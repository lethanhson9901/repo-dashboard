Yes it's great. But it also consistently (although not very often) makes horrible decisions and writes dumbest code possible, which means it's absolutely incapable of working on its own without meticoulus guidance, unless you want your project to be unusable mess. I love this tool because it speeds up development a lot but there are rarely days without making a facepalm when I see its mistakes.\n\n8 yoe",

I spent a long time in consulting across probably 50 or more places, many Fortune 500's (sloppy companies tend to pay consultants more, for obvious reasons) and some more time in FAANG type stuff so I have a wider point of view than most... \n\nWith that said, I think there are two places where something like Claude seem like absolutely clear wins:\n\n1. Really shitty places: If the opex, code coverage and dev quality are all \"lowest offshore bidder\" quality, Claude will legitimately be better than regular devs, and a few smart people can seem like gods. If the system was already broken and unstable the downsides of the churn to get to green is also lower. \n\n2. Really good places, for a little while: If you have a solid system w/ good docs and great unit tests and wonderful CI/CD etc, you can trust Claude to act like a meth-addicted intern refactoring and cleaning up tech debt and hammering out a dozen of those \"we'll get to it some day\" stuff. I'm at a level where I'm in meetings and Slack DM's all day and don't get to write a lot of code, and Claude has let me clean up so much junk that was bugging me but that I couldn't justify prioritizing for myself or any more junior folks.\n\nOTOH the middle is scary. A half decent place is just the trap where even great LLM's can do a lot of damage, b/c there is enough good stuff to damage but not enough safety nets to protect things. In the great places, I  suspect we'll hit a price in 5 years as all the juniors were either laid-off/not-hired/or utterly crippled by brain rot.\n\nIn theory, it's a great ecosystem for a curious, ambitious senior engineer to make more impact than ever. In practice this shit is mostly over-hyped and dangerous.",

For example, the Agile Manifesto rejects processes as a way to accelerate developers. And one of the signers started the insanity of scrum certifications and whatnot. DevOps is orthogonally related; a way for devs to manage their own ops to avoid the process of going through ops. Now DevOps is its own distinct thing in many orgs with a lot of processes.\n\nWe have a history of getting bogged down in processes, creating/using something to relieve us of the weight, then readding processes. Processes aren’t bad; too few is bad and too many is bad and what is enough varies by team and product and company.\n\nWrt GenAI, I think we’ll probably find more processes to slow down how fast we can go with it too.

With that being said, that refactor fundamentally changed my opinion on where agentic coding is heading. I have designed the architecture of the project to be AI first, and I think that’s a big contributing factor.\n\nI think a lot of people overestimate how “quality” their code really needs to be. For most use cases, good enough is fine. If you’re supporting an application that’s 4 nines, sure that’s different. I’d reckon most people here aren’t doing that though.",

Assume you speed that up using AI, you would need to allocate more time to planning, because AI is not a mind reader and unless you are explicit it will just make up an asnwer.

IT will make deliver 1/6 faster, not 10x. But I am not a millionaire tech bro schilling anything, I am just a knuckle dragging software engineer.

Needed to know if it was actually using one of the methods that’s changing, or if it was dead code. \n\nAdded the backend repo and frontend repo to the same cursor project. Wrote one paragraph of instruction with context I was aware of. Let claude do its thing while I went and worked on other stuff for 15 min. \n\nCame back and it had grepped the method name then followed the chain all the way up to the endpoint that eventually called it, then tied that back to the frontend code. I manually checked the work and it was perfect. \n\nIt saved me 30 min to an hour and really reduced the cognitive load of the whole thing. To me that is incredibly useful, because I do that kind of work (undocumented code spelunking) constantly.

          "text": "I don't get those people. AI coding tools produce output that’s only as good as the codebase they have context over and as good as the team using them. I worked on two projects:\n\nOne had a very clean and simple codebase: a good amount of abstractions, dependency injection, solid type definitions for all layers of data, good unit test coverage, documentation, etc. The state of the repo made you feel like you were putting together Lego blocks. The LLMs I used at that time did a good job because they could figure out the proper pieces of functionality to use. In this case, yeah, LLMs can speed up a mature and skilled developer quite a lot—but not to the point of replacing them, because they aren’t able to foresee future bottlenecks like a human can.\n\nThe other project? Oh boy… 20-year-old code with TONS of baked-in logic at the database level, hardcoded values all over the place, no abstractions, no unit tests, SQL queries with 600+ lines of code (repeated all over the codebase with maybe 1 or 2 changes), no reusable code, nothing… The code? It was Jenga code. Spaghetti code is an understatement. The state of the project and team was so bad that we were doing one release and 2–3 hotfixes just to keep the app running.\n\nAnyhow, LLMs were introduced by management to “increase productivity” and all that crap. The result? Even worse code, more bugs, less attention paid by developers due to the commodity effect, more hotfixes, and no standardization on anything new introduced.   \n  \nBasically, the LLMs were making sense of the current codebase and producing equally bad solutions. On a 20+ person team, where maybe 16 of them simply don’t care anymore, the amount of bad code, issues, and debt we pushed in a month was astonishing. I pray not to reach the one-year milestone on that project under those conditions. We reached a state where in theory we push lot's of items but the rate of bounces is at least 75%. QA people can't keep up with this amount of change. Found solution? You guessed it: they hired a QA agency where they leverage AI to write tests based on our AI written Jira items and the codebase changes. The result? Many of our items are simply tested in production by clients.\n\nIn an effort to solve this newly created problem, the C-level executives said: “Let’s add AI code review.” Guess what? Devs are silencing over 20+ comments on a single MR because it keeps pointing out already-present bad patterns and bugs.\n\nSo the moral of my experience is: these tools can’t replace developers on real-life projects. It’s simply impossible without hitting a point where you can’t move forward due to the state of the codebase. Looking at the product milestones, I’m like: yeah, we aren’t able to deliver that, because every new feature introduced creates 3–4–5 other problems on its own that pile up.\n\nWith any new AI tool that was added in my team, the problems increased, quality went even lower, it's harder and harder to write code buuuuut, the numbers look great: +120% more bugs solved (because we created 2x the amount of bugs vs the pre AI era), +200% more features shipped (but 90% of them are not working as expected or they have lot's of problems) and so on....",

Eventually it get to something decent, but in that amount of time I believe I could have done it better myself.\n\nBottom-line: If you're a dogshit coder, Agents may seem like an amazing leap forward, but if you're technical enough and work in statically typed languages where simple copy/pasting isn't good enough the Agents are a small drag on productivity/a small gain depending on the specific task. Unless you are doing a very boilerplate/braindead thing then yes the agents are great at that -- things like Makefiles, Github Actions, etc stuff a junior dev would take a day to do.\n\nIf you look at the thought loop an Agent has as it implements your ask it looks like a 12 year old thinking loop. Agents are built on top of the LLMs directly, and since those have no clue what they are really doing, it's the blind leading the blind. The tech-industrial complex and VC-funded gaslighters will keep posting everywhere that LLMs are a gamechanger and the future, but it's just a cover to push overshoring and layoffs. Plus they are invested in literally 900 AI startups so it's part of their portfolio strategy. The sad part is the entire US equities market is being propped up by these AI narratives and when the music stops it will be harmful for everyone. \n\nNot to mention the only reason companies like OpenAI are still running is because they got 100s of billions of dollars from Dubai and the UAE. It's a national security priority at this point. The last thing anyone cares about is if it actually works for the average dev.",

TBH, I nearly didn't bother, but maybe this is worth the effort. Maybe you'll listen. We'll see.\n\nFirstly, understand this...Stability in work is an illusion. It simply does not exist. It never did. Employers are not your friends or your family. They want you to think they are, but if you become a negative figure on the balance book well...Bye!\n\nEmployers are ALWAYS looking for a way to cut costs and, well, AI is being presented as the latest in a long line of silver bullets because, on the face of it, it appears to offer a credible way to really replace people.\n\nThis has happened before. Not on the scale they are presenting with AI, but it has several times. And I'll tell you about one.\n\nWay back in the 1980s a revolution came to pass. It was called Desktop Publishing and Apple paved the way. The majority of people thought of it as just a nice easy way to print their business documents cheaper than having to send them out to be printed or get designers and printers to prepare the docs so they looked good.\n\nYup, that's really how things were done. And there was an entire industry and several professions that vanished over the space of a few years. Poof! Gone. The most complete was that of a Typesetter. This was a highly skilled profession that existed for centuries. And in the space of 5 years, it no longer existed.\n\nI know about this because I was one of those who helped destroy that profession and was at the heart of a lot of what went on at places like News International and others.\n\nAnd you know who survived? Those who learned how to leverage the new technology and gain some advantage and build a better lifeboat.\n\nSo you ask me how you learn to adapt? Fuck, I dunno. It's your job on the line and your industry that's trying to destroy your life. If you can't figure out how to make your presence useful, how the hell do you expect someone who has no idea of your corporate culture to advise you?\n\nI will say this, however. If you can figure out how to automate yourself out of existence and package that up as a product, then you may well be able to squeeze some juice out of that.\n\nBut I actually think a lot of this is nonsense. This tech is more than a little flaky and, as they say, there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip. Nothing is certain and there are never, ever, ever any guarantees when predicting the future.\n\nIf I were you, I would be building the tools and knowledge to ride the wave and not get drowned by it. Knowledge is the only thing you can completely own and take with you. Everything else is transient.\n\nGood luck.",

I sometimes asks it to execute smaller tasks, but in general it's much faster to do it myself than to wait for Copilot to do its thing. Even if it does it, I am still spending some time reviewing it to be sure it didn't do anything moronic (it really likes to call ToArray() on a byte stream that represents a file that can be tens of GB).\n\nIt's pretty good at SQL, especially if I don't remember the syntax for PARTITION OVER, but at the same time it means I will never learn that syntax, which sucks. Still, I almost always have to change the SQL later, because we have millions of rows in the database, and the first version with 12 joins (4 of which are on the same table) just takes too long. \n\nIt is a useful tool, very useful, but I don't feel threatened by it at all, at least for now. If I was a React dev, I would start learning C#/Java/Go though.\n\nI am also in the camp where actually typing out the code is the fun part of the job (especially with vim mode!), and then hitting save and seeing the autoformatter put everything in the correct spot.

If technology evolves, it's important to be honest about what it is and isn't capable of and what your strengths are.\n\nLet's take a different kind of street vendor for example. Let's say someone is selling prints of AI generated art. They might feel that they're a skilled prompt engineer. They are of course not a truly skilled artist by any reasonable measure.\n\nUnfortunately, for the masses, a lot of people lack taste or the ability to discern between real art and AI generated slop.\n\nEven more unfortunately, this leads to the community of skilled people spending all of their time bitching about fake artists instead of focusing on their own talents. Im just starting to find it a bit exhausting how many of these posts there are that take a post made from the perspective of someone who is now able to achieve more than they could before because of AI, and effectively bellitle them because they are not truly skilled. It doesn't matter. Just leave them be and have more interesting discussion.",

If you dont have the experience to know the frameworks, libraries, templates, best practices, inputs, outputs, types, test scenarios, patterns etc, to tell it to be aware of its not going to and its just going to break.\n\nThe reason most code AI's make is bad is because its unconstrained by contextualization limits you see in code of  hardened applications. The better you get at communicating those limits, the longer the AI goes without mistakes.\n\nIts like training a junior sadly.",

Here's the first example I found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i\\_built\\_embex\\_a\\_universal\\_vector\\_database\\_orm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/)\n\nHere's the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust](https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust) Open the repo, look at the code, and especially take a look at the commit history to see how the developer wrote it. Take a look at several other projects like that and you'll get your answer.\n\nPersonally I've become incredibly productive using agents. I used Aider first, and now Codex-CLI. I've done some internal projects for my last employer which I wouldn't have been able to do in the normal way. I'm currently unemployed and I'm working on this: [https://github.com/tzanko-matev/cogni](https://github.com/tzanko-matev/cogni) \\- a framework for evaluating a codebase based on the effort that it takes an agent to answer a question about it. So far I've written 0 manual lines of code. You can see my commit history for a better idea how I work, and especially you can take a look at the very messy /spec folder where I keep the documents which drive the agent.\n\nThe general rules for working successfully with agents in my opinion are:\n\n1. When you want to do something first make the agent write a plan. Once the plan is done and to your satisfaction make the agent start implementing the plan  \n  \n2. Make the agent commit frequently. Tell them that before each commit code must build successfully, relevant tests must be written and must pass. This will significantly improve the output of the agent  \n  \n3. You need to set up your development environment and your test suite so that the agent can use them easily. You need to have full test coverage. This might mean things like Playwright tests, e2e tests involving one or more VMs and so on. Agents can create much more sophisticated test harnesses than what human developers would do in the past. \n\nFor example I worked on developing a BPF Linux kernel program. My agent was testing it by starting a VM, running the code, and examining the output. I had a single command \\`just vm-test\\` which would do all of this so that the agent could start it easily. The agent could also SSH into the vm and run commands inside in order to see what's going on when the program wasn't working correctly.  \n  \n4. Refactor often. In order for the agent to work efficiently the code must be maintainable. From time to time I ask the agent to do a full code review and see if the code matches the coding guidelines that I have set. Most important guidelines are to follow Single Responsibility Principle and to have short files. I would ask the the agent to develop a refactoring plan and then to implement it.\n\nI believe that following those rules I can handle codebases with hundreds of thousands of lines of text (code, tests, docs). I don't have experience for larger codebases.",

Utility varies by application and code base; I find it struggles with research type tasks, but most of the work I do isn't like that. \n\nI ended up picking up a side job (couple hours per week) doing something more interesting than my day job because I had so much more free time and because I can use Claude code there as well. \n\nMost of my dev friends have gone all in on it. One guy set up a jira board, GitHub, databricks, and notion with connectors to Claude code, and a bunch of other stuff, and he's been developing at a frenetic pace. Another couple of them have spun up a side business and do most of their development with CC; these are expert engineers btw, just so much faster than they were before. \n\nI see posts like this and I wonder if we're using the tools in the same way. It's fun and also a little depressing how good these tools are. Sure they struggle occasionally but they are also extremely powerful. And they get a lot better the more creative you are and the more context you can provide via connectors, and the more guardrails you build. \n\nP.S. as good as it is, the company leadership at my current day job is still fumbling the bag, as they seem to have ambitious goals that somehow don't align with how to build useful patterns. So it's gonna be a waste of time and money even when people at their own company are secretly finding amazing and useful workflows. It's a bizarre situation and a frustrating one.

I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year  ... Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.\n\nThis rhetoric about \"adapt or be left behind\" is something I've heard a million times over the last few years. For the longest time I've wrote these people off as being hype beasts, or shitty engineers. However, I'm starting to accept the possibility that the vibe coders are right.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I still believe that the majority of vibe coders are shit engineers. Code quality is on a downward trajectory, and I think we're looking towards a future where few people have the technical prowess to \"level-up\" to senior+. But I'm starting to think that the powers that be have invested so much time and money at this point that mass adoption of vibe coding in the software industry is inevitable.\n\nBut what's changed for me is that I'm beginning to accept that if software development continues to adopt AI, that I'm just going to have to find another career field. And that sucks, because I love programming. But I'd rather move to a different career field than become a glorified product manager. I know for some that \"it was never about the code,\" *but it's the only fucking thing I liked about this industry*.\n\nSo in the meantime I'll continue on as normal until management either forces me to become a vibe coder, or I get laid off for \"not performing.\"\n\nI don't know, getting that of my chest kinda feels good. I wonder if anyone else here is preparing for a similar exit in the short term future?\n\nPS: This post isn't to say that I don't use AI tools, or that I find them useless. I use Claude/ChatGPT every day for searching the internet, to answer small questions about libraries, double checking that I'm thinking about a problem correctly, etc.. I basically treat AI as a rubber duck. But it doesn't write the code for me, because that's the part I enjoy doing.",

Great way to get a quick summary of an existing codebase, maybe good for very simple and repeatable tasks like adding type annotations to python modules. Great for data entry and other tasks that are simple for humans but hard to automate.\n\nBut code generation? It just doesn't remotely make any sense with current generation LLM capabilities.

I needed a Bazel rule to take a `rules_oci` output and turn it into a CPIO archive, so I've got a Go program to iterate over the files in the rootfs of a particular reference in an OCI layout directory and write them into a `newcx` CPIO archive. Writing the code was an obstacle I needed to overcome to keep tinkering with the architecture.\n\nGemini one-shotted \"Write a Go module matching the interface of `archive/tar.Reader` for iterating over the files in the flattened rootfs of a particular ref in an OCI layout directory,\" \"Write a Go module with an interface similar to `archive/tar.Writer` for writing CPIO archives in the `newcx` format used by the Linux Kernel to support extended file attributes on top of `newc`,\" and \"Write a Go program that takes a path as input, opens it with [OCI package path], which works like `archive/tar.Reader`, and writes an archive to stdout using [CPIO package path], which works like `archive/tar.Writer` but has the following header structure instead of `archive/tar.Header`.\" I was happy to outsource and have a working OS that night instead of hand-writing some relatively uninteresting code that is neither performance nor security sensitive and walks well-trodden ground in terms of API design.\n\nOn the other hand, I also enjoy high-performance computing. My friends and I will sometimes take an algorithm problem and pick a baseline machine to run it on and see who can get the computation done the fastest. I love drilling down into assembly-level optimization to get the fastest time. That kind of programming is enjoyable to me and I would hate to outsource it to AI even if I thought AI could do it well. Same goes for API design. There's a satisfaction for me in factoring a problem well in a way that leads to an intuitive API that lends itself well to performance optimization and the names of things start all falling into place.

Another group being fear mongered in to thinking they have no skills, can build no skills and have no future in software development because AI makes them obsolete.\n\nFor me llm’s are just another tool in the toolbox. Good for scaffolding and simple tasks. In large code bases they derail more often then not. They aren’t magic and sure as hell don’t make me 10x the developer I am right now.\n\nIf anything we’ll need more competent developers in the future then we have now. But that doesn’t fit well with the CEO’s that just heavily invested in a tool that doesn’t life up to the hype.",

Every time I join a new company they tell me how they do TDD or \"write tests\" and all they know is the test triangle and how use a basic test runner.\n\nThey don't know anything about factories, behavioral testing, shared behaviors, fuzzing, fault injection, mutation testing, etc. They don't know how to value tests. They don't know how to write valuable tests. They don't know how to maintain testing suites over time.\n\nThey barely know how to do E2E and often it turns into a ball of yarn. They often have no idea how to do maintainable visual difference testing.\n\nAnd the things they know put them in a corner, the testing triangle is dog shit and useless once you start actually getting into writing maintainable test suites for complex projects. Mocking, fixtures, and object mothering start working against you (they don't even know they're doing the last one). But these people persist because someone showed them the testing triangle and told them that unit tests are the best, integration tests are too hard to be worthwhile, and because of that they never learned to write spec helpers.\n\nAgile is the same way, Big data is the same way, webscale is the same way, microservices are the same way. Almost every industry trend is just managerial and product hype. I think in the late 2010's everyone just sorta gave up on \"engineering hype\" because the management class started getting feedback around how these things work in practice that they didn't care to hear.\n\nI had a company who was claiming their software was \"AI\" back in 2018. There was no \"AI\" there. I wrote most of the stuff they labeled \"AI\".",

          "text": "What exactly is there to be \"left behind\" in regards to?\n\nAI tools are the most intuitive tools humans have ever created. It's natural language. Do you speak English? Great, you can use AI tools effectively. The hard part of coding with an AI assistant is knowing how to code yourself. I might even argue that the people who aren't coding themselves any more are the ones being left behind in the AI era, not the ones having AI pump out as much code for them as possible.\n\nSure, there are some specific ways people work with these tools that might be of marginal utility to learn the details of, but there's pretty much nothing to learn that a competent engineer can't pick up in a week, if even that, and generally these \"techniques\" end up just becoming adopted natively by the tools themselves anyway.\n\nI mean, just go on Medium and scroll through the AI category. Every article promising some revolutionary new AI coding technique is just rehashing some minor AI-specific variation on what is already an industry-standard best practice like making a design document or breaking things up into smaller pieces.\n\nFor a good engineer, just knowing the basics of how LLMs handle context and what might result from clearing context or not having something in context that should be, should basically be all you need to know to get started. The difference between an absolute AI coding assistant wizard and a good engineer touching the tools for the first time really isn't that big. If the difference *is* big, it's just because one person isn't taking the time to actually understand in depth what's being created for them.\n\nThere's some interesting depth to be found in actually building a system that uses LLMs to probabilistically solve a problem that couldn't be solved before LLMs because it was too big a search space or too unstructured to be effectively solved with purely deterministic logic, but I'm gathering that's not what you're referring to. It seems like you're worried about yourself as a coder not using AI assistants heavily, and that I honestly think isn't something you should be worried about. At least, not in a, \"OMG I'm not learning valuable skills\" sense. I would keep my ear to the ground in regards to your employer forcing adoption of these tools in a shallow way, but otherwise I think it's never a bad move to keep your personal coding skills sharp. Those skills are the only difference between a vibe coder and an engineer with an assistant after all.",

We had strong enough group standards even then to ask whether the term “engineer” could be used for the broad collection of software dev experience levels.

I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.\n\nThis is not software engineering, nor is it using AI to make you more productive when working on production code.\n\nUsing AI for production code, while reviewing what the agent produces, and testing it is not vibe coding.\n\nAs far as being a good software engineer that uses AI, the critical skills are knowing when / when not to use AI, what to use it for, and how to scrutinize its output in a way that makes you more productive without introducing tech debt.",

Because you have to understand when things go wrong. And the best way to understand the code is to write it yourself. Even if it takes a longer time. Because after all there is no such thing as a free lunch - understanding something takes time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, AI definitely has its uses.

It would be a violation of my contract to submit any code that I didn't write and don't have a licence to use. I cannot be certain where LLM-created code came from.\n\nHell, some of it might be *my* old code, used to create a derivative work (the LLM model itself) contrary to the terms of its licence. If there's a grumpy old programmer class action lawsuit happening, please let me know and count me in.\n\nMany of us old farts learned to program, in part, by copying code listings from books and magazines. Yes, magazines full of source code used to exist!\n\nI don't advocate a return to this, but to this day, I don't copy and paste from Stack Exchange or places like that. I *always* type it in.\n\nThis forces me not to skim any part of the example, so I can understand and critically evaluate it all. Sometimes, example code leaves out things that are important in production code, like checking return values. Sometimes, there's an easy-to-miss detail that is actually very important in understanding how it works. You only catch this by forcing every single token through your brain.\n\nAI advocates are doing a lot of predicting of the future, so let me do one. I'm not going to put a time line on this, because I'm not a very good prognosticator, but here's something that a lot of us have seen coming for a while.\n\n\"Engineer\" is a legally protected word in all engineering fields *except* software engineering. If you build things that could hurt people if they fail, you carry certain responsibilities both to yourself and to society. The speed at which you construct things is a very small part of that.\n\nAs software takes over more of the world, there *is* a major disaster coming. There will be an event or series of events where many people die or are permanently injured by a software failure.\n\nI don't know in what form it will be. I also don't know when, but I fear that \"vibe coding\" is accelerating us towards it faster than it otherwise would have happened.\n\nIn a sense, it's already happening, only with data breaches rather than physical damage. We should certainly expect security exploits to increase in frequency as AI assistance increases. But that isn't quite enough to trigger what I'm pretty sure is going to happen.\n\nPart of the fallout from this inevitable disaster is that governments will insist that the software business *must* be regulated. Maybe not in the US, where the lobby is strong, but Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc will do it.\n\nAnd when that happens, you had better know how to take responsibility for your software if you want to keep doing what you love, and not offload that responsibility to LLMs.",

People wrote their own tools for this workflow, claimed they are in front of everyone and you need to catch up - all of this is useless right now. The same goes with \"manual planning\", i.e. asking the model first to write a plan, and then next prompt to implement it - AI coding tools are doing this automatically right now.\n\nOn the other hand, if you believe models have plateaued and/or the bubble will pop and advancement will stop because the model is not sustainable financially - you can just wait for the \"workflow approach\" to stabilize and for tools to mature.

I think if the tool is getting better every month then what is the point staying on top of every new AI tool and technique out there. If you know the car will be cheaper and better every month, you would not buy a new one today and wait.\n\nThe AI vendor is trying to play double narrative of: It will become easier and easier to use AI to code to the point that we don't need engineer + If you are engineer, you need to learn and be expert in AI coding today. Honestly, I think the vendor have all incentive to make AI tool will become easier and easier to use.  So I don't think we need to always stay on top of everything.\n\nWill it be very easy to the point we don't need engineer? I don't think that is possible. But if that is the case, there is no point for us to become come good at \"AI Coding\" anyway. We should be all learn farming.\n\nDon't act out of fear.\n\nSecond, there is an assumption that writing and reading in English is more productive than code. Just few days ago, I worked in a PR where there are 200 lines of AI-generated plan with 10 code changes. I just simply, don't read the plan because reading code is easier.\n\nBefore this AI rush happening, when I went to fix the system there are a lot of times I find that reading the code itself is much better than reading the documentation. I used to try to understand how smart contract work and I find reading the code is much better than reading their white paper. I think the narrative of English is more productive make sense for managers, I don't think it always apply to engineer.\n\nLLM helps me in producing code. It can produce a lot of code really quick. I used it a lot when building new stuff. But I also can imagine myself finish tinkering code directly to make a small precise change that fix the production, while everyone is tinkering with a spec to have LLM make a correct change.\n\nThird, I don't find using AI destroy joy of programming. I don't think using AI turn you into product manager.  You still need a lot of engineering skill.\n\nFourth, the conversation has been too much around \"losing our jobs\". With that noise in the background, no grounded conversation around AI coding. When I speak and evaluate AI, I always say to myself, if I gonna lose my job, so be it.

Within a day, the agent managed to get pretty far in refactoring the code.\n\nThen I asked it to clean up the typing errors in the new code (they existed in the old codebase) and...it just started falling apart from there. It turned out that while it understood what I wanted to do and structured the new code accordingly, it more or less lifted the code completely as-is, type errors and all. It moved code to new modules where they made more sense (yay!), but then left the now broken imports alone in other modules (boo). It would fix type errors by...deleting the type hints.

          "text": "TLDR: Focusing on the outcome more than the tools is the only way to keep enjoiying this field in the next decade.\n\nCode is, and has always been, a tool to solve problems. Every job has a problem to solve. For most of us, it just so happened that the part we enjoyed, solving problems with code, was also what helped the businesses we worked for the most.\n\nTomorrow, if Dev + AI > Dev, we will have to adapt. Because at the end of the day, in a capitalist world, the only thing that matters is solving problems for people in the best way possible in exchange for money\n\nSo there are roughly two kinds of engineers from my pov\n\nThe first one likes to code, build fast, optimized, well architected, mantainable, and scalable systems. Their code is their art form, and they like their work because it allows them to practice that art all day long.\n\nThe second one is more focused on getting their work done and moving on to the next thing. They have always seen code as a tool to achieve a goal: moving the Jira ticket forward and getting paid at the end of the month. They may or may not enjoy coding as much as the first type, but at the end of the day, they are in it to move forward in their life, their job, their pay, or the business they work for.\n\nFrom the outside, those two people may look exactly the same: developers. But in reality, they are not playing the same game. Their intrinsic motivations are different.\nThese are, of course, caricatures. In reality, there is a spectrum between those two archetypes, and we are probably a bit of both.\n\nI used to lean more toward the first type and genuinely fell in love with this field because of the problem-solving it requires. The complexity of the systems we work with has always been a brain feeder and a real source of joy for me. But since the only thing I can really do is adapt to the industry shift, I want to learn to enjoy getting shit done more than enjoying the act of doing shit.\n\nNot because one is better than the other, but because that’s where the leverage is moving. I still care about quality and craft, but I no longer want them to be the point. The point is progress, impact, and momentum.\n\nThat’s the emotional shift I’m making: from loving the solution to loving the outcome. And I believe that moving forward this will help me keep enjoing this field.\n\nSide note: I also learned, as a failing entrepreneur, that building a company scratches the same mental itch as solving AdventOfCode problems. It is an optimization problem. (Less deterministic and requires a divers range of skillset)\n\nYou are searching for the right product, the right customer, the right distribution channel, the right pricing, the right partners, and the right growth loop. \nEvery decision affects the rest of the system. \nEvery mistake propagates. \nEvery win compounds.\n\nEvery part of a business is a stack in itself.\nThere is an engine to optimize: yourself.\nThere is a moving target: the market.\nThere are bugs: your blind spots, your execution failures, your wrong assumptions.\nThere is technical debt: bad habits, rushed decisions, misaligned incentives.\nThere are refactors: pivots, rebrands, restructurings.\nAnd just like with code, the same archetypes exist: system optimizers and needle movers.",

Writing new code was maybe 20% of my time on a good week. So the “AI is changing everything” thing feels less like a new era and more like the same thing getting turned up to 11.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 is a better dev than most juniors I’ve worked with in the ways that matter day to day. It follows instructions, it has absurd breadth of knowledge (not depth, obviously), and it operates at a superhuman speed. I still love coding, but I think the realistic path is: keep coding anyway, both for the parts where LLMs reliably fail and for the parts where you need real taste and judgment, plus production hardening, tests, integration, debugging, and cleanup. And yeah, you should keep your hands on the keyboard regularly, because as DHH put it: when you “vibe code” too much, you can feel the competence leaking out.\n\nEmotionally, this is probably close to what the Luddites felt in the early 19th century. History wasn’t kind to them. You can hate the direction, but it’s hard to see it reversing when so much money and momentum is behind it. This is the worst it's ever going to be, and we are just starting out.\n\nWhere I fully agree with you is the “how do people level up to senior+” problem. If juniors grow up prompt-first, they won’t build the mental model you need to debug, design, and make good tradeoffs under pressure. If I were hiring for my small startup right now, I wouldn’t bet on a bunch of juniors. I’d hire an experienced senior who can lead and supervise a “team” of coding agents and ship. Juniors are kind of cooked unless they deliberately swim upstream and learn the fundamentals the hard way. Vast majority of them won't do this. Sad, but true.",

I thought.. well I am not going to become some ML/AI engineer.. but I will figure out how to use AI tools to help me get more done faster and try to learn how to prompt it so it puts out amazing code, etc at the same time.

And AI has to operate off of systems, libraries, and technology developed by us.  If those contain flaws and we correct something in say a library, the AI was perfectly able to replicate some answer upon the older version, but some of that answer was a workaround for a bug that no longer exists, how long would it take to clean that up?\n\nWe like to tout AI as a replacement for people yet until we master ourselves and find some way to overcome our own weaknesses, I'm not sure how it can ever do that.  The only thing it can do is probably help us on that journey by forcing us to see ourselves in ways that maybe we aren't comfortable with.",

It’s not a perfect transpiler, but it seems to be improving rapidly.\n\nIt’s totally fine to not use or want to use new technologies in your job. There are still jobs available in 2026 for people who prefer to write in assembly instead of relying on a compiler to compile their C code. Similarly, I’d expect there to still be jobs available in 2036 for people who prefer to write their Typescript code by hand on a text editor rather than relying on an AI assistant.\n\nHere’s my perspective — I still enjoy reading assembly when I’m doing reverse engineering, and some times writing them by hand when it’s necessary… But I also love programming enough that I want to learn the new tools and languages available rather than be closed off in my walled assembly garden. I learned what I consider “old school high-level” languages when I first started: Common Lisp, C, Python, C++, Java. As the years went by, I also learned Typescript, Kotlin, Go, Zig, Rust, Haskell, Scala, and even more experimental stuff like Agda, Roc and Hylo just to stay abreast of the state of the art. Generative AI is the latest innovation in the programming language world, and it seems like the productivity gains from writing code in the highest-level language we have available (human language) is significant enough that it’s here to stay. IMO, I’m learning about and using generative AI _because_ I love programming; not in spite of it.",

And it's vitally important for the industry that it is in the right hands.\n\n\nRight now execs are buying the hype like it or not. Everyone is going in the AI direction. If you don't get on board you will be left behind. I'm an engineering manager and I've been heavily involved in AI for the past 3 years or so. Having AI skills is now a hard requirement in job ads in my company. If every company does the same then you're locked out of the industry. \n\n\nI've been a fan of AI from the start tbh (I wasn't a manager then). But I've always been frustrated with this industry in that 20% of the people do 80% of the work. I thought that maybe AI would bridge the gap and bring those low performers closer to the high performers.\n\n\nBut that has turned out totally wrong in my company at least. The high performers are now light years away from the rest. The best devs are seeing incredible gains from the tools. While the poor devs are doing worse. They are firing out PRs they don't understand, that take a long time to review and correct.\n\n\nAI is here to stay. So we need the good devs to get on board and shape the future. We can't have the poor devs or the product people getting carried away with their POCs. \n\n\nI understand the view of \"but coding is what I like doing\". I thought the same. But when you get good with these tools, you might come to realize like I have that it isn't the physical act of writing code that I enjoyed so much. It was solving problems that I really got enjoyment from. With the boost in productivity I can solve MORE problems now. I have never been so satisfied. \n\n\nBut the important part is getting this productivity boost without losing standards. But these are problems we've already solved as an industry. There has always been bad developers pushing poor code. But we have PRs, pipelines, linters, automated tests etc that are in place to enforce standards. Preventing slop should already be a solved problem. \n\n\nTLDR; the more good devs we have shaping the future, the better.",

It was hilariously fun zooming around. \n\nOne of the guys there was like 35 years old and was completely out of fucks. He’d been there like fifteen years and one day I asked him why he doesn’t seem to care. What he said really stuck with me:\n\n“All this is really new to you so it is interesting. I’ve done it all. It’s all boring now. I don’t care.”\n\nI’ve really thought about him a lot during this new Claude Code world. Why? Because after more than 30 years of programming I’ve done it all. I’m right where he was.\n\nSure frameworks have changed and languages have evolved but at the end of the day it’s all the same.\n\nHowever…\n\nThese AI code tools have generated a new life into me and a bunch of other older timers I talk to. Nearly all of have said in some form or fashion, “I haven’t had fun programming like this in years.”\n\nSo I’m not worried about the old style of development being left behind. The kids adapt to this new world, because they will. They always do. \n\nI’m not far from calling it a career and I’m super interested in what they can cook up with these tools.

It's not pointless bitching by the way but it's often poorly written, one sided, and the answer is often \"talk to the person you're bitching about/talk to your manager/stop worrying about it\". The mods likely check the reports and agree.\n\nIf it's the latter, my brilliant theory is that there are some curmudgeonly folks in our industry and some of them are in this subreddit and forget that working with people is part of most jobs in the industry. They get annoyed at \"people are whining\" and report the post as venting to the mods.

Unemployed for 3 months. Old coworker has a job opening but hed be my manager. Cool, ive worked with him on some projects. Its a long ass commute and im getting paid the lowest I have in the last 8 years. But they say it's super chill and an easy gig.  \n     \nI start my first week and im told the current lead is leavung in 1 week. I am now to take over and entire application where they, somehow, got the idea they could make a simultaneous  multi 4k video stream player that uses raw h264 being piped over websockets, decoded, and manually painted to canvas at 120fps per feed (its a multi camera monitoring system). \n  \nIts written in angular many, many versions behind. Uses web workers. It has to work in an air gapped system with no cloud or internet support. The front end client has to do all the work because the backend servers they sold are basically $99 used dells from 2008. They had a system working using ffmpeg but the transcending was \"melting their recording servers\". The e tire state manage is a giant ball of spaghetti code thats impossible to debug.  \n    \nThey then say I have to get it actually working for a big client that's already pissed that they haven't gotten things they already promised. All during the holidays. And all the other devs are working on other things.  \n    \nNo real requirements, no project management, no QA, just a big ole \"make it work at least better. Old  coworker now new boss is more interested in having meetings and being \"fun manager\". I had to melt Claude and make my own epic and stories with all the implementation guides. They ask me in the beginning if I can get it to work. I said I can get it to work better but cant grantee anything. Which they constantly forget and the product guy is promising the client a release they can \"play with\". \n    \nLike I said, zero qa. No ci/cd. Oh, and surprise \"we need a release on a dev server\" randomly no matter the state of my feature branch. Im having to learn the product while simultaneously trying to fix it. I've got juniors who only know how to optimize rxjs to the nth degree but dont understand the state \"management\" of the application doing nitpicking comments on the PRs.  \n     \nSo yeah, two months slinging code on the tickets I have to create. Creating my own documentation of an existing product. The day comes and I get the FPS drops down from 98% to 75%, there is no more perpetual loading. But they create an entirely new environment with all new cameras and throw it up on it the day before and freak out. Nothing is working with all these fucking cameras i didnt even know existed. They are complaining about things lile \"auto pause\" that i havent even heard of. They say its not 100% working. I told them there was zero chance that it could be. Now the old chum boss wants to have a talk because he just got his ass handed to him and wants to know what the disconnect is with my definition of \"working\". I never said it would be \"working\" I said it will be working better because the entire architecture is a nightmare that I have zero idea how anybody could say it was a good idea.   \n    \nBut great. Already had to use mortgage assistance after the layoff because a ton of family bills rolled in. So now im probably getting shit canned and just need to sell my home.  \n     \nMaybe im have just become a shitty dev. Bit it really feels like im hooking up with one BPD job after another. Im cooked.  \n    \nWhat do you all think? Am I crazy? Just shit at my job now?",

It allows every dumb fuck to just spit out code, or some kind of app, and it makes people think our job is easy. It also enables people who would be too dumb to do these kind of jobs at all, to at least have a shot at it, which also devalues the field. And I'm not saying you're dumb at all, but e.g. even you probably wouldn't have been able to jump in and make progress on this random obscure tech without \"melting Claude\" as you put it. Other people do that too, just on a much lower level scale where they go from not being able to do any software engineering work themselves to actually doing work.

I’ve been in the industry nearly 30 years, and have lots of friends in the industry, and man – the stories I could tell!\n\nI’ve also walked in to a lot of jobs like this, especially when working freelance. I’ve found what works for me is brutal, but polite, honesty. Staying frosty while letting management know just how much of a shit-show something is by way of asking clarifying questions and setting expectations early and often. When I walk onto a job like that I question **every** decision looking to simplify everything as quickly as possible, but I’m also mindful of project delivery: they can’t pay me if they’re not getting paid themselves. An impressive demo showing a little (often faked) progress can help get some extra time to get things working properly. Remember: they’re not out to get you, they’re out to get money from the client. You’re actually part of the team, and the team’s goal is sales. You’re not there to build nice software, you’re there to provide value, both to your employer and to their clients. If you can reframe around that, things actually get a bit easier for you; you can balance “building nice things” with “keeping my job” and hopefully have less stress. You’re already breaking stuff into tickets, now group them into milestones with the MVP features done ASAP and get sign off from the client. That clarity may help them chill out.\n\nGood luck!",

The only way to come out of this as positive is to setup a meeting with your boss to discuss setting up a roadmap for the next 3 months at least, preferably 6+ months. You need concrete and reasonable requirements. Work through the main issues about performance and architecture, and highlight the huge risks of the project promised as-is. The more risk and bleeding-edge techniques applied, the more unpredictable the deadline is. \n\nSetup SLOs and SLAs for the service. Clarify what is and isn’t included. Setup another meeting with stakeholders and get them to agree on these, working through the issues over one or more sessions until both sides are in agreement. No commitments of any kind until this is done. \n\nDon’t commit to any deadlines unless you’re being threatened with termination. You _need_ time to understand the system. They will not be happy, but you should not care about their happiness. You were hired to be an engineer, and a large part of that is preparation and planning. Remind them of that, and specifically that this project will never get back on track without that.\n\nThere is no quick fix to a situation like this, and they need to reset expectations with stakeholders. If there’s a contract/money tied to this, it’s a lost cause already, but don’t let them force you into working overtime and doing death-marches. Their failure to plan and deliver does not constitute treating this as your fault. You deserve to be treated with respect. \n\nSend emails at the end of every meeting with all attendees summarizing the agreements made in the meetings, along with follow-ups for any items that still need resolution. You need to do this to protect yourself from people over-committing on your behalf, and this form of over-communication makes it very difficult for anyone to pass the buck.",

The freaking requirements doc that was written up by the product owner doesn't even cover the scope that the software I helped build and develop covers, and I keep telling them that unless we get more staff with dotnet expertise or move at least some people over this is going no where.\n\nHeck, I even let them try doing a ticket for this guy involving a smaller application, they did the ticket only because I provided help and guidance because no one had any idea how to do azure, and even with all that work, the entire thing failed.  Mainly because some person hard coded passwords for users that no one remembers, as well as the user names, stuck them in the software and yeeted out of existence to another job.  There's no source control for the project that was being replaced so if it goes down due to updating the user password the entire thing is toast.\n\nGoing from a dotnet project to a java / spring project that has 5 years or more of history on it is not a code swap, it is a complete rebuild that requires heavy amounts of work to even pull off.

You should preferably let some good contacts know to keep their eyes open. \n\nFor this gig, you need to talk money - that is all they hear. If you want to keep the job aka get salary, let them know it will cost a lot to replace - as it has but again - since at least you know *something* about the product. Demand stuff like QA/BA/manager/similar to remove impediments and assist. It will save in the long term. The keyword here is save money.\n\nGoing on a tangent on everything that is wrong doesn't work, they just hear how you can't do it. Pointing out incorrect business decisions is what they at least can understand, if you really want to explain their shitty situation. And for the love of god get things in writing. You just learned an important lesson of \"just saying things\" will come back to haunt you. And you will always lose \"he said/she said\" situation. Don't say keywords like \"working\" or \"next week\" - it will haunt you. Shifting the blame like \"only if x is working, maybe\" will make them understand the complexity. Like \"sure only if there are proper requirements on that\" or \"nothing new pops up\". One day they might even ask \"okay how do we do that\". \n\nIt is funny how much it matters on *how* we say things. And this is why good managers who can play politics and defend are so crucial.",

While fields like high-level medicine are often more secure due to their specialized nature, other industries can be unpredictable. For trades and service jobs like plumbing or USPS, layoffs might be rarer, but they do happen, especially during economic crises like 2008. What I've noticed is that many people in these fields experience job stability differently, often dealing with tough work conditions instead of layoffs. If you're interested in tracking layoffs to get a sense of what's happening across different industries, checking resources like state labor department websites or the Bureau of Labor Statistics can be helpful. One thing I also look at is WarnBrief, which tracks layoff notices. It's a bit like piecing together a puzzle to understand job stability across various sectors. How's your experience been in your current field?\n\n  \n\\---\n\nFull disclosure: I'm with WarnBrief (https://www.warnbrief.com) - we track this stuff, but the above applies regardless of what tools you use.",

I’ll be the first to admit we need to pay bills and put food on the table but if you accept that shiity job you will regret it and be super depressed for at least 6 months. Work on some side projects and really get back to your roots what made you want to be a developer or whatever you are. This will help you form strong opinions of what you’re really good at and what you really want to do and more important what you don’t want to do. Another thing, with 22 years of experience you should be leading a team not on the bottom of the totem pole.

      "text": "I am hearing a lot of stuff about agents as in Claude Code or Antigravity. There are even people saying, that they have 5, 10 or even 20+ agents running at the same time while saying, that they haven't touched an IDE for weeks. That would be a huge change in my workflow. So I gave it an honest try with Antigravity since I have the Gemini Subscriptions anyways and its included in the pricing.\n\nI tried to bootstrap a project and generated specific prompts for the agent and it started working. It looked really good first and I was slowly getting further with the project. I could not \"one-shot\" every functionality, but I kept going further and further.\n\nAt some point, some features were not working as expected. I tried many ways around it, but then something else started to break. \n\nSo eventually I have hit a point, where I suddenly have some random codebase with many thousands of lines and nobody on this world knows how anything is working at all. And even if it seemingly works on the first glance: I have no idea what already works beneath (what might not be visible in the UI), how it works, which tasks are specifically already fully implemented and how easy it may be to add potential requirements in the near future.\n\nI have no idea if there are any security holes or similar. The whole reliability is gone. This may also have legal implications for teams or the whole company, if it is going to be a real production application.\n\nI would need to reverse all of the code to undestand it and build some mental map of it. If I would have prompted it further and further, the codebase would probably grow larger with the same concerns. It feels like the new bottleneck is the cognitive load one can take to understand the huge amount of code that is being generated.\n\nSo my question is: If you work like I described in the first paragraph or know somebody who does something similar like that, do you just dismiss the actual context and understanding of the codebase? Just a quick glance and a \"LGTM\" for the code you produced on your own and up to prod? Or what am I missing here? How does that play out in the real world? I am not a hater or anything, I am just genuinely curious what's going on, since I get flooded on social media with those claims.",

The idea is to provide an agent with some bootstrapping instructions and a number of files it can use to store a roadmap, changelog, and documentation, all intended to make human review of agentic work much easier.\n\nThe framework is intended to limit how much an agent focuses on, keeping its work sessions short and tightly focused. It’s also meant to keep the user in the loop and regularly reviewing the work being done, so they always know what generated code does. I think putting this kind of structure around an LLM is the only way to consistently get useful results out of it.",

It's definitely faster than typing everything out charcter by character, switching between mouse and keyboard, or refactoring symbols one instance at a time, but that's not what I do. I have (dumb) autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, code search, macros, and multiple selection, etc., so overall the actual editing is fairly quick and painless. Sometimes it's even a little fun; figuring out how to efficiently perform an unusual transformation with the tools available is like a mini puzzle.\n\n\nSo I'm left wondering if it's a tooling problem. As in, maybe people justifyably find editing code in a barebones or unfamiliar editor tedious, but now instead of looking for a more advanced editor or learning more about the editor they already use, they reach for LLM code generation, because there's less friction getting started with it.",

Sometimes I officially go in to plan mode, but I don't find it necessary most of the time. Because my framework is so conventional and well documented, everything has a pattern or file type for each need. I can talk through TDD and get the functionality all in place (really complex stuff). It does it. It writes the code. I am detail oriented and acting as UI designer and things in this case too, so - I'm going to tune up the HTML and address and test the accessibility concerns - and I'm personally going to write a lot of the CSS -- but for the most part (besides that) I'm letting CC write all the application logic and wireframe all the interfaces out. I have 2 or 3 windows working on specific areas with their own unique context being built up / or for different features or review tasks. As I go, I review the code in GitTower and make clear grouped commits just like I've always done. I'd rather someone else write all this code... but given that I have to in this case, CC is amazing. It totally works. But it also took me 15 years to learn enough to be able to use it like this. If I didn't have that experience - I'd just be guessing and accepting everything. That wouldn't work out that great. I have to be here to steer things. And since I'm not just producing output based on Figma or spec - it's really important that it *does* work this way. It's iterative and I'm building the real things and having people test along the way. (and I'm not trying to sell anyone on LLMs - I don't care about your code - or your job at all).

When a project gets complex, AI agents lose the big picture. That’s when hallucinations kick in, and the AI starts making decisions for you—like suggesting a weird version downgrade—that can turn your whole codebase into useless crap.\n\nFor example, I once had Claude try to fix a dependency conflict in an \\*\\*Expo (React Native)\\*\\* project by forcing a \\*\\*version downgrade\\*\\* from SDK 54 all the way back to SDK 40! It basically tried to solve a modern problem by dragging the project back years into the past, making it completely incompatible with everything else. If you don't catch these things, you end up in \\*\\*dependency hell\\*\\*.\n\nInstead of treating AI as a brain, treat it like a \\*\\*scalpel\\*\\*. Use it to make surgical cuts on a very limited scope. Your prompt should define and set strict limits to that scope. For example, ask it to write a specific function and treat it as a 'black box.' Use the AI to comment the code so you know how to interface with it later without having to dive into the logic every time. This is how you actually get a professional advantage from these tools.\n\nBottom line: AI is not a thinking entity; it’s a tool you must direct. Never let it make high-level design decisions. It works great within bounds, but the moment you put your own brain on \\*\\*autopilot\\*\\*, you’re in trouble.",

They sound so good that people usually just go along with what they're saying. They aren't like a real person who has something to lose by being wrong. They're incentivized via their architecture and training to prefer shorter resolutions, so they try to finish everything as fast as possible.\n\nWith that in mind, you are better off keeping their scope as limited as possible, only feeding them additional scope once you've confirmed they succeeded at all prior tasks. They also benefit from grounding, keeping them anchored to something real and steady, as language can drift as semantics get misaligned. So, for your project, try writing all of the tickets ahead of time, define their business requirements, acceptance criteria, any implementation details or preferences, etc. and then whether you are using one agent or 20, they're all pointing at the same thing.",

          "text": "Not to pump TDD too hard, but tests are even more important when working with LLMs. Tests are specifications you can run to validate everything works correctly. If your tests are well written and cover the functionality you need, then an LLM can work with that back and forth until it meets the specs, and when the tests pass you know it is actually working not kind of working. This addresses the issue of fragility you touched upon where \"some features were not working as expected. I tried many ways around it, but then something else started to break.\" Almost certainly the \"something else\" was totally uncovered by your tests so the LLM didn't know and you had to discover it with manual checks. Consider if it was covered by your tests and you required your agent to pass all tests, formatting, lint, etc. the typical CI checks we use to make sure humans don't merge bad code also helps LLMs from making bad commits by providing guardrails.\n\nWhen people say \"one shot\" they usually just typed a single prompt into an AI and hoped for the best despite ambiguity, lack of specification review, lack of validation/testing steps to make sure implementation actually matches the reviewed specification, lack of retry in their development loop to fix any implementation gaps, etc. Consider orchestrating or sequencing multiple agents together like we do with human engineers at scale. With humans in larger companies, when an error gets into production it's never the fault of one engineer. It's always the fault of the process. The process is what is supposed to protect us from getting bad bugs into production and should make it impossible for a single engineer to be able to get code into production alone. Was the change tested, passing the gauntlet of CI checks, was it reviewed with the context to understand what it \\*should\\* do, was it deployed to staging before production, and so on. Anytime someone says \"one shot\" I know they aren't codifying their process properly for systematic checks and fixes. Iterative > one shot.\n\nCognitive load is a real issue not just for humans but LLMs too. I created a static analysis tool for technical debt/complexity analysis as part of the CI flow for my workflows so that terribly written highly complex code is automatically identified with appropriate context provided to an agent to fix during my implementation workflow. You can find tools that can help you with this out there. If you happen to be using Rust I can link you to the tool I built for my projects which is specialized for Rust and LLM consumption.",

However, AI agents can be very useful if you use them smart. Try a spec driven bootstrap, test driven implementation approach. First, ask AI to help you to make a structured spec, which is abstract of machine code, focusing on **what** you do vs **how** you do it (e.g. use Gherkin format). Then generate a skeleton app without a business logic, which is full stack, compiles and runs, but does nothing yet. Then implement features one at a time, write tests first. And take any AI generated stuff critically, check every line, refine, work incrementally. Good luck with this.",

Markdown documentation files in the repo are your friend. You can even get the agent to help write some of it, but the point is that you're defining, in detail, what you want the thing to build. Design patterns. Class hierarchies. Interfaces. Any non-trivial design decision. Before you send the agent on its merry way you should have a very strong understanding of what the result should look like architecturally.\n\nThe perk of doing this is that a) you know what it is the agent is supposed to be doing, because it's your docs. And b) it makes reviewing agent code *much* easier because you're not trying to figure out what it's doing, you're just evaluating whether or not the produced code is consistent with your spec.\n\n- Tests tests tests. In the same way if another human programmer turned in some non-trivial bit of code you would expect to see tests with it, you should be expecting tests from the LLM. The scaffold for tests is one of the first things you want to set up. Make the LLM run the tests (or run them yourself if you don't trust the LLM to hallucinate it - which... it does sometimes) and verify correctness.",

But it is much more like copying and pasting from Stack Overflow.  \n\nHow you can improve the quality of what you are doing:\n\n1. Always iterate. It is never going to be perfect the first time, so the idea of one-shot prompting it is not remotely the right approach. \n\n2. You must stay on top of what it is doing. You can't trust it to write more code than what you can review and test. \n\n3. Building features is going to be better than starting from scratch on a new project. AI feeds off examples, so showing it exactly how it should build is always going to improve the quality and make reviewing easier. \n\n4. Accept that it isn't going to figure out anything for you, you have to tell it what to do. It can pull things together and seem like it is \"designing\", but it is just parroting examples. Luckily, in any decently sized codebase, this is also what any developer should be doing. Constantly inventing new patterns inside an existing codebase is a road towards a mess.\n\nCoding with AI is not going to write better code than coding without AI, but it is definitely faster. It isn't even easier, because the job isn't to write code, it is to build working features, and it absolutely won't do that without your exhaustive supervision.

However, the large codebase was built in manageable pieces, step by step with LLM working no longer than 5 min at a time. This code was thoroughly tested and ended up being a very robust application with plenty of validations and resilient to anything I threw at it. \n\nThe LLM agent is not going to fit into the conventional software engineering workflow and if you try to dump JIRA tickets onto an agent, well, your milage may vary. You need to architect specifically for the agent and you need to execute with strong oversight. You dont need to watch the code itself, but you need to set small testable and provable deliverables and keep the agent accountable to meet these deliverables. \n\nYou can do the TDD approach where you ask it to write tests first, then ask it to write code that passes all of them. You can iteratively discuss a full user story -> requirements -> task and you should store them to a file and have the LLM reference these files for context. You also need to ask it write extensive logging for errors and exceptions, but you have to prioritize only important logs as spammy logs blow up your context window and completely cripple the LLM. Make the agent write documentation, make it write --help content, LLMs LOVE documentation. \n\nIf you do not follow the correct approach, the agent will likely blow up its context at around 10k LoC with a large error and you will be left holding a bag of 10k lines of code that's borderline worthless.",

          "text": "Why do people expect AI to upload a codebase directly into their brains? You can’t expect to understand a codebase when you “kept going further and further”. \n\nSadly, I know what you mean. AI can do a lot with vague, one-shot prompts. It’s amazing. Someone who doesn’t know a lot can build and explore and learn. I ask AI to do things that are on the edge (and way over the edge) of what I understand. I “vibe code”. It’s a fun way to ask stupid questions and learn. \n\nBut somehow people interpret this as a reason why AI is bad—and how software developers sucks. It’s clickbait for the AI marketing bots. \n\nMore seriously, if you want to work with AI in a long-term live environment as a contributor or small group (not speaking to production environments for engineering teams), you should understand all the code you create. What this means for me is a lot more upfront planning.\n\nIf someone is using 20 agents (and doing it the right way), then they’re probably have a lot of upfront agents that work as a team with other agents. For example, I have a few layers of agents and context:\n\n**Workspace**\nCopilot provides a default “.github/copilot-instructions.md” where I define the language/version, package manager, external links/MCP servers, linking rules, workspace settings, and git. Then, I create a small agent checks those settings, searches websites to suggest stable, popular dependencies. Another agent to summarize commits. \n\n**Development**\nI have a dedicated folder structure for planning. Initially, I create three .md files: \n- scope: describes boundaries and limits; i.e. “building a store with frontend client and backend container. use node. Don’t create infrastructure—use containers”; user stories if you want to go that far\n- plan: describes goals and patterns (i.e. ports and adapters architecture, unit of work for aggregates, helpers for server actions, etc.). Also define entities. These should be explicitly defined, use an example json/yaml file and describe the transaction. Ideally, this plan outlines the tasks to complete. \n- tasks: I usually generate with AI, but look over closely before moving forward. It describes stages and tasks to complete. Tasks includes steps to insure a previous stage is complete. Ideally, when a stage is complete (save the first couple) the app runs and can be tested in that state before moving forward. Tests are crucial. I don’t exactly follow test driven development. I create tests to drive the agents. So, tests that enforce invariants are a base layer—if checkout product doesn’t match cart product, instruct agents to review domain packages. Also for behavior, like this route should never/always be available, if it fails retry precious step. \ntasks.md is an interactive file. Instructions tell agents to mark tasks as complete as they run. \n\nThen that’s when more agents start to get useful. Agent to keep a changelog during development. Agent to create and update documentation. Agents for linting, type checking, summarizing logs, and testing. Agent to suggest features and warn about complexity or check redundancies or performance. Small single purpose agents. I try and get creative sometimes. \n\nIdk about 20 agents running at once, but you can easily get to 20 agents total. It’s fun and cool. Can everyone chill out on the AI coding hate.",

LLMs are a tool, not a magic wish-granting genie in a lamp, and require investment to learn how to use effectively. Without proper context engineering and oversight, they will happily generate complete garbage.

There's a lot of nuance to getting what you want out of using AI properly that comes with practice.\n\nTo start with, you need to always understand what it's produced. There's a lot more time in AI workflows needed for understanding and validation. It's okay to have small parts of the code you don't fully understand, but those need to be well tested. \n\nOne trick to get some level of understanding fast is to start with interactive design. Communicate exactly what you want, and why, have it bring you a few solutions for that, and pick one. That way you know exactly what it's building, and both of you can set guard rails before you start.\n\nGuard rails are critical. Type checking, aggressive linting, and other checks (e.g. I run lighthouse on a stop hook on some projects) will help no end. Treat it like a junior report, where you'll still need to understand what it did. \n\nThe ideal of running 10+ Claudes at once is very real (I'm up to about 12 sometimes), but it takes a lot of practice. Start by getting very good at using one, and add a second once you've mastered the first. And master parallelism via sub-agents before you try to juggle projects. \n\nIt's a difficult skill. The people accurately using 5+ agents at once have been practicing for years now. It's great you've taken the first step now, but don't try to do it all at once.",

The idea that the code/UX was thoughtfully considered, *and should be reasoned about before changing*, seems to be increasingly remote.\n\nWorse, I think these devs were above doing that pre-AI.

The best case scenario is a longer PR review as we rehash things that are covered in the PR description. The worst case, and the one I worry is becoming the common case, is people being more likely to give cursory reviews: having not read the PR description and not gotten context on the \"why\" of the change, they're just looking at surface level code details rather than considering bigger picture stuff. That's never been a good outcome, and it's an increasingly bad outcome in a world where much of the code is AI slop (and where thorough review is more important than ever).\n\nSome of my coworkers who are good writers have started to preface their PRs with \"(human written)\".

Leadership sees the feature list—often without ever using the product—and concludes you’re doing great. When customers complain that things are broken, you get to swoop in as the hero who \"fixes\" the problem and saves the relationship. If your code has long-term issues, well, by the time they get visible to management you already have your promotion, salary increase, or whatever you're after.\n\nBy contrast, investing time upfront in maintainability, usability, and other (long-term) quality aspects is hard to measure and often not really appreciated by leadership. It's \"boring\" work.\n\nAnd many customers seem to accept getting half-broken software. For example, Apple used to be the company that built products that \"just work\". Today, they throw out non-working \"Apple Intelligence\" doesn't work as advertised or a \"Liquid Glass\" operating system that's considered a UX catastrophe by many experts and full of bugs but people still buy their phones. But I don't want to say that this is an Apple-specific problem. It's all about short-term revenue, marketing lies, and extracting money from people and not about building products that work and last.\n\nIn that incentive structure, producing AI slop as fast as possible is what gets you recognized / promoted as an engineer.",

To put it another way, let’s say I’m about to start working on a feature or pipeline or whatever code artifact, if I know in my head exactly what the code needs to do, how it needs to be structured and how to test it, you best believe I’m using Claude to implement it for me and saving that time.

No. The ai tool is still LLM based, so the generated code can (and likely will) contain subtle bugs. \n\nWhat's worse tho is that unless you create tiny apps that fit in 1 file, your code lives inside a bigger project, a larger codebase.

Adding new features in codebases like that takes more effort than just generating code for just that feature; changes ripple through.

And now they’re damaging a lot more and speedrunning to that unmaintainable state.\n\nPeople who were good coders and knew their code backwards and forwards are generally adopting AI as a helper. They’ll run a planning session, then start coding and generate small scope requests, where they read, understand, and refine the output. Their productivity is much higher and the code quality is the same or better, and their understanding is the same. The output gains are very real if you know what you’re doing.\n\nMany are resisting adoption, both good and bad.\n\n“Vibe coding” really only has a place professionally when creating prototypes or internal tools. Theres a reason we haven’t seen an onslaught of vibe coded apps consuming the software market, because you can’t actually build broad scope fully functioning software this way. It will always reach a point where you can’t change it anymore, and it happens very fast.

If I hated that I'd have become a manager years ago.\n\nI get the feeling most people who are in favor of AI tools for development work on web frontends: lots of training data was available, the output seems reasonable and I can understand why people don't want to write JS by hand at times. However backend systems, game engines, complicated desktop apps... the picture is completely different there. Example: for my .NET ORM (LLBLGen Pro) I worked for more than a year full time on the Linq provider (which converts ASTs into command trees which are then used to generate SQL. The ASTs are produced by the C#/VB.NET compilers by generating code that builds them at *runtime* and are called Expression trees, so they exist at runtime). There wasn't (and still isn't) alot of documentation how to do this properly and the code that was there, was hard to understand complicated code. There are many corner cases to deal with (e.g. Linq's Group by has different scoping than SQLs so you have to interpret the tree to properly convert it at the right places, introducing projections etc.). \n\nWould an LLM be able to build that for me? No. I doubt it ever will. It's niche, I know, but I like it as an example of a complex system that requires a lot of work on many levels to make it work. The run-off-the-mill CRUD app might be an ideal case for LLM based AI tools, other complex tasks might be a bridge too far and always will be.",

They learn by identifying patterns in data, which allows them to generate new outputs by leveraging their internal parameters. This means that while you won't necessarily receive the most optimal or innovative code, you'll get solutions that reflect the **average** quality and approaches present in the training data.\n\nTherefore, you should employ machine learning in scenarios where **average** is acceptable. For instance, ML can be beneficial for *generating initial drafts of unit tests* or *creating functions that address common problems*. Additionally, ML can be useful in *identifying architectural errors* and *potential vulnerabilities* in code. You may also want to ask improvements to your existing code, to *learn and improve*.\n\nIf you use AI to generate full-blown, production-ready applications, oof. Don't do that. We'll all eventually pay the price with the spread of crappy, unmanageable code throughout the world.",

Imagine someone enters \"no peanuts\" on their order.  A human can read this, but that fails at scale.  Imagine if we could tag allergy concerns, so \"no peanuts\" and \"extra spicy\" have different urgencies?  Or if they said \"swap the chicken for shrimp\" - we want to call them and confirm the extra $$ on the order.  \n\nSo, we have a process which takes a newly submitted menu and queries the LLM. *\"You are a food preparer.  Given this menu and these comments, please read each comment and tell me if they're about allergies, potentially change the cost of the order, or are very negative. Return your answers as structured JSON\".*\n\nThis works amazingly well. Customers aren't exposed to AI slop.  Even if it's not 100% accurate, it's incredibly useful.  It's affordable (about 10c per order) and runs fast enough (5-10 seconds). It's even cheaper in batch (you save on input tokens), so you can run dozens of orders at a time.",

          "text": "Here, I’ll give you an example of what my workflow might look like:\n\nMy team is deploying an internal product to help our Contracts folks negotiate with our suppliers and with our customers. They can upload contract language, we identify the clauses in the contract, provide some enrichment from internal and external datasets, score each clause using a combination of heuristics and ML, and provide an LLM generated top-line with citations.\n\nWe wanted to make these citations a bit more “rich”: add some icons, some conditional highlighting, some onHover behavior, etc.\n\nIt required some changes to our underlying datamodel, some new parsing logic, pipeline updates, then a bunch of wholey-new frontend components.\n\nI had a bunch of this already in my head. I knew which datamodel changes I wanted to make, and I knew how to write the parsing logic I wanted. I spent a morning writing a TDD for these changes. I sent it around to my team for comments. I used Claude Code with Opus 4.5 to plan out the tickets: I knew it would be like 5-8 tickets, but wasn’t sure *all* of the files I needed to touch, and wanted to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Took me about an hour to get all the tickets written to the level of detail I wanted.\n\nAfter that was done, and I’d reviewed my team’s comments, I started working through the tickets.\n\nI implemented the parsing logic myself, I made the datamodel changes and ran migrations. I used Claude Code to bang out the pipeline changes in the meantime. Took me about an hour to write my bit, I checked in on Claude Code every 15min or so to make sure it was moving in the right direction.\n\nThen, I spent about 10-15min reviewing its PR (not really a PR, I had it in a local git worktree, but same idea). Backend changes all look good to me.\n\nI push the branches to get CI going, tag a coworker or two to review. I start on the frontend tickets.\n\nFor these, I point Claude Code (still Opus 4.5) at each Linear ticket, and give it the TDD I wrote as context. I point it at the Figma mocks our designer made.\n\nI check back in on CI for the backend PRs. I ask Claude Code to write some new unit tests covering the backend work. I review them. I edit a few, add one for an edge case it missed. I push.\n\nSwing back to the frontend agents. Fire up the website locally. It doesn’t look right. I tell Claude Code it needs to match the mocks *pixel perfect*. It churns for 5min. Ok, now it matches.\n\nI spend 20min reviewing the frontend changes while CI runs. I add three new end-to-end tests. Everything looks good to me, I tag a coworker in a PR for awareness, set GH to automerge.\n\nMy mental model for Claude Code right now is basically “we are all tech leads”. I spend pretty close to zero time actually *writing* code in vim. Instead, my time is all pre-work and architecture, and code-review. To be fair, this is basically how my job *has* been for the last couple years: figure out what *should* be done, delegate, review what comes back. I think it’s actually made me a more rigorous tech lead because Claude can be super stupid sometimes. It means I have to think about what might be misinterpreted in my tickets, forces me to be really explicit about when I care about certain system specifics, and when I don’t. It means my people-engineers get better-scoped, more detailed plans from me as well.\n\nLater, we want to add the same citations frontend behavior to another part of the website. I didn’t bother writing a ticket — I just pointed Claude at it. “Make this field like XYZ other field, only use existing components and logic.” 3min later, PR ready to merge. I didn’t bother reading the code, just opened the website, made sure end2end tests were passing. Pushed, set to automerge.\n\nMaybe this is vibe coding, maybe it’s going to bite me in the ass. We’ll find out.\n\nIt takes a decent amount of work up-front. I put a lot of work into our test harness. My team’s quite defensive about changes there. It forces me to spend much more timing writing english and reviewing code. But I find that I end up with better process documentation. And honestly, “being an IC” and “being a tech lead” seem like they’re basically the same job to me.",

We have no juniors, everyone’s got minimum 5 years experience. Now I’m back to being an IC, but I think I’m basically bringing my tech lead workflow with me. Part of it is that at my current startup everyone on the team own certain products/initiatives, and borrows small parts of each other’s time. So we all sorta act like the lead for some things, and the IC for others. Having a lot of written material makes it easy for us to stay on top of what everyone else is doing.\n\nOnce we start hiring juniors/interns, I’m not sure how I’ll coach them to use LLMs. Seems tricky and it’s a bridge I haven’t crossed yet.\n\n2. Since we’re prototyping/shipping quite quickly, it’s quite important that we can refactor freely. One thing we experiment with quite a bit is our internal datamodels and some of our API contracts. To give us confidence that we aren’t breaking anyone up/downstream, we spent a bunch of time thinking through some truly end-to-end customer workflows. If they can come back green, we know our system works, even with significant refactors to big parts of our system. With this product we’re at the stage where we want to make breaking changes maybe every week, maybe multiple times a week. Having a strong test harness makes me more confident, and I also think it’s a useful piece of documentation (like a good README) to point the LLMs at in terms of explicit “intended system behavior”. You can often do stuff like “make ABC tests pass, you may not modify the tests”, and that helps bound the LLM a bunch. End-to-end works particularly well, as unit tests can get stale pretty quickly as we modify architecture and internal behavior.",

          "text": "I use AI constantly now, but for me there is a big difference between vibe coding and let’s call it “AI assisted programming”. \n\nLet’s firstly talk about vibe coding. I tried to vibe code a small statistical dashboard for our app. To be honest I achieved what I wanted to achieve, it shows all the data it looks ok, nothing fancy. I spent approximately 6 to 8 hours to do this. Which previously would take me maybe like 3 to 5 working days. So it’s really a noticeable speed up. But. The code is absolute fucking garbage and I absolutely don’t trust it. It’s cool as a demo, but I wouldn’t push this to prod. Also, I still used my knowledge as programmer. I told the AI how ETL pipeline should be structured, even though the code is garbage I still managed to have some separation of concerns there. But still, mine influence on the code was relatively minimal.\n\nBut when it comes to “AI assisted programming” that’s completely different thing. So here I’m more in control and I would create the structure, set everything up and I would just outsource the “boring part” to AI. For example, you just need to develop another simple feature, that doesn’t require much thought. It’s pretty clear how to implement it and you can explain to AI how it should be done. Yes, go ahead and give it to AI. But you see, for this you need to understand the structure of the existing code. In tools like Cursor/Claude code when prompting I quite often tag specific files where changes need to happen and tell it to reuse specific functions. AI is actually very good at solving small, structured and limited problems. Yes, people are too. But still even to mechanically type it and think about small details will take you like several hours, but with this you heavy it ready in 10 minutes.\n\nActually, I have like a rule of thumb to understand if I’m vibe coding or I do “AI assisted programming”. If I can’t review all the code that is generated by AI, and I don’t fully understand it, then it’s 100% vibe coding.\n\nAnother big thing what I use AI for is understanding different code bases. At work, and I work in a big corporate, we have a lot of different repositories that I need to use from time to time. And being in a big corporate means that in 90% of cases it’s much simpler and faster to figure things out on your own than trying to find the right person. So we have company approved Claude code. And I use it to understand what this code base does, how it works, and what parameters I should use. \n\nAnd another thing, is writing small throw away scripts. So there is a joke that programmers would spend 3 days automating things they can manually do in 30 minutes. Well, now with AI you can actually automate it in 5 minutes. And for such things I don’t even use AI code editors. I just ask ChatGPT or other to write script and I’ll copy paste it.",

I enjoy coding and I don’t want to have a tool code my important logic for me and if I absolutely need the help I walk through the code step by step and make sure I understand it. \n\nWhat makes me use AI is when I have spent at least an hour trying to find documentation that better explains an error I’m finding or a solution with one of the build tools I use. I work in the embedded space and I have two build systems, Yocto and CMake. Yocto has a lot of lackluster documentation with no examples and lots of syntactical sugar that is not straightforward. Most of my times using AI have been because I could not figure out how to use some obscure feature in Yocto. This is largely since the space around Yocto is largely proprietary (how many open source embedded OSs are being made?) so you just don’t see a lot of examples or really any documentation when you get into obscure problems. Even then I have had AI fail on me but it did help me generate new ideas I couldn’t see. \n\nI have also used it once for CMake help when I could not figure out how to package and deploy a header only file for Conan2.

          "text": "I started a project a few months ago to explore this very question: https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun\n\nIt's a functional programming language that transpiles to JS.  I don't necessarily intend to push for its usage, but it's meant to be complete enough that it _could_ be used.  I wanted a project with real world complexity that involved domains where I don't have deep knowledge (compilers, type systems, etc.).  It's been on hold for about a month due to RL, but the language design is probably 95% complete and the compiler is at about 80%.  The code is 100% written by Claude Code.  Probably about half Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5.\n\nWhat I'm finding is that it's surprisingly (even shockingly) capable.  But you MUST tailor your approach to work within the capabilities of the AI.  From my experience so far:\n\n* As always the hard part is the requirements.  Several times on this project I had to step back and work out more detailed requirements for the language and/or compiler (still using Claude) because _I_ could see that we were trying to implement something too vague.  Claude will sometimes ask questions when it realizes more detail is needed, but it's never going to tell you \"we need to stop and rethink this entire plan.\"\n* You must leverage CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.  Not just for understanding your code base and standards, but helping the agents navigate and maintain complex parts of the code and repo.  For example the docs/spec (language spec documentation) in my project.\n* You must add all the guardrails you possibly can - strongly typed languages, linters, etc. and you must make sure they're required.  CLAUDE.md isn't enough.  Git hooks aren't enough, Claude knows that it can bypass them with `HUSKY=0 git commit..`.  I added a [Claude hook](https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun/blob/main/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-verify.sh) to block it from committing without passing checks.\n* You must test the hell out of the code base.  My project is about 75% test code and has 90% coverage.  It's not just validating functionality, it's more documentation to tell the agent how the code is supposed to work AND more guardrails to catch problems if the agents starts to go nuts when refactoring or changing functionality.\n* You MUST have multiple layers of checks.  I have Claude form a plan and save it (see `.claude/archive` for examples), then usually have at least 2-3 clean sessions review and revise the plan.  After implementation have a clean session audit the implementation for completeness.  I also have Claude set up in github actions to review PRs (recently set up CodeRabbit tho haven't really used it yet) and it has absolutely pointed out problems with PRs.  Claude Code can use the github CLI to review feedback and update the PR, which is pretty nice.  You need all of this because no matter what you do the agent will sometimes just do whatever the hell it wants - decide that part of the work will be deferred to later, decide that a linter or type error can just be marked with a TODO, or that failing tests are ok because they represent \"pre-existing problems\", etc.\n\nAlso, it's gonna cost money unless you're very casual.  When I started I was on the $20/month plan, it took less than 90 min of coding to hit limits.  I bumped to the $100 plan and have been ok with it, only came close to hitting the limits once when I tried running 3 sessions simultaneously with worktrees.  That gave me a serious headache tho, not interested in doing it regularly.\n\nIf I was starting a new greenfield project with complete control over the technical direction I'd seriously consider vibing it with Claude.  But what does this mean for existing code bases, especially messy legacy code with poor structure, no tests, etc.?  That I don't know, and I think it's going to be very challenging to effectively integrate agents into those code bases.  Unfortunately my day job only allows Copilot, so I haven't been able to explore that aspect very much.",

          "text": "I have around 10 years of experience as a fe dev, started using claude code about three months ago. \n\nGot a project written in angular which we needed to redesign with an actual design from a designer, the design was improvised by the developer along the way in the original version and had really bad UX. \n\nSince we are a react based FE team and we might want to maintain this and develop it in the long run, part of the project was to recreate what existed before but with react now while applying the new design. \n\nThe plan was to go all in with AI from start to finish and evaluate how to integrate it in our workflows from now on. \n\nFirst week or so, I didnt create any code, I created a bunch of “analysis” .md files, I explained to claude code what the project was about, had it read through both the angular project which we would replace, read through the dotnet BE project which we will keep using with minor modifications where needed, explained the stack and architecture I wanted in the end (vite, react, tanstack router, vitest, shad/cn, react hook forms, zod, tanstack query prebuilt with orval etc.), had it read our companies testing guidelines, use our linter setup packages etc. \n\nThis resulted in about 250 of pages of .md if all of the output were combined. From that I started extracting smaller .md files as phases of a plan and then fed that as initial input to the ai, along the way I keep generting various analysis, plan, implementation log and report files and have a mix od human in the loop and more autonomous sessions reading those and spitting out new ones along side the code changes they are doing. \n\nI had a mix of going back and forth between implementing new features, testing, debugging, fixing and refactoring stuff already added and so on. \n\nThe current result is that I have all the functionality ported and it will be tested by our qa for 2 weeks while I am on vacation, on the code side I have 4 different branches covering all the implemenation besides the initial setup stuff, just actual features.\n\nFrist one is the entire auth, profile, onboarding flow, the second one is around 10 simple entity crud flows for the admin, the last two are the actual user flows, the users create something over a multi step detailed form and then they are matched with other users based on some logic and that is basically it.\n\nI probably spent about 20% of my total time on the project on the review and refactoring of the first release MR and I have it exactly how I would want it, and probably at a better state then if I would have wrote it, cause I usually wouldnt add this many tests, besides that,  it would be hard to tell that this looks different then what I would have written without ai.\n\nThe other release merge requests are a lot messier and contain a lot of stuff that is either overcomplicated, not consistent, or plain old wrong etc. \n\nThe plan now is to get all the QA found bugs that will be there in two weeks when I am back from vacation, fix them and go through the same process for all the remaining not refactored release branches and get the code to a place where I am confident to accept it and merge it to production. \n\nIn the entire process I did a couple of manual changes here and there, but for all practical considerations the ai wrote and rewrote the entire project. \n\nI dont have a strong conclusions at this point, besides that using ai as a web dev is probably not going to be optional anymore, besides that, what the process should look like, where the human in the loop is important, exactly how much faster or better on the one hand or worse if overused and underchecked on the other will this make us I have no confidence to say yet.",

Whether that's to gather information - I have Github MCP hooked up to Copilot - so Copilot can gather any historical context or whatever that I might need, or just ask Copilot to do the task for me and see where it gets. \n\nSimple tasks it will just one-shot. I need to review the code and handle the PR workflow and deployment and all that stuff, but the code change is all done by AI. \n\nMore complex tasks, it will handle all the leg work of investigating legacy code and making the required code changes. Quite often the changes are not 100% correct, so I ask it questions to verify it's reasoning and sometimes adjust the code myself. \n\nIn a PR workflow, I now consider it rude and wasteful to ask for human reviewers before getting a Copilot review. \n\nI also use AI for answering questions from Product Managers. eg \"How does <xyz> feature work?\" -  Copilot is absolutely great for these kind of tasks. \n\nThis is just scratching the surface.\n\nI've also built a number of personal projects using OpenAI codex using a relatively obscure tech stacks (Rust + Dioxus or Bevy) which it handles absolutely brilliantly. It does make mistakes, but they're surprisingly human mistakes like a few compile errors after a big change, which it then fixes in 1 or 2 attempts.   \n  \nMy personal projects have become much more ambitious and high quality. What would have taken weeks or months is now taking days or hours, seriously. \n\nA big part of the improvement is not having to pour through sketchy documentation and blog articles trying to piece together the correct way to do something, the AI *just does it.*",

If I don't remember something useful by then, I move on and stop using the LLM.\n\n\nAs far as *actually* executing tasks, I find it produces code that feels like an Escher painting. Nonsense that vaguely *looks* like code until you scrutinize it, and generally it doesn't work the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, nth time you prompt it to \"fix this\" or \"do this\". Much faster just to do the work myself and not have to wander a labyrinth of nonsense. The reason for this is that many systems do the equivalent of cutting up and stitching a recipe book back together whenever you ask for a recipe -- there is no comprehension of the task.\n\n\nBeing able to conversationally prompt for an overview of a topic (prompting for specific references/comparison to topics I do know) is new. It's a feature very few prior technologies could do this well!\n\n\nBut these LLMs do everything else sloppy enough that I can verify the output is wrong and non-fixable with prompting.

An example is I had to add a retry mechanism for a kafka project, I switched on my personal PC, gave Claude instructions, one being that exponential backoff won't work for my use case so we can try either Quartz or Hangfire. Claude gave me two POCs, I then went on to my work laptop, created two branches, quartz and hangfire, demoed both and  my lead and the rest of the team decided that hangfire should be adopted across all microservices as we have an advantage of a UI.\n\nI also use it to teach me Azure beyond the basics.\n\nEdit: Also use it for Documentation though I do this on my work laptop as Copilot has context of the entire project. \nUnit Tests as well.",

I try to “one-shot a simple application” with a SOTA model in my area (databases, asking for a simple unreplicated kv store, aka a hash map with an api), and it crashes and burns. It also takes longer to “think” than it takes me to write the thing myself. I fine-tuned my own model for more systems-level stuff and it works much better to the degree that I find GPT 5 Pro and it to be about equal, except that it runs on my desktop instead of multiple gpu servers. \n\nI trust agents very little. They seem to maybe be functional if you do heavy TDD in a strongly typed language, but that’s borderline imo. \n\nNobody I’ve talked to working in “more critical” software (dbs, drivers, firmware, other systems software) has found a lot of value in LLMs for coding and I had to go to fairly extreme lengths to get something that could maybe replace an intern (at least one I would hire).",

Asking questions about libraries or services I could use, trade offs, capabilities. For example I once asked for a reverse proxy like nginx but something better documented and more opinionated and it suggested caddy. I evaluated caddy, decided it was indeed what I was looking for and I've been using it ever since.\n\nFor coding I use cursor, either through its UI or a custom cli tool I wrote. If through cursor UI, I'll ask for something in broad strokes, like adding an onboarding flow and explaining the pages I want, then for changes like a better component organization or interface adjustments. Eventually I reach diminishing returns and finish and polish whatever it wrote. LLMs always write more than is necessary and cleanup needs to happen to manage project complexity.\n\nThe main value here I think is rapid prototyping. Even for old projects, you sometimes add new things to it and telling an LLM to build it from scratch in a few different ways can quickly test feasibility. Much gets thrown out in these cases anyway. Just, when you've found the approach you prefer, it's important to rework and test and simplify whatever was generated and not just merge it in.\n\nFor the custom tool, I just use that when I'm doing rote work. It's kind of an experiment with getting LLMs to build things more reliably, more info here:\n\nhttps://workflows.saf-demo.online/\n\nIt's basically a way to generate boilerplate then run prompts and checks automatically.

I do a couple more rounds of review and polish there, then present it.  It is so much faster than before I had the LLM assistant and I end up being more grounded in the design because of the review process I did with the LLM.\n\nAnother project I have set up (instructions plus context persisted for all chats in that project) that will generate code from that design.

          "text": "I've been using ChatGPT extensively since it came out and I feel like it really improved with their thinking models. Today it is usually much better and quicker than just searching on Google.\n\nAs a coding assistant, it became better and better over time. Initially I was just copying code from my machine to ChatGPT and some context, which was super annoying and slow.\n\nI remember trying out Codex (or Claude Code (?), don't remember) at the beginning of this year or in the early part of the summer and wanting to try out just how much could I push these models and how heavilly I could rely on them to do most if not all of the coding work. The first 2 hours were really impressive but then the code became full of design problems / code smell / repeated slightly different versions of code. It would also get stuck in edit/unedit loops (e.g. make change X, doesn't work, revert change X, doesn't work, do change X, repeat).\n\nSo I didn't try these agnetic models after that, until in the middle of November this year when I had an ambitious, low-ish risk project project at work and I had read these models had greatly improved. So I thought about doing the exact same thing, that is see how far I could push these models and check out how heavilly I could rely on them. So I tried Codex once again.\n\nLong-story short: At this point in time I don't think I ever need to write code ever again for mainstream programming language work. These models have improved \\_A LOT\\_ over these few months.\n\nI'd plan the project with ChatGPT 5.something Thinking and Pro and construct a \\`PLAN.md\\` that I'd then have Codex work off of.\n\nAnd it turned out really well. I was very cautious first. Checking all the edits it made and vetting all of them. Criticising the code it wrote or the reasoning for writing the code. I then slowly let that go and just wanted to see how fast we could possibly progress. Turns out I was the biggest bottleneck in getting features out.\n\nAs the project grew and started working, there were tons of features I wanted to add to it and when I reached a point where the work could be done in parallel I would run multiple agents working on different parts of the code base that don't intersect with each other. Now I've reached a point where that is too slow (e.g. having multiple agents working on the same code base) as they step onto each others toes when implementing features, and I am figuring out how to proceed (e.g. each agent runs on its own container and has a copy of the code base and the something-something merge requests, etc.)\n\nIt was also super addicting.\n\nBut as you do it for 12 hours a day for a few weeks you start to notices the issues and quirks of Codex, e.g. it would sometimes just want to delete the contents of your files, get stuck in edit/unedit loops (where something is broken, make change X, still broken, undo change X, still broken, redo change X, repeat), get stuck in really long thinking loops where it made no progress for up to an hour at least for what seemd like a trivial task, or its personality would flip and it would become really hesitant about editing code (to the extent it refused to do, e.g. \"Are you really sure you want to do it? It is a really big change and has to touch on all the files of the codebase.\"), etc. The code it makes also starts to become smelly and poorly architected over time and you have to explicitly suggest for it to rearchitecture/refactor. After multiple compactions it would also tend to become weird and glitchy, so I often start a new fresh codex once it starts to behave weirdly. I was also surprised that 400K tokens is pretty small (about 10 - 20 minutes of work on gpt-5.1.codex high).\n\nSo, yes, I am in the process of figuring out how I can accelerate even more as there are lots of features I want it to work on simultaneously but my environment is poorly structured for that. It definitely feels now you can 10x (or more) your productivity with these current models.\n\nIf you are skeptical just try them out for yourself.\n\nBTW: I was using Codex CLI.",

Back-and-forth with an AI just seems weird, and that's a mental bloc for me. The anthromorphisation (sp?) of AI annoys the heck out of me.\n\nFor writing code, my observations from reviewing AI-generated code is that it'll produce more of the same - quality is inconsistent across our repos (and I'll hold my hand up as being someone who has contributed to that) so more of the same isn't necessarily desirable IMO, and the test suites don't always  provide great confidence to support an AI-assisted reactor. \n\n---\n\nThe rest of my team have been using it, along with a reasonable degree of adoption across other teams. Within my team, I've seen it used a lot for essentially transcribing designs from Figma to React - in these cases, the \"more of the same\" aspect comes up and you see a lot of low-level building blocks being used. For example, `<Typography variant=\"m\">` instead of a higher-level component that would describe the semantics.\n\nAI-assisted PRs have tended to be big, but I think that's down to both our code structure and the AI tools\n\nThe tests I've seen it produce are mostly fine, but it will often introduce a couple of tests that are worthless.

For me, a value stream map, would look like this:\n\n- PM writes JIRA ticket\n- read JIRA ticket to identify scope, priority, and complexity\n- update JIRA ticket with my understanding\n- JIRA ticket goes through refinement\n- engineers critique ticket until it meets definition of ready\n- engineers place story in ready for work\n- engineer gather context of the scope\n- engineer begins work with context\n- engineer validates work locally\n- engineer reviews work locally\n- engineer creates code review\n- engineer has work reviewed\n- engineer has code merged\n- code is deployed\n- engineer monitors changes\n- engineer reverts changes if issues arise\n\n\n\nThis likely is pretty similar to something you’ve worked in before, but it’s important to label each step.

It's possible to 'vibe' it but then it's a pretty crappy loop of describing a small change, evaluating the plan, letting Codex implement and then evaluating the change. \n\nIt's also .. unsatisfying. I got into software engineering due to ADHD traits and focusing on problems felt great. As said, this is closer to requirements engineering/product ownership and fixing a problem ... just isn't as satisfying.\n\nLong story short, if approaches like Codex continue to improve I expect a shift in what we do (for apps) to change to being more requirements driven, but having an understanding of the technical tradeoffs that approaches an AI might take in implementing features or addressing problems is going to remain valuable.",

This collection of Md files has already saved dozens of hours of work.\n\n2. Big giant find replace for css colors and variables in css. Stuff I could have done (and did a lot of) manually. But yeah literally just like 200 css files and 3-4K hex codes, translated to css variables. AI also solved all the things where you can use hex codes but can’t use variables.\n\n3. Setting up a npm package/vite library for React components and css tokens, so different apps can use the same styling. I had never set up a library before and AI walked me through how to configure vite for a package, the build, etc.\n\n4. Any figma design, I can throw Claude at it and it gets it 90% of the way there in minutes. No more manually going back and forth or copy pasting a figma component and editing it in your code. If Claude is set up to do “best practices” and pull from existing styles it’s very easy to get it to pull stuff over in a DRY way.\n\n5. I will throw a full ticket at it, copy pasted from Jira, and it will hunt down what might be causing the problem in the code. I will continue to prompt Claude forward until it can explain or point at something that I can then manually go in and investigate. Great when you don’t have domain knowledge.\n\n6. 3rd party integrations. If the 3rd party has online documentation that is public (like most) -super easy. I have only done this with one company so far but it is basically telling Claude where I want it in the code, what the url of the documentation is, and then going and cleaning it up after.",

I find writing tests more enjoyable than reviewing and correcting generated tests.\n\nI've also found that generated code is often more like a StackOverflow answer - it may address the immediate question at hand, but may not be written in a way that works as well if you need a bit more abstraction.

Then ask for fixes and the justification, you select the best approach and also manually tests to make sure the fix works.\n* Simple changes across tens of files (like changing the signature of a method or replacing a deprecated method with the newer version)\n* Address tech debt\n* Verbose tasks like creating models or thrifts \n* To explore edge cases on an ongoing task\n* Brainstorm the best path once I'm starting a long project (you give it the RFC then do a talk like you would with other engs)\n* It is also pretty good at creating (mermaid) diagrams based on a text you provide. It is very useful when writing RFCs.\n* Speaking of RFCs, it can help you to make the investigation easier. The important part is to never fully trust it and verify the answers are correct. \n* For coding, if you are not super happy with your implementation, you can use it to brainstorm a better implementation. \n\nHope it helps. And please please please, never ever fully trust it. Review anything it produces as if you were doing it with an intern. LLMs are super useful, but trusting them too much can lead to pretty bad outcomes.",

For example if I want to write a chrome plugin for the first time, it is pretty great at setting up the framework to do all of it. Similarly with any sort of scripts to improve productivity, they are one off and not hooked into a larger code base and these can increase productivity.\n\n\nTests: \n\n\n- I like to make it write the first few tests, but I hate when it writes 30 tests. Now I just ask it to write one test to test a specific thing. Then I make sure the test is functioning correctly then copy it to make the five tests that I want of that style.\n\n\n- when it writes all 30 tests, it often isn't testing what it appears to be testing. Or is testing in such a way that it passes regardless of whether the code is right. In a sense it is trying to write tests that pass.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n- One shot it works, or it goes around in circles and sucks. Mostly the latter, so far as I can tell. \n\n\n- It very quickly turns to hacky solutions to make things work rather than sticking to best practices that you have asked it to, or that exist in the code base.\n\n\nOverall, it is too eager to write too much. And the more code there is written the more bugs there are. The more code there is to read, surpassing the ability of the dev to comprehend and parse all of it. So I don't understand how people are letting agents loose to write tons of code. I end up trying my best to constrain it to write less code most of the time, so that I can ensure it's doing the right thing.",

The report means I can quickly check if it's correct and throw it away if it's wrong.\n\nGeneralizing, I've found it quite good at chasing around command line output.\n\n2.

I ask the AI to do it and often get something close enough to make automation worthwhile.\n\nI find building things up piece by piece works much better  than having it write the whole thing in one shot. The code is way easier to review too. \n\nGiving algorithmic suggestions can also cut off some hacky solutions. E.g. parse by matching parens rather than a brittle regex.\n\n3. When I'm working in a domain, tool, etc I don't know well, I find that the suggestions/code it produces are useful to give me ideas and pointers to strategies even if I don't directly use the output.

I push the agent to use modern standards and tools. It tries to hand-roll everything by default, like it's in a coding contest, so it needs to be told. \n\nValidation is done the same as before: Manual, E2E, or Unit depending on the project. Unit is mostly for libraries. E2E for user-facing apps. Manual is all you need for prototypes and experimental branches. \n\nAs far as evaluating the upsides and downsides, there is far less \"low-level\" thinking required which means you get more practice at conceptual planning. More code review means your intuition for code quality grows. More time writing natural language means your communication skills improve. If your goal is just to build stuff, then this is all great. The downside is that you won't be in touch with the inner workings of your projects. On the other hand, building your own libraries is easier than ever so you might end up with a deep understanding anyways. \n\nIn the past, I would plan things out as well as I could and do the coding in dedicated, high-intensity sessions.

I usually give the agent a task, review the result, and if it misses the mark, I discard it and try again. When the agent cannot handle something after a couple of attempts, I step in and modify the code myself, but that is rare.\n\nWhen I dislike the agent’s behavior, I ask it to write a directive I can add to its custom instructions to correct that behavior.",

          "text": "I'll tell you three different stories about AI use. \n\n*How I use it at home*\n\nGmail does not have a sort by sender.  To replicate this, I copy the email address of the sender of the email I'm on, and paste it into the search bar with [from:$sender in:inbox].  But last week, instead of doing that, I realized that I could have Claude write a chrome plugin to do this for me.  So I gave it this prompt:  \n\n    i want to create a chrome extension called \"gmail search for sender\".  requirements:\n\n    add a keyboard shortcut to gmail to activate the functionality\n    the keyboard shortcut should be pressing i.\n    when you press the shortcut, it will search the current message for it's sender, ideally using the from: line, and then do a gmail search for messages from that sender in the inbox.\n    The search should look like \"from:$email in:inbox\"\n\nAnd it gave me a chrome plugin and install instructions.  I found one bug, that I told it about and it fixed, and then I had a plugin.  This plugin 10x my email productivity.  Now I can get through 1000 messages at a time -- before I could get through maybe 10 before I got tired of the copy/paste.\n\nI am not a frontend dev, so I could not have done this myself without hours of work and I most likely would have given up before getting it to work.  Using Claude was the only way this would happen.\n\n*How we use it at work*\n\nI'm the CEO of a small software company.  I've told my team that they can use the company card to pay for any AI tool they find value in.  Some are using Claude, some are using Gemini, some are using Codex.  Each uses it for different things.\n\n- One team member uses it for simple frontend work.  He's great at backend, but not at frontend, so he will use AI to write frontend code.\n\n- Another team member used it for porting work.  We had a library in Python and wanted to make a Go version.  He did not just ask it to port the whole library, but instead went function by function asking it to port each one using the Python as a reference.  He would give Claude the general plan and context as to what the function does, and then iterate with Claude for a bit, sometimes making manual changes.  He also used Claude to write the initial test suite by porting over the Python test suite.  *Claude/AI is really good at porting existing code to a new language*.\n\n- Others are using it for code review.  They will plug their code into AI after writing it and ask for a code review.  Sometimes it comes up with some useful suggestions, which they will implement themselves before submitting for human code review.\n\nOverall my team members say that it's increased their productivity 2-3x.\n\n*How my friends use it*\n\nhttps://github.com/adrianco/meGPT\n\nHe built an entire MCP server to replicate himself, and it was 100% coded in AI.  He also has another project where he wrote a Swift app, also 100% coded in AI.  He's doing this work in the open on his GitHub so people can follow along.  He's retired now, so he just does this for a couple hours a week, but he's outputting as many results as he used to when he was working full time.\n\nAnother friend set up an \"AI coding team\", where they gave each AI a personality (\"you are a principal engineer and believe in test driven development\", \"you are a curmudgeon, you poke holes in everyone else's code\").  Then they give the task to the \"team\" with a detailed design document, which iterates and comes up with a solution.",

At the time I thought he was joking - how can I, a junior, even approach much less understand the code in the standard library.\n\nTurns out, after deepening my fundamentals, reading multiple of the canonical books, participating in open source and years of writing/reading code, I no longer feel the same fear to approach any codebase in my main languages.\n\n(Humble) bragging aside, in my experience to be able to *read* code effectively you have to know the language/runtime and most if not all the language features. And this takes a lot of time - in the hundreds to the thousands of hours. \n\nTime investment that's not always judged as practical by most developers. And to be honest, it mostly isn't - often you have some very opinionated framework and you are left developing more or less trivial code in lots of places. So they end up using and being comfortable with a very limited subset of patterns and language/runtime capabilities.\n\nNow, with the use of LLMs the same people have to read and evaluate a lot more code:\n\n* code that may use patterns they have not encountered before \n* code using language constructs they are only vaguely familiar with\n* code relying on some implicit runtime/framework behavior they are not aware of\n* code that's actually using subtle anti-patterns \n* code that's just wrong/hallucinated\n\nExpensive option would be to try to understand everything by prompting the LLM for explanations. However, they might have lots of blind spots, or just think they understand something they actually learned the wrong way. Of course, the LLM might just provide plausible but still misleading explanations - again only something an expert can discern. Unknown unknowns might surface that require a lot of extra-study... that's all very uncomfortable and is not helping very much for their current task.\n\nLess expensive option would be to push the code that they convince themselves they kinda understand and trust the LLM. After all it appears to work. And voila, they've produced slop for others to review and maintain. \n\nNot sure if devs are solely to blame. For as long as I can remember, people were asked to be generalists, rely on frameworks which were doing the heavy lifting, be language-agnostic, not dig too deep into trivia, look things up instead of actually internalizing them etc etc. And now instead of just writing their simple glue code they have to read and evaluate a superset of what they know - running the code and observing behavior being the only real means they have left to judge its \"correctness\".\n\n",

Not sure if you read this old article [\"Code Isn't Literature\"](https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/) but I think it is instructive.\n\n> First, when I did my book of interviews with programmers, Coders at Work, I asked pretty much everyone about code reading. And while most of them said it was important and that programmers should do it more, when I asked them about what code they had read recently, very few of them had any great answers. Some of them had done some serious code reading as young hackers but almost no one seemed to have a regular habit of reading code. Knuth, the great synthesizer of computer science, does seem to read a lot of code and Brad Fitzpatrick was able to talk about several pieces of open source code that he had read just for the heck of it. But they were the exceptions.\n>\n> If that wasn’t enough, after I finished Coders I had a chance to interview Hal Abelson, the famous MIT professor and co-author of the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. The first time I talked to him I asked my usual question about reading code and he gave the standard answer—that it was important and we should do it more. But he too failed to name any code he had read recently other than code he was obliged to: reviewing co-workers’ code at Google where he was on sabbatical and grading student code at MIT. Later I asked him about this disconnect:\n>\n> [...]\n> > Abelson: Yeah. You’re right. But remember, a lot of times you crud up a program to make it finally work and do all of the things that you need it to do, so there’s a lot of extraneous stuff around there that isn’t the core idea.\n>>\n>> Seibel: So basically you’re saying that in the end, most code isn’t worth reading?\n>>\n>> Abelson: Or it’s built from an initial plan or some kind of pseudocode. A lot of the code in books, they have some very cleaned-up version that doesn’t do all the stuff it needs to make it work.",

Many of the senior+ engineer that I know have built their mental model of the codebase through their own experiences with implementing features and fixing bugs in that codebase. \n\nI see a lot of people who advocate for using LLMs in coding saying that it helps them automate the \"boring, low-level\" details of programming and helps them focus on the higher level architecture of the problem.

But working at that level of abstraction is **hard** even if you have the lower level knowledge of the codebase.

      "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI've been doing frontend development for about 9 years now, mostly building websites for the first 3 years (worked in digital agencies) and last 6 with intermittently building and maintaining public web applications at my in-house role at a blue-collar company. I was laid off in November 2025 due to restructuring after 6 years from this role, where I was the only frontend dev on a small marketing team, working fully remote. I live about a 1.5-2 hour commute from a couple of major tech hub. There aren't many jobs around me, for what I do, at all.\n\nMy work there was mostly incremental. Small features on existing web apps, CMS updates, and occasional larger projects building 0 to 1 frontend web apps in React. Whatever the business needed from a frontend perspective.\n\nI've never had to do take-home tests, coding challenges, or live coding interviews in my career. It was always a 1-hour discussion of my experience, some basic technical questions, and then an offer.\n\nSince being laid off, I've been applying to frontend roles, and I’ve been trying to break into full stack development since I see a lot of those (built a hefty side project and threw it on my GitHub - struggled through it, learned a ton of new things), but the interviews I’ve faced have been… very different:\n\n* Live coding challenges or HackerRank/HackerEarth tests that expect you to know everything by heart. I’ve always Googled or asked AI for help in my work, so this is completely new. I haven't seen any Leetcode.\n* Random, rapid-fire questions, especially on backend topics where my experience is limited or super advanced frontend topics I've never had to take into account during real-world work.\n\nI won't go through all of my interview experiences, but so far, I've been rejected by most of them - specifically after the HackerRank/HackerEarth/live-code portion. After applying to a senior frontend position, and having a live-code portion with a senior frontender, he point blank told me at the end that I should not be applying to senior roles. He also said some other insulting things. He could tell I was visibly tearing up. He apologized. I don't know if he's right, but it really hit me. I see so many senior roles, and it makes me think I'm not good enough for them based on my experience.\n\nI have two young kids. My days often start chaotic, which doesn’t help anxiety and uncertainty around job hunting. My kids are extremely stressful at their age (2 and 6), I'm also not sleeping well at all because of the 2 year old + life situation stress. \n\nI’m trying to stay positive, but I’m struggling with how to effectively prepare for these technical interviews, and how to practice for coding challenges/live coding without burning out. In the past, I would usually get a job within 3 weeks of applying, with interviews from about 50% of applications. Now it feels like 5%, and it's been over 2 months. So many rejections. The whole process is overwhelming.\n\nI had an emotional breakdown last Tuesday in our garage. I broke down at my parents twice in the past month as well. I am seriously, seriously mentally struggling. When my wife and kids leave, and I'm alone, I can barely muster up the strength to go down to my office and sit in front of my computer. It's becoming a place I hate.\n\nSometimes, I breakdown in front of my kids. They ask my wife, \"why is daddy crying\". I feel ashamed. I haven't engaged in any hobbies that I regularly did before the layoff - like play guitar, video games, consistently going to the gym. I don't see the colour in my life anymore.\n\nIf anyone has any practical strategies for passing coding challenges/live coding, in terms of ways I can practice in the afternoons, I’d really appreciate your advice. My current daily, Monday to Friday is:\n\n\\- Helping kids get out the door - always chaotic and stressful.  \n\\- Applying to jobs from 9am - 12pm.  \n\\- Building a React to do app over and over so it's memorized, because I don't know how else to prepare for live-code tests.\n\nMaybe in the afternoons I can practice, but I really just don't know what I should be doing, because every single test is different. I don't know what kind of test will be thrown at me. Any advice here would be very, very helpful. I wish things would go back to the way they were. Talk about my experienced, tech talk, then offer. Especially with a young family.\n\nI just want to understand how to bridge this gap and get back to doing the work I love without losing my mind. \n\nMy mental health is already in a downward spiral. If you could please be kind, I would really appreciate it.",

          "text": "Hey man, sorry you're going through this. It's a worry I have all the time as I'm the only earner in my family and have zero tolerance for risk. I also have young kids, and I get it man. I'm 90% out of my spoons for the day when I start my work in the morning.\n\nThe interview process is pretty insane for our industry, and it feels like every startup or established business  is after a \"rock star developer\" or seems to think they are Google. 10 stage interview process, \"quick\" take home projects, LeetCode challenges, meet the founders, cultural fit, meet HR for a stress test, reverse a LinkedList for the first time in 15 years, etc etc. It's insane to me - imagine asking a plumber with years of experience to do something like that?\n\nThat senior guy was a dick. He made a judgement about you based on a very limited duration of interaction with you, and reduced you to that one thing that you \"failed\" in his eyes. Did he see that you're able to learn? Did he understand that not everyone knows everything and the best hires tend to be people with good soft skills that have an interest in learning and fitting into the team? Did he at least explain his reasoning, and talk the problem through *with* you? ie. how the real world works when you're peer programming? Sounds like he gave you some insight to what it's like working there.\n\n>I see so many senior roles, and it makes me think I'm not good enough for them based on my experience.\n\nJust want to address this too. Always keep in mind that they're asking for 150% of what they want in the role, but will settle on 75%. You have skills, and interviews are a two-way process. You're checking to see if they're a good fit for you as well.\n\nIt's tough out there, and hard to stay positive some days. Just remember it's OK to call a shitty situation a shitty situation - and be kind to yourself! You know more than you think you do, and you managed to stay employed for 6 whole years until the bottom line of the company forced a restructure. I've been in places where people didn't last a month lol.\n\nHave you contacted a recruiter? That's usually your best bet, they are good at working on your behalf and finding vacancies that suit your profile. Good hunting!",

That rarely brings the best out of a candidate.  \n\n- Interviewing is a skill that takes time to develop.

Any area that raises your suspicion, you can just dig deeper. This was 90% of the interview for me. This still sucks for people too nervous to talk, but i did everything i could to accommodate nervous folks. As i'm definitely one too. Interviews are a nightmare.\n\nThis doesn't tell you if they can actually build things, but personally i find the ability to build follows closely behind API knowledge (eg the stdlib of your lang, etc).\n\nUltimately this worked for ~50+ devs, so much so that we were acquired and now i assume i don't have this ability.

          "text": "Hey man I’m going through an incredibly similar situation to you right now. I wanted to comment on here to encourage you and let you know you aren’t alone in this. The industry is going through a bunch of turmoil and it’s causing us to have to reapproach how we look at our careers. The way we prep for interviews now is vastly different and it’s intimidating and frankly a bit scary because it feels like everything is on the line. I know you know technical content and you have the ability to do the job. What’s challenging you right now is the mental blocks and the psyching yourself out based around things out of your control. it’s the case where entering these interviews a lot of the content you have in your head can go out the window due to the stress. I highly encourage you to get back on a routine where you reduce the stress. This can include talking to someone, working out (research has shown a daily workout routine does just as much for stress reduction as attending therapy), taking a walk for 30 mins with the kids in the morning. It’s really really important you get that under control first, especially for your kids. You are their everything. And they are the most important thing. The job cycles will come and go. You once had the passion for it and maybe you can rediscover it in some way.\n\nOnce you have a bit of a self care routine down, start slowly reintroducing studying, a couple hours a day max to start. This will help immensely for getting through these coding rounds. The best way I learn is taking an accepted solution, walking through it out loud with how I understand it, watch the explanation and algorithm videos, try to write it out myself in a slightly different way with my own style. Once I get comfortable with enough of these I then tackle similar problems, leetcode lets you know which problems are similar enough. You can’t all or nothing this though as you’ll burn out really quickly. You’re clearly doing something right enough to MAKE it to these coding rounds. You’ll be able to close on one of them once you get your confidence back. There are tons of discord groups you can join in this space as well where you can ask questions and find study partners.\n\nI wish you all the luck in the world. What you’re doing is immensely important and also difficult. I have two young children of my own. We will power through this and land a position soon.",

I had a lot of days I couldn’t muster the energy to prep. It took me about 6 months to find a job again and even with it now it’s not a job I want, but it pays and I’m coding. \n\nYour first priority is making sure your family’s boat isn’t sinking. Enough savings and income and unemployment to keep the house/rent paid, lights/heat on, and health insurance/childcare. \n\nIf you can’t make those then cut back as hard as you can until you can, or find contingencies. When I was unemployed I briefly worked at my daughter’s daycare because they gave us a discount on the cost. It helped stem the tide of not having work and gave me breathing room. \n\nNext, time to get competitive. Learn to do leetcode, read about system design, and study. Make it like weight lifting reps. 3 reps of leetcode (a set) per day, as much from memory as you can. Write it down, recall it from memory. Study “how to memorize things” and keep at it. \n\nThe prep will suck. I’m in it now too. The interviews will suck more, they’ll rob you of your confidence. But know that any of those interviewers see you and think “there but for the grace of God go I”, none of us are safe and it’s scary. \n\nHang tough, ask for help. DM if you need it. ",

          "text": "As pretty much everyone else said.. you are far from alone. I am 25+ years experience.. out of work for 2 years now. I've not been going hard core because a) I have ALWAYS sucked at leet code.. lucky to have gotten jobs through contacts that mostly got me bypassed from leetcode rounds. But this time around.. there are easily 1000x more developers competing for same roles, and most are in their 20s to 30s.. I am in my 50s. While I am luckily not gray hair so I dont quite look in my 50s.. I am still clearly older. I've had to redo my resume to remove 15 years of history off of it to have a shot at anything because I'd wager 1 in 1000 older devs get past the AI screen for a HR call. NOBODY wants older devs. 20 years ago.. a 45+ year old dev was a Godsend. Someone with insane knowledge, could lead a team, calm, make decisions, etc. TODAY.. nope. They want 25 to 30 year olds with 3 to 5 years doing interviews, and anyone past about 40 except in the rare case they have no interest in hiring.\n\nYou add AI to the mix and all the hype its gotten this past year especially.. with plethora of company's saying they wont hire junior to mid level engineers any more due to AI tools good enough to do the work they did.. and then you add the insane amounts of outsourcing which should be fucking illegal giving away American jobs for cheap labor.. and well.. you have the perfect storm of the absolute worse our industry has seen by far. Many will argue 2008 was as bad if not worse. Nope.. not even close. But I'll save that argument for another thread/time.\n\nMy only saving grace is my kids are 21+ years old even though 2 still live at home and I pay for them.. while being unemployed. I am gearing up for a divorce too.. so shit sucks badly right now.\n\nMy only hope is this last 6 months or so I doubled down on AI tooling to try to learn how to use it to build something that I think the industry still has room for. No clue if it will pan out but its my last attempt in this tech field. If this doesn't work out.. its literally $20 an hour jobs (or less) and finding middle aged room mates who keep to themselves and hopefully can afford a rental room to live in. No clue what else to do. Going from 250K + benefits to 0 income and no benefits.. to possibly a 40K job with probably no benefits is insane in your 50s.. supposed to get better, not worse. But this market, esp in the US but I understand its world wide.. is awful. For millions. The numbers are way off on those not working or struggling too. 4.3% my ass. It's WAY more than that. I'd argue a solid 10% to 15% of the population is out of work or unable to find work that pays the bills.. let alone saving for retirement. \n\nSo one thing I'd suggest.. while you're off.. pick up Golang for back end. It's the easiest language to learn, its used more and more for APIs, database work, microservices and back end stuff. Sure typescript is there too if you want to use that, but having a 2nd language, esp one you can learn in a week shows you are learning and not sitting around. At least somewhat. Start some projects.. like building a back end that provides APIs and build a front end GUI that calls those APIs. add in some go-migrate for db migration stuff to show you can migrate DB changes to the schemas, etc. BUT USE AI! If you have the means, pay for claude code.. $100 a month gets you a pretty good amount of weekly usable AI stuff, and learn how to prompt it, use guardrails, etc. It's a valuable tool to learn and today more than ever you're likely going to need it for most jobs soon.\n\nI wish you the best.",

It takes a toll on your physical health too. Crying is okay. Being upset is okay. Your wife should be supporting you through this and I’m hoping she is. I don’t want to get too into the personal stuff but I’ll leave it at that. \n\nYour skills. That you’re just building the same react app suggests that you might be a frontender who got in through the design layer of web development (pure html, css, with some light js) and might be lacking CS skills or background. Maybe you’re not familiar with backend concepts? You can be a very successful front end engineer but most of them have a good understanding of backend concepts and operate at the “back of the frontend”. Google “the great frontend divide” and you’ll find some good things there. The days of frontend and backend devs slinging code over the wall to each other is over in many Saas companies. \n\nThat could be why the interviewer said you weren’t senior. It’s not just about learning a framework or library. I don’t say this to discourage you but so you don’t use React (or Vue or PizzaKebab.js) as a lifeboat. That way leads to more layoffs. \n\nIf you’re floundering at the coding interview, consider investing in one of those courses that teach you how to pass leetcode and live frontend coding interviews. They walk through the solutions in videos and teach you about the various complexities that interviewers check for. You don’t need to become an expert in backend or algorithms but you just need to understand enough to perform for the interview. I don’t recommend just banging your head against leetcode sites alone if you aren’t able to learn it on your own without guidance. With the stress you’re under, it’s normal. \n\nMost companies just run through the same exercises honestly. Make this loop efficient. Do something cute with a string. You’ll see patterns emerge and will be able to pick them up. \n\nI’ve written a lot but hope it helps and things pick up for you.",

I can imagine how you feel, I work as a frontend software engineer myself and even tho I am currently employed, I try to stay interview ready which can be very overwhelming. \n\nThis is the interview process followed at my company when we are interviewing for developers. Please note: the level of knowledge expertise that's expected from a candidate depends on if they are applying for a junior, intermediate or senior level role. \n\n- coding portion (either pair programming but with most algorithmic questions to understand the problem solving ability of a candidate along with their knowledge or JavaScript/typescript). We also give candidates an option for take home assignment even though we know that candidates can ask AI to do the entire thing, during the interview it can be pretty easy to guess if the candidate knows their stuff. \n- theoretical questions portion: for FE engineering roles we expect candidates to be knowledgeable about our tech stack which is react, typescript, state management libraries like redux, CSS/styling questions, some basic CI/CD and security stuff like different between cookies vs. sessions. \n\nThis is my personal plan for staying interview ready (I say personal, because different things can work for different people plus I am also assuming that you are proficient in JavaScript/typescript) but I am going off what we are expecting from potential developer candidates at my company: \n\n1. Practice leetcode questions (you can start from the easy ones and work your way up, I think for me - doing leetcode questions is more about exercising the problem solving muscles of my brain).. also note: I think because of AI - hiring managers know that working code can be generated very quickly so now it's more about the developer having the knowledge and intuition if the AI generated code is good enough/has the correct structure and fits the codebase.. so in an interview  that's what they could be trying to gauge. \n2. Depending on the tech stack of the positions you are applying for - create a small working applications which you can showcase during an interview and also add to your GitHub.. basically building a portfolio that you can add to your resume. For example, if you are applying for react focused roles - then you can perhaps build an react application with MERN architecture. And if you want to apply for full stack roles - then you can add a backend with Python  to the same application? I tend to leverage the help of AI for learning these things but I make sure that I fully understand the code AI is producing.. to do this I look at the actual documentation, still leverage stackoverflow/forums etc. \n3. Get good at answering technical questions and at technical discussions about the stack so you can practice that: for example, practice some theoretical questions about the framework, JavaScript, typescript, CI/CD, security, styling, data structures, system design and architecture etc. \n4. Highly recommended: networking. I think in this job market, it's unfortunately easiest to get a job if you get it through connections (former coworkers, folks you know on LinkedIn, meetups, networking events etc). \n\nI hope this helps and you land something soon - good luck!!",

Grinding the same React app over and over again doesn’t seem like a very productive way to prepare. Leetcode, systems architecture tutorials on YouTube, books, etc are your best friend.

These interviews are pretty bad at assessing your actual ability as a programmer most of the time so I wouldn’t be too concerned with improving as a programmer and more concerned with learning to cheese interviews.\n\n3. I would consider diversifying the types of roles you are applying to as much as possible. I spent the first couple years of my career in consulting and that opened my eyes to a wide variety of roles that are outside of the typical “engineer” or “developer” stuff most people apply to. Consultant roles are a good place to start, sometimes companies title roles as “solutions architect” etc. IMO I think for better or worse the industry is changing as AI tooling improves and management expectations will morph around that. The sooner you can market yourself as a problem-solver or people manager or whatever (besides just a guy who writes good code) the better off you’ll be long term.\n\nAlso, make sure you’re passing the vibe check… I understand things are wildly stressful for you right now but don’t let that leak into your interviews. It’s just as important to come off as someone who is easy to work with as it is to come off as competent. I’ve interviewed a good amount of people and it’s soooo much easier to advocate for someone who has a good energy about them.",

If you don't have to take care of your kids all day, and have long stretches of hours, honestly I think you're golden. You have nothing to worry about: only the grind is ahead of you. Budget for a month and after 30 days you should be in a MUCH sharper posture for interviewing.\n\nIn between doing these exercises, read the react documentation, watch videos doing deep dives on react and frontend SWE (there are plenty on youtube), and also on weekends make small apps like the TODO you mentioned.\n\nHave the discipline to do this, and I'm willing to wager you'll pass a Senior Frontend technical within 30-60 days of consistent practice.\n\nYou already have the foundation, you were just in a job that didn't push you to your limits often. The good news is you can crunch that. Frontend SWE isn't *that* hard, and can be learned quickly.\n\nFor your stories/behaviorals/STAR questions, you might have to fudge the truth a little bit here. Make your work sound meatier and more difficult than it was. It is what it is.\n\nIn terms of backend: be honest about your limited experience here, but you can always study hellointerview system design and study REST and make small CRUD apps. A small CRUD app that can be made in a weekend, combined with studying, would teach you most of the fundamentals you need to know to be considered a \"full stack\" engineer. The advanced system design requires more effort and time, but all the resources are on hello interview and youtube.\n\nGood luck man. You're not alone, this industry is topsy-turvy right now.",

I’m sure others in the thread will give you practical advice on how to practice, build a side project, etc. \n\nI want to say, the situation you’re in is VERY HARD. The feelings you are feeling are OKAY to feel. You are not less than, you are not a bad engineer, you WILL get through this. \n\nWhen you feel yourself beginning to spiral, go for a walk and don’t stop until you feel better. Yes, your brain will tell you to not waste time and continue studying. Still take the walk. When you are alone, journal. Write out every single thing that you feel, until your mind is empty. Yes your brain will tell you it’s a waste of time. Still do it. When you feel like crying, let it out. It doesn’t mean you aren’t strong or capable, it means you are human. Let the tears flow. \n\nGetting the next job is unfortunately a numbers game and highly subjective. Stay focused, Keep MOVING, and things WILL get better ✊🏽",

That interviewer who told you so bluntly was insensitive, but unfortunately they were not wrong...\n\nI'm not trying to hurt you - I'm trying to tell you the truth. You may have been given a senior title at your last job, but you need to understand that titles are not in any way consistent between companies and/or industries.\n\n> My work there was mostly incremental. Small features on existing web apps, CMS updates, and occasional larger projects building 0 to 1 frontend web apps in React. Whatever the business needed from a frontend perspective.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry OP, but this is in no way senior-level work at any software product company or even agency in 2026. The needs of the company you worked for were fairly rudimentary, and so that's where your skill level is at. Further, you ended up specializing pretty narrowly, and if you're going to specialize, the expectation from companies is going to be a higher level of mastery in that specialization which you don't seem to have. So your skills lack both breadth and depth - neither of which meet the bar for a senior role.\n\nIf you're going to land a job, you really need to move past your self-pity and sob story about your family. I understand it's real for you, but it's irrelevant when it comes to your job search. You spent most of the content in your original post seeking validation that it's the companies that are the problem instead of accepting any accountability.\n\nIf you're actually going to do right by your family, wallowing in self-pity definitely isn't going to get you there. You need to accept the fact that you're starting from basically scratch. Swallow your pride and start applying for more junior or mid level roles. The goal at the moment is to get a job.\n\nAgain, please accept this feedback in the good faith nature that it's intended in. I'm trying to help, not hurt.",

It's fucking hard out there, and I speak as someone with fifteen years' experience who's just spent four months out of work looking for a contract gig.  It's not just *literally* cold out there.  I suspect it's because the whole AI thing has had companies second-guessing whether they *need* to hire people or not.  It seems to be thawing a little since late November, but nowhere near where it was.\n\nSecond: tech tests suck.  I don't know anyone who likes them, and to be honest with you most places that have competent leadership realize that they're not representative.  The best gigs I've had have been for people who know within forty minutes of casual conversation whether you know your stuff or not.  But they're designed so that nobody should get 100% on them; it's not a pass/fail thing - but if one of the candidates *does* know linux command line and how to set up an AWS infrastructure then they absolutely want to know that and judge appropriately.\n\nWhat I will say is that a lot of companies can be absolute pieces of eight about it.  In the past I've been negged about my abilities just so I'd consider a lower paid job.  I've been told I shouldn't be applying for a senior position.  (For context, I didn't just declare myself to be senior; an employer spontaneously told me that's what I should be calling myself given my skillset).  Some people - not all techies or even a majority, but the field does seem to attract them - just enjoy dicking on other people to elevate their own self esteem.\n\nWhat I suggest, in the current atmosphere, isn't training, or coding exercises, or qualifications; there will always be a field that they want that you chose not to learn in favour of something else, they'll always have a tech test from a different website.  Just do what interests you, what takes your fancy - because that will help keep your head up, and what you want is a job in a field you're interested in, right?  And adjust your attitude instead.\n\nYou're a goddamned experienced developer with nearly a decade under your belt in a field where they're asking for minimum three years to call yourself \"senior\".  That's not just coding knowledge, that's industry knowledge and experience of how to get shit done.  These incompetent snots are throwing pointless tests underfoot.  That's not something to feel defensive about, that's something to get angry about because a competent recruiter would be asking you, to your face, \"In Vue, do you prefer the options API or the composition API?\" so you can wax lyrical about the advantages of readability and explicit vs implicit behaviour definition.  Or whatever.  (Do not focus learning Vue, in my experience there's more React about, you're on the right track there).\n\nAlso, one tip that I'm going to PM you because if I post it here it might spoil it.",

In this hypothetical scenario you probably would sound relatively casual or more confident whereas in the current mental state you probably sound less confident and for lack of a better word, more desperate. I think not many people would like to hear that tone in a formal setting.\n\nBased on the above hypothesis/theory, I’d suggest the following \n1.

      "text": "EDIT: As I posted this, I received the message from management that we are fully embracing Cursor from 2026 onward and are mandated to be AI-first. I'm leaving.  \n  \nI know any tool should do the job and the editor you use shouldn't affect your ability to do your tasks as much, but I'm doing this full time and it's becoming a daily inconvenience.\n\nI'm mandated to use VS code and Sourcetree. Both great tools, but *I* *live* inside the shell. Their workflow is good, but not for me. I have asked for a reason and they gave the following:\n\n\\- They want to prevent mistakes from happening --> So instead of responsibility, they introduced a seatbelt  \n\\- They want me to be able to help others, as well as have them help me. If I use different tools, that becomes harder --> We can just open GitLab, or, I don't know, open a different editor when someone is looking at my screen :)\n\nI've already addressed this multiple times and it starts to gnaw at me. I proposed the idea of instead of mandating a tool, mandating key features of said tool. For example, instead of \"You should use VSCode\", they could say \"You should use an editor with LSP support and a linter as well as basic highlighting features\". They then told me that they don't feel like managing multiple types of software and they don't want everyone to download whatever they feel like (I should mention, we are concerned with information security and therefore comply to ISO/IEC 27001 standard.)\n\nI seem to be alone in this, because I'm the only dev at my workplace that seems to have a problem with this. This makes it very hard to have a credible opinion. Most other devs already used VS code along with Sourcetree (or Fork) and others have started their careers at this place with said tools.\n\nI feels like I'm at a dead end with this. I'm not planning to leave for this, but the fact that we're being micro managed like this does give me the ick. Do you think it's feasible to try and convince management? And if so, what do you recommend?",

People aren't standard.  The implication is that they're not interested in getting the best you have to offer, they just want what you can give without tailoring your role to you because customizing your company laptop undermines the ability to pass it along to drone 53 and they pick up where you left off.  \n\nAnd again, I get why; they development to be a solid bedrock on which they can build.  They want it to be dependable engine so it can manage itself and they can make more interesting and profitable manoeuvres with marketing, and sales strategy.\n\nBut the thing is: as a developer, it sucks to be forgotten and ignored.

It does not have anything in common with an assembly line, and managers acting as if it does is not simply insulting, but deeply wrong.

It only takes one to bring in a new tool and cause security and compliance issues.\n\nWhat you can do is to talk to the top level engineers (Sr. Staff, principle) and ask for their opinion. If it was strictly a management decision, then you can ask about the process they followed to make that decision. Who did they involve? What research was done? What happened to trigger this mandate?\n\nIt never hurts to ask for clarity.",

          "text": "You’re not wrong to feel the ick. What you’re reacting to isn’t Cursor or VS Code. It’s a shift in how trust and responsibility are being handled.\n\nMandating a tool instead of mandating outcomes is a common management move under uncertainty. It feels safer because it’s legible. “Everyone uses the same thing” is easier to reason about than “everyone understands what they’re doing.” But that safety is mostly cosmetic.\n\nA few hard truths that may help you decide how much energy to spend here:\n\nFirst, this isn’t really about editors. It’s about governability. Management is optimizing for predictability and supportability. Tool standardization lowers coordination cost and makes oversight feel simpler. That’s true even when there is no regulatory requirement driving it.\n\nIf there is a regulatory or compliance requirement, the mistake is the same one you already identified: confusing controls with brands. Standards almost never require a specific editor. They require capabilities, auditability, and accountability. Mandating a tool is an implementation shortcut, not a compliance necessity.\n\nSecond, they’re conflating guardrails with judgment. Seatbelts don’t replace drivers. Linters don’t replace understanding. “AI-first” doesn’t prevent mistakes. It changes where and how mistakes surface. If the organization can’t explain why a system behaves the way it does without pointing at a tool, they’ve traded responsibility for comfort.\n\nThird, you’re likely outnumbered because most people don’t feel the cost yet. Standard tools are usually a net positive for juniors and generalists. The friction shows up for people who are deeply fluent and already operate with strong internal discipline. That doesn’t make your concern invalid. It just makes it invisible to the majority.\n\nIf you try to convince management, don’t argue preference or philosophy. Argue failure modes.\n\nA productive framing sounds like:\n“I’m aligned with the goals: fewer incidents, better collaboration, and lower risk. My concern is that we’re treating tools as controls instead of requiring specific behaviors and capabilities. That works until something goes wrong, and then nobody can explain why.”\n\nThen offer concrete alternatives that still satisfy oversight needs:\n\t•\tDefine required capabilities, not brands.\n\t•\tDefine review, ownership, and rollback expectations explicitly.\n\t•\tAllow tool variance with a clear support boundary: if you choose a non-standard tool, you own first-line support.\n\t•\tMake AI usage explicit and reviewable, not assumed safe by default.\n\nThat last point matters. “AI-first” without clear expectations around review and ownership doesn’t reduce risk. It redistributes it. Speed without comprehension is deferred outage.\n\nNow the uncomfortable part.\n\nEven if you’re right, this may still be a losing argument. Some organizations choose uniformity over judgment on purpose. Not because they’re incompetent, but because they’re optimizing for scale, not craft. That’s a valid choice. It’s just not a neutral one.\n\nYou’re not unreasonable for pushing back. You’re also not obligated to stay if the direction continues toward tool-enforced conformity and away from judgment-based trust.\n\nThe craft was never meant to be duct tape and YAML. The craft is building systems that behave under pressure, and being able to explain why.\n\nIf that’s no longer what’s being rewarded, believe the signal.",

It’s _much_ easier to simply train everyone on a consistent set of tools, so that any developer can be productive on any project, and if there is investment in common infrastructure that impact is maximized because the support surface is minimized.\n\nAlso you’re not considering other issues:\n* Security and Compliance review. Every tool that touches the source code needs to be validated to ensure it’s not leaking your company’s IP or customer data. Particularly if you deal with GDPR stuff, you have to be *super careful* around compliance for any tool that might interact with any customer data. \n* Liability issues in the event of a defect. This is usually only relevant to safety critical software, but if it turns out a defect is introduced into the source due to a defect in the tool used to modify the source, this can open up the company to liability. Therefore all of the tools must be explicitly certified. Certifying tools is very expensive and time consuming. Your individual velocity is not worth that effort.\n\nIt’s fine to think a workplace isn’t for you if their workflow doesn’t suit your needs. That’s a mature decision to make. But there are a _lot_ of very good reasons a company, especially a large company where no single developer actually has that much impact in the end, may want to restrict the set of tools their employees use, even if those tools are “free” from a license standpoint.",

Relying exclusively on CI as your only line of defense for software quality is a poor choice. It certainly should make change *easier to validate*, but all testing has oracle issues. Plus, CI does nothing to validate your random editor/extension is not leaking your IP to a third party, or customer data. (To be clear, extensive CI is wonderful. “If CI passes, it ships to main” should be the goal for every org. The repo I work in day to day sweeps well over 80 permutations of compiler/C++ standard/OS/stdlib combinations, plus another 20 or so sanitizers and static analysis tools).\n\nIn addition, for safety critical software development, it’s not really an option, it’s *required* to qualify every single tool that could impact the bits that wind up executing on the safety critical system. For example, read [this](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/m/61793_CMR10-16.pdf ) paper from MathWorks on the process for ISO26262.

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m 28 and have been working for about 6.5 years since graduating university, all at the same company. Professionally, things are objectively going well: I’ve moved up to a senior role, a staff position is within reach, I like my team, enjoy the kinds of challenges we work on, and I’m paid well. I’m fully remote, have solid work–life balance, and can’t really complain on paper.\n\nThat said… lately I’ve been feeling increasingly disillusioned with tech, AI, and the broader industry. I’ve long had a sense that this kind of work isn’t especially meaningful to me, but for years I managed that feeling by focusing on travel, friends and family, hobbies, etc. I also volunteer and stay active in my local political scene, thinking that would help balance things out.\n\nRecently, though, I just feel tired. I’m not particularly motivated, and I don’t feel excited about “pushing the needle” anymore at my company or team. I do what's asked and not much more unless it'll assist my team. I took most of December off and had about three uninterrupted weeks, including some travel with my partner, and it felt *really* good. Coming back from that break has made me wonder whether a longer career break might help me realign, or at least force me to honestly ask whether this is what I want to be doing with my life.\n\nFinancially, I’m in a strong position — good income and a sizable safety net — but living in the SF Bay Area often feels like being stuck in a rat race where everyone is hyper-focused on portfolios, AI agents, optimization, etc., and that mindset just doesn’t resonate with me anymore.\n\nI’m wondering if it’s worth taking a real break: traveling for a while, stepping away from work entirely, or doing something different for a bit. I could also work remotely from abroad, but I’m not sure if that would actually solve anything or just kick the can down the road.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar place — especially people who took a break (or didn’t) and how it worked out for them. Part of me is fearful that leaving this opportunity will mean it'll be very difficult to get back in... I'm not sure what to do, I'm at a new crossroads at this point in my life. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

In addition for the third team, there was one page that had a good idea but they couldn't figure out how to present in a way clients understood.  The design that page eventually settled on?  Almost identical to what I'd proposed months earlier, which no one acknowledged or seemed to even remember.\n\nI ended up asking to move to the maintenance team, which was surprising and confusing to my manager.  We were apparently putting new hires instead of experienced people on that team, so they didn't really get why I wanted to go there.  I had a suspicion about how they worked that ended up being right, and ended up liking it so much more:  No product owners, the developers talked directly to the internal people that used the products they maintained, so we managed to avoid busywork and everything we did had direct visible impact.  Being maintenance instead of development meant there wasn't very much business-requested development, and as long as there wasn't a fire to put out we could work on whatever general improvements we wanted.\n\nOver the past year there's been a restructuring so this team is turning into a development team, but we still don't have any sort of Product Owner so it's still mostly team-driven in a way other teams aren't.  It's been almost as long as the other three teams combined, and at least for me is still working out the way I'd hoped back then.",

Both breaks were the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nAfter dropping out, I took a month to literally just binge watch Netflix. Then I started boxing. Then I started working on some passion coding projects, to refind my love for coding. After \\~5 months, I started looking for a job. I ended up moving cities and spent the next \\~6 years at the same startup.\n\nAfter leaving the startup, I took another 9 months off. I followed a similar pattern as before. Do nothing for a few weeks, then I started to get serious into lifting weights. Then work on some passion projects to remind myself why I love coding. I still lift weights five days a week, so Im happy the habit stuck with me a year later.\n\nI ended up getting a few offers 6 months ago just from my network. Really didnt do any interviewing. I wasn't even looking because the market sucks right now. However, I maintained relationships with old coworkers. I tried to do a zoom call to catch up with one person a week. This paid dividends as most my network was employed and a referral is a generally a safer hire than a rando.\n\nIf you have the financial safety net, I say take the break. Use it to recharge. Use it to find or rekindle some passions. But don't forget to water your network. They might be the ones that hire you when you're ready to go back.\n\nPS, it was quite scary to leave my last gig knowing I was gonna take time off. But I felt nothing but relief at the end of my last day of work. 10/10 would recommend.",

The last two years have led to what is now an insufferable culture. Every single OKR involves AI. We’re being spammed every day across Teams Channels with posts from senior leaders with AI propaganda. It’s being asked to be implemented into products where it makes no sense at all. All of our learning workshops and our budget has gone towards AI. They’ve openly stated that our biggest problem is the bottleneck of code reviews and are looking to automate that.\n\nI’ve grown so bitter towards it mainly because it feels like we’ve entered the age of anti-intellectualism. We’re now apparently ecstatic that there’s no critical thinking required anymore. Hard-earned skills and knowledge are being democratized to people who quite frankly haven’t earned them. \n\nThis hurts because I’m a very driven person. I taught myself to become a software engineer without a degree. It took three years of nights and weekends. Been an engineer for another 3-4 after that. I’m constantly teaching myself new languages, libraries, and frameworks outside of work to expand my stack. And currently it feels so demoralizing and demotivating to continue learning when all companies now care about are how fast we can get LLMs to write our code. \n\nAll of that to say, are any of you working in an industry where this isn’t being shoved down your throat? Curious if this is just a finance / tech thing or if it’s absolutely everywhere?",

They nail on features, and in a lot of cases, this'll be onto a codebase no living soul has seen.  Pure black box.\n\n* No plan survives first contact with the enemy.  On release of the platform, they try to pivot based on customer uptake and feedback.  AI refactors AI code, building crud on crud.  The longer this goes on, the harder it hits when they have to bring in real coders for a rewrite.\n\n* From the perspective of investors, these are investments that *appeared to have solid foundations*, evaporating into nothing, suddenly needing massive investment to get back to where they were six months ago.  Suddenly, \"AI\" on the pitch deck goes down like suggesting skyscrapers in sinkhole country.\n\nIt's going to take one or two high profile failures, that's all.",

Every time there has been an innovation it has traded off control for leverage. When C happened we delegated control of specific memory registers to the compiler for more leverage (you can now write once and run on any machine for eg). When Java happened we handed off control of memory management. With SQL you gave up exact imperative style instructions and controlling how to find your data for more expressibility. Now with AI it's a similar trade-off, you're giving up deterministic coding and the granularity of control associated with that to be able to express yourself in natural language which can potentially scale a lot better. It's still a bet at this stage, but it seems to be in line with how progress happens in this field.

The team is working well and we're optimistic to get QA operational by the end of Q3'26. \n\nMy next big task is assembling a team to migrate the stored procedure nightmare that basically runs the entire company. There's 4 or 5 databases each with \\~500 stored procedures running on a single Microsoft SQL instance. As you can imagine, costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers. \n\nThe system is slightly decoupled, HTTP requests ping back and forth between 3 main components, and there's an in-house ORM orchestrating all of the magic. There's nothing inherently wrong with the ORM, and I'd like to keep it place, but it is responsible for calling all the stored procedures.  \n\nThe final component/layer is responsible for receiving the HTTP requests and executing the query/insert/stored procedure (It's basically SQL over HTTP, the payload contains the statement to be executed). \n\n  \nWhile some of the functions are appropriately locked in the database, a very large percentage of them would be simplified as code. This would remove load from the database, expand the pool of developers that are able to work on them, and sweet sweet unit testing.\n\nI'm thinking of \"intercepting\" the stored procedure requests, and more-or-less building a switch statement/dictionary with feature flags (procedure, tenant, percentage) that would call native code opposed to the stored proc.  \n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with this?\n\n  \n",

This gets a bit tricky with mutable state paths, but you can work out how to handle those on an individual basis.\n\nOnce you have enough runs where there is no differential in outputs for both paths (stored proc & code), you have a *bit* more certainty that you can switch over. As a bonus: if you collect the input/outputs for each run, you now have a solid compendium of data to derive your first tests from :)",

I have had many cases where I rewrote PGSQL queries and functions that drastically / exponentially improved efficiency of operations. \n\nIn many cases the DB outperforms app code when written properly because it has way lower IO overhead and can send back the minimal amount of precomputed data. It also has the advantage that you can configure built in materialized caches in addition to its own integrated caches without having to make your app deal with caching BS itself. ",

If it is important, then I would try to determine what the ideal state of the system would be, and then move iteratively towards that solution. If it is not important to improve the performance, and moving to the cloud is the primary goal, then I would try to avoid making any changes to the stored procedures unless necessary. You might see some significant performance improvements if you just optimize the SQL in the existing stored procedures.\n\nRegarding the solution you proposed...IMO the idea of a \"SQL over HTTP\" service sounds like an unnecessary abstraction in the first place. The database itself is SQL over HTTP -- why do you need an additional layer? Furthermore, having the SQL over HTTP service rewrite the queries sounds extremely confusing and error-prone. It's not hard to imagine a situation in which the service breaks a query by rewriting it incorrectly, and then the upstream clients can't figure out why it's not working because they sent the correct SQL to the downstream service.",

How about you let me write you 50 lines of t-sql, put it in a stored proc, and your orm calls that proc instead? Oh, you can't because your software architecture does not support that for what ever reason.... Ok.... Have fun. No, throwing half a million in hardware and resources at the problem is NOT going to solve that.\n\nDon't be that black and white. Stored Procs can be a LOT better than ORM generated queries. CRUD stuff being piped trough Stored Procs, cause it has to be a Stored Proc.... well... thats not good. There is a sensible middle ground thou. Besides, while it would suck to work with, Insert new row, update single row, select single row, delete single row..... piping that through a stored proc, will not consume messurable more resources than doing it with adhoc queries generated by an ORM. I challenge the internet to provide execution plans to me.\n\nAnyway, why do you think, stored procedures are the reason \"costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers\" ?\n\nI guess, they implemented the middleware in SQL, but that is giving you a lot of credit without any real stated reasoning there.",

          "text": "Let's get back to basics: Are you sure that the stored procedures are the performance problem?\n\nStored procedures aren't imbued with any intrinsic performance detriments that are - in and of themselves - going to compromise your workload.\n\nOn the contrary, well-written stored procedures tend to perform better in a lot of scenarios.\n\nFor example: Suppose you have a transaction comprising two statements, where the result set (comprising an arbitrary number of rows) of the first statement informs the second statement.\n\nIf you were to write the equivalent in application-tier code, the results from the first statement would need to traverse the network so that the application-tier code could then run the second statement. Locks end up being held longer, increasing the occurrence of blocking - thus reducing concurrency, and increasing latencies - in a busy enough database, because SQL Server needs to wait on the client (the application-tier code) to consume the first result set, then run the second query, and ultimately commit the transaction. There are of course other factors such as the use of RCSI (read committed snapshot isolation) which complicate the matter, but you can probably see what I'm driving at.\n\nIf the application-tier code is egregious enough (e.g.: it loops through each row received and, in each iteration, does something relatively slow like appending data to a file or making a HTTP request over the network to another service) then the likelihood of blocking other concurrent database queries is very high.\n\nOn the other hand, no such network traversal would happen if the transaction comprising the two statements happens within a stored procedure.\n\nBut moving on.\n\nSQL Server is a sophisticated piece of software in which ultimately everything boils down to queueing (i.e., 'wait stats' for the topic of interest) and sharing. It's essentially one big zero-sum game of contention management where any one query in the workload runs in contention with - and to the detriment of - the others (unless you're overprovisioned, in which case the server will be quite bored).\n\nThe challenges are manifold. You need to identify your actual bottleneck. It'll be CPU, memory, disk IO, or network IO - or perhaps something more exotic. Analysing your wait stats are the way to accomplish this.\n\nYou might well find that there are a small handful of problematic queries that are overwhelmingly responsible for dominating the server's resources (CPU, RAM, IO), and in doing so marginalising the rest of the workload. If your databases are multi-tenanted, it might even be more specific than that: It might be the case that it's a small number of queries run in context of a specific tenant's data (i.e., perhaps you have 99th percentile tenants who absolutely dwarf all of your other tenants in terms of how many rows of data they have).\n\nYou might well find that some well-meaning developer has written a query that uses a TVF (table-valued function), and that this TVF is running hundreds or thousands of times per second (or worse). It's unfortunate, but a lot of developers fall into the trap of trying to modularise T-SQL code as they would C# code or Java code due to ideals like DRY (don't repeat yourself). But doing so in T-SQL can oftentimes compromise the query planner's ability to produce performant query plans.\n\nYou also need to consider the prospect that known challenges in SQL Server - such as parameter sniffing, or inaccurate estimates - are introducing inconsistency in your workloads. Perhaps queries are sometimes fast and sometimes slow depending on the order in which queries are executed and for which parameters (which might lead to a query plan cached for 'small' volumes of data being applied for 'large' volumes of data, or vice versa).\n\nThere is a whole body of knowledge - performance tuning - which is far too extensive to cover in a single Reddit comment.\n\nAnyway, suffice it to say that my gut feeling is that if you make a concerted effort to understand your current performance characteristics, you might find that a small amount of index or query tuning can actually change your fortunes and get you to a much happier place.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to take what amounts to presumably years of accumulated intellectual property and essentially dispose of it, which might itself take years of effort.\n\nIf these 2000 to 2500 stored procedures are even moderately complex, what you're describing is tantamount to a rewrite. As fun as it is to daydream about 'getting it right', these efforts tend to burn the political capital of those who pursue them and - frankly - can cripple otherwise healthy businesses (because the rewrites aren't without cost - they divert effort from other initiatives).\n\nI sympathise with the remarks about testability, but I'd put it to you that T-SQL isn't inherently untestable. There's an actual unit test library out there - tSQLt - if you fancy that. But you could just as easily write bespoke test scripts that establish a baseline (i.e., schema and data content) and then assert a number of preconditions and postconditions with respect to a procedure executed under test.\n\nI also sympathise with the view that SQL code is not 'democratised', as it were. I'm a Data Reliability Engineer, and I spend a lot of time helping engineers in product teams with the T-SQL and database aspects of their systems because - as you imply - the pool of application developers who are adept at working closely with databases is quite small (it's a niche area, and many developers are quite avoidant when it comes to working with complicated SQL).\n\nBut the main reason - I think - for an eagerness to avoid stored procedures is that they're simply out of fashion, and the software development industry is very fashion-driven.\n\nI'm not saying that's the case here, but I do think that - more often than not - it really does boil down to them being unsexy and unfashionable.",

So when data is changed it's easy to track who did it and when, as well as easy to revert.\n\n4) Destroying items in the database doesn't really delete (usually).

In theory, high enough fanout of read traffic could also cause production issues, but we didn’t have a lot of work of that sort. I took over both projects that could trigger these problems, I didn’t go out of my way to advertise that the whole CD pipeline could be run from a dev machine using a service account I had Ops set up for it.\n\nWhen I took over the project, it was causing alerts and open circuit breakers in production if you ran it at during peak traffic, or while someone else was running a batch process. By the time I was done the warnings page said, “check if there’s an active incident happening and don’t run it” which really could be used to describe any CD task. \n\nI broke a few eggs in the process, but I only worked on it when I was in the on call rotation so I could own or dismiss any alerts that fired. And I made one of them run >3x faster and the other 20x faster while also making them behave. \n\nI’m also of the minority opinion that every process run by CD should also be able to be run by individuals in case your build servers are down, which did happen once there. They should have a run book, only be run by a pair of very senior developers, and only with a quorum of engineers assenting to the operation. Which is to say you should be able to fake every step of CD in a war room if everything has gone to hell in a hand basket. War Rooms, in any mature org, are the confluence of two errors working together to take out production. In a very mature org, that can grow to three. And one of those three can be Atlassian or GitHub shitting the bed. \n\nAs a side benefit, that sort of process transparency makes it easier for new engineers to suggest improvements to the process. Which can be opaque especially in Bamboo, which loves Information Hiding, which is an unconscionable behavior in CI/CD. Bamboo is the devil.\n\nEdit to add: one of the very first things I did with the batch processing is change the user agent so people could figure out that an own goal was going on and who to ping about it. Previously it looked like one of our production services due to using the same service discovery library and that’s a no-no.",

Anyway ...\n\nWhat would anti-AI mean exactly and why would doing it mean you get huge upside because everyone ends up crashing and burning ? Why would everyone else crash and burn in the first place ? It's not black and white, 0 and 1. It's not don't use AI at all or go balls deep. There are various degrees of AI integration into your processes and products and not everyone is doing the same thing. There are checks and balances - internal QA, customer feedback, market share changes, ... - that will tell companies to reconsider way before they have a chance to crash (at least the sane ones, not the 3 MBAs in a trench coat ones - but those were doomed to fail anyway).\n\nCase in point.\n\nI work for a decently sized multinational. Software is an essential part of the service we provide to our customers. Due to the specifics of the industry we have to deal with sensitive data, and have quite strict SLAs. We cannot just go crazy and vibe code shit because it's the new hot thing. At the same time the data isn't super sensitive to the point we couldn't use AI due to strict security policies, and the management would very much like to see if the output of programmers could be improved through magic. So we move ahead, evaluate models, compare pricing between providers, decide which ones to keep and which ones to cut, etc. We encourage people to run internal experiments, share the results. We integrate external models where it makes sense. We track spending and reevaluate.\n\nI suspect the reality is that a large portion of the landscape does the same. We're the boring ones you don't read about anywhere because there's nothing controversial or particularly smart in that. Just boring business as usual - try new stuff, see if the ROI is good, keep or throw away, repeat.",

      "text": "So fifteen to rwenty years ago some engineers provisioned some servers and then were allowed to retire without passing on administration roles or knowledge.  By the time we got management on the \"succession planning is important\" page the horses had already left the barn.\n\nOne of the servers hosts SVN source control used by all our projects as well as the license server for some embedded compilers we use, and the other runs a web app used nationwide.  Government work, I'm being vague not because it's secret but just to keep things at a non-details level.\n\nIn government work, teams do not own our own IT and maintaining it is a pure cost for the internal team or external company contracted to do that, and the benefit of what is running on it is not known or a fuck given by the ones hosting.  This year, that IT org was like, \"your servers are on a really old version of windows; we're gonna turn em off.  k thx bye.\"\n\nWe had to beg for extensions.  Ironically I had been trying to find out where those servers were physically located and who pays their electric bill for several years, but somehow my attempts to find someone who could tell me that never connected with the attempts of the people where the servers lived to find out who depends on what's on them.\n\nTo me, from the moment I understood the situation this was slowly escalating from concerning to this is an emergency, but like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Many other engineers I work with are either not programmers or embedded programmers who came up pre-internet or at least pre-Github, and not in the web tech or servers world.\n\nAnyway on the plus side I haven't gotten push back against moving the repos to Git (our agency has an internal hosted git provider), but on the other hand I have gotten a strange lack of reaction at all.  I have at least gotten management carte blanche now to spend my own time on making this migration happen, but I have asked for management support in getting affected engineers to devote some time to telling me how they want their projects to come through, and I never get a response.\n\nThe reason I need their responses is engineers were using the full flexibility of SVN both to create complex branching relationships and also misusing it out of ignorance, and one project in particular where every time they did a site they checked in another copy of the entire trunk and build folders (and trunk itself is GBs) produces a repo that really needs to be carved up.  Basically they were (are) using SVN like a cross between a monorepo and a share drive.\n\nI and a colleague are over here busting ass to make a nearly-technically-impossible transition happen smoothly but when we find something we can't \"magic\" our way out of if we ask, \"do you want the repo in Git to end up like option A or like option, because we can't bring it through unchanged?\" none of the affected individuals bothers to respond.  Even when I send emails with high importance and all caps, \"ATTN: either you will lose records of 20 years of work if this migration goes wrong or at the very least if you do not respond I will have to pick for you and if you don't like what I picked it won't be changeable later\" - no one responds/cares/expresses an opinion.\n\nThis is strange right?  I'm not taking crazy pills?",

That said, the increased scope and expectations are well known internally.\n\nI think my main question is: is it normal to be expected to outperform peers and **first** demonstrate \"visible impact\" before moving to the next level, even when your day-to-day responsibilities already go beyond what other L4 engineers are doing?",

Decade of experience so less than many around here, but the only meaningful raises I've ever received are when I switched companies.\n\nStrangely enough, my current role (1.5 years) is Staff level and I am working through the promo to Principal side-by-side with my manager. Who knows if they actually follow through! \n\nI share this to emphasize:\n\n**My manager has a job description w/ a title, role description, specific responsibilities, etc of which we collaborated in order to create/define. We also have accompanied this with a timeline that we are actively moving through together while documenting the journey the entire way.**\n\nIf you don't have something akin to the above, I echo the sentiments expressed here to:\n\n- update your CV\n- start interview prep (LC, SD, etc)\n- begin interviewing\n\nWorst case: you have leverage when you land a few offers",

To be comfortable at CurrentLevel+1 you are expected to be able meet your CurrentLevel responsibilities without having it take up all your time. So if you're able to do CurrentLevel + 80% of CurrentLevel+1 for a year or so, you should have a good case for promo into CurrentLevel+1. \n\nThat being said, your manager should know when particularly time consuming responsibilities (eg crunch or oncall for CurrentLevel, or a bunch of allday meetings for CurrentLevel+1) get in the way for short periods of time. And if it's been 2-3 years of this as you say, either your manager's expectations of what you need to show don't align with reality, or they are stringing you along.

I build some sort of CRUD API, build out some frontend based on our designers figma mock ups using our internal UI libraries, figure out how to structure the schema to support the new data structure, do business logic with the data that got submitted, display the said data in an existing table, new table, whatever, rinse and repeat.\n\nI've been getting an itch that I'm not learning all too much so I want to start reading some books or take some external courses. It also doesn't help that I'm a self taught developer (Math major) so while I'm extremely happy that I'm kicking it in the \"big leagues\", I want to start challenging myself once again because it genuinely feels like everything I'm doing on a day to day basis are things that I taught myself via some random \"Full stack\" udemy course from 2020.\n\nSo with that said I wanted to ask you all the same question I've been wondering. What books or courses helped you on your journey to become a better developer? For what it's worth, I have the Udemy/Coursera subscriptions as well.\n\nMy initial thought was to read \"designing data-intensive applications\" but I heard that it's a thick book and a new volume is coming out because some info is dated. My next idea was to do Andrew Ngs machine leaning course and while I'd love to start learning some math and going into that rabbit hole, it really feels like a waste since I'll never get a job in that space and I'll never really use those skills again. Then finally, I landed on a course where I'll learn about Dev Ops (Docker, Kubernetes, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, etc) because that actually seems relevant if I were to ever do my own startup and dev ops is an area where I'm not knowledgeable (but tbh I'm not excited to learn about dev ops).\n\nAnyone want to share what books or courses that they genuinely found interesting apart from \"How to create a CRUD app\"?",

You’re still growing, but it doesn’t feel like growth because the problems aren’t stretching new muscles.\n\nDDIA is still worth reading even if some parts are dated. The value isn’t specific tech, it’s how it changes how you think about systems, tradeoffs, and failure modes. You don’t need to read it cover to cover either. Skimming chapters that map to things you actually touch can already sharpen your instincts.\n\nOne thing that helped me more than random courses was deliberately studying things adjacent to my job but not required by it. System design, distributed systems concepts, scalability tradeoffs, and even reading good postmortems. Those connect directly to senior level thinking without forcing you into a totally different domain like ML if you’re not going to use it.\n\nIf you ever want to stress test your understanding, practicing system design interviews is oddly effective even if you’re not actively interviewing. It forces you to reason end to end instead of living inside one service. I’ve used StealthCoder for that to keep structure when walking through designs, and it helped surface gaps I didn’t notice in day to day work.\n\nI’d avoid chasing courses just to feel productive. Pick things that change how you think about problems, not just add new tools. If you come away asking better questions during design reviews, that’s usually the sign it was worth it.",

      "text": "I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the \"tactical tornado\" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:\n\n>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.\n\n>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \\[...\\]\n\n>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.\n\nI do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.\n\nSince I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?\n\nOusterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:\n\n>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.\n\nWhen I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a \"strategic\" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",

We've got a few people going ham with Claude/GPT for coding and yeah, the code review sessions have gotten... interesting\n\n  \nThe main issue I've noticed is that when you're pumping out code at AI speed, there's this temptation to just rubber stamp whatever looks like it works. Like someone will generate a whole API endpoint in 30 seconds and suddenly we're reviewing 200 lines instead of the usual 50, and honestly it's harder to catch the architectural issues when you're drowning in generated boilerplate\n\n  \nI think the key is using AI more strategically - like for the grunt work after you've already figured out the design.

He suggests thinking of a few different ways to achieve the desired outcome and going with what you believe will lead to the lowest complexity and be the easiest to extend functionality to in the future. \n\nI didn't want to add this to the post because I didn't want to make it too long, but if someone is shifting all the cognitive load to the LLM or agent, it seems almost guaranteed that this process isn't happening. This is something I find concerning when thinking about the future that could come from this, but I don't know if anyone has worked in a place that has done this long enough to actually see negative repercussions, or if these concerns are realistic.",

Maybe the answer there is really in solidifying that process, defining human in the loop checkpoints, and getting an entire team on board with that. I definitely understand why engineers can’t be bothered holding the hand of an llm and would rather just do it themselves.",

Opus 4.5 is strong enough to one-shot 90% of plans. Otherwise I iterate back and forth with it. Sometimes I'll notice it deviated from the plan but actually found a better solution. I have commands set up to have the agent validate, check and commit the code.\n* I do a thorough self-review and open the PR.\n\nFrom my experience the most valuable part is the actual planning section, getting the business requirements and design right (code is not the bottleneck).

          "text": "> but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.\n\nSpeed of development is a contingent good, not universal good. Shipping fast can mean your company survives another day (common in early stage startups - taking on technical debt is an investment in speed and survival and is ideally done judiciously), or it means you can spend more time on architecture, or on user research, or whatever else. It can be good, but it can also be bad when optimizing only for shipping speed over correctness, readability (for an LLM or a human developer), and maintainability.\n\n> my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?\n\nNo, not really. It's not speed that affects that, but quality of the developer. If you're going to use these tools, you should be really good at detecting code smells, redirecting agents, and setting up guardrails to prevent the complexity in the future. The same thing you do when reading a teammate's code. You can also set up deterministic automatic tests, like a cyclometric complexity calculator, something I've used with human-only and augmented teams. They can be annoying but are very helpful.\n\n> When I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a \"strategic\" mindset at that level.\n\nI don't think it necessarily is impossible. I run a few projects with agents concurrently (necessary evil in my business) and it doesn't somehow make me unable to make or foresee architectural decisions. It does allow me to fail faster, though, and issues that I miss can be found and fixed much quicker since feedback cycles are so much shorter.\n\n> So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?\n\nYou should always be 'strategic.' That's the case whether you are not using an agent at all, using one just for rubber ducking or writing, or doing a full explore-plan-write-test loop, it just looks a bit different depending on what you're building, why you're building it (a simple planned out user story will look much different from a full feature or new project scaffolding), and it takes discernment and experience to do it effectively. Adding to that difficulty, we don't have established best practices yet, **everyone** is learning how to use these things while they change very rapidly, so there will be growing pains.",

You don't even need to run multiple instances of claude. You can use other models.\n\nBut the main premise and real world example is a GUARDIAN .md agent that runs a seperate process. One that has all the context of your coding conventions, example code, style guide, security guardrails.  \nTo reduce hallucinations, it executes a parallel process using your OWN tools. Your own linter, your own security scanner,etc. This runs in parallel to the main agent that you are throwing prompts to. But, it runs in the background of the 1st's agent's generated output. It is monitoring that output and flagging the first agent to stop with flags. When the 1st agent is flagged, with the stop command and stop exceptions, you can have a 3rd or 4th agent to verify those findings and reconcile the changes.\n\nIt is basically having an external auditor with a different opinion based on a different set of context.  \nI have different agents reading based on different AGENTs MD files like SECURITY\\_PROTOCOL . md, STYLE\\_CONVENTION . md, BOOTSTRAP . md , etc.. This keeps context windows small for each agent without overwhelming individual ones.  \n\n\nA real example is I do a lot of ES6 code. If the main agent deviates, it stops. My style guide enforces patterns like modules and seperation of domain of code. So my code is very DRY and readable. Without the secondary agents, CLAUDE would make 4,000 line files. With my agent, it makes 30 files all with proper imports/exports with a max of 60 lines. That is just an example. But it makes the code easy to read and easier to do digestable PR commits/reviews.\n\nMulti-agents is a MUST. Without it, it is a show stopper because LLM will use deprecated code libraries/dependencies/npm. Or they use the open source version when we have enterprise versions of packages with different featuresets. Hallucination is really not an issue when you have different models executing external tools versus letting one agent auto-pilot with no guard rails.\n\nSo when people say they do multi-agents, you have to examine their setup and tooling.",

          "text": "I feel quite the opposite - **your entire focus as a vibe coder is on the strategic part**. The tactical elements are handled by the agent, and your job is to manage the big picture. \n\nFor context, I have \"written\" about 30k lines of code and docs in one week, deployed it and it operates satisfactory as a proper demonstrator web app. The part that I didnt trust the agent with was authentication which needs to be added to complete it but overall, I am fairly happy with the state of the application, and it works great, never found a hiccup.\n\nI have had a very solid strategy doc up front with at least 100 points and prompted the LLMs point by point, with tests, validations and regression testing checkpoints. Keep in mind I started with user stories, fed them to an LLM to create a requirements and used that to break it into epics and tasks, then massaged them carefully based on my experience to keep them at the correct step-size and to log, test, document each stage appropriately. I mixed in manual testing as the LLMs were churning. I architected the process where the agent operated in \\~5 min intervals, followed by me asking it to prove and validate the completion of each objective. \n\nIt took me a few days to complete a standalone web app project to the point I was confident to demo it. \n\nIs it maintainable? Yes. As a part of my process I had the agent write documentation for the features. For any feature there is a documentation that explains it, if I want to make changes I point the agent to the documentation and based on it I ask it to make changes. I dont intend to manually read thousands of lines of code and documentation so I needed to make sure the agent is able to maintain it.\n\nIs is debuggable? Yes. As a part of my process it was critical to design logging very carefully - too little and your agent will be lost, too much and your context window blows up and you go nowhere. \n\nCould I get it done with the agent working unsupervised - absolutely not, it would have collapsed really quickly - it took a lot of detours and messed things up many times where I had to stop it, roll back changes. Sometimes it does random silly things like generating data inside a function instead of taking the function arguments which is really odd that it can be so smart and so dumb at the same time. Sometimes, it severely overcomplicates things to the point where it generates 1000 lines of new code instead of changing one line. Supervision is absolutely necessary, BUT, its an extremely powerful tool in hands of experienced developers. \n\nI recommend everybody should start pracitcing - utilizing agents can really boost your productivity by a lot.",

Having a clear conception of what you want to do, not only the requirements, but the implementation, and using the LLM to generate the code, is going to be faster for many people than typing it out themselves. However, it requires you to be disciplined.   \n  \nBasically, if you view LLMs as a replacement for typing, rather than a replacement for thinking, you *sometimes* can go faster than you would otherwise. However, results are variable. Sometimes, it is faster to just type it up yourself. If what you want is very particular, an LLM may not be able to infer what you want it to do efficiently, and you might be better off just doing it yourself.\n\nYou can use LLMs to discuss many of the strategic questions that arise when coding. You can ask it to evaluate and propose alternative implementations. There are ways to use it that are healthy on net.\n\nPersonally, I find that some of my LLM usage is mood driven. Sometimes I want to dive into the problem myself and type it all out or work out the problem in real time by coding it directly. Other times, I have for instance been driving in the car and know exactly what needs to be done, and it is reasonably easy to explain to the LLM, so I will do that and shift into steer and review mode, and its great.\n\nA frequent thing for me is that I'll manually code out some of the basic models or logic, creating a skeleton which makes clear to the LLM what I'm trying to do, which, when paired with a discussion phase prior to implementation, is often very effective.\n\nBut certainly, LLMs make it very possible to just shut your brain down and get some \"working\" ill considered solution out there, and I would say tactical tornadoes are raging around me all the time.",

I even got badges like \"Daily Heavy User\" and \"Top 10% Performer.\" The most cringe part is the text at the top: *\"There is no room for complacency.\"* Like, wtf?\n\nI've been a dev for a long time and this is the first time I'm being measured by *how* I use a tool instead of the actual value or quality of my code. They even have a \"Daily Use\" percentage (97% for me) based on my working days. Does anyone else feel like this is a massive red flag? It feels like they're prepping to replace us or at least treat us like prompt-monkeys. Is this happening in other big tech companies too or is MELI just going full dystopia mode?\n\nSorry for te rant, just had to share this bc it feels wrong on so many levels.\n\nThis here the image:   \n[https://ibb.co/MkyWcBRp](https://ibb.co/MkyWcBRp)  \n  \n",

      "text": "This is a stance I'm pretty firm on, but I'd love to hear other opinions\n\nMy first role as a software engineer was driven by a queue. Whatever is at the top of the queue takes priority in the moment and that's what is worked on\n\nAt first, this actually worked very very well for me. I was able to thrive because the most important thing was always clear to me. Until I went up a few engineering levels and then it wasn't. Because no other team was driven by a queue\n\nThis made things hard, it made things stressful... Hell, I even nearly left because of how inflexible I always felt\n\nBut point being, in the beginning, we were small. We had one product. Other teams drove our product, and as a result, drove the tooling we used\n\nSo we had capacity to only focus on the queue, knock items that existed in the queue out, and move on to the next thing. Easy.\n\nThen we were bigger. Now we have multiple products. Other teams began working on those. We were left to support existing and proven product. We were asked to take on tooling, escalations, etc that other teams had been working on. We did not have capacity. All we knew was the queue. To some people, the queue was the most important thing. To other people, speeding up our team through better tooling was the important thing. And to others, grand standing was the most important thing\n\nSenior engineers hated this. Senior engineers switched teams. Team was left with inexperienced engineers. Quality of product produced by team has significantly depreciated\n\nMe not at company anymore. Me at different company\n\nMe not know why start talking like this. Me weird sometimes, but me happy that my work isn't driven by a queue that's all important meanwhile having other priorities that me told are equally important by stupid management cross teams\n\nThank you",

              "text": "Strong disagree. I’ve worked on teams that do this and also a team with much less process (no kanban, no jira, just PRs and project level syncs). Velocity was far far higher (for me personally probs 2-3x) on the low process team than the 3 other high process teams I worked on. And it wasn’t due to team size or company size, the low process team was the biggest team I’ve been on (8 engineers). \n\nThe reason is that I spent hours every day on process before, be it daily standup, point estimation, jira wrangling, triage meetings, prioritization meetings etc.. it often took more time deciding to work on something small than just doing it. \n\nMy last team (the low process team) eliminated most of that. We had our main projects, which were loosely determined by PMs and then given to us, a weekly standup, a weekly project sync and that was more or less that. When it came time to work on a project, we’d scope it out and design it within a small group and then just go. \n\nI can’t tell you how liberating it is to start coding days after starting the project instead of being bogged down on scope and design meetings for weeks. Occasionally our process meant we’d have to redo some work if our design was flawed, and for more complex projects we’d jump into prototypes in the beginning, but its still vastly faster than trying to perfect everything at the beginning. And all the pointless bike shedding is gone. \n\nThe best part of this is that I had all this time cleared out and we had the autonomy to just do things when we wanted to. Have some tech debt you want to clean up? Just spend a few hours, get a review and get it merged. The burden is unfathomably lower when you don’t have to justify it, track it, estimate it, triage it, and schedule it. \n\nLike I’m telling you we had the cleanest code base I’d ever seen. We had helper tools for days because people cared to do it and we had the autonomy to make it happen. Some of my most impactful changes happened on a whim when I’d be debugging something and decided to spend a few hours adding some diagnostics or whatever. \n\nI had this one project that I suspected would save us a good bit of money, but turned out we have no good way to get an accurate picture of team infrastructure cost. No worries, napkin math was enough, but I snooped further and saw we had all the raw cost event tables covering our team’s infrastructure in our data warehouse. So on a whim I spent a couple of days creating some team specific tables to make cost easier to calculate and a nice dashboard with various aggregations and charts.\n\nWell lo and behold I get a slack a few weeks later from higher up asking why we had a cost spike with X service. Turns out someone had shared the dashboard and they added it to their cost review resources. \n\nI didnt tell anyone I was making this, I just presented it to the team when it was done (then I think one of our PMs spread it around). At my old companies I doubt this would’ve been prioritized over project work, and we’d spend time discussing the rights aggregations and charts and what tables to make and blah blah blah and it would never happen.\n\nAnyways, sorry for my rant. I’m sure this won’t work on every team but it’s been such a breath of fresh air to “just do things” and I really don’t want to go back.",

What we do is create tasks when technical (invisible) work is needed and use it to make it visible for other stakeholders (product manager). It does not equate to having a heavyweight process around that, and honestly, it helps a lot: every dev is assigned a task, everyone can see what's being worked on, etc. And the best part is that rarely anyone outside of the dev team argues that those tasks are not needed.\n\nBefore, we had a horrible way of trying to squeeze that technical work into existing feature tickets, and it was painful because it did not give a real picture of what's happening. Now we can have a refactoring task that must be done before a feature can be delivered, and everyone is OK with that.",

Like, some literal examples I've used internally are jira tickets with titles like \"Make (Redacted Feature Name) More Usable\" and \"Build Integration With (Redacted Third Party Service)\", and no body.  The kanban process worked for us because we just adapted to it and when the ticket is that vague the developer's action item is to get on a zoom call with the product manager and babysit them through writing some actual tickets (then put those in the backlog for somebody to work on).  It wasn't perfect, because obviously developers would prefer not to do that, but over time some of the product managers learned how to just write reasonable requirements in the first place (and then regressed when upper management forced a different process across the whole company).  \n\nSAFe's a terrible fit for that because it assumes you've already got that \"Twitter, but for Dogs\" feature broken down into actionable/estimable tickets before the quarter starts, when in actuality you're forced to figure that shit out on the fly.",

That is to say, it's better to keep focused dev work going and people on task than it is to give KTLO people a break. In the long run it makes little difference and we found longer rotations were better for continuity, on both sides. We even got it to a point where it fell outside of our product capacity. We hired so product had at least the capacity we saw and then hired more to make sure we had this capacity as well. Yes, it got to a point where everything not on their radar fell into KTLO but we similarly planned and projected and hired accordingly. At times it was bad and we didn't have capacity and it kept being underfunded, but right now we're at a health size for this to work.\n\nMy two cents is that you have to plan for it. There will always be unexpected things that come up and the worst you can do is try to scramble to figure it out.

      "text": "I used to love working here. First job out of college, good environment to learn and grow, good coworkers, great WLB, well-known company (not a big household name but people know it when i mention it).\n\nBut in the last 2 years, things have slowly gone downhill. Theres 2 things,\n\n1. The compensation is not competitive. I'm pretty underpaid relative to my peers in the same location. However, I'm okay with this given that I'm fully remote and the WLB is extremely good (most days I'm done with my tasks for the day after 5-6 hours).\n\n2. Huge shift to building AI products. This one has made me hate my job. \n\nThere's a huge push to integrate LLMs into everything. Everyone I know, aside from the infra teams, is working on an LLM-related project. I've been working on building an AI product for the last year and it has made me miserable. I hate that I spend hours a day tweaking a prompt for something that is non deterministic, and will still deviate from the prompt, no matter how many adjustments I make. \n\nI hate that product has crazy expectations of how LLMs work, and are not satisfied that it can't do things perfectly,\n\nI used to do Full Stack stuff, but now it's mostly backend because there isnt much frontend to do since everything is a chat interface. Product seems to not want to create designs for anything. Instead of creating nice flows, we just throw in a chat interface now and let the user interact with an LLM to do things.\n\nThe products we're building aren't great either. Sometimes I feel insane because I personally do not want to talk to LLMs when I'm using products, and so I hate the things I'm building, but product seems to think this is what people want.\n\nAnd i hate that, since I'm building chatbots, I have to talk to them to test them. I'm going crazy talking to AI all day. \n\nI miss building actual products and thinking through designs, instead of constantly talking about what models we should upgrade to and what lines of the prompt need to be tweaked.\n\nI've asked for a team transfer but seems like most teams are doing LLM projects.\n\nI'm also worried about layoffs. If everything is a chatbot, what are all the designers and front-end engineers doing?",

                  "text": "People will downvote this, and many (mostly new people in the field) will disagree, but the general attitude of specifically new engineers has changed significantly in the last 5 or so years.\n\nWhen I started, new engineers worked their backsides off to give their careers a major shot in the arm. Engineers also understood that it takes way more than 8 hours a day initially to achieve excellence.\n\nIt's after several years that engineers used to say, \"okay, I've read a ton of books, studied and learned new technologies, built many side projects just to experiment and learn, and made a serious impact at work. I'm older now and have put in the work, so I can bring significant value to any team/company by working 9-5 and prioritizing life outside of work.\"\n\nThe people these days complain about preparing for interviews, doing take home problems, doing personal studies after hours, and being in situations at work where they have to go above and beyond to fit into a high performing team/company.\n\nThe field is competitive and there are very smart, talented, and hard working people. It's truly a privilege to be part of a world class team, and it takes more than just doing your job. The same is true for sports, law, other engineering fields, etc.\n\nIn my opinion many new software engineers have a warped perception of what it takes to be successful. Things like \"a day in the life\" where they do very little except enjoying perks, get paid a ton, and think that's normal are out of touch with reality. And those days are over.\n\nSo a young person who is new in the field who talks about finishing \"tasks\" in 5-6 hours, and having a good WLB is not a positive to me. Someone saying, \"I spent 20 hours this weekend building a side project in a brand new technology and it was awesome\", is someone I want to work with. That's how I was and the other people in my team as well.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

It seems like folks often don't ask questions because it might make them look stupid or whatever. I don't give a shit about having to explain things multiple times in multiple ways. I actually view that as at least partially my fault for not communicating things effectively. The worst thing folks do in that situation is not speak up, because then when the misunderstanding becomes obvious, and it always does, it is at a time when it costs more time and patience to resolve than if they'd just asked repeatedly until they understood it. \n\nNow, there's always the chance that you just don't understand because of some shortcoming on your part. Again, this is something you'd be best figuring out sooner rather than later.

If I didn’t get it the first or second or third time, the problem is usually that I’ve made a bad assumption, or there’s a logical leap or conclusion that I didn’t follow, and going through step by step - basically debugging the design or conclusion - is the way to figure out where the disconnect happened.\n\nBecoming the go-to person for something is a lagging signal of expertise and social proof. For building the expertise, there’s no substitute for curiosity. For instance, in our system, any time someone describes something the system does - like in on-call review or as part of an incident response - if I didn’t already know it, I dig into the code until I can trace for myself exactly how that works. Any time I hear about a feature that we want to write, I do a mini design myself to see where it aligns with our system and where it’s mismatched, and then I think of good ways to resolve the mismatch. Whenever I answer a question on Slack, I don’t just answer the question, I also try to think about the context of the question and understand that - why did this person ask this question? How did they end up coming to ME with it? Etc. and if appropriate I offer feedback on that. Do this enough, and you’ll become an expert naturally.\n\nThen the social proof - when discussions are happening, offer your knowledge. And the critical thinking you’re doing will lead you to develop opinions - offer them, too. Eventually people will remember that you helped them out or clarified something for them, and they’ll start going to you directly. And when they start recommending you to their peers, then you’re literally the go-to person.",

I'm talking about actual networking, like traffic flows, protocols, etc. \n\nFor reference I pursued my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering so I technically don't have the most traditional CS background and I have about 7+ years in the industry now focused on devops/SRE roles. I'm fine when it comes to writing code, best practices, observability, operations, IAC, troubleshooting, etc. I've designed and developed many microservices in my career since that's a big chunk of what I do but I barely know what DHCP is, or the fact that everything is \"dns\". \n\nI know how to make requests to api's and could maybe tell you it uses the tcp protocol, but I don't actually know what that protocol entails or how it works under the hood. I ssh into remote machines all the time, but I can't tell you what exactly is happening. Something about a tunnel being formed? Or tls? I just know that it's more secure, but I don't truly know how or why. Something something certificates. \n\nI just feel that in my career thus far, I've never had the reason, or opportunity to NEED to dive deeper into how networking actually works because many issues I've had to troubleshoot end up being at a much higher level.\n\nI recently had a recruiter reach out about a role and naturally I decided to give the interview a shot and the first technical screen came with alot of rapid fire questions about networking topics. I honestly couldn't answer a majority of them and it was quite embarrassing given I'm at least a mid-level engineer. \n\nso I was wondering if anyone had any resources for getting a better grasp on all of this? Because I'm sure if anything it will just be nice to read on something in my down time.\n\nEdit: thank you all for providing some great pointers for expanding my networking knowledge. I just want to point out again that I'm in devops/SRE and though I've been lucky to not have to dive deep into more networking topics, I'm sure one day I will so learning about the OSI layer at the very least seems valuable in the long run.

I don't have any good resources handy, as that was back before the web really had many of these things. What I will say is focus particularly on the \"layers\" concept when you do stumble upon the documentation. It all starts with the ethernet layer (MAC addresses and wires), then goes to the IP layer (connecting to physical machines) and then TCP/UDP on top of that (one has reliable delivery, the other does not (a gross oversimplification)), and then application-specific protocols build on top of that (HTTP). \n\nIt is one of the concepts that has served me well in ways you might not expect. Networking is more about streams of data, and that can be useful knowledge in other areas than just networking, for example writing binary file formats. They both have the same problem: serializing and deserializing data. Just think of it as sending nothing but a series of bits. It could be written to a socket, or it could be written to a file. but it's a stream nonetheless.\n\nThings like DNS try to make all this easier. Instead of memorizing IP addresses, it's like a phone book, where you can look people up by name. Everything like DNS builds on the fundamentals I laid out above.\n\nThis is why the \"layers\" concept is so important to get started here.",

You can learn a lot just by monitoring your network traffic while some services (like dhcp) are running, and investigating the packets you see with wireshark or tcpdump. Some of the RFCs are pretty short.\n\nLinux has and usually comes with all sorts of tools for dealing with networking stuff from the command line. rarp/arp, netstat, route, ufw and iptables, traceroute, tcpdump. You can combine those with grep, less, etc to analyze network activity.\n\nIf you want to try configuring some Cisco routers, we used a program in one of my classes called Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate networks and devices.\n\nIt's hard to know how far you are. Do you know the tcp 3-way handshake? Can you read and write a routing table? Do you understand the differences between TCP and UDP?  Can you read and write CIDR notation subnets? Do you know ARP and RARP and how they relate to MAC addresses? Can you successfully make SSH tunnels? Configure routing protocols? Configure a firewall? Create VLANs? Set up a DHCP server? Set up a cisco router? Know how to use wireshark? Coming from a sysadmin background, that might all be basic to intermediate stuff for some people. Or not.",

The truth is that most of us learn what we need to solve the problems in front of us, and if your day-to-day hasn't required deep protocol knowledge, there's no reason you would have developed that expertise. That interviewer hit you with questions that weren't relevant to your experience, and that says more about their interview process than your competence as a mid-level engineer. The good news is that networking fundamentals are totally learnable - start with \"Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach\" by Kurose and Ross if you want the textbook route, or check out Practical Networking's YouTube channel for more digestible content that connects theory to real-world scenarios you actually encounter.\n\nThe real lesson here is that you need to be ready for interviewers who ask these curveball questions that don't match your background or the role itself. Some companies just have lazy interview processes that throw everything at candidates without thinking about what's actually relevant. For getting better at handling these situations and knowing how to navigate tricky technical questions you're not prepared for, I've found [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to be really helpful - full disclosure, I'm on the team that built it, but we specifically designed it to handle unexpected interview scenarios and provide real-time support when you're facing questions outside your comfort zone.",

If you were the reviewer, would code would you want to give a closer look to. What was hard? Tradeofs? Etc?\n\nIt is also expected that you write inline comments in code (we use BitBucket) of anything of interest.\n\n\\# Testing\n\nDescribe your testing strategy.\n\n\\--\n\nAs a reviewer, you are expected to truly understand the PR. We sometimes get developers that open PR, clicks approve within 10 s or just write \"lgtm\". That's never ok, we expect reviewers to also comment the PR and provide feedback.\n\nThe central point is that the PR is a place for feedback, from both perspectives. If you can't accept that, can't accept being pard of a team and bigger picture. Good luck elsewhere.",

If cursor was meant for vibe coding, there would be no reason to base it on vscode and having anything besides chat interface in it.\n\nI personally find LLMs very useful, but it takes a while to get a feel for the scope and type of a task you can reliably offload to an LLM and get good results. I think a lot of productivity research fails to take this into account. If you give AI assist tools to someone who never used them and immediately measure their productivity, it's obviously going to be lower because like all tools, they have a learning curve. Once you get some experience, an AI-assisted human performs better than a human without AI, or AI without a human. \n\nLLMs are better than me at everything that I do not specialize in. If I'm dealing with a new library, or something I don't do regularly, it saves me a lot of time. I appreciate not having to google shit like \"bash if statement\" or flags for specific commands when I need to write a script once in a few months.\n\nThey are very good at interpreting cryptic errors, reading logs, and debugging in general. Most of the time when I select some code and describe the incorrect behavior, they get it right.\n\nIn general, if I know what I need to do clearly enough that I can describe it in words, and it's something that would take me under 20 minutes, LLMs typically do it right on the first try at least as well as I could have done. Sometimes better.\n\n>junior dev on my team used ai to build a feature. worked great in dev. hit staging and there was a race condition that took 2 days to debug\n\nTo be entirely fair, this could easily have happened if the junior handwrote all of that code too. Would still take two days to debug, just longer to write. AI is far from perfect, but so are juniors. I remember stuff I wrote in my first two years on the job, it wasn't pretty.",

We are tackling these challenges at Luther by keeping core process logic as code, fully compatible with Cursor, but running on a high-performance, but constrained, runtime (built on Golang) that handles everything else (inclduing state management and consistency). The platform handles the integration glue and event messaging for you, so you don't have to worry about AI going off the rails. It prevents those subtle timing issues in mega-workflows, that AI often struggles with.

      "text": "I like Junior devs. Most of them are a passionate bunch with the spark still in their eyes. I want to help them chase their passion, and be better as Software Engineers. However, patience and energy to deal with people aren't exactly my strong suites.\n\nSo, here I am. Spill the team devs! What worked for you when training junior devs?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks all for the advices! For future reference, I have summarized the discussion here;​\n\n**Work Assignment & Hands-On Approach:**\n\n* Give junior devs appropriately scoped work that's challenging enough to be interesting but not so hard they get frustrated\n* Treat juniors like any other engineer—give them tasks and let them work; provide rough guidance if they flounder\n* Have them fix bugs as a way to contribute early on\n* Let them drive on tasks while you observe, ask questions, and provide feedback\n\n**Teaching Problem-Solving:**\n\n* Don't just answer their questions; walk them through solving problems themselves\n* Ask them \"Why did you choose that option?\" to understand their thought process\n* Use the \"give a man a fish\" vs \"teach a man to fish\" approach—focus on teaching the process, not just solutions\n* Use pair programming with juniors driving while you watch and resist the urge to grab the keyboard\n* Use Test-Driven Development (TDD): write test cases together, have them make tests pass, then have them write tests for you to make pass\n\n**Pair Programming & Mentoring:**\n\n* Implement a gradual pair programming progression: you drive with commentary → they drive with your commentary → they drive with their own commentary → they work independently\n* Pair program on tasks where they struggle to move forward\n* This approach can significantly accelerate their productivity (potentially reaching SE0.5-1 level in days for good candidates)\n\n**Code Reviews & Feedback:**\n\n* Explain the \"why\" behind code review feedback, not just what to fix\n* Use specific examples: \"this works but it'll bite you when X happens\" sticks better than \"change this\"\n\n**Managing Shy/Quiet Juniors:**\n\n* Build connection through non-work-related conversations and team building\n* Normalize asking \"stupid\" questions by sharing your own past mistakes\n* Set up regular one-on-ones to discuss what they're working on in an informal setting\n* Make it clear you want them to ask more questions than they think they should\n* Emphasize that asking for help benefits you too—it gives you a break from your own work\n\n**Building Confidence & Reducing Fear:**\n\n* Encourage them genuinely without being judgmental\n* Stress that asking for help is valued; spending 10 minutes helping is better than them spending 8 hours stuck\n* When they say \"this is probably a stupid question,\" normalize it and connect it to something you've done\n* Think of juniors as \"big toddlers\" who don't know anything yet—this helps with patience and empathy\n* Remember you were also an idiot once—this helps build patience\n\n**Self-Learning & Independence:**\n\n* Teach them how to use search bars (wiki, Google, Reddit) to find answers themselves\n* Have them contribute to documentation with their own notes\n* The goal is to minimize the time they need from you for things they can figure out themselves\n* Be patient when there's intent but not understanding; less so when there's neither\n* Distinguish between being a \"teacher\" and a \"mentor\"\n\n**Domain Knowledge & Onboarding:**\n\n* Give proper training in domain knowledge—this is underrated\n* Use onboarding tasks as teaching opportunities (ensure feedback is constructive, not judgmental)\n* Have them fix and review code during the onboarding phase\n* Set expectations early through one-on-ones\n* Embrace that they bring fresh perspectives and see opportunities for improvement\n\n**Managing Difficult Situations:**\n\n* Handle juniors who get frustrated; help them understand that imperfection is normal in software development\n* Don't micromanage—let them figure things out; they might come up with something better than your idea\n* Be clear that as a senior, you have final authority on decisions, even if they disagree with the approach\n* Work on your own patience and energy to deal with people if you want to effectively mentor\n\n**Key Mindset:**\n\n* Good juniors don't require much handholding—focus on the talented ones\n* Different people have different learning processes; customize your approach\n* If they have aptitude, you'll gradually hear from them less often or get tougher/more complex questions over time\n* Not everyone can be mentored equally; some have more potential than others",

It was all fine, took ages but the result was good.  However going through it (after tons of initial changes including a near 1 hr argument over letting users upload all images types and not lock it to only pngs as the junior wanted) they finally insisted that we ONLY use it in two places and have all the other image uploaders the old style.  I kept saying no, we are doing this to eliminate all of them to take the burden off users needing the pixel perfect image size in order to upload anything.  And the entire thing was my idea to begin with.  But I was told I was wrong and it was only ever meant to be in a few places and the junior refused to do the rest.  That is just one example.\n\nI am getting sick of no, you MUST use X framework, or no, you MUST do it my way for some reason I can't explain, it's just the way.",

Finally you let them loose and make sure they know to talk to you if they have any questions.  The better the intern the more steps you can skip.\n\n\nThe first time I pulled this off the team was shocked at how fast the the intern was self sufficient at something like a SE0.5~1 level.  Most recently the team bought into it and took about a week to get to ~SE1 performance, although that particular one was almost definitely a luck of the draw kind of situation.\n\n\nComing back to juniors, I don't think I would try the intern thing with a junior unless they were either fresh out of college or otherwise having significant problems.  But it might work adapting some of the later stages.  For an intern I want them working on relatively easy problems with known solutions.  But if you want to help a junior level up, maybe give them a problem that's definitely beyond them but normalish for you.  The pair with them where they're driving and you offer commentary whenever they look like they're starting to spin.",

I had found out at the time that they 'fixed' their Y2K problem (their system was using 2-digit years) with a bit of a hack or maybe some would call it a workaround. \n\nIn preparation for Y2K, instead of modifying their system to use four digit years, they kept the 2 digits and then put in checks around if the date is X years difference, assume it's in the 1900's or 2000's. This logic was all over the code and any integrating system still used these 2 digit years.\n\nFast forward to 2026, I just met up with an old coworker that still works for this company. Turns out, nothing has changed. They are still using a 2 digit year with these hacks still in place. Surprisingly, they had even ported their software to a new language in that time, but kept the 2 digit year and all the hacks as-is.\n\nThis got me wondering...\n\n1. How much software is out there that still deals with 2 digit years with these kinds of workarounds? \n2. Do other developers run into this often?\n3. If so, have you experience anything catastrophic from it?\n4. For those who eventually fixed it properly, what was the catalyst?\n\n",

      "text": "So I have about 7.5 years of experience as a backend/firmware engineer. I had a week to kill, so I decided to finish both of these books off. When I was an intern at Bank of America, people in my team used to literally worship Uncle Bob. Interns had a lunch meeting where we would bring our food and watch Bob Martin's videos.(It was only my team who did this).\n\nThen I went to work at Bloomberg and almost everyone there with 20 to 30 years of experience, guild members, Tech Champs etc. told me that I don't need to read these books. And that I should just use my intuition.\n\nMy experience with these books so far seem to be:\n\n1. 90% of the content in these books is common sense.\n2. 50% of the content in those books is Bob Martin telling wartime stories about things that are common sense in 2026. Some of his stories feel made up to be honest.  He just says that this is how we used to develop software in the 80s and 90s. His stories read like \"People used to put their hands on an open flame and it used to burn their hands. Believe me, I was brought in as a consultant at a famous company where I have seen developers put their hands on a flame and burn their hands. The product managers would lit a giant pyre. And all the developers would line up by the fire, taking turns burning their hands. I worked with them and taught them not to put their hands on flames. At first the product managers came at me with pitch forks demanding to know why I am not letting the developers burn their hands! But after I explained my rationale behind not burning your hands on a open flame, they backed off immediately. And with in 3 quarters I brought down the number of people with burnt hands to 0\". And then he would draw a graph that would show the number of people with burnt hands went down to 0.\n3. 3% to 4% of the content is actually new to me. And I can use that to write better quality code.\n4. The remaining content is just too pedantic? too esoteric? Things like \"Common Closure principle\", \"Common reuse principle\", \"Stable Abstraction principle\". I cannot imagine myself sitting in a meeting and using terms like that. Nobody will take me seriously. Like if I were to try to convince my teammates to use those principles, I would pretty much have to do that without using those terms. And even then I anticipate it would result in an hour to 2 hour long fruitless meeting, where people might agree with me purely for the sake of politeness.\n\nLike between chapters 12 to 15 in the Clean Architecture book, he is repeatedly advocating creating \"components\" which are just repositories of interfaces/abstract classes with very little to no implementation at all. I can understand why he is suggesting people do that, but it would be like a career suicide to convince someone in a professional setting to let me do that. I personally know so many of my colleagues who would argue that creating such repositories would makes thing less maintainable/stable. It might work if you are with a group of people all of whom have read these books. But in a C++ or Golang or Rust team, suggesting things like this wouldn't sit well with people I feel. I can definitely say that Java developers would love Bob Martin's ideas.\n\nIn the 7.5 years that I have worked as a software engineer, I have exactly seen one case where people built a repository entirely of interfaces & abstract classes that could not be used on it's own and had to be imported into some other \"component\".\n\n**On the common sense part:**\n\nI have mentored junior engineers who could definitely use this book. Like this one person who I was mentoring was asked to implement a feature that would require changes to 5 to 6 classes and they implemented all of the changes in a single class, and changed the function signature of half a dozen other methods so they would pass objects/information to the class where they were implementing the feature. For people like that, this book will be wonderful! But for people like, just understanding SOLID principles is itself enough.",

          "text": "My experience is that most devs don't know how to weigh advice and how to understand the advice with principles in mind. So they will take the clean code principles as absolutes and then do strange things to the code that will actually hurt its readability.\n\nClean code rules/advice are not absolute. What matters is readability.\n\nFor example, spreading functionality over lots of functions / files will frequently hurt readability vs. having that functionality on a single screen.\n\nThe reason to spread functionality over multiple functions / files is so that you can create \\*abstractions\\*. You divide a large problem into smaller problems, you create abstractions for each part of the problem, so that each remaining part is easier to understand on its own.\n\nWhat frequently happens instead is developers just take the lines of the code and kind of push them into multiple functions with no thought about the interface between. I would very much prefer the code to stay together as one ugly function than be spread around with poorly defined interface.\n\nAnd this is the simplest advice... when it comes to more complicated patterns, advice, the success rate is even worse.\n\nAnother issue is when people insist on implementing solutions to something that is not a problem. For example, when they introduce complex structure to a very simple application.\n\nSo my thinking about those books is that they are great, but only for people who already have some experience battling with poorly written code and are searching for solutions to apply to solve specific problems. People who are mature enough to be able to take advice with a pinch of salt, who understand the role of principles in software development and who can observe the effects of what they are doing and decide when it is or it is not bringing in the expected results.\n\nFor a new dev, the best thing to do is to ignore the books for a bit and instead:\n\n\\* gain experience with shitty code. This should not be a problem, most projects have plenty of it.\n\n\\* gain experience with good code. This is bit more difficult. You can browse github and read other people repositories in search of well written code. You can also refactor your own code until you (and others) are happy that it is nice and readable.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEDIT:\n\nBooks are great as a source of ideas but that's it. I read Uncle Bob to get ideas how I can fix my code, not as a list of commandments I have to live by.\n\nUnexperience people, especially, don't understand this. Young people do not yet have the experience and what our brain does is if we do not have experience we seek simple rules to make sense of the world. And when we do it, we tend to latch onto ideas like that and use them as a gospel.\n\nBecause this is typical way people learn: we first learn to \\*emulate\\* others, only after some time we understand why some things are being done this or that way and only then we can make up our mind about it in a more informed way.\n\nUnfortunately, careers in IT have been greatly compressed. You can gain a lot of knowledge in 4 years that it takes to get you from a newb to a senior developer, but you will be unlikely to become wise developer, this takes a lot more time usually. So there is a lot of \"senior\" developers who are effectively still behaving like juniors and still mindlessly preaching same misguided gospel.",

This is obviously less than ideal in hindsight.  But at the time those cults form, it probably seemed like a good idea at the time.  But taken to extremes or treated as absolutes, any of this advice will fall apart and do more harm than good.\n\nAs an old man who does appreciate the wisdom of the ancients like Uncle Bob, at the time he was initially preaching, I was a card-carrying advocate.  What I think gets lost in translation is that no rule or law is absolute because what we do isn't just science.  It's also art.  It's why we still don't have good tools to measure productivity or code quality.  There is always another way to do it, and it's easy to lose sight of preferences versus dogma.\n\nIt really depends on the language you are using and the type of code you're running into.  If you are reading these rules and they don't seem like a beacon of wisdom, count your blessings.  You are either blessed with code that is already 'clean' by whatever standards you use or with blissful ignorance.\n\nIt's the same with Agile.  Kids today seem to love to hate it, which I find amusing.  But at the time the Manifesto was published, it seemed like mana from heaven in the waterfall mines.  I think the principles are still meaningful, but the cargo cults that formed and treated them as rituals to perform or the 'consultants' selling snake oil were very different than the discussions and changes they initially inspired.",

They are practical in understanding that real world code requires **strategies** to add or change features to the spaghetti mess without piling more spaghetti but also not breaking existing features. \n\nYour teammates will still have opinions. But if you submit a PR where most of the lines are added, tests, and minimal redline changes, they can contest the lines you changed, but for the new stuff? You have a better chance of convincing them to accept. \n\nIf I was a junior again, I’ll recommend that. Anyone can write new code. Not everyone can work with legacy code effectively",

      "text": "Hey Devs,\n\nRecently, I've run a detailed performance tests on my blog, comparing MySQL with Postgres and it basically turns out that Postgres is supperior in almost all scenarios: for the 17 executed test cases in total, Postgres won in 14 and there was 1 draw. Using QPS (queries per second) to measure throughput (the higher the better), mean & 99th percentile for latency (the lower the better), here is a high-level summary of the results:\n\n1. **Inserts**\n   * 1.05 - 4.87x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 3.51 - 11.23x by mean and 4.21 - 10.66x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `21 338 QPS with 4.009 ms at the 99th percentile` for single-row inserts, compared to *4 383 QPS & 42.729 ms* for MySQL; for batch inserts of `100 rows`, it achieves `3535 QPS with 34.779 ms at the 99th percentile`, compared to *1883 QPS & 146.497 ms* for MySQL\n2. **Selects**\n   * 1.04 - 1.67x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 1.67 - 2x by mean and 1.25 - 4.51x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `55 200 QPS with 5.446 ms at the 99th percentile` for single-row selects by id, compared to *33 469 QPS & 12.721 ms* for MySQL; for sorted selects of multiple rows, it achieves `4745 QPS with 9.146 ms at the 99th percentile`, compared to *4559 QPS & 41.294 ms* for MySQL\n3. **Updates**\n   * 4.2 - 4.82x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 6.01 - 10.6x by mean and 7.54 - 8.46x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `18 046 QPS with 4.704 ms at the 99th percentile` for updates by id of multiple columns, compared to *3747 QPS & 39.774 ms* for MySQL\n4. **Deletes**\n   * 3.27 - 4.65x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 10.24x - 10.98x by mean and 9.23x - 10.09x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `18 285 QPS with 4.661 ms at the 99th percentile` for deletes by id, compared to *5596 QPS & 43.039 ms* for MySQL\n5. **Inserts, Updates, Deletes and Selects mixed**\n   * 3.72x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 9.34x by mean and 8.77x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `23 441 QPS with 4.634 ms at the 99th percentile` for this mixed in 1:1 writes:reads proportion workload, compared to *6300 QPS & 40.635 ms* for MySQL\n\n  \nThere were only two join cases, where MySQL was slightly better; but nothing compared to the differences cited above.\n\nGiven this gap, when do you use MySQL instead of Postgres and why? Does it have additional features and/or advantages that Postgres does not provide? Or, are there other scenarios that I am not aware of, where it does deliver better performance? Something else entirely?",

How many cores did a given node have? Clustered/Cluster topology? Query shapes or just CRUDs? Insertion order of records/access patterns? Record size? Cache hit/miss ratios? CPU/memory/disk utilization? IOPs? $/cpu-util? \n\nAn e-commerce company is going to have much different access patterns, query shapes, etc than a household banking company. Databases will perform differently under these different circumstances. \n\nOther considerations to cover include configuration tuning questions, OS tuning, and a variety of other metrics and composite metrics that are taken into consideration when analyzing database performance.\n\nIt has been a long time since I’ve done analysis on MySQL, but I’ve seen investigations that concluded that MySQL has nearly 99% vertical scalability in TPC-C.

In my experience healthcare companies care more about joins than any other client I’ve encountered. \n\nScaling is the next king. To go from 92% vertical scalability to 95% VS actually represents a 40% throughput increase. You can imagine how insane 99% vertical scalability MySQL achieved in TPC-C is. So any e-commerce workload at massive scale may consider MySQL over Postgres. \n\nIf somehow your records exceed 4KB then you’ll see serious performance degradation in Postgres. \n\nThose are just some examples but to be completely transparent I haven’t done any MySQL perf testing in a couple years which is why I’m siting investigations I’ve heard of rather than my own lol.",

I feel like I have a moral obligation to protect the team from the predictable death marches that happen 3-4 times a year, but no authority to actually do so. \n\nI'll save all the exposition and put it plainly, my current manager is the type who from leadership's macroscopic view is likely viewed as someone who drives results. On my team's level:\n\n- He commits aggressively\n\n- He extracts heroics\n\n- He ships\n\n- Incidents are rare *enough*\n\n- When incidents happen, they are framed as unfortunate costs of speed, not leadership failure\n\nHe takes no accountability for committing the team to over-aggressive deadlines (seemingly not self-aware in this regard) and believes firmly that pressure reveals excellence, discomfort is the cost of impact, shipping under fire is leadership, and engineers who can't handle this are \"not there yet.\" Arguing with this ideology has resulted in lost political capital. The small wins I do garner for the team come at personal cost. His manager is aware of his.. quirks.. and I think is pretty eyes wide open to it all, but I think he's fine endorsing it as the insane pace of delivery keeps our stakeholders happy.\n\nThe few weeks leading up to major launches are your fairly standard death march, but heroics of a few engineers willing to succumb to his high-pressure tactics save us from any launch slippage or (usually, not always) major production incidents. \n\nHere's the problem:\n\n- company is great\n\n- coworkers are great\n\n- product is great\n\n- work is generally interesting\n\n- pay is pretty good\n\nIn lieu of all that I'd just hit the eject button but it seems like all of the cultural problems and pressure originate singularly from this manager (who increasingly makes it hard for me to get out of bed in the morning).\n\nI'm pretty sure internal transfer or leaving entirely are still the only options but would love to hear opinions/anecdotes on how others have/would handle this.",

I asked the right questions and it was sold as the team works under me as I have control of how things work.  The reality is I have control of the team, but not high level decisions that directly impact the team.\n\nPriority of tasks are handled above me,  Setting up good design practices is frequently side tracked because management doesn't think some of the tasks for a new feature are actually needed.  They had this great trick have saying lets schedule this work and would break things up in to phase 1 and phase 2 of the feature development.\n\nThe great thing for them was phase 2 was things like message retries that they didn't care about. So they just never made phase 2 priority over other feature work.  Of course when it actually becomes an issues it's a big to do, but they are fine dealing with it when it happens.\n\nJust like you experienced the level of incidents are acceptable.  The team may think they are operating inefficiently due to poor code quality, but the company sees sped as more than fine.  The reality is the system is working as designed by the people up top, as another posted stated.\n\nWhile we had aggressive deadlines there was literally 0 consequences to missing them.  We once had a major release late by close to a year and nobody said anything when it was finally done.  In fact the company still threw a team party for a successful release.\n\nThis may not apply to you, but what we eventually learned was to just stop caring.  Do what management wants in terms of priority. Push back against unreasonable deadlines, but relent after one time.  \n\nAt the end of the day nobody cares about deadlines as anything more than a carrot to trick weak people in to working overtime. Everybody realized this and never worked overtime.",

You have to recognize that this is a trust and culture issue. They do not trust or respect your professional judgement. They think all of your nerd babble is superfluous to making money.\n\nThe reality is that whose job this is and how effective they are depends on your culture.

If you don't want to death march, don't death march, and don't order the people around you to do it. The only way these type of marches can work without burning people out is if you make everyone think it's there idea to do it, then the manager comes in at the end and shuts it down. Otherwise, it's brutal.\n\nThis is a specific, but avoidable pathology in tech. We're told to be autonomous, but only when that doesn't conflict with what the execs want to do. Ambiguity gets pushed on us all the time, and the cynical view is that happens to protect management and frame failure as personal, while giving the execs plausible deniability and a chance to criticize your decisions later.\n\nAll that said, if you are in a place where you can't focus on craft or leadership, and getting yanked around by games you don't want to play dominates your experience, it's time to move on.

Pick a small number of tests that are most likely to find bugs. Make a list of the inconsistent failures/noise generated from those tests, and either form a v-team to fix them if you can invest the resources, or tackle them one or two at a time until the test is always green.\n\nIt’s sounds like you work in a place with a high quality bar, where finding and fixing regressions is prioritized over feature development and sprint work. If you want to increase unit testing culture, I recommend organizing a post-mortem/RCA process for regressions that meet some defined bar. Then in the RCA, consider whether a less expensive test like a unit test could have caught the bug earlier. If yes, then create a repair task to write a unit test and assign it to the person who wrote the regression.",

Sure the code was run, but that doesn't mean anything meaningful was tested. Use mutation testing (stryker.js or similar) for a reality check. Our early test suites were showing about 85% on traditional coverage metrics but about 12% mutation numbers.\n2. Integration tests are \"easy\" because you can stick a wrapper on your infra and just test your UI/API directly for simple behaviors. Actually that's not a bad place to start if you have no tests at all because at least you can quickly test critical paths and throw mission-critical breaks.\n3. First problem is that you get a false sense of confidence \"well CI passed so it must be okay\" when your coverage wasn't really meaningful. Sometimes these integration tests are worse than having no coverage.\n4. Longer-term issue is that you get none of the benefits of TDD: improved encapsulation and predictability of behavior under change. Integration tests bypass both of these. This has required a long-term strangler-fig to overcome and still isn't done.\n5. As you found, running your whole application through each test means the tests run only at application speed, and every micro-behavior you want to test ends up bringing tons of baggage.\n6. To ensure the behaviors you actually care about, you actually end up with far more permutations than if you got unit tests right.\n\nIt sounds like you just have a horribly entangled, tightly coupled app and the leads know that proper testing would require massive refactoring due to undocumented side effects etc.\n\nThe reason they are resistant to unit tests are the exact reasons they would benefit from it.",

I think of unit tests as having a more diagnostic purpose: they cover a narrow scope and say \"Here's what's wrong\". Integration tests are like screening, they say \"Something is wrong, I don't necessarily know what\". The first is good at telling you where the bug are, the second is good at telling you you have them. If all you have is screening you're gonna go insane from the noise. If all you have is the diagnostics you won't find a lot of bugs. So there's a balance to be struck.\n\n\"Integration\" and \"Unit\" almost have no meaning there's so much grey area between them but I find it helps me to define integration as screening and unit as diagnostic, because that makes it more clear to me what the actual goals of the tests are. \n\nIf you don't have a clear idea of why they're there you need to figure it out or get rid of them.",

That's means running tests. Generally speaking you should not be introducing bugs with new features.\n\nBug free code doesn't really exists and nobody is looking for that.

You should not be running tests, see a failure, and say run it again because you know it will eventually pass.  If you care about testing then you should treat trusting code just like production code.\n\nEvery places I have worked at in my 15 YOE testing code was held to the same coding standard as production code.

Yes, improve testing to be more reliable and faster, but if you have done that it this is how long it takes to run then it is what it is.\n\nOut side of individual SWEs running a subset of tests to check their code changes during normal development, you should have something like Jenkins running all of your tests every night against mainline or something like that.  It doesn't matter if not changes were made, just getting continuous runtime is a good thing.\n\nYou should be working to get to a point where testing is reliable and 100% passing every night.

The regression pipline uses 50 VMs, that is if no one is using them but in most cases it is half of it, which takes 2 hours but often enough i can only run 2 or 3 regressions because other teammates are running theirs.\n\nThat is a slow feedback loop, as such I need to rely a lot on manual unit testing to uncover issues before starting regression.\n\n> If you have flaky tests then refactor them so they are not flaky.  You should not be running tests, see a failure, and say run it again because you know it will eventually pass.  If you care about testing then you should treat trusting code just like production code.\n\nWe invested a full year to refactor them so they are not flaky then we created a pipline to do a 40 run script flakiness validation. They are not as flaky as before now.\n\nThe below is an example of the easiest fastets test script:\n\n1- configure the settings for this workflow\n\n2- start the app\n\n3- validate webservice x started with timeout y within x  srconds (there is 5 other validations of startup webservices)\n\n4- validate card xyz exist with the following values\n\n5- click on card xyz\n\n6- validate the following components and info exists\n\n7- add product xyz\n\n8- validate the product xyz has been added\n\n9- scan product x\n\n10- validate the returned webservice values to be xyz",

You shouldn't want to get rid of this tests but supplement them with other integration and unit tests. End to End tests are great because often SWEs don't actually use the product as a product.  So things can be missed because you don't make the entire journey as a user.\n\nI don't know how your webapp is deigned, but I assume there is some back end API that the Frontend UI calls.  If so then you should be testing the backend separately from the UI.  The backend probably has requirements so tests to that.  \n\nYou use the API of the backend and send it a message and look for the reply that you get is what is expected. This also allows you to now send things like bad data to tests error situations that you probably cannot do easily within end to end tests.  You can do something similar with the UI testing where your tests are now the back end talking to the UI and sending it data.",

Which implies your iterations - change, run test, learn, adapt - to build things is not limited by \"running tests\". No time lost waiting for tests to finish. Learning phase can start immediately.   \nSo you can run many such cycles within a time span of 60 minutes and thus make progress. In case of negative feedback, the change set containing the failure is relatively small, thus the root cause is easy to find. You can quickly start a new cycle and progress.   \n\nWhen your integration tests (taking 40 minutes to run) you are likely limited to 1 feedback cycle per hour. And that is probably an optimistic estimate. The cycle rate is very low. Because of this low cycle rate, devs will increase the size of the change set (to compensate for slow feedback). Which in turn has negative impact on the learn and adapt phases because the root cause is now to be found in larger set of changes.\n\nTrick is not to have yet more tests, the trick is to have tests at the right level (unit, integration, e2e).

Integration tests are useful to catch more obvious bugs, although you can certainly test more exhaustively now and then. The trouble is many projects focus solely on testing as means to gain assurance and that's a very broken model. With unit tests you end up with a lot of indirection and very low actual assurance (due to coupling and due to the fact that some errors span unit boundaries, e.g. a DB query isn't wrong just in your application, it's wrong once you consider how the app and DB interact), as changes inevitably touch tests. With integration tests it takes a very long time and it costs a lot if you try to test everything all the time. The more rational solution is to use unit tests for pure units like algorithms or specific simple functions, integration tests to cover basic functionality, then you rely on other means to gain assurance like code reviews, static safety (type safety, memory-safe languages, abstraction etc.), manual testing and so on. Stop rubber-stamping PRs and relying on the CI exclusively to catch breakage. If you can't stop developers from merging and breaking things arbitrarily, you have bigger problems than a lack of tests.",

We mocked the database layer (our usage was already abstracted), we also mocked the files system and external dependencies.\n\nThose tests took tops 100ms each, and could run in parallel, so on a dev machine you could easily enable continuous testing and run tests on each save.\n\nThey would catch 99% of the bugs we caught with tests. We had a nice way to for setup, a bit of abstraction for verification - that's where we would also test edge cases.\n\nThe system tests would spin a full VM in the cloud with the whole system installed, and then install our app in that system, trigger some functions and wait until it's done, then query the system to see if the process was executed correctly. That part was easily 20 minutes to an hour, depending on how much resources the VM got from a pool.\n\nI would urge you to go into this process - have tests that run as big part of your system as possible, but with no dependencies (or as few as possible, TestContainers for the win) and have most tests in that form.\n\nUse unit tests to verify some actual business logic (like applying discounts on an invoice or something like that)\n\nUse system test (running as close to prod conditions as possible) only for few scenarios happy path - this can be more if spinning up takes a long time, but tests are relatively short.

      "text": "While working on the formal verification of some software, I was introduced to Shapiro's work and went down a rabbit hole learning about BitC, which I now understand is foundational for the existence of today's Rust. Even though Shapiro made sure to scrub as much as possible any information on the internet about BitC, some writings are still available, like [this](https://danluu.com/bitc-retrospective/) retrospective.\n\nShapiro seems to be very much against the concept of subtyping and inheritance with the only exception of lifetime subtypes. Truth to be told today's rust neither has subtyping nor inheritance, except for lifetimes, preferring a constructive approach instead.\n\nI'm aware that in the univalent type theory in mathematics the relationship of subtyping across kindred types leads to paradoxes and hence is rejected, but I thought this was more relevant to axiomatic formulations of mathematics and not _real_ computer science. \n\nSo why is subtyping/inheritance bad in Shapiro's eyes?  Does it make automatic formal verification impossible, like in homotopy type theory? Can anyone tell me more about this? \n\nAny sources are more than welcome.\n\n**EDIT:** For future reference, [this](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00073205) provides a satisfactory overview of the problem.",

When we split these problems it gets very abstract.\n\n* As way to share an implementation, and to abstract over this shared implementation. This has nothing to do with types really, it just lets us define some common implementation detail that is shared, and then also work on this shared implementation without caring about the nominal semantics that separate the different uses. You can also think of this as finding ways to abstract implementation details into a domain that is easier to translate into others.\n* As a way to define polymorph over [bijections, surjections and injections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection). Here's where you realize why Liskov Substitution Principle is such an important thing when dealing with inheritance. You need to ensure that either given a injections `A->B` any operation on `B` will result in a value for which there's a `B->A` defined (even if it isn't defined for all possible `B` values, e.g. if we define that squares are a subtype of a rectangle, you can't have operations on rectangles that would convert a square into a rectangle secretly, because we have to recover the subtype). And this is where it gets messy, we want to use a non-bijective function as a bijection, and guaranteeing this is true for all valid operations is really hard.\n* As a way to extend multiple implementations centrally. This is kind of a unique mix of both, but with a pragmatic twist that isn't quite covered by either. Basically we want to be able to abstract over a subset of functionality and cover all it's core agreements in one place, while allowing extension of it at a later time. This is kind of the gap that interface default methods wants to cover in Java. Basically when we want to add functionality to all objects that implement some interface, we'd want some default behavior to satisfy, that then the classes can override if they so wish.\n\nBasically the two extension problems are defined as [The Expression Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem) where we want to two things. One is to add a new implementation of some super-type (add a new supertype) without having to recompile or change the super-type itself. Another is to add functionality to the super-type *without having to recompile the sub-type itself* which is the tricky part. And we'd want all of this to work on a level where we can be confident and use the type 'unboxed', that is that all polymorphism and (subtyping) can be taken away and you create optimal code as if it all had been hand-crafted.\n\nAnd yeah I agree with the author, we are getting interesting work done in this areas, but this isn't a \"solved\" problem with a clear answer(s), at least not as far as I know. As the problem gets better defined, and we understand more the challenges and gotchas we are able to find better simple solutions, but until now things will need some level of hackery or quirkiness on top.",

This can sometimes make sense but it’s a VERY strong coupling. You lose tons of flexibility.\n\nOften, composition is better. If B is used as attribute in A, you decide yourself which parts of B you use, so changing A has often no direct effect (unless you change logic, strictly speaking violating OCP which can be ok but be aware!).\n\nAlso each usage of B within A (against the interface) is very explicit. Some user C of A will never be able to use some B method without a change in A -> good.\n\nWith inheritance C can suddenly do things if B was changed if A wasn’t. This effect proliferates along the hierarchy.\n\nAll this is limited to public inheritance. Private/protected inheritances have different meanings and effects. And I left out performance/memory implications like vtables that are relevant only in C++ as well because, well, they are language-specific. Among them is also that languages like Java only allow inheriting from one class, so it’s anyways a one-line extension way (C++ allows more, and extending interfaces in Java also allow more, yes).\n\nBut yeah in short: Inheritance is VERY strong coupling, the strongest there is out there.

While I approach development from a composition-first approach, I take the things that fit this paradigm clearly and consider them for inheritance. If I find I have many such contracts bound by a mostly unchanging purpose with always shared behavior, it’s a strong contender for inheritance. These are also reasons you might start design out purely compositional until you know enough about the patterns to determine what is better suited for inheritance. We simply might not have enough information to understand what is contractual in this manner when we start out. If ever! As always, it depends! But certainly prefer composition over inheritance. Don’t over engineer with a crystal ball.\n\nEdit to add the other reason, sorry:\nAnother is poorly thought out composition. You can end up with deep composition chains. Or as you need to add functionality, you end up with them. That can suck. But I don’t think it’s a good counter-argument to use inheritance instead.. could just be you needed to go about the compositional solution a bit differently. However, if you KNOW there is a strong contract like I described earlier, it removes this problem from the equation.",

The only thing Anthropic got dinged for was having a small portion of books that were torrented in its digital library that hadn't been used in years. Every other piece of copyrighted training material they paid for. \n\nBut you should consider why you are just now considering this when you're using any number of third party services for processing or storing your code, your customer data, your telemetry, and almost everything else you do. The same exact restrictions and legal agreements apply here. Your enterprise should be engaging with a provider's enterprise unit to get an agreement in place, or just use something like AWS Bedrock if you trust AWS more than say OpenAI or Anthropic. But all the big providers are able to easily set up BAAs for standardized compliance like SOC2 and HIPAA (I've done this for clients before. AWS' process is the easiest because it's all automated). \n\n> Also with building something novel these models might struggle a lot and with enough assistance and multiple back and forth if we do get a novel implementation to work, wouldn't it be easier for the model to implement it next time for someone else??\n\nNo. Models don't learn directly from your conversations, they're frozen in place and in most harnesses your context/memory remains local to your or your account and has to be used as context in calls. Continual learning isn't a thing in LLMs (yet).\n\n> are we just making it easier for claude to automate our jobs away?\n\nYour entire career, whether you admit it to yourself or not, is in automating jobs away.

They don't upload your entire codebase: Current coding agents use a ReAct loop where they use some tool (e.g. ls, cat), are fed the result of the tool, then decide on what to do next. Further, they mostly work in two steps: (1) finding relevant information, and (2) doing the edits. The only bits that go to the AI servers are the outputs of the commands above, which are arguably a small subset of your codebase, not its entirety. \n\n2. There's a clear separation between training (what makes the AI learn), and inference (you using the AI). Training is mostly an offline process that takes a long time. The model that you use is mostly static between training runs (e.g. between Claude 3.5 and 4.0). The model doesn't automatically learn as you use it.\n\nOf course, there's room for shenanigans. The company could keep the logs of all your interactions with the model, which includes snippets of your codebase, and use that in the next training runs. That is what the license agreements are mostly protecting against.\n\nNotice I used \"mostly\" a lot, because there are a lot of subtleties to it, but I think this is an overall good picture to think about.\n\nTL;DR: if you are using a respectable provider (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral), I wouldn't worry too much about it.",

Only approved software allowed on workstations (probably typical in some organizations) but in this case the approval process takes months, including for security patches on already approved software. The duration of the approval process isn't an indication of rigor of the vetting in this case. Automated software is used that takes about 10 mins to run before the stamp of approval is given. The remaining time is due to having multiple people required to check a box and pass it along. Most of the time, the process is stuck with someone in the chain and it needs to be escalated to get it moving. There seems to be a disconnected between the need to control the environment and the ability to quickly react to new vulnerabilities with patched software.\n2. Vulnerability checks on internal software libraries set up in *some* internal software project repositories, but are either: a) never run, b) have builds that are permanently broken, c) only run on 'main', d) are used to merely internally *record* vulnerabilities with no priority to fix, upgrade, or replace the library. Although I think it's a good start to identify these things, it appears that in some cases, without follow up, this starts to look like busy work (e.g., l*ook how much time we spent on 'security processes'*) without actually doing something about it.\n3. Vulnerability checks run on 3rd party software only. However, no security testing done on company generated code, even when a company has a dedicated security team. This includes checks for misconfiguration. \n4. Individuals with 'security' in their role's title (not necessarily C-level) being perpetually absent or unavailable from any real life security discussion. This can be either before, during, or after a very specific security problem. Occasionally, these individuals will even have presentations on the company's security internally which rarely reflects reality.\n\nI'm interested to hear if any of this sounds familiar or if I've just had bad luck.

You have to be SOC2 compliant because your customers' vendors have to be SOC2 compliant (because their customers' vendors have to be etc etc).  So, take the spreadsheet, check the box that says you complied.\n\nYou're going to have to slow down work sometimes to address \"critical\" security issues that are actually BS.  Just gotta live with that.  \n\nAnd honestly, I've seen several cases where a developer just didn't understand a legit security issue and tried to incorrectly argue that it was a false alarm.  There's some merit in just following the rule even if you don't know why the rule is in place and/or don't think it's applicable.  \n\nBut yeah, I think a green flag in an organization is if the person in charge of security seems to be actually trying to balance the impact it has on work, and is willing to take the time to try and explain why a measure is necessary.  The guy who just says \"shut up and check the box\", either because he doesn't understand the rule himself or because he doesn't want to take the time to explain, is a red flag.\n\nI think at the end of the day, a lot of actual security work is being done by people with really niche expertise that can't be scaled, so the only way to effectively make companies across the industry comply is to bring in box-checkers and try to provide them with a reasonable set of guidelines to enforce; so you're pretty much always going to have to deal with this problem.",

I can’t speak for the folks OP refers to or others in this thread but like you said in most cases we’re well intentioned. I don’t take pleasure in slowing folks down, and we’re human like everyone else\n\nWe’re also almost always one of the last people to know that $securityThing is needed. I show up to a meeting and it turns out they need $securityThing next week, but literally everyone else present knew about it for a year+. And now you get a solution thrown into production from procurement, to design, to review (also hastily done), no PoC, and now in production.. likely checking a box that customers care about. \n\nAnother challenge is hiring more experienced security folks. Guys worth their salt that truly understand developers pain cost as much as developers.. but they also don’t make you any money \n\nOn the topic of devs doing insecure stuff… unfortunately they don’t yell at the dev (not that anybody should be yelling).. they yell at me . Trust me, I’d love to leave you to your devices. I think beyond your typical vpn, endpoint monitoring, domain joining, and other network/cloud based tooling, we shouldn’t need to block devs much at the local level. But the dev goes and publishes a password for the umpteenth time, and now I’m getting yelled at for the umpteenth time. I tell them don’t do that, they roll their eyes because security is not in their job description and they’re not the ones whose livelihood is on the line if something happens. So now the annoying scanner is here and it takes longer to deploy. \n\nThe best orgs I’ve seen makes security everyone’s job. Having security champs embedded in dev and OPs teams to help make more secure services together as well as extending the function of security to catch these things early. Shifting left: get security involved early. If you’re adding new infra and other components involving permissions, networking, etc, get them in for a threat model review ASAP whether that’s the champs or the security team themselves. Get your management to buy in as well. Of course this is some pie in the sky stuff. Part of it is also just being in the “right” place. Where I’m at plenty of security are former devs. The scanner isn’t only for main, but for any branch. They provide hardened images for us to pull from for our OSes.  As long as it’s not explicitly black listed or pops the anti-virus, put whatever you want on your local machine… but in my experience in a lot of places, whatever bad things that can be done, will be done if you don’t try to restrict it. It’s all of a talent, management, and collaboration problem",

Not necessarily just in security but in other areas too like architecture. I find that in some companies, 'Everyone is responsible for X' turns into a diffusion of responsibility where no one does anything because someone else is going to do it or because no one is going to come asking questions to them specifically if it doesn't get done or if the decision later turns out poorly.\n\nPerhaps it's just a luck of the draw for what a specific company culture values as to whether it grows into real responsibility or not. This is part of why I asked the question, was to see what was 'normal' or 'typical' to see if I need to adjust my expectations around this stuff.",

There are lots of optional specifications with various different interpretations that is ultimately driving developers to add more and more hacks into their implementations, and before you say \"never roll your own auth\", have you considered that the people behind your favorite auth libraries are also adding these hacks? Just because it's abstracted away doesn't mean there aren't hacks in the implementations.\n\nImplicit flow is one of my greatest pet peeves. Everyone says it's bad practice and inherently insecure to pass tokens in the browser URL, but if we were to force auth-code flow in ALL apps tomorrow, there is certainly going to be some major pushback. Furthermore, Some providers provide an `expires_in` and some just rely on the service to poll the token until they get an error before retrieving another token.\n\nThe lack of care given to validating tokens on the client side doesn't bother me as much, but it does concern me. Most will at the very least, check for expiration and issuer. Signing Keys is a hit or miss, some will check it, and some rely on the \"inherent security\" of the auth code flow or  [checks signature validity but not the signing certificate](https://docs.goauthentik.io/sys-mgmt/certificates/#certificate-considerations)\n\nDoes this bother anyone else?\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more widespread breaches just from the lackluster implementation of OAuth as a standard.",

With new job ( 5 months in), I feel more disoriented now than ever and it’s stressing me out and making silly mistakes at work. All these are intensifying my stress levels\n\nMy initial plan was to coast as Senior Engineer as long as possible. But now I feel incapable of doing that too.\n\nNow I am thinking of 3 options:\n\n1. Quit my job, take a break and focus on my health. But this option is making me anxious due to gap and also it fears me that I will be dreading to go back to work.\n\n2. Start as Junior engineer which will lessen the load. That means down leveling my career briefly. But this may look bad on my resume and if I state the down leveling is due to health, my hiring options may be limited.\n\n3. Finding a company with lesser work load and good WLB. But it’s very difficult to find a company with good WLB in India as everything is very competitive and WLB is non existent.\n\nSo out of 3 options, I am leaning towards the 2nd option, but not sure how to carry out the career conversations. \n\nSo seeking for experience in this scenario\n\n",

Once I got on hypertension medicines around ~35, I went years without having a migraine after that.\n\nPoint being the migraine may be triggered by stress of work but be compounded by hypertension and/or diet and lack of exercise.\n\nAdvice\n\n- Get checked out if you haven't by the doc.\n- Excercise is critical and aerobic exercise should be done for 15 minutes.\n   - Consider working out between coding sessions to turn off your brain and mitigate daily work stress.\n- Removal of sugar (for me I did by 90% at least sugary drinks and candy) from my diet gave me more afternoon energy that was sapping my mental work. Aka gave me more mental more endurance.\n   - Check your A1C and get it lowered if you are in the upper zones.\n\n---\n\nObviously what worked for me may not work for you, but at minimum lessoning your stress either mentally by offloading the work stress to the \"I don't care let them fire me\" bucket and at minimum upping your exercise and/or modify your diet may help you navigate this better.\n\n---\n\nChanging jobs may lower the stress, but a lower to mid level programming job is just a different kind of stress and not worth the jump. Find a different work culture with the skills you have.",

Plus relational dbms are old and lame!\n2. I guess we need to model user profile data in our system too, we probably ought to make a second collection for that...\n3. Now that we have more users in our system, these lookups between our 20 collections are really slow. We keep running into weird concurrency issues and janky manual rollback code bugs since we have to manage our own transactions. Updates are really hard to write too since our data is now denormalized across so many different places, and migration and ETL scripts are a nightmare!\n4.

Zero downtime upgrades and mirroring are other good features.\n\nMostly, I think the major difference is in the _mindset_ of the developers, though. I've worked with quite a few people over the years whose default mental model of a software system is pretty much \"a reactive stream of Java objects\", and if that is how you think of it, then Mongo is a pretty obvious solution.

Mongo backups are inconsistent by default and without replication (yes shocking)\n2. We suddenly hit 2MB per document limit in a totally unexpected way ",

There is no Postgres equivalent that I know of. We have a bunch of different aggregate queries for creating things like session replay, statistics, visualizations, etc and Atlas has been very helpful in detecting slow queries and optimizing them.\n\nLastly, maybe I'm just an amateur, but I find it easier to write the MongoDB queries than SQL queries. Especially since the SQL queries really depend on having a good database architecture in place first. We also track new parameters pretty frequently and I'm very thankful I don't have to do migrations.\n\nI think the key with Mongo is staying focused.

      "text": "Hello everyone,\nI wanted to share some thoughts and get your perspective.\n\nI’m a software developer with about 5 years of experience. Early in my career I was very motivated and strongly believed that, by rigorously applying software engineering principles, I would eventually reach a solid level of control over the systems I was building. Clean code, logical models, separation of concerns: the goal was to reduce entropy as much as possible.\n\nIn the first years I made simple mistakes: I studied them, improved, and could clearly see progress. Over time, however, I started noticing a recurring pattern: there is always something that’s not quite right. Not necessarily critical bugs. Sometimes it’s a small UI detail, sometimes a requirement interpreted differently by the client. Each time you raise the bar, add more checks, learn, improve… but the loop never really ends.\n\nWhat I struggle with the most is not the request itself, but the feeling it triggers. Even when the work is objectively correct, when I’m asked to “fix” something — even a very minor detail — I experience it as a kind of micro-failure. Rationally, I know iteration is normal, but emotionally that request reopens something that, in my mind, was already closed.\n\nOver time I’ve also realized that much of the theory I once internalized as “law” is actually highly heuristic. Working under tight deadlines, on legacy systems inherited from others and poorly designed, theory only partially fits reality. The gap between the ideal and the real always remains visible.\n\nAfter years of thinking that I just needed to keep improving my skills, I’m starting to believe that a certain amount of chaos is intrinsic to the field itself. I’m not questioning the importance of professional growth — I’ll definitely keep doing that — but it seems to me that software, by its nature, never really allows for total control or a true sense of closure.\n\nDo you relate to this experience?\nDo you ever experience requests for adjustments as a sense of incompleteness or failure, even when the work is done well?\nIs this something that fades with time, or does it simply change in how you learn to live with it?\n\n\n@note: Thanks to everyone for the advice, you’ve been genuinely helpful.

A lead UX designer told me this during a rough burnout patch: the code doesn't truly belong to us, it belongs to the company. As much as we're the creators, we're not the permanent owners. That shift in perspective has made it easier to handle change requests after I've marked something as \"done\", it was never really done, it was just the current iteration.\n\nI won't lie and say the feeling has completely faded. I'm still working through it myself. But I do think there's a certain amount of chaos that's intrinsic to modern software development. The pressure to constantly deliver, legacy systems, tight deadlines.. it all creates an environment where \"perfect\" is mostly impossible. Learning not to fight that reality has been more helpful in coping in my experience. These days I aim for ~80% perfection on my work, so that I can reduce any potential burn out or stress on myself. It's tough to reprogram yourself to do it, but it does help in time. \n\nSo yeah, I think you learn to live with it rather than waiting for it to fade.

You'll probably have more luck dealing with it by taking some psychedelics and listening to Alan Watts then you will trying to read more books on design patterns.\n\nI have a friend who works in the law and they were telling me about someone they knew who was very smart and competent but really struggled once they got into the field. They excelled in law school because there all the problems center around past cases with \"definitive\" results. Once they got into the real world they had a hard time dealing with cases where things are messy and there wasn't always some precedent in place that gave a perfect answer to that specific situation.\n\nSame thing with programming. When you're in school you're given problems that have \"known solutions\" and clear guidelines because the requirements are written by computer scientists trying to teach a concept. In the real world you need to deal with users and clients who don't really know what they want, don't know how to communicate what they want in a technical way, and who change their minds all the time. And like you said, you need do all this work in the context of external pressures like deadlines and legacy software that needs you to do things in a certain way even if it's not \"ideal\".\n\nThis is why I get annoyed with software engineer/developers who are so dismissive of more creative/artistic classes. If you actually take arts courses, especially after the intro level, you'll know that a big part of what they teach is how to think creatively, how to approach problems, and how to stop that urge to keep working on something until it's \"perfect\". Those skills are absolutely valuable in programming because it's a very creative field, even if it isn't strictly an art like painting or sculpture.

That's how they work. They know the problem they are trying to solve, they know the projected load and they build it (or often just design it) and they're done.\n\nBecause of that, and because of the life and death consequences of their decisions they can have hard and fast, resign if someone tells you different, rules. Yes, they'll \"future proof\" things but no one expects an mechanical engineer to build an engine for a go-kart that can be scaled to a cruise ship.\n\nThat's problem one.\n\nProblem two is an offshoot of problem one. Because we are \"engineers\" we must have rules so as an industry we've gone searching for them. We've taken patterns which we're explicitly **never** intended to be hard and fast rules and turned them into things you build systems out of without thinking or analysis because that's what engineers do.\n\nWe've taken architecture patterns written in the 90's for a type of software development that no longer exists and applied them mindlessly ignoring all the changes in technology and more importantly tooling that have occurred since.\n\nAnd on top of those things we have created a culture of promotion as fast as possible, even though those new titles have long since stopped having any actual meaning so we've turned the above crap into check boxes for promotion that, like the promotions themselves have lost all meaning.\n\nTL:DR\n\nThe ideal state you're trying to achieve was never ideal in the first place, it was made from rules never intended to be rules and observations of a past that aren't true. That's why you can't make them work in real life, because they don't and never did work (at least not the way we use them).",

I (really learned) ~all of the Neetcode 150 and it was sufficient for all my interviews.

I'm one of those people that are happy when they can be out for a walk and thinking about a problem. You only get that when you actually give a shit about what you're working on. You'll hear the argument of \"they don't give a shit about you, so why should you give a shit about the work,\" and IMO if that's your argument, go be a plumber (pun, jabs intended). \n\nI work on stuff that is interesting to me, and I always try to find things that interest me. I can't see wanting to constantly looking for a job just so I could be judged by some asshole that spends their entire time googling or leaning on AI to solve their problems, but they work for a big company and have a cushy salary, so they must be smarter than me, right? I know what my talent is, and as long as I can put it to use, I'll happily avoid the 90% of judgmental asshats that work for these \"lucrative\" companies. \n\nThis whole leetcode culture never made any sense to me. We don't use it when interviewing. I actually don't really care to ask you to write code. I ask you point blank questions that I expect you to answer right there. I'm not even really looking to see if it's the right answer, I'm instead looking for honesty and passion. If you're the kind of person that is a natural problem solver and humble, you'll admit when you don't know something and it'll be clear how insignificant that is, because you'll figure it out. If I have to go through an experience like college, taking tests to get a job when I've been doing this for 20 years, I don't even want the fucking job. If you're not going to ask me about what I've worked on, which is the most important thing we should be talking about, because then you'll see my passion for my work, then I don't even want to work with you.\n\nSo, long story short, IMO those places that you're failing to join because you didn't pass some arbitrary test are not the kind of place I want to work.

If it's the latter, I'm probably not interested in working there anyway, so it's a blessing in disguise.\n\nIf you're not answering their questions in the way they want, then there's two explanations in my point of view: you don't have the skill they are looking for or they are unrealistic in the candidates they're looking for. Neither one of those scenarios defines a situation I want to work in, because I'm either not qualified or they're a bunch of elitist folks I have zero interest in working with.",

          "text": "Unless you are very slow I kind of doubt  it’s speed of doing the leet code. If you are finishing with the good/optimized answer that’s enough. You don’t score points for finishing 30 minutes early. You might however lose points for not explaining your thought process clearly enough. So unless you aren’t finishing take a step back and confirm that speed is actually the issue. I do very well in interviews and I rarely finish more than maybe 10 minutes before the end of the interview (that’s usually when people plan for you to finish) and I only actually write the fully optimal answer maybe 70% of the time. I usually write and explain the realistic answer then tell them how to get from that to the optimal one. \n\nAgree to disagree that algorithms are idiotic. I have found at staff level knowing them has actually come up multiple times. And at this point I’m basically an SRE. \n\nI actually think that position might be why you don’t know the edge cases of the system design. Most edge cases are actually usually related to some really specific piece of how a system works. A system design interview isn’t testing that you know that thing it’s testing that you know how to think about that problem. So for example if someone asked why you would use weighted random over round robin or least outstanding requests it’s useful to know a bit about why those algorithms actually work. But you can ask follow up questions to the interviewer to get more info about the edge case to help you determine how to solve for it. \n\nThe one that comes up the most for me personally is dfs and bfs searches. But that might be industry related or just how I solve problems. \n\nWhat I can say is I think that you are likely too focused on the exact right answer and not focused enough on proving you can effectively work with other people. I’ve failed plenty of people who can parrot the textbook to me because they can’t actually talk to me about the problem. I’m not hiring someone to lock in a closet I’m hiring someone to help out the junior engineer that needs to upgrade sqlalchemy. \n\nAlso just a side note. I assume you are just complaining because it’s Reddit. But if you are giving the complaint about the other engineers as the reason you want a job swap it out. Without proof it is not possible to tell if they are the problem or you are, and you don’t want to make an interviewer guess.",

Management was constantly getting feedback from customers who were leaving due to our service being unreliable. They used to request from the developers to make our system more stable, but somehow could never accept the high cost in their eyes to do the work.\n\nIn my eyes the root cause of technical debt is a communication problem between developers and management. Developers experience the pain of the technical debt directly, but often can't make the decision to prioritise it. Managers choose what to prioritise but to them technical debt is like dark matter - it is not directly visible but only visible through the effects on team velocity down the line. That's why they can't understand the cost and deprioritise it until it becomes too late.\n\nIs this how it feels in your work? How do you manage to successfully show to your managers that technical debt is a real problem?",

It all sounds like a reasonable way to plan work until you realize phase 2 is never going to happen until it's a fire. They just played games to not crush the SWEs spirit.\n\nYet, they constantly preach things like thinking through problems to address potential issues early.

Technical Debt is meant to be taken on as an explicit decision when, like a home mortgage, the debt is a useful and overall beneficial instrument that facilitates the business goals of the software being implemented.  \n  \nToo many people now think it just means \"slapdash code written by dingdongs who didn't know any better that we have yet to go clean up after because we don't have time right now OMG how is there so much of this spaghetti now?!!!\" That's not Technical Debt that's just crap code and a problem with your team's skill set and/or project management. A buildup of that kind of liability should never be allowed. If that's happening that's a Stop the Line event. Stop everything until it's fixed. That project cannot, by definition, be successfully sustained.\n\nAnd by fixed I mean in the Martin Fowler's \"Refactoring\" sense. Make explicit decisions and a plan. Define change boundaries, contain what can't or shouldn't be changed or changed yet with appropriate test scaffolding (ensure there are some kind of interfaces / contracts defined by those test that the refactored code will interact with only in the same way the legacy piece already expects). Don't just charge in and start changing stuff to improve it. You've already got a fragile system, a patient in ICU on life support. Keeping them stable is critical as you work to save them. Where the most new extensions need to go, stop and make those areas easy to extend. Then you can start extending them in feature developments while continuing to judiciously refactor elsewhere, getting back to a limp and a walk on the way to running again.\n\nREAL Technical Debt isn't a dirty word. It exists because it was useful to our most important goals to create it...and so we actually chose to! Yes, we should have a plan to go back and repay ourselves the loan, but that shouldn't feel bad. It should feel like oh good, I get to have a place to live now, even though I pay a mortgage with an interest rate that was worth it in the end.",

That's a defect.\n* Technical debt is the condition of the code that otherwise works but is difficult to modify or maintain.\n* The root of the problem stems from the fact that the compiler works just as well on shitty code as great code.\n* Developers are usually ultra fixated in getting something working. This is the right thing to do.\n* But even the best developers create code that is difficult to work with.\n* The problem is we tell management: \"It's working, but I need some time to clean it up\", like its an option. Managers just hear: \"It's working\". \n* In Extreme Programming, where the concept of technical debt really came into common use, technical debt doesn't even bubble up to management. You don't tell management you're working on it. It's not their concern. The state of the code is the domain of developers.\n* You also don't approach technical debt as a large re-do. You chip away at it a little at a time as part of your normal, everyday work. Here's the part where it's our fault: Most developers are more comfortable with re-writing something than gradually improving it. That's a skills/experience problem.\n* Addressing technical debt is a boy scout \"leave your campsite a little better than you found it\" thing. \n\n  \nBottom line: Stop talking about technical debt to your managers.

That's the technical debt; adjusting in the scope of the whole system to avoid compounding emergent issues.\n\nThis is why (for example) in embedded realtime systems for say, missiles, you have much greater constraints many of which are designed to decrease the emergent outcomes as independently rigorous modules are combined. Doing things this way is hard. Building web applications (for example) while constraining complexity is harder still.\n\nWithout organisation wide buy-in for constant whole-system engineering, and the costs associated, things will and do rot with every change at time T where T+1 has unknowns.

Note: this strategy won't work for really L/XL pieces of debt, but a team with a culture that follows the Boy Scout rule of \"leave every campsite cleaner than you found it\" will have a much easier time of staying on top of debt and preventing problems from festering. \n* Or alternatively, you need to align the debt work with some other big business initiative, e.g. if your customers are demanding a V2 product anyways, then it's probably a good time to argue that \"Oh yes product managers, we agree that your V2 vision is going to be amazing, and because it is so amazing certainly it deserves an amazing upgraded backend architecture too! We wouldn't want to hamstring your new amazing V2 vision by building on top of a subpar V1 foundation, right?\" Note: there is a huge world of difference between, aligning the tech debt work with the product goal, vs the much worse but regrettably common failure mode of communication where an engineering team instead takes the tack of \"no bloody way, there's no fucking way we can build V2, not until we fix all the terrible crimes in the V1 codebase\" (in the former you are perceived as helping the company achieve its goals, and in the latter you are perceived as being a blocker/detractor who is stopping the company from doing what it wants).",

This is not to be confused with a poorly designed system, which is buggy or poorly performing code that is not easier of quicker to make than an alternative. \n\nManaging technical debt means making sure that management is aware of trade-offs. Make it explicit that in order to hit some deadline, that means you \\*will not\\* expand it or scale it. When they inevitably ask you to do so, then it becomes urgent and that is when it is prioritized. Push harder on features that you know will need to scale or be extended, as that is \"bad\" debt, but it is totally fine to have technical debt on something that isn't likely to need scale or be extended. \n\nUnfortunately, none of that is really useful to you right now, as you are paying interest on the technical debt, and management isn't willing to pay it down, so it will continue to get worse.

Every line of code you write, is technical debt. It may be a microscopic amount, or it could be a lot. Every line of code you write today, could have some impact on some unknown feature you build tomorrow. The amount and effect of this debt can be compounded by things like unclear requirements, poor roadmap planning, time & budget, etc.\n\n>That's why they can't understand the cost and deprioritise it until it becomes too late.\n\nThis is the problem. If you believe like me that every line of code you write is some form of technical debt, then continuous improvement is paramount. Companies are so focused on *outputs* (the features we build) and making sure we deliver faster... and focus less on *outcomes.* Tech Debt is a cost center... you're asking the company to invest time in things that aren't new features... for many organizations, that's a tough pill to swallow.",

Great software companies understand this. I should clarify, I'm not for changing codebases for the sake of codebases, but most developers know where the debt lies and good developers know exactly when they are adding it.

          "text": "When [Ward Cunningham first introduced technical debt](https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html), it was primarily about code quality. Poor architectural and design decisions embodied in the code make working with it harder. Sometimes, you ship with those poor decisions because delivering working software and getting feedback means you know if you've built the right thing before you polish it.\n\n[Martin Fowler has a good write-up about technical debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html), too. I like his phrasing around \"cruft\", \"deficiencies in internal quality\", and working with the system. This broadens the definition beyond just the code, since \"the system\" encompasses other things. However, it still draws a distinction between internal quality (which affects the developing organization and teams) and external quality (which affects customers and users).\n\nIf your system isn't meeting reliability requirements, then you have deficiencies in external quality.\n\nAs far as where technical debt comes from, [Martin Fowler wrote about the concept of technical debt quadrants](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html). To give a few examples:\n\n1. Only automating the happy path test cases could deliver faster, but until the other test cases are automated, you have a higher risk of regression. Maybe it's prudent to get that faster feedback, but the team will be slower to make changes without the safety net of rapid test feedback.\n2. You may have found new technology, but the team doesn't have much experience with it. They are going to learn the right and wrong way by building with it. It could be better for the system in the long run, over using deprecated technology that the team is more familiar with, but they'll also be running into the idea that they should [plan to throw one away](https://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway). If they didn't build a throwaway prototype, the one that gets thrown away and replaced will be the one in production. It's prudent to use this new technology in the long run, but the team will inadvertently make mistakes and poor choices that need to be fixed later.\n3. When schedule pressure forces the team to choose between just-enough architecture and design and throwing something out there, they will make reckless decisions that make it harder to work with the system.\n4. Sometimes, you don't have the knowledge and skills on the team. People are in over their heads. They ship something, but it's not a solid foundation. It's reckless to have a team without the necessary knowledge and skills, and inadvertent in that they don't know the right way to do things.\n\nPaying down technical debt can be done in discrete tasks - small, independent, deliverable units of work. You can capture these units of work just like features and bugs. However, unlike features and bugs, where the stakeholder impacted by their delivery is a downstream customer or user of the system, the stakeholder in the paydown of technical debt would be the development team. You may not be able to identify all technical debt (especially of the inadvertent time, until you know the right thing to do or the right question to ask), but you can keep track of all of the deliberate choices that you made that you know you have to revisit, as well as whenever you learn a better way to address a problem. Once you have these units of work, you can express the value to the team in solving them, often in terms of system characteristics like maintainability, testability, and portability. Being able to associate the technical debt with key features or architectural elements of the system can help surface it when it's appropriate, since you only pay interest on the debt when you work on a part of the system with it.\n\nYou'll see the effects of technical debt in two places. First, when working on a part of the system with technical debt, you'll have a decrease in throughput and an increase in cycle time. It will take longer to complete work as you deal with the debt, either paying it down without planning or by working around it and continuing to build on a shaky foundation. Second, technical debt that isn't addressed may surface as externally visible defects, as you found through your user feedback and customers leaving the service. Being able to tie technical debt to decreased throughput or external quality issues makes it very visible to management.",

All sins derive from the simple fact that most management has either a superiority complex or a complete lack of trust in their development teams, not without some justification. The stereotypical INTx developer usually (*not all*) struggles with effectively framing and communicating the uncertainty that comes with servicing the engines while in flight. Don’t blame agile. If your strategy is waterfall, the plane never takes off. However, management is sitting in 1st class oblivious to the engines on fire.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things across my career was the constant revisiting and ignoring of basic engineering principles. The very definition of madness: doing the same thing every time and expecting different results.\n\nOh and quit blaming AI.

Oversee work and take your time. \n\nIf you get pushed by management, respond with an explanation that rushing will lead to tomorrows legacy/technical debt. If that does not work, consider switching.

Everytime that I change jobs, I believe a large source of my success has been through my journaling habit.\n\n---\n\nI loathe to sound like an unemotional robot, but when journaling I keep track of two things:\n\n* Situation Task Action Result (Result measured with a \"proper metric\" as you're able to, not everything has a good measure that's worthwhile/easy to obtain)\n* Notable Social Interactions (think situations for behavioral interview questions)\n\nI carve out a few minutes on my work calendar every day to journal, and for the most part I do actually do it. To take my notes about work and make them more formal in my journal. This becomes figurative gold when it comes to:\n\n* End of year self-reviews\n* Requested reviews of peers or bosses\n* Resume writing\n* Future interviews\n\nIt's all a means to an end. Especially in a tough job market, I find that I customize my resume a bit more for job postings because of the plethroa of options that I have to pull from.\n\nFurthermore, During interviews I find that the fact that I even keep a work journal like this is a boon sharing that I do this habit for some hiring managers. It's a way to show introspection in my own career.\n\nLastly, generally describing work issues/achievements for my own personal record hasn't ever turned into an issue. I'm not a lawyer, don't steal code/propriatery stuffs. Usually I message with my manager and HR to have a record of this being approved that I forward to my personal email. And, if they want me to I even offer to send copies of what I'm writing.\n\n---\n\n### Question:\n\nIf you keep a work journal, is there other information that you capture that I didn't touch on?\n\nI keep a seperate `Notes` in which I have code copy pasted and use more of a scratch-pad / reference for my day to day job. For emphasis, those notes stay 100% corporate side. I make a clear distinction between `Notes` and `Journal`. But I don't think there's much more what I can journal than what I described above?",

My org uses a pretty standard Java backend & React-based frontend. There's nothing special about it, and my team mostly writes a domain-specific app built into the wider company platform using standard (and some custom built) integrations.\n\nAnyway, all that to say, it's good work, and I like it, and I'm happy with my company/org/team (and vice-versa). However, it only offers so much variety in the sorts of technical problems I get to solve, and the tech stack itself is rather pedestrian. I did get into software engineering because it always fascinated me, and I really love the technical side of things. My 40 hours a week is *usually* enough to keep me feeling satisfied. Lately, though, I've had a stronger itch than usual, and been wanting to try out some personal projects, learn some new tech, even dive into more theoretical CS-y things.\n\nUndergrad was great because I could go deep on whatever interested me just through taking classes. I never much had personal side projects then, though, because I got enough out of my coursework and extracurriculars. I've dabbled a *tiny* bit before in trying to learn some new languages with different paradigms, but nothing stuck. Usually it just feels too artificial. I like to have some sort of problem solving to go with it instead of just \"memorize some syntax\" or something, but it's hard to come up with those problems on my own. So I've just never developed the skills needed to learn on my own.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions, or strategies they use? Like, ways to generate ideas for side projects if you want to get hands-on, or resources for teaching yourself something new (including learning about what topics are even out there to explore).\n\nIt feels like such a silly thing to ask, but I think it'd do me well for both my career and my personal satisfaction to work on these tools, to keep the intellectual spark alive.\n\nETA: A little late, but I've read all the replies! Thanks everyone for the suggestions. These are all some helpful pointers, and it's nice to get some insight and direction.",

After another 15 years, I still scrape the hackurls list to keep an eye for what's out there and look for inspiration.  But most of the time it is younger devs that are mentioning things to me to play with or learn.  I no longer spend as much of my free time playing with things at home.  But I still advocate for at least one career learning goal a year with my manager where I can allocate at least 4 hours a week on that.  \n\nWe're now drowning in options to upskill, from applications, web sites, to many social media options.  And bigger employers are usually pretty happy to pay to open doors for you to gain access to skills they'd like you to have and may even have internal training paths either to get what you need for a promotion or other desired skills.\n\nAnd yet even with the huge variety of different languages and frameworks I've used, there is still a handful of old reliable tech that has dominated most of my work time.  Companies like tech that just works.  Pushing the bleeding edge is expensive and risky.  If that is more your speed, you can either hitch your wagon to a startup star or chase after grant money in academia.",
