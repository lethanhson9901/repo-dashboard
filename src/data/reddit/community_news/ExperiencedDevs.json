I was that guy pushing to rewrite stuff in Rust because it was trending then, wanted to use some experimental database I found on Github with 200 stars because the readme said it was web scale. Got into legitimate arguments about framework choices that in hindsight did not matter even a little bit.\n\nThen I became the person who had to fix things when they broke. Oh you wanted to try that new message queue? Cool, hope you enjoy debugging why it randomly loses messages at 2am. That distributed database you read about on Hacker News? Awesome, except now deploys take 6 hours and nobody knows why.\n\nAt some point I just got tired. Tired of explaining to product why we're three sprints behind because we're fighting our own infrastructure. Tired of being the only person who understands how some piece of critical infrastructure works because we picked something obscure.\n\nNow I'm boring as hell and I love it. Postgres? Yeah sure. Proven message systems? Absolutely. Things that have documentation written by humans who actually use the product? Sign me up.\n\nYou can still build cool shit with boring technology. Actually you can build way cooler shit because you're not spending half your time debugging your infrastructure instead of writing features.\n\nAnyway yeah, I'm officially old and boring now. My infrastructure should be so reliable I literally forget it exists. Save the excitement for the product.",

And people who love assembling infrastructure and conveyor belts on which to place the black boxes of products often don't care at all what's in the boxes.\n\nI do not get excited about product.

The reasons are exactly the same as why OP suggests embracing proven mature tech: reliability and predictable behavior are king.  \n\nApache, MySQL, and PHP peaked before we learned many painful but valuable lessons about webserver, DB, and framework/language design. Often their mistakes were *how* we learned -- or drove the industry moving in different directions.  Some of those problems cannot truly be fixed retroactively.\n\nIn this day and age, Postgres is better than MySQL in almost every way... and I say this as someone who has gone DEEP in MySQL and DBs in general.  Similarly the alternatives to Apache are generally stronger -- whether it's different webservers (Nginx etc) or alternative architectures such as static CDN-hosted assets + API servers or lambdas.  PHP hasn't aged quite so badly, but other mature languages are stronger on readability and encouraging maintainable practices.",

Let’s build a big centralized system, now let’s split into tiny pieces, now monoliths are great….\n\nOf course it’s a generalization since every iteration improves on the last one but the reality is mostly simple and we’ve discovered everything about 30 years ago: there’s no perfect solutions so it’s a compromise. Sometimes it annoys us one aspect so we change architectures to fix it, then other problem becomes more annoying and we go back to the initial architecture… \n\nAnd don’t get me started on speed of development… so many frameworks promising faster development and yes, for that nice video tutorial they are faster but then you get into troubles and just waste more time overall.

You guys realize that you're just writing random spammy SQL that will confound your database team for years to come, right? And that now you have to maintain the database schema in TWO places (in the database, and in the ORM you implement), right? And when the queries break, instead of being able to foist that job onto the database team while you work on something else, you'll have to debug both your code and the database schema just to figure out what's going on? The problem was never that SQL is difficult to deal with, the problem was that *databases* of any substantial complexity are difficult to deal with.\n\nAnd then there's AI, which I don't totally object to, but my prompts keep it very tightly controlled. Even when I do so, I find later on that it did something stupid, like create the exact same method in two different files, which I didn't notice because I only saw that the code was correct, not that it was in the wrong file.\n\nAnd then there's the infinite JavaScript frameworks, where I remember being interviewed as to whether I knew Angular.js (the original version) at the height of its popularity in 2016, and then watch its popularity decline rapidly as it was deprecated for the new version.

Another aspect is that in this situation, the only place to edit schema is in the ORM, not in any of these databases. Contrariwise, when you have several applications talking to a central database or databases, where they all need to share a common set of data, stored procedures are to be preferred, as they act as an API that enforces all consumers to be limited to valid database actions. An ORM in the later case would imply that any change to the database schema to also be implemented in the dozens of applications using the database via ORM.\n\n",

      "text": "I work for a company where I'm the only software engineer. My work is very niche, and about a third of the company's business depends on the projects I deliver.\n\nI have been working with this company for 3 years, and they'd been my client for 9 years prior. Up until two months ago, my boss was one of the two company owners. However, two months ago they hired a new manager to be my boss. She manages myself and 3 others who are not developers. She worked as a manager of engineering teams at her previous jobs.\n\nSo far, every one of our 1:1s has only been negative feedback for me, given in a somewhat scathing/demeaning manor. I have received zero positive feedback. I am taking it on the chin and am doing my best to apply everything she is asking. There is no acknowledgement of progress.\n\nI have asked for candid feedback from my teammates, and while they had minor points to share, the severity or quantity does not match what my manager is expressing.\n\nIn addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory. \n\nMy assumption is that the company owners want to fire me, and they have instructed my new manager to set me up for failure so that they have cause. But this confuses me, as they have not hired anyone new and the company would be screwed without me as we are in the middle of large projects that only I can do.\n\nFor context, I am not perfect. I have issues with communication and availability. I do not miss deadlines however. And my manager has acknowledged consistently that my work is top-quality. I am known in our little bubble of our little industry, I have spoken at conferences, and we have gained work from Fortune 25 companies as a direct result. They hire us just for my expertise (I'm not particularly skilled, but again my work is niche). In addition, our team has won awards for my work at these conferences.\n\nWhile I genuinely appreciate the manager's feedback, the severity and manner is causing me more stress than I can handle.\n\nWhat do I do? I have never applied for a job. In 22 years, I have only been offered work and employment. A few weeks ago a competing company offered me a job, but I like the people and the work here. I don't want a change.",

Why do you think that is?  Based on your statement, your manager likely isn't qualified for the job and sees you as a threat who will eventually expose them since you're the only one who would be able to identify that they have no idea what they are doing.  Your manager is trying to get rid of the threat, but they aren't savvy enough to understand what it would mean for the business if they actually get you fired.  Perhaps this is wrong, but if your manager isn't providing any sort of coaching to solve the negative feedback, at some point only one of you is going to be working at the company, and it's not going to depend on whether you jump through their hoops to address the feedback since they aren't giving you a way to do it.  I'd say your best bet would be to reach out to your old manager for casual conversation and eventually broach the subject of your past performance and ask if there was anything they thought you could have improved upon while they were your manager, and if they have nothing negative segue into your current performance feedback asking for advice on how to improve.  If anything, this will give you information on where the owner stands on wanting you around without explicitly asking if they want to fire you, and if they have no idea what your manager is doing, it will give them some breadcrumbs to start paying more attention.",

Like, message me at 7pm within my first month to tell me to get on slack so he could yell about something levels of toxic. That was the closest I’ve ever come to just quitting a job with nothing else lined up. Luckily in my case it was just a single rotten apple and every other manager I’ve worked with at the company is awesome. But a toxic manager really does a lot of damage to your health, even if you know deep down they’re in the wrong you can’t help but still feel inadequate",

Your assumption might be right but there's another possibility that's more common. New managers coming into a role where someone has been operating independently for years almost always feel threatened by the person who doesn't need them. You've been running this for 12 years between client and employee. \n\nShe showed up two months ago. You know more about the work, the clients, and the business than she ever will. Some managers handle that with curiosity. Others handle it by establishing dominance. Sounds like you got the second kind. \n\nThe fact that she acknowledges your work is top quality while giving you nothing but negative feedback in 1:1s is the tell. If the work was actually bad she'd be talking about the work. She's talking about process and communication because those are the things she can control and you can't easily defend against. Here's what I'd do. Document everything. Every 1:1, every piece of feedback, your response, what you changed. Not to build a legal case but because if this escalates you want a clear record that shows you took feedback seriously and improved. Right now it's her word against yours and she's the manager. Talk to the owners directly. Not to complain about her. Frame it as a check-in. \n\n\"I want to make sure I'm aligned with where you see my role going.\" If they're trying to push you out you'll feel it in that conversation. If they're not, you just planted a flag that says you're engaged and paying attention. And take that competing offer seriously.

Ask her to explain the things she has been saying in your 1:1s in front of the owner (s). She will either stutter out something very different than she has been saying to you, giving you the chance to call her out for changing her feedback.

It might be the case that the manager is very bad, and wants to manifest the power she has over you; don't re-interpret her actions as company actions unless you're 100% sure that's the case.\n\nDon't offer the control of your employment to her. If you offer the control and you leave by your choice, she will pay zero consequences for your dismissal. After all, it was your choice that you left. Nobody will ask you about your side of the story because you won't be there anymore. Her side of the story will be the official story. She can't just fire you on her whim; she needs to document it somehow. She needs to have arguments against you. Somebody *will* ask her at some point \"why do you want to fire this guy\". Think about what could those arguments be, and address them before hand, so she can't use them. If you know what the arguments could be, but you can't address them or you can't fix them, then accept that *she may have a point*.\n\nImagine how a conversation could look like between you, her, HR or some boss. What arguments could be raised against you, what arguments could you use against her. Prepare yourself for these arguments by resolving them *before this conversation happens*. Make sure you make her acknowledge these potentially important arguments are resolved on any 1:1 you have with her.\n\nBut also *don't fall into the trap of thinking you need to have more than everyone else just because you always had more*, or because you're an old employee. New managers love to exploit that. Maybe this is this case.\n\nIt might also be some kind of \"women's empowerment\" ideology going on, especially if you're a middle aged white male.\n\nHave in mind that in the management chain, it's very common for an employee to *not like* their supervisor, and you need to have *heavy and documented evidence* if you want to walk this road. Without evidence, it might be seen as \"he'll complain, complain, complain, but eventually he'll get used to it\".\n\n> In addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory.\n\nPlease give an example of what those accusations looks like.\n\nEscalate to higher management that you need those answers, but your manager doesn't provide it to you. Don't accuse the manager of anything. Make sure higher management knows that there is a problem with providing information. The manager also has her work. She needs to follow the rules as well. Make sure you point out those rules.",

I’m starting to realize I might have unknowingly been spending the last 2 years burnt out *because of* startups. \n\nit wasn’t the pace. I actually liked moving fast, being productive. but I think i was losing it seeing that nobody really knew what they were doing, from the c-suite all the way down to dev team.\n\ndon’t get me wrong, some of the best engineers I’ve worked with were at these startups. but there was also much bs, and people being extremely confident while clearly not knowing what they are doing.\n\nbeing mostly at series-b/c companies made it worse. that awkward stage where the company is “maturing” and “scaling,” but you still wake up to Bob's 2k+ line PR of junk that's \"urgent\".\n\nnow i feel like a small fish in a big pond, surrounded by really strong devs with tons of legit experience building things that have real users and implications. the pace is slower. the attention to detail and process is better. still some bs. but its a breath of fresh air. also probably helps that those tech leads above me have decade+ of experience and can back it up and code circles around me, rather than someone who graduated a bootcamp last year and is “leading” because they know how to run `npx create-react-app` when the founder was hiring.",

I've been in small startups for most of my 20 year career. The last startup was sold to my current employer. I went from having tons of influence, to very little. I don't like it at all, and am ready to go back to something smaller. They're not a massive corporation, but they're a much larger business that's getting ready to go public. My options vest at the end of this year, and I intend to go back to smaller businesses or start my own at that point. I hate the bureaucracy and feeling like I'm just a cog in a wheel. Maybe if I made FAANG money I'd be more willing to put up with it, but at my salary I'm just not.",

Startups often aren't connected to reality and delusional about the product in really strange almost cultism ways. The success of the product is often decided by what mental abuse the CEO wants to inflict and who they inflict it on. It can be fun if you are really into what you are into and the product is making enough money that the success overwhelms the higher ups. \n\nMid is more balanced. There is productive levels of stress. I think I worked 1 Saturday a year for 8 years. I had input on my work before it hit my desk. I could say no to stuff and yes to others in a way that allowed negotiation with product teams. We had money for tools, established widely used standardized software tools. I could use Windows and Android and not deal with culty logic and sub optimal tooling and hardware when things went really wrong. I just pulled some parts out the closet and went about my day. When we needed an AI we just bought a mining rig and some gpus and did the work and expensed it.\n\nAt the second mid size, if i left my desk i would pass a bottle of vodka under a coworkers desk. Then a mini bar. Then a kambucha tap. Then a convince store bar deli. Then a hard liquor store. Then a brewery before getting  to my car. When I got a memo about when and when it is not ok to expense strippers I decided to go back to megacorps.\n\nMegacorp there is no talking talking back. Its not slave labor but it's the mindset of slavery. You don't express anything that would make anyone uncomfortable about anything ever, even if what they are saying do something kinda non-compliant. The environment was cheap, often smelled of farts or microwaved fish.  I think I met my coworkers two times in 4 years. \n\nThese are not bad people. There are just so many rules, the reality of capitalism, and the reality of survival. When someone disappears for the day silently you don't say anything unless it interferes with work. It's much harder to get ahead because of all the rules, funding wars and downsizing. It sucks in a different way.\n\n\nI would rank it mid, megacorp, then startups.\n\nMid at 90\nMegacorp at 50\nStartup at 30",

Get permission. Get it on the backlog. Argue about it in refinement. Then hope you get the chance to work on it before a random reorg happens or priorities shuffle. \n\nAlmost everyone is incompetent but plays nice, but is politicking behind the scenes. The corp keeps raking in money because they're a big fish already. They've captured the market. Inertia.

Yet if you rock the boat too much, you're hosed. \n\nIt's the most inefficient endeavor I've ever been a part of. National labs, startups, even grad school were more rewarding and more likely to get things done and give you some sense of satisfaction. Big corp?

But deep down we all know it's just window dressing. Or nipples on chest armor.

      "text": "The company I work for hired a junior a few months back. He is fresh out of university, cannot express himself very well,and during his time in college he made some consulting, and write some shallow tutorials in medium. Unsurprisingly, he has this mindset in which the more code he wrote and merge, the better employee he is, regardless the code nor the impact. It's ok, I was there once too.  \nMy manager wanted me to pair with him to slowly introduce him into the code base, starting with the easiest service. Im a senior but he doesn't report to me, so my work with him is meant to be collaborative where I lead and he follows.\n\nThe situation is the following:\n\nWhen I onboarded him and tried to give him permissions, he dismissed my questions and instructions quite abruptly and immediately sent me a PR to review. I chose to ignore that.\n\nLater, he spent weeks reviewing PRs he was assigned to, consistently approving everything without real review — including large PRs in a language he openly said he had never used, for a project he hadn’t been introduced to. On top of that, he started rushing others to merge, saying he had “already reviewed it.”\n\nWhen we started working together on a project, I assigned him a few tasks meant to help him get familiar with the service. He delivered quickly, but while the code looked polished, it lacked proper functionality: tests were missing or superficial, patterns weren’t followed, and he hadn’t tested the code. I gave clear feedback, explaining that testing and understanding the service was the whole point of the exercise. He ignored this, added reviewers outside the project to get approvals, and merged as soon as he could. The code was, unsurprisingly, broken. I told him I was happy to help if testing was difficult, as it’s part of the learning process.\n\nDuring a meeting to plan future work, he proposed a new way of working that would require appointing a tech lead, hinting himself for that role. The rest of the team reacted with visible awkwardness.\n\nAt some point he also started to review my work (definition, design, analysis and decomposition of tasks) to which he didn't have no background. Since he couldn't understand what I was talking about there, and with other people, he said that my work was incomplete and I had to add information that was lacking and pay attention because \"was very complex and not common\".  \n\\[...\\]\n\nI ended up talking with my manager and his manager (who seemed to have seen those signals and agree with me). Explained what I observed, what I tried how he responded and the aftermath was his manager talking to him, and him pairing with somebody else. I can see my other colleague is not super happy about the collaboration but things seem smoother.\n\nI can't help feeling that the result for my manager was \"I couldn't manage the situation\", so it's just better to change. Im trying to grow in my role and influence is a big part of this, so:\n\n\\- How would you solve this situation more autonomously? I would like to avoid go to my manager for help but rather saying \"I have this ~~problem~~ blocker, I propose to do this, do you agree\" without losing the project Im working with, or how solid I can be perceived.  \n  \n\\- Would you have talked before? Or only talked with his manager?\n\n\\- Other advice?\n\nThanks in advance!",

That’s their money, let them decide how they want to spend it. The rest depends on the answer. \n\nIf that junior is more important that the company business, users and stakeholders - it all gets into the management space, not technical space. The management is the whole process on its own, so I wouldn’t limit myself by obvious advices like “uh-oh you should listen them“ but apply something useful. These day I would suggest two good sources on management: Crucial Accountability for the companies more focused on a slow pace of correction and who can affords months to fix behavior or Radical Candor for the organization that needs to move fast. \n\nOtherwise what I see is lack of kind of “coaching contract“ established upfront in this relationships. Seems like there are a lot of unspoken assumptions on the both sides and these assumptions aren’t appear to be compatible. It is still good point to have open conversation on assumptions, even very evident, like “functional requirements must be fulfilled and internal coding standards must be obeyed” or “the information about how we work shared not to discuss, but to learn and apply”.

          "text": "I think you did pretty well, but here are a couple of things that stood out to me, besides what has already been said:\n\n* At the start, when he ignored your questions and then submitted the PR, ignoring what happened is conflict avoidance, which makes it hard to escalate issues and lets them fester. Instead, you need to tell him \"I cannot review your PR, because I need you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first\" or even review his PR and explain that it isn't tied to any real issue or need - or that it's low quality or whatever. Honestly, I'm not even sure what the problem is from reading this. I trust that his PR wasn't high quality, based on everything else you said, but there's nothing here to go by. Having this documented makes it easier to escalate if there is a problem and it gives him a chance to correct the issue.\n* When he approved the PRs without reviewing them - this one is hard to document. You could have a meeting with him to go over the PRs with you together and then document what happened. If it's clear he didn't actually review the PRs tell him not to approve them blindly, and follow up in an email with the contents of what was discussed and agreed upon in the discussion. If he refuses to talk to you, document and escalate that, too. If he isn't the one to review those PRs, that could also be a process/culture issue in the company that needs to be addressed, instead.\n* When he criticized your work, get him to specify which areas need clarification and what the common approach would have been to those issues. Force him to clarify his position. Tell him we all want the system to be easier to understand and modify, but we can't do that if he pushes back on designs without sharing his experience or tangible criticisms. That instead of shutting down discussion, he needs ask clarifying questions so we can move forward together as a team.\n\nThat said, I relate to your story. I've had a few juniors try to worm their way out of their responsibilities like this, and it took a few times for me to learn how to handle it. The best way to hold people and escalate is to be clear about your expectations, especially when they screw up. Leave a clear paper trail of the expectations you establish and their response to those. Then escalate when they refuse to comply.\n\nYou've got to take the emotion and subjectivity out of it and make it objective so that someone can say: \"This employee was fired because they were unwilling or unable to follow the process / guidelines which were clearly documented for them.\"",

Unfortunately there are some who have this attitude that will take conversations like this as a personal attack or a way to belittle them, so having a paper trail to cover yourself if this comes up is always a good idea.\n\nIf this continues, then I would arrange a meeting with their manager, yourself and them. This is basically you still being in control of the situation but bringing the manager in as the next step is for the manager to deal with, this also gives you another person in the room and this discussion should be along the lines of \"what you are doing now is not how we do things, you need to pull your head out of your ass.\"\n\nBeyond this point it is out of your hands and the manager needs to take over and deal with the situation.\n\nIn terms of your concern about \"I couldn't manage the situation\", I would say that a big part of managing the situation is knowing when to escalate a situation. If in your position you are purely a mentor who can coach and guide, but that is the extent of your \"hard authority\" then trying to reach them via these tools is all you can really do.

It's counterintuitive, but asking for help and showing that you are changing based on that help will build your credibility with your boss, not ruin it. However, you are right in that you need to go in with talking points that show you're actively trying to improve.\n\nSo make a list of the issues you ran into with this guy and ask your boss for coaching and feedback.  \n  \nStart with: \"he approved PRs for languages he himself admits he doesn't know.\" Use the STAR method (or at least find a regular format to describe WTF happened) and make sure you're being intellectually honest about what you could have done better. Ask your boss for feedback and advice on how you can improve for next time and how they would have handled the situation. Make sure they answer the question about how they would have handled the situation. If they can't or won't, red flag - they may not be able or willing to coach you properly.\n\nDepending on how anxious you are, writing up a script in advance and reading it out loud a few times to make sure it sounds natural and professional can help a lot.\n\nAlso, please know that what you experienced is pretty common. Your company made a bad hiring decision and now you're worried your boss is going to scapegoat you instead of fix the hiring process.

It takes a significant amount of your time, because it’s another big problem to solve. How you dealt with it was already acceptable, but it’s not to craft level. Just like you’d submit code that’s ok, but not craft. It’s true that human problems like this are a two-way street, but you have way more lever than you think. \n\nPersonally, when I’m assigned to mentor someone, just like studying codebase and all, I prepare a directory and markdown about them. I study them, document them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, proactively meet with them other than pair programming, document their personality and the boundary of failures. You’ve noticed problems, but they’re scattered and presented more like a rant. As you said, you need a plan of attack. \n\nThe same way that there’s documentation about the personality and technical capabilities of the junior, I’d create a roadmap of growth. Your roadmap could include every PR that he submits has to go through you. You would lay out why you’d like a thorough review on every one of these, at least when it’s a system you own, things include prevent code breakages and to facilitate better review process, and help him learn better on PR culture. You could also include things like more targeted PRs that he needs to test, even prepare some review templates to start with. I’d get buy-ins because my plan usually looks like I notice the human problems, I’m not emotional about it, objectively these are the things that need to get done, or need to be enforced by his manager, to help him grow. My first meet with the junior would’ve also included these discussions with them; while it’s collaborative, I would ask how they think of the codebase, what’s their career goal, what are the areas of interests and things they are learning about. I’d ask what they think they’re good at etc (as opposed to my own observation, good to see how delulu some are in documentation). \n\nAll of these take up significant of my time, but it’s part of mentorship. It’s also helpful to communicate/negotiate with the managers that, because of the plan of attack and all, this is where I’m spending my time and how. This way, it really can be communicated in a way that is basically the same as “do you want me to work on this feature/system more or that”. \n\nI haven’t gotten tons of mentorship opportunities, but the two I had were manageable as a result. One of them very arrogant, and really took a lot of my time, but it’s something I communicated and negotiated, and before I left the company, the junior expressed he really learnt a lot and wished there were more time. \n\nAh, I will say, since I’m Asian from Asia, I’ve been learning to balance the humbleness mindset and required amount of assertiveness. \n\nHope this helps.",

I'd pull him aside and tell him:\n\n- You're being made to work with the junior by the manager, and don't have a lot of say in the matter.\n\n- The company wants junior engineers to more quickly ramp up on the codebase, it's not that this one junior is being singled out.\n\n- If the two of you want to turn this situation into something worthwhile, you will have to work together. Otherwise, it'll just be a waste of time for the two of you.\n\nSaying these will hopefully do the following \n\n1. Turn whatever animosity the junior has towards you towards your manager instead. This may seem mean, but this is what managers are for.\n\n1. Create a common \"enemy\", which is known to bring people closer together.\n\n1. Make it clear that the junior is not being singled out or babysat (that may be true in practice, but don't make them feel that). That this is just a general effort to ramp up juniors more closely.\n\n1. Create a new common goal: we're both stuck here against our will, why not make this as painless as possible?\n\nThis may diffuse things at least enough to where he's not going around you to get approvals and merging buggy code.\n\nAt my work, even if you have approvals, if one SME has concerns, you're not supposed to merge anyway. We had that happen a few months ago while working with another team and it was a big no-no. Maybe your place can institute such a rule?",

Outside of that , I don't really know that there is a long-term speed up. People have to be incredibly disciplined to work with AI assistance in a way that they still understand the code base. Lack of understanding means velocity will slow down over time. \n\n\nShow them the problems from AI generated code. And apply to other jobs.

Or from the arse of a manager?\n\nIf you take all the time you spend in a week, and you measure it to such detail that you are differentiating between \"typing code out when I know exactly what you want\" and everything else, including other types of software development, you'll find that the time you spend knowing exactly what you want and coding it is a really small % of your time. Even if you code 100% of the time, I think it's maybe 20% of that.\n\nI think this is tricking people? When you do side projects this % is way higher, because you're building it for yourself, so there are no expectations of how it works. You can elide edge cases by not caring about them, you can renegotiate what you consider mergable because it's just you. You can just take the first thing Claude returns because of this.\n\nSo I can be really productive on side projects at home, where I simply can't be at work. AI at work makes me, idk, in aggregate over a month, like 2% faster? \n\nDon't get me wrong: there are **blocks** of time where it makes you way faster. Eg today I had to quickly knock out some scripts to debug a prod issue. It made something that would have taken 15min take 30 seconds. But I'm not 30x faster all the time, I'm 30x faster for 30 seconds.",

Hacker News works partly because discussion beats authorship, and the bar is social rather than formal.\n\nIt might also be cultural.

Do you still read technical articles? You aren't the only one, and if you're a compelling writer, have something interesting to say, or did something interesting, people will want to read what you, the human, wrote. This isn't what people use LLMs for - instead they're used (especially for technical things) to get broad overviews of concepts, do research tasks (in which case they do link back to their sources), or ask specific questions that are usually covered in documentation.\n\nSo to make your work worth reading, you have to think about how people are using LLMs and fulfill the niches they can't. This may mean higher effort work, more unique content, or something else, but overall it raises the bar for what you write.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to think about why you're writing. To me, it doesn't really matter whether bots are scraping my content for AI or anything else. I write first for me, then for my audience, whatever it is. Some writers even make versions of their work more accessible for AI so that their ideas get out there or users can better query the work directly.",

So, down here people grouped themselves into different social media - like pikabu and habr and \"underground internet\". In the west these blogs were a thing,so they never centralised into one bug platform.\n\n\nIn Ukraine we have an idiosyncratic platform called Dou - it is more akin to news media for IT industry, but also quite a lot of habr-style technical posts.

Over time we moved to RPM packages, then Docker and Kubernetes. I learned the importance of immutable artifacts, configuration management, and overall the importance of making systems easy to reason about, and the value of homogeneity, immutability and predictability. \n\nI learned about trade-offs in software engineering. Now if I am interviewing an L4 or L5 candidate, I always focus on whether they understand tradeoffs in their designs.  There is never 1 “best” way to do things, you always need to understand what goals you are trying to optimize, and what needs to be given up in order to satisfy them. \n\nUsing fair queuing is important to prevent hot users from crowding out smaller users. \n\nThe value (and drawbacks) of asynchronous systems.  If your entire system is synchronous, it's easier to understand, but eventually you will hit a scaling limit. Synchronicity is slow, and coordination always reduces the speed of a system.\n\nBackpressure and providing congestion signals to upstream callers.  Learning about congestion control algorithms that do not require coordination like AIMD or CoDel which can help congested flows perform optimally.  Being explicit about providing back-pressure, otherwise things will fail in a way that is unpredictable or out of your control.\n\nLearning how overloaded systems in general do not operate efficiently, you want to keep utilization well below 100%. \n\nCAP theorem is real, many times we were forced to make that trade whether we liked it or not.\n\nAt-least-once vs at-most-once delivery, and being cognizant of the choice you are making there.\n\nCellular system design, and being able to route traffic volume between cells for failover or load testing purposes. \n\nThat's a lot of what I could write down off the top of my head in a few minutes.  None of these are specific to any technologies.  Over the course of a 20 year career you just learn to go with the flow technology-wise. Many times the technology choices are made above your pay grade without your input.  If you are lucky, you get to choose.",

Our product at this point is in the 1,000+ microservices, which helps at scale because most services are tasked with doing this small chunk of work really fast.\n\n1) No, while ideally the producer does a best effort on maintaining order per partition (not per topic). Our data can be visualized as time series data, we care about some device working (being online basically) and when was the last time we saw it. If an event arrives and we have seen the device more recently, then at persist time the event is dropped. \n\n2) Fortunately no, again we are lucky here and can keep things simple. If a batch of events is dropped, we can tolerate it. It’s not ideal, specially for devices with low activity, but at the end of the day it’s a device health system and the data itself is not critical. \n\nWe keep events in memory after consumption from the Kafka topic, our biggest problems would be OOM Kills or pod restarts. Good monitoring prevents the first one, or at least catches it while happening and alerts us to scale the application limits while we debug the root cause and the second one is mitigated by taints on the pods that schedule them as critical backend pods which means they don’t restart unless absolutely needed. In that case the application shuts down cleanly and we can persist whatever is in mem before terminating.",

I have an operations first mindset and approach.  It’s also how I personally build systems\n\nThe issue is if you’re only did dev, especially in product focused companies. Most roles are trying to protect you from hardware and systems.  So you’re insulated only prioritizing code output with no real care about how what you’re writing is interacting with a broader system.\n\nYou can only get this as a lived experience.  This isn’t some exercise or something you cram for.  You have to feel it in your nervous system. You must design from fear not confidence. You must design as if you are going to be woken up at 3 am to fix it.\n\nThis is hard to imagine when it has never happened to you.  So you seek it only as an abstract risk.  \n\nSo my recommendation is to think in failure modes.  Not only what a system can do, but how can it fail? And if it does fail, how do we recover? What does good vs bad recovery look like?",

      "text": "I’m a Senior BE with 7 YOE and joined a new team about a month ago. The people are ok, but I’ve run into some architectural patterns that feel like anti-patterns.\n\nCurrently, a lot of the business logic and orchestration lives directly in the route handlers. There is a strict rule against service-to-service calls; instead, the team uses a pattern where logic from one service is injected into another via lambdas passed down from the route level. This \"callback hell\" approach is apparently meant to keep services decoupled, but it results in lambdas being passed many layers deep, making the execution flow incredibly difficult to trace.\n\nThe friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles, especially since i'm still new to the team so there is not much established trust. However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nHow do you go about shifting an established engineering culture without coming across as the arrogant new hire? I want to advocate for better DX and maintainability, but I'm looking for a way to do it that feels collaborative rather than confrontational.",

I know about design patterns and testing. Your code base you all have worked on for years SUCKS and we need to rewrite all of it now because I'm here. I know rewrites could destabilize the company and risk all our jobs, but I am superior to you all so follow me while I show you the ONE TRUE WAY.\". That's you. That's how you sound to them.\n\nLet me ask you does the code currently work and provide value to your customers? Are changes so expensive that you are losing to your competition? \n\nIf making radical changes to the structure of the code base isn't leading to radically improved outcomes for your customers then you really need to think about the return on investment there.\n\nI'm not saying code quality doesn't matter. It absolutely does. But you must ask yourself is this the hill you want to die on today as a new member of your team? Is it worth it for your career? Is it going to be rewarded by your team? \n\nEvery time you fight a battle you are spending political capital. You must save it for the fights that truly matter. If you spend it now you won't have it in the future. It takes years to build it up and minutes to spend it.\n\nIf you really want to fight this battle then the best way to do it is to build trust first and then build a business case for the improvements. Suggest a pilot service or feature to show how much better it is. You need to show how what you are proposing saves time and leads to better outcomes for the business (saving money, increasing performance, faster turn around time for new features).",

I guarantee everyone else sees and understands the alternative but at some point you accept the architecture to just make progress on the things you need to and realize there some hours in the day you need to eat/sleep/see your kids, so no, that's total system rewrite probably isn't necessary.

          "text": "> The friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI am confused why this is an either-or thing. Perhaps this is a language specific problem (you didn’t specify the language), but a lambda is just a closure box around some function invocation. Sure you can write logic inline in the lambda, but there’s no reason you _have_ to do things this way, the lambda can equally just call a free function (in languages with such a thing) or capture some function object that implements the logic. Why can you not have the logic you want to directly unit test separated into a testable unit, test it, then simply pass that as the lambda? The lambda now only serves to “wire together” the injection point to the logic being injected.\n\nThis kind of design keeps the decoupling between transport and business logic that you’re looking for, while simultaneously not rocking the boat on their design patterns?\n\nAs for needing integration tests: I mean, yeah, ultimately you are going to need those, because at the end of the day you have to validate the system as a whole behaves as expected. Put differently, if the actual requirements on the system are “when API X is invoked with arguments Y, effect Z happens,” then you need to actually test _that_, the rest is implementation details. The point of separating out smaller units for testing is to isolate the point of failure. If the top level test fails but the unit test passes, you know the issue lies in the integration between the unit and the larger system. If both fail, you know at minimum there is a defect in the unit which likely is causing a defect in the system the unit is integrated into.\n\nI can’t comment on the overall architecture because your description of it isn’t very detailed. It sounds a lot like pretty standard inversion of control principles, which are usually considered *good* for testing and maintainability. Perhaps the problems you’re feeling there are tied to either poorly specified contracts (I.E. the contracts of those lambdas aren’t well specified), or due to implementation specifics (people writing massive, deeply nested lambdas inline instead of breaking out directly testable helpers with the logic and having the lambdas in the transport layer just wire them together). Once you’ve really understood the *why* of the design, perhaps you can push to close the gap on documentation or best practices that can help you and the next you understand the system better, as well as help shift left some of the testing practices from being purely massive top level integration tests to a healthy blend of system level and unit level testing.",

As long as you’re ok with that, pick your battles. Focus on cheap, high-yield pilot projects that have clear feedback when they work out. Performance issues are good for this, because numbers clearly go down/up. Things like “this makes the code easier to work with/easier to extend” are harder to prove, and therefore not great for gaining trust early on. \n\nYour challenge is a political one here - not technical. Maybe you had a lot of trust where you came from, so it’s hard to have your ideas viewed with skepticism, but an antidote to that is showing them you can do it their way, at least for a little while. It’s also an opportunity to check your own bias. If you’re surrounded by people who implicitly trust you, that can dull your awareness of weaknesses in ideas you have. And if you’re actually right, you’ll help others check their bias, but keep in mind how uncomfortable that can be for some people to have dictated to them. \n\nPS - I know how that can feel like you’re just going along with everyone’s complacency and it’s really frustrating.

Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\n\nYou could advocate for tests using the Test host or equivalent in your environment (you don't mention which it is). The one that I use is for for outside-in, and all in-memory testing. You can and should swap out real database for mocks here, to keep it all in-memory and fast. You can call these \"component tests\" or regard them as decoupled unit tests. I find this a very useful pattern by either name. As it sidesteps the implementation details, use of  route handlers / DI or not. So you're free to refactor under test.\n\nNo, they're not the _only_ kind of tests that we have - there are \"methods & mocks\" unit tests, and also tests that run after deploy to dev and use real databases and external services. But they are the bulk of tests, and it works well.\n\n> I’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles . However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nThis is a real dilemma, because both are correct. The only thing worse than code that uses an odd pattern and style that doesn't work that well, is code that uses it 50% of the time at random so you never know what you're getting today.\n\nHowever, I too would be thinking \"WTF is this and why?\"  A \"strict rule against service-to-service calls\" is bizarre and useless, and an interface with 1 method on it is exactly equivalent to a lambda / delegate / func, except in that it has a named type, which makes it easier for humans and DI containers to deal with.\n\nIt's _possible_ that they have some odd requirement that makes this pattern necessary, but I'd bet money that they don't, it's just just habit, misunderstanding and ignorance of common good practice.\n\nOr maybe you're working in a Functional Programming language such as F# where passing functions to functions is the \"Right way\". Or with an ex-Haskell dev? ;)",

What is tagging? where are the images? how can they check project state? without this genre of information, they will forever be wary of breaking something.\n\nlow confidence devs are paralyzed in an environment they can't navigate. it's impossible to focus on problem-solving when you can't move or orient yourself. \n\nthe best way to get them familiar with these is to show them what they are and what you can do with them in zero-stakes scenarios. Ask them to find things. ask them to check if a trigger in the db exists. ask them to enter a container for secrets or find a function in the repo based on what its name could be. ask them to make a docker image from code in a specific branch. just focus on tasks that have them interacting with a dev env harmlessly until they can do things without needing to ask you how. \n\neven if they still need to google it a month later, they will at least know that they are able to manipulate their environment with a bit of work, and that goes a huge way toward autonomy.\n\nto help speed up their progress in memorizing things however, it can help to export some aliases with them in their *shrc\n\nwork with them on this. have them suggest things they struggle to remember, or things they want to do more easily, and get some basic macros built out. \n\nunfortunately, all that is the easy part.\n\nlow confidence devs will languish here at the stage of 'i can move now' without ever taking these steps further or combining them. they will never trust that these steps can be left to work on their own or automated or chained or piped. They need to see a feedback cycle in action. You need to give them a problem that will hammer their ability to make a change, push it up, see the effect, and then force them to make another change based on the feedback. \n\nI recommend nomenclature updates for this. changing names of functions, classes, variables, etc., in our case, especially useful when they run into .proto, where it isn't as simple as just changing the name. more generically, nomenclature updates that hit external APIs can be a nice lesson in stakeholder management. \n\nnomenclature updates are fairly valuable and fairly low stakes. they're easy to match parity with prod, they make the codebase more understandable for humans and ai, and they touch wide swaths of the codebase. people also tend to feel ownership over things they name, and it can be a great way to get the dev further invested.\n\nhave them follow every step as visually as possible. generic k8s example, they make a change, they save it, they run tests, they commit. head to whatever is running CI: image builds. head to dev env. deploy new image. trigger smoke tests. watch for green. remote debug to see new name in action. check error logs. error? back to code, make change, repeat. hit regression button when you're not spotting easy errors, head to whatever is running your regressions and watch what it's doing. look at logs as regression runs. jot errors down for repeat.\n\nwork on similar exercises as the dev becomes more confident. this is not your or their failing -- they were never supposed to be in this position.\n\nalso, this is all fairly tedious work and it will quickly become apparent if they're trying to take you for a ride anyways, because it's nearly impossible to not learn at this level of direct feedback unless you're actively not engaging with it. I have worked with extremely unintelligent developers on processes to keep them productive; all you need is motivation, the willingness to try, and the courage to ask for direction.",

You need to be having this conversation with their manager first and foremost. Come at it from a perspective of genuinely trying to do the best thing for the company and everyone involved’s career: that due to the intense deadlines you have been put under, you are finding it difficult to have enough time to both mentor this junior engineer and accomplish your assigned workload.\n\nYou may have concerns about the ability of the junior engineer can ever improve, but you also need to consider the possibility that the problem is you, not them. That is, that your teaching style does not resonate with the junior engineer, and given the tine pressure you are under, you are not able to both alter/improve your mentoring ability while simultaneously keeping up with the non-mentoring workload you have. It’s ok, it happens, not every teacher is the right teacher for every student. But you need to be open to that being a possibility, and come at this from a humble place of just trying to set everyone up for success as best you can. Avoid adopting an attitude where it seems like you think you are the ultimate arbiter on if someone can hack it or not.\n\nPresuming you share a manger, this conversation should then move on to how to best handle this situation: either reducing your world load so you can focus more on mentorship, or looking to assign someone else to mentor the junior engineer so that you can focus more on non-mentorship tasks.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your manager, this should also result in an honest conversation about _why_ the junior engineer isn’t improving, which will help the manager understand if it is likely that the junior engineer might improve under different circumstances, or if they really don’t have the chops to ever make the grade.\n\nFinally, leave any implied assumptions of nepotism out of this. Going anywhere near that is only going to hurt you, not help you. If it is nepotism, you’ll just make yourself the bad guy for calling it out and you will get burned. If it isn’t nepotism, it will not look favorably on you that you immediately jumped to that conclusion instead of honestly introspecting on where _you_ may have been failing them as their mentor, and you’ll get burned. There is no good outcome going down that path.",

Part of it is everyone's busy so review gets deprioritized, part of it is codebase complexity meaning understanding the impact of changes requires significant context that takes time to load. Assigning dedicated reviewers just creates bottlenecks when those people are unavailable, and the async nature makes it worse where someone leaves feedback, the author addresses it 8 hours later, then the reviewer doesn't see updates until the next day which stretches everything out. The other thing is review feedback being subjective style stuff rather than actual bugs, so there's multiple rounds of back-and-forth over variable naming or formatting which seems like a waste of time but people have opinions about it. Some prs apparently sit for a week before merging which is pretty absurd for any company trying to move fast, and pair programming helps for critical stuff but it's exhausting and doesn't scale…. what approaches actually work for keeping review quick without it becoming rubber-stamping where people just approve without really looking?",

          "text": "Your org needs a style guide.\n\nYou mention in your post more than once that there are a bunch of back'n'forths on subjective issues. The style guide should specify enough detail that it should resolve pretty much all of these subject issues by taking a stance, not because it's a better or worse way of doing it, but because consistency across the entire codebase is better than inconsistency, even if the style guide chooses the worse option. Or, in cases where inconsistency has little to no cost (or even benefit), then it should clearly state that coders should either defer to local style (meaning that style should conform to whatever is the prevailing way in that file, module, or team), or that it really doesn't matter and reviewers that raise it should be redirected to take it up with the style guide instead of the code author.\n\nThe second thing is that your org needs an SLA around code reviews. For changes that total less than 100 lines touched, < 4h, for changes greater than 100 lines, 8h per 500 lines of code added/changed/deleted. Whatever the SLA is, set up a dashboard and display everyone's last 30d of code review activity.\n\nThe problem your org likely has is that PRs are too big. Changes should be split into the smallest cohesive set of changes possible, and the above SLA will encourage everyone to keep their PRs under 100 lines if at all possible. At the very least, people will be encouraged to collect bigger changes that are conceptually weighty into PRs that require more review attention instead of clubbing together a ton of little, independent things into the same PR.\n\nYour issue tracker should also allow issues to be tagged with specific PRs. The way to keep all of this organized is to create a tracking issue for each task (preferably that belongs to a parent issue for each project an individual owns). Then individual issues can track conceptual sub-tasks and accumulate tags for the set of little PRs that contribute to changes. This seems like a lot of bookkeeping, but if your tooling is good enough to handle this, it has tons of benefits. It becomes easy to track down issues when a CL needs to be rolled back, it creates a fine-grained view of where things are for task tracking, and it makes it very easy to substantiate your contributions in your self-eval at perf time.\n\nI actually keep a running self-eval doc. I book fifteen minutes after lunch every Friday which I allocate to updating that doc with detailed links to what I'm working on and notes to myself. When self-eval time comes it's pretty much a cut'n'paste for me because I've been keeping it all year long, so it's easy to adapt into whatever format is requested.",

My experience working with AI coding agents so far has been they are both more capable than the engineers say, and less capable than the PMs/executives think. \n\nI am a mobile engineer by background, about ~15 YoE at this point and have worked professionally in about every space except front end web. I am also late to the AI game. I have been in the \"this cannot build scalable, maintainable code\" camp for years. But in the last 2 months I've gotten access to more or less arbitrary amounts of Claude. \n\nWhat I've found is, in short, it is not very capable of thinking. But it's very capable of implementing. And that itself is a major capability. \n\nI'm used to working in code base with very rigid architecture patterns derived from foundational team libraries. High degrees of decoupling, very perspective in how state and data flow are managed. These patterns were developed to handle introducing new grads into our code base and not have them immediately knock over prod / break main and make 500+ developers waste their time.\n\nWith those requirements both enforced by the compiler and the basics of the good practices guide dropped into CLAUDE.md, I've found that it does an excellent job working inside that well defined box. The blast radius of its mistakes is small, and the scope of the changes is associatively equally small. \n\nIt certainly is not \"write me an app\". But it can be \"write me this state inside this state machine that makes this call to this service and then maps the output into a new view model instance consumed by the renderer\" and it can handle that very well. \n\nReduces the implementation time once I've decided what needs to be done by from ~ an hour to 5 minutes, scaling at about that rate. I do legitimately feel about 500% more productive than I was previously. \n\nPro-AI people, is this the use case you imagine? Do you think I'm handicapping myself not giving it larger scope? \n\nAnti-AI people, am I deluding myself? What do you think the invisible impacts will be that I'm not anticipating? ",

Context engineering is a whole new skill that I consider a subset of software engineering. Master it and I guarantee you can get pretty good code out of AI models.\n\nAt the end of the day you still gotta come up with a system, understand the constraints, and then decide on how you want it build.

So it’s a new skill for *them*, one that they probably have received no mentorship on, and which management somehow expects them to be good at despite forgetting that all the staff engineers they had on their teams had to spend years honing it in order to get prompted to staff.\n\nThis is the problem that leads to AI slop code.

So you have to be judicious about how much responsibility to give it, how much information it needs to fulfill that responsibility, and how to efficiently present that information without overwhelming its memory.\n\nThe more agents you onboard, the more you tasks can get done, but that shifts your burden from writing code to reading and reviewing it. The better you are about establishing and enforcing clear patterns, the easier that will be.\n\nIf you structure your applications so that all changes flow through a few common files, you're going to have to resolve a lot of conflicts whenever you have work being done in parallel. If it's structured so that different features live in different files, you're going to have a much easier time.\n\nIn so many ways, it feels so similar. It all relies on the same fundamentals, just in slightly different ways. So I think the big change is that AI is going to force all engineers to upskill in architecture and leadership earlier in their careers than they had to before.",

                  "text": "Yes and no. The obvious point of comparison is compilers, since they translate higher level more human-oriented language to something closer to what actually executes on the hardware. If you're an early adopter, there's a significant advantage to being familiar with the compiler's target language, so you can deal with bugs or optimize better. But as they get more battle-tested, that advantage diminishes until the compiler is so good that there's almost no benefit to knowing the target it compiles down to.\n\nThe big difference is that compilers are deterministic and LLMs are probabilistic. Given the same C code, the compiler will output the same assembly every time, and it will be better than anything 99.9% of human programmers could ever write by hand. The LLM will give you something different every time, so there will always be value in being able to ensure that you got one of the better outputs.\n\nSo as LLMs get better at generating code, I think it will be easier to get away with not understanding the code and blindly trusting it. But we'll never be able to trust them as far as we can trust compilers, because they're non-deterministic. I think it will be similar to how you can usually get away with using an ORM without knowing SQL, but every once in a while you'll get bit by something like an N+1 query that you could have easily avoided if you knew how it translates to SQL.",

You think through it, analyze, debug, etc. AI doesn’t take care of those parts. If you are building a feature that is super close to the existing one and you really don’t care about thinking, you may as well copy code and update config. That is not much if any slower than AI doing it. And if feature is significantly different then AI will need quite a bit of oversight.

But I've been stuck in hole this company has been digging for themselves for like a decade in which they just keep writing code and it's a pain in the ass to try to convince developers to start writing test cases now.\n\nSo have you had similar experiences? I feel like there must be some way to auto generate test cases based on network traffic and database state, but I don't know where to begin. All I want is something that can run a bunch of automated Java tests without requiring like a month-long manual QA cycle that still manages to miss things.\n\nLet me know if you've brought a company out of a similar situation :]\n\nI've already tried throwing large language models at the problem with some Junior Developers, but even then it looks like it would take over 10 years of solid progress to get to a reasonable point. I'm just hoping there's some standard industry test generator that I'm not aware of 👀",

Start with characterization tests around the ugliest, highest risk code so you can lock in current behavior before touching anything. Even a few coarse tests around critical paths can cut fear way down. Trying to backfill clean unit tests everywhere usually fails, but adding tests only when code changes slowly moves the culture. Auto generation rarely helps much because the hard part is deciding what behavior actually matters. Once people feel changes are safer, buy in tends to follow.",

We updated the old system to be a bit more verbose in logging, and then setup log scrapers that could capture all the inputs and outputs.\n\nWe built into the new system a way to write end to end tests, and a parser to turn the logs into inputs and assert expectations. We used Java, so we leveraged JUnit Dynamic Tests so that we could generate tests automatically from a structured test case json we put together from the logs.\n\nWe then would replay all the activity from the previous day/week and find which cases broke. The cases that broke got committed to the repo, and the passing cases deleted. This carried on for a month or two until we routinely could play an entire week without any failures.\n\nEffectively we turned the current production behaviour into BDD test cases. \n\nIt worked great, and is something that could be applied to existing systems not just rewrites.\n\nThe main thing is refactoring the application to allow you to run it up in a mode that allows for deterministic tests like this.

When I worked with them for a few months in 2020, the code base was 8 years old, had zero unit test coverage, and was full of spaghetti.  After a few weeks of wrestling with it, I decided to go all in on testing and ensure that all work I did was 100% covered by unit tests.\n\nWell, one of my first bug fixes involved fixing a 800-line function inside a 12,000-line file.  There was a lot of spaghetti and a lot of dependencies going on, and I had to do a bit of surgery so that I could mock things.  Long story short, it took me days to get it into a testable state, I introduced a few bugs along the way, and then I was banned from further experiments in testing.  The PR that introduced the tests sat abandoned and was finally closed 4 years after I left.\n\nFast-forward to 2026 and there's still zero test coverage, and last week I revisited the scene of the crime - the function is now 1400 lines long and the file is 14,000 lines.  I'm taking a more realistic approach of trying to write as much as possible of what I change inside new files/classes that can be more easily tested.  At the moment I'm working on a new integration with Microsoft Graph API so that's fairly easy to keep out of the spaghetti zone.  For my 5% time I also have three ideas for separating bits of logic out of the 1,400 line function into smaller, more testable classes.\n\nI don't anticipate progress to be fast, and at this stage I don't anticipate that either of the other devs who work on the code base are going to join me.  Neither of them know anything about testing, and it would be very difficult for them to learn on code that is very poorly factored for testing.  If I can build up a good set of examples of testable code, and figure out a couple of the refactoring challenges, hopefully it would be more approachable for them to learn.",

Budget for the extra time, of course, but mandate everyone do it.\n\nIf there's no time to write unit tests that cover the entire thing touched, then new tests should at least cover whatever functionality changed, and the author needs to file an issue against themselves to finish the unit test for the rest of that file within some fixed timeframe. You won't be able to practically use AI to generate meaningful unit tests, but if you disperse the work and the policy is to write them on a go-forward basis, then AI should be very helpful.\n\nMake sure all affected unit test suites pass before code is allowed to commit, and ideally you can start working toward a CI/CD pipeline that begins by setting up some continuous test servers that can tell you what the last green build is.\n\nBut unit tests will not suffice, not nearly. You should also create e2e tests that cover the basic functionality of the app. Just nail down the major user flows through the system, and make sure those are run as part of the deployment to every environment.\n\nFrom there, you can start writing integration and functional tests that exist in the middle space. The smaller the test, the more functionality it should cover. e2e tests should only verify major user paths through the system, integration and functional tests should try to hit the 80/20 rule, and unit test coverage at the lowest level should cover pretty much everything (that's the goal, obv you're pretty far away from that).\n\nYou should also invest some time in monitoring progress. Set up some publicly visible dashboards on TVs that display team progress toward test coverage, and for each team they should easily be able to display metrics for each team member. Also do some monitoring on the functional side. Publish some dashboards about code quality in production and chart progress by following how improved code quality reduces production issues. Put up a dashboard that shows test failure rates across the different environments … each test failure caught in a nonprod env is a production issue prevented. Over time, failures should migrate toward the developer.",

How are you handling it? It seems so overwhelming and I can't keep all the changes in my head at the same time.\n\nAs an example, one of my coworkers used AI and in a few hours built a custom http server metaframework to allow exposing arbitrary internal library function calls over the network to enable us to split off parts of our application into services. But figuring out how to actually connect any of my work to it and understand how it's configured gives me a migraine. I can't ask for help because nobody on the team really knows how it works or what technologies it uses under the hood, and needing to ask and look manually instead of getting AI to do it means I'm a bad dev. It's gotten to the point where I dread interacting with any new code. How do you deal with the volume of stuff you have to understand on a daily basis?",

I think with AI, it's like 2 hour AI \"plan mode\" that generates a spec to execute, 5 minutes of coding, 1 hour of testing, and 2 hours of self human code review just so I can understand the code myself, then whatever time for AI and peer code review.

We should all be 'managers' with fleets of AI agent junior devs, and in the same way you wouldn't read every line every junior dev coded you shouldn't read every line your AI agents make, and if you had a question for a junior about strategy you would ask them instead of diving in to look at the implementation.\n\nThe problem I have is that the tooling lies, you can ask the AI \"why did you do X\" and get something completely wrong out, but I seem to be the only one who cares.",

Or when garbage collectors came around and we stopped memory management. People complained about compilers generating inefficient code, there was a lot of skepticism. Garbage collectors are STILL not 100% always more efficient than doing it by hand. \n\nBut the results mattered more. Portability, scalability, saving on human hours, etc. So people iterated on these optimizations and made them more and more robust over time. Nowdays I don't think there's much of a gap left where you would do better than compilers by hand. As in, most programmers rarely care about what's going on under the hood anymore. The same is likely to happen with AI. The code that is written will just go under the hood and we will likely stop caring about them. Smart people will figure out what kind of guardrails to put in, what kind of automated processes to put into place to get things to a state where it won't matter whether the code is clean or human readable at all. \n\nWhat you're seeing is just the transitionary state...there will be confusion...there will be inertia to hold on to the old ways...it will be hard to \"let go\" of the control that writing code by hand provides. But it's best to learn the new way (based on historical evidence). The best of the new ways is probably not figured out yet, but this is transitionary. You should pace yourself and adapt to the paradigm shifts. Understanding the code is still important today but only because it's in transition and it might feel rough for now, but you can still figure out the \"good enough\" approach (ie. maybe move towards rigorously testing behavior/results rather than review every line of code, etc). Over time smarter people will make it work if the trends are to stick ie.\n\nI know there's a caveat that AI is fundamentally non-deterministic (vs compilers for eg are deterministically \"correct\"), and what I said is a bit extreme, but directionally that's the way things are headed. Code readability will likely still matter but less so and it's gonna be about where the balance ends up. It'll be a higher level of abstraction and the change will be profound, even if you can't fully treat it as a black box entirely.",

      "text": "TL;DR: My company wants me to deliver what was scoped as a 3person backend project in the same timeframe, but alone using AI tools and I’m struggling.\n\nI work as a backend developer at a software company that builds turnkey applications for clients. Recently we signed a deal with a client for a finance app. The backend effort was originally planned as 3 devs over 3 months. The budget is agreed with the client, so that part is fine.\n\nBut my company is now insisting that I deliver the same work in the same time, completely on my own, with using ai. They’re very serious about it. I pushed back a lot at first, but given the market, I realized pushing too hard probably won’t help me, so I reluctantly accepted.\n\nI’m not new to ai tools I try to use them a lot which is probably why they picked me. But building a project from scratch like this with AI feels almost impossible. The app is a finance product that includes money transfers, and there are a lot of security and idempotency concerns I have to handle.\n\nI’m trying to keep the AI’s output in very small chunks and review everything, but I’m under huge time pressure. If I keep working like this, I’m sure it won’t be finished on time. When I try to go faster, I’m afraid I’ll end up with parts of the system where I don’t really understand what the AI produced and in a finance app, that feels risky.\n\nThis also made me wonder if this is what working as a developer is going to look like in the near futureconstantly being expected to do “3 people’s work” solo with AI. Maybe I’m just struggling, maybe others are doing it fine. If anyone here works like this, I’d really like to hear your advice.\n\nDo you think this is a temporary phase, or is this the new normal?",

Let's talk about what scope to cut for an MVP\"\n\nThe key IMO is not to accept the premise that a given scope can always be delivered in a given time just because someone's asked for it. More \"my professional advice is that this isn't workable\" than \"I personally won't do it\". Don't get sucked into mind games.\n\nI am personally stubborn enough to lose a job over this (this hasn't actually happened yet though, I've chosen most employers wisely i guess), but I suspect this advice might apply even if you're not. After all, the alternative is overpromising followed by failure, right? Or the small chance of producing something good enough by crunching 60h+ weeks, but have you actually seen that bear fruit on death marches (as opposed to those rare inspired passion projects)? Will it be worth it compared to standing your ground a bit while polishing your CV?\n\nFWIW I don't think this behaviour from certain organisations and managers is new, nor is it AI-specific.

They have structured definitions, if you have samples, user manual you should expect very good implementations one shot, stripe is its own story but our friends in r/vibecoding have some tips around that. If you have indempotency and other constraints it is easier to build a loop that produces near production ready code. \n\nYou must use tools like claude code, codex or opencode that operates over the whole source code, and a good agentic model, so you can feed it entire features, you already have a base and you can ask to generate the code that follows the same architecture/patterns as your current code. You might also have your handcoded segments that you absolutely want to preserve and your base.\n\nAI is particulary useful for financial code, if you have input <-> expected result and a sketch of the algorithm you want to use, it is easy to generate tests that verify precisely.\n\nTry to follow your usual workflow, design the databse, create the model, the controllers and the frontend for example, experiment with big tasks, subdivide in phases, use plan mode. use e2e tests to verify the application.\n\n\\--------------\n\nAt the end of the exercise you will have VERY FAST a large part of the application but buggy as hell, the reality is that you will need the same 3 months and the same 3 devs, one vibe coding and the other two doing qa and solving bugs. Since it is a new  process you might need  even more time since the bugs the AI generate are always very strange and hard to spot, and some code must be written manually.\n\nYou are working with experimental technology that is very imperfect, you should talk to your boss about the expectations and risks, and have two dev/test by monday, make it very clear that the testing cycle is non negotiable and longer than traditional development. If (when) the project fails it is because the manager didnt put enough resources, not because of you. \n\nIn my experience financial algorithms even with known input/output and enough samples should be made manually, you really need a wingman for this project, you will be fighting context rot and lobotomized models, you need a person dedicated to make sure the financial data is OK.  \n\\-----------\n\nIn conclusion you should give the AI a chance, use codex/claude (or kimi/minimax) + opencode, the project will most likely require MORE resources than a normal project, expected since it is an experiment and will take 2x the amount of testing.",

One group was encouraged to use AI tools, and the control group was not allowed to use them. They were given the same tasks.\n\nThe outcome was surprising for both sides of the argument. The team with the AI tools was able to deliver new features something like 30% faster. There was no difference between the two groups in code quality, or time to perform maintenance tasks.\n\nObviously, this result flies in the faces of any AI companies claiming 10x (or even 2x) velocities. On the other hand, it demonstrate value when the AI tool is guided by competent developers.\n\nThe real question is though, if 30% gains for new features are what we can realistically expect, are the costs of training and inference really justified?\n\nAnother impressive headline out there is that someone let 16 agents loose to build a new C compiler in two weeks. It did accomplish the goal, but if you read past the headlines the story is far more nuanced than the marketers and CEO’s would have you believe.\n\nThe agents were guided with a very heavy hand, and were allowed to use GCC and other existing test suites to validate the product. The agents needed almost constant guidance and correction by a human. The result, while technically a passing C compiler, produced far worse object code than even GCC with all optimizations disabled. The linker is also was buggy. There were also most likely hundreds or thousands of C compilers in its training data, so this wasn’t the same sort of task that most organizations are going to be asking it to do. Most companies build bespoke software when free software isn’t available, and COTS software is too expensive or doesn’t meet their needs, i.e. the example solution isn’t already in the training data.\n\nAnd they burned $20,000 USD worth of tokens. In two weeks. If you gave four CS grads $5,000 USD each and asked them to give you a C compiler in two weeks, they’d probably be able to build you a low quality C compiler.",

          "text": "I think they're a little greedy expecting one person to do the work of three. I recently built a payment backend in about 3 months using Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5. I found it was exhausting trying to review thousands of lines of code carefully over a sustained period of time. I think I was probably doing the work of 2-3 people, so I think it's possible to do it. Just keep the PRs as small as you can so that it's always clear what exactly you're trying to achieve. Once you start having larger PRs with thousands of lines of code, it becomes impossible to maintain quality control. I would recommend writing E2E tests and preferring it to unit tests, and don't try to make the tests comprehensive. It can become bloated and lose its effectiveness if you're just churning out giant test files. It's better to carefully plan what you think needs to be tested the most and make sure those areas are covered well. Another thing which I think can be very helpful, is to spend a good amount of time in the planning phase. If you can research and write up good technical documentation -- even if it takes days -- you can use those as living documents that you can load into new sessions, and have Claude Code keep them up to date. If you maintain a well-planned tech spec, it can easily generate Jira stories and tasks for you and save you a lot of administrative headache.",

That's the right call for a finance app.\n\nHere's the core problem: AI compresses the typing part of development, not the judgment part. Security, idempotency, edge cases in money transfers - that's judgment. And judgment doesn't scale 3x just because you have faster typing.\n\nTrust me - I'm at a licensed fintech company and have seen over the last 10 years many companies go bust because RBI comes knocking and asks you to just shutdown. When you're dealing with money, the accountability layer isn't optional. The parts you \"don't really understand\" become exactly the parts regulators or security audits find.\n\nWhat your company is betting on: AI writes code fast, so 1 person = 3 people.\n\nWhat they're missing: The bottleneck was never typing speed. It's understanding what you're building, catching the bugs before production, and being able to explain it when something goes wrong.\n\nThe uncomfortable answer: Document everything. Every scope assumption, every risk you flagged, every \"do it anyway\" response. If this fails, you need the paper trail showing you raised concerns. If it succeeds, you've proven you can deliver under unrealistic constraints.",

I’ve dealt with something similar. \n\nI was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm in 2020 after a urgent care nurse heard a heart murmur at a Covid test who referred me to a cardiologist who had a top doctor referral to repair my valve and replace that section of aorta. Wild year that was.\n\nTurns out a side effect of open heart surgery where the heart and lungs are bypassed by a heart and lung machine is “pump brain”. Very foggy for many months and definitely felt a dozen IQ points knocked off for a while.\n\nPersonally I switched from the high output grind to a higher level but slower paced role doing mostly design, architecture and reviews. Kept up with the development and it did get easier for me though. Now with LLM tools I find it a nice boost in productivity. I use it for areas that I’ve thought and and designed thoroughly so it’s really just saving typing time and the plug and chug. Remember to keep your doctors in the loop with what your feeling and solution it together as I’ve had to make a LOT of med changes along the way, beta blockers especially.\n\nDealing with a diagnosis like yours can weigh on you emotionally as well, even beyond the meds, so stay open to therapy, supplements, meds etc. that could help that.",

Brain fog can have all sorts of causes, and you are on meds, so this might not work, but most people are deficient in these nutrients:\n\n* Vitamin D (especially if you have dark skin, stay out of the sun, or use lots of sunblock)\n* Magnesium\n* Zinc\n* Iodine (especially if you don't eat seafood or use iodized salt)\n* B-1 and B-12 (you need all B vitamins, but these are the most important for nerve health and most likely to be depleted, and B-12 deficiency is associated with brain fog symptoms)\n\nIf you drink alcohol, just stop. It depletes your body's ability to sleep and regenerate. Getting enough sleep is a key factor in avoiding brain fog.\n\nIn general, research nutrition that promotes nerve health, mitochondrial function, and the ATP Krebs cycle. With luck, researching and focusing on nutrition might mitigate many of your symptoms. Research what nutrients your meds might be depleting, as that might provide a good place to start. Googling \"nutrition deficiencies that cause brain fog\" will confirm what I've said here and offer more detailed information. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I want to share my knowledge and my opinion. But I’m scared. I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nLogically, I know I shouldn’t care about that. I can just write and put it out there for anyone to read. If they like it, they like it. If not, that’s okay. But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nSo I want to ask you all: should I do it or not? Even though I’ll probably do it anyway, I still want your opinions. In 2026, should people still write blogs?",

I have a huge knowledge based stored in Obsidian, but there’s no fluff in it, because, well, it is written for me: I don’t have to write the “obvious stuff”, nor does it have to cover a subject fully. I don’t have to write engagingly, because it’s a brain dump. I also don’t necessarily have to keep it up to date.\n\nWhenever I thought “oh, I’m sitting on all this, let’s just make a blog!” (and I did that numerous times)… it did not end well. I’d run into imposter syndrome, where I didn’t feel qualified enough to write about any subject. Or any post would take ages to write, because I felt it should cover the subject thoroughly (and correctly). Then it would go out of date, and I’d have to deal with updating it. All that effort, and then no visitors. Or worse: visitors leaving comments pointing out shortcomings. I found it exhausting.\n\nI am not you, you are not me. Your mileage may vary and I don’t want to discourage you; the only way to know is to try. But in a sea of “yeah you should” comments, I thought I’d share a different view. Hope it helps, good luck!",

I want to share my knowledge and my opinion. But I’m scared. I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nDo this. When you build your site, don't enable analytics, don't enable comments, if you share it avoid looking at upvotes, shares, likes, whatever. Force yourself to write for your own benefit and develop your own voice before you let an audience (or perceived audience) dictate it.\n\n> But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nYou said in the paragraph before that you wanted to share your knowledge and your opinion. That's meaning enough. If you need more meaning, look for it intrinsically: writing solidifies your knowledge, it builds your brand, and opens opportunities down the line if you're willing to be patient and put the work in.\n\nFor me, when I started in this career (2014) I already had a long tradition of note-writing from my previous life in academia. I write primarily to learn and understand things better, and early on I built a simple website. I kept writing about interesting projects, things I learned from work projects, and more. In early 2018, I saw a call for writing samples to write for Real Python, and I got my first paid writing gig. Fast forward to 2022 or 2023, and an acquisitions editor for O'Reilly reached out about doing \"Reports\" - short sponsored ebooks (30-40 pages) on technical topics. I did 2 of them, got familiar with the staff there, and then about a year ago I pitched them on a full-length book. Guess what I'm procrastinating from writing right now?\n\n(On top of that, I'm still blogging)",

          "text": "\nWorth noting that there's actually a surprising amount of CRUD-adjacent work in DB management roles. Take MongoDB's Atlas offering - a lot of the platform work involves building APIs and UIs for provisioning clusters, managing configurations, scaling instances, monitoring settings, etc. It's not pure database internals, but it's CRUD at scale with interesting complexity around distributed systems, infrastructure automation, and resource management. Hell, I worked at Splunk and never once touched or even looked at the core Splunk code - same principle applies. You can absolutely work at these companies without diving into the engine itself.",
