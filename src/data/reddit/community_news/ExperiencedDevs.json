      "text": "Biggest difference working with senior devs isn't the technical stuff honestly. It's how they communicate \n\nAsk a junior something and you get like 15 minutes of context, explanations, caveats. Ask a senior and its \"yeah that's broken, I'll fix it by thursday\" or \"no idea, ask Dave he touched that last\"\n\njust direct communication. \n\nAnd when stuff breaks, seniors mostly just own it. \"I fucked up the migration, rolling back now.\" Meanwhile I've watched junior devs write 3 paragraphs in slack explaining why technically it wasn't their fault before even starting to fix anything\n\ni'm obviously not saying all seniors are like this, some never grew out of the excuse phase. But the good ones are simple - you ask a question, you get an answer. You need something done, they tell you when or tell you no. No guessing what they actually mean\n\nMakes everything faster tbh. Less meetings trying to figure out what someone was really saying. Less parsing through defensive language. Just actual communication\n\nTook me a while to realize this is a skill not just a personality thing. Being direct without being a dick. Admitting you broke something without spiraling. Takes practice I guess ",

Real expertise and judgement isn't.\n\nThere are people who just manifestly have a clearer understanding, intuition and vision for whatever we're doing. I've worked with a number of people like that in my career, starting with my undergrad advisor in college. He was great in *part* because of his social skills and understanding, but there was far more than that. There's a level of skill, insight and experience that has no substitute.\n\nExpertise is hard to evaluate, but you'll know it when you see it. And that sort of tacit knowledge is what makes senior folks—ones who are actually senior, not just those with an inflated title—actually different from non-experts.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating to talk about because the only descriptions I can give are all fuzzy. But, at the same time, that shouldn't be a surprise; the reason tacit knowledge is *tacit* is that it's hard to put into words!

If course correcting quickly even in somewhat embarrassing circumstances adds to overall impact while the alternative (finger pointing, blaming, making excuses) moves things in the other direction, it's management's job to keep everyone problem-focused and reward correct behavior.\n\nJuniors should be getting trained as soon as they land on a team that everyone messes up, it's part of the job, acknowledge and move forward. If a junior's mistake has a large negative impact, that's a systemic problem, not an individual one…the system doesn't have good enough guardrails.\n\nIn the end, this kind of culture benefits the higher ups too.

Working with varied stakeholders makes you better at communication as does having a deeper level of technical practice since you more deeply understand and can speak more simply. The confidence others are talking about in this thread is a side effect of all of this. \n\nPrincipal and staff is similar in that you need to level up communication even more and take an even higher level holistic view while also maintaining enough detail to work with other tech teams in your purview. ",

      "text": "There’s a strong argument that in-person work is superior for junior developers simply because of \"osmotic communication\" which is the ability to absorb knowledge just by being in the room. We noticed this gap with our post-2020 hires despite our best efforts, they weren't picking up the tacit knowledge that comes from sitting next to senior engineers.\nThe solution was surprisingly simple: Open Audio Rooms.\n\nWe shifted from private 1-on-1 calls to public voice channels. If I’m pairing on a feature, I hop into an open room instead of sending a private invite. If we need a third opinion, a teammate can see we’re talking and join us without the friction of calendar invites or missed DMs. Even if you’re working solo, sitting in an open channel recreates the office \"buzz.\" You can listen in on problem-solving in the background or just feel less isolated. The best part is that unlike a real office, you have the ability to cut the audio and leave when you need deep focus.\n\nOur new grad picked up a ton of knowledge this year and our ~2022 hire vastly improved their knowledge over the last year after we switched to working this way.",

As someone that's worked in-office and remote for quite a few years in both, I vastly prefer remote for all it's benefits over in-office for it's few benefits. In-office is just a constant barrage of interruptions from loud coworkers, chatty neighbors and people just \"stopping by with a quick question\". There are countless tools to assist in remote whiteboarding, it just seems like most companies don't feel like adopting them. When it comes to straight up collaboration on something like rubber ducking or over the shoulder debugging, remote largely feels the same minus someone staring over your shoulder. When it comes to roadmapping and planning, you tend to capture more in documents than on a whiteboard when doing it remote.\n\nAt the companies I've worked remotely, we've done in-person offsites and remote planning sessions. The entire benefit the in-person is the social aspect after the meetings. The actual meetings feel largely the same.\n\n> In 10 years I think we'll look back at how we do remote today...\n\nAssuming it's not gone because of all the RTO mandates. I agree tools SHOULD improve but I'd be curious how hard it is for a company to get funded with remote work tech as their basis in this wave of calls for RTO.",

When a group is 8 or less, organic human collaboration doesn’t require strong leadership in-person. As soon as you break beyond that number, you need to be more intentional. Remote is phenomenal for collaboration at large group sizes, but it requires you to be a lot more intentional for collaboration in small groups.\n\nThe ceiling for remote collaboration in small groups might be technically lower, but I think the ceiling is still dramatically higher than most in-person groups actually achieve in practice. It just requires better more intentional group facilitation.",

Of course the new team using MSTeams is getting forced back to the office 'because collaboration' lol.\n\n\nHonestly, stop using private communication, no one cares that your question is silly, there are no silly questions. Just ask. And treat the group chat like the office, say hello, say goodbye, mention that it's beertime on Fridays, talk about the food you cooked. Obviously it doesn't feel the same as in-person if you behave like a bot. Behave like a human, make friends, show your personality.",

There’s so much they pick up just by being in the room with seniors little habits, ways of approaching problems, even how to ask for help. When you’re remote you have to be intentional about creating those moments.\n\nOne thing that’s helped my team is pairing sessions with cameras on and a running slack channel where anyone can chime in. We also encourage juniors to check in with a couple of peers or a senior after they wrap a task: not just on the code, but on how they communicated and collaborated. It’s surprising how different those perspectives can be from how you see yourself. A few honest conversations can bridge the gap that physical proximity used to provide.",

Not async comments. Not a Loom video. You and me, screen share, explain what this code does and why you made these choices.\n\n> First week, guy shows up with a 600-line PR. Gets about 3 minutes in and realizes he can’t explain what half of it does. Closes the meeting, comes back two days later with a 90-line PR that actually makes sense.\n\n> Now most PRs are under 100 lines. People are breaking things up because they know they’ll have to defend it live. And when they can’t explain something, they go back and either figure it out or rewrite it before the meeting.\n\n> It’s not perfect. Some people hate it. But review time dropped and I’m not just rubber stamping AI slop anymore.\n\n> What'd u do?",

      "text": "Friends, do not make the same mistake as I did. I'm about five years into my professional software engineering career. I am nearly finished with a 12-month contract and expect to spend some time unemployed in what appears to be the worst job market ever, absolute lunacy riddled with bots, AI slop and 1,000+ applicants for every position. And my problem is that I have nothing to show. Allow me to explain.\n\n\nMy career had problems from the beginning. I graduated from a no-name college with a sub 3.0 GPA due to mental illness. I managed to cure my illness about three years ago, finally figuring it all out and entering into the most productive phase of my career. This was a great breakthrough, but I had too much to prove at this point and got fired from my Fortune 500 job after being put on a PIP.\n\n\nA while later, I got this 12 month contract at a mid-sized company. I was about 3 to 10 times more productive compared to when I started, sometimes clearing out multiple tickets in a single day. Problem is, the company initially put me on some difficult issues involving thorny bugs or small but tricky to implement features. I solved these just fine, but I often overestimated the time I'd need to spend on tasks. What I thought would take 3 or 4 days often took 1 or 2 weeks. It was fine though, I was learning their systems.\n\n\nEventually, management decided to plan sprints. So you had to estimate the time you'd spend on an issue, but also how many issues you could fit into a sprint. And my team started giving me easy, brain-dead issues like changing one property in one file. I'd sometimes spend more time managing merge requests than I'd spend developing for those tickets. This made the estimations much more accurate for management, but it was code monkey stuff. I let this go on for a month or two until I complained to my team lead, but the company had already declined to renew my contract.\n\n\nNow the team had serious, rigorous development work it needed to do. It needed to get rid of these C++/Lua bindings and replace the Lua with pure C++, it needed unit tests, and it needed to abolish serious data duplication anti-patterns which were all over the place. But most of these issues were either not ticketed or forever buried in the backlog. I was specifically hired to introduce unit tests and test-driven development to the codebase, but this was pushed far back to a distant release. I tried to work on it by myself in my spare time, but I just didn't have the energy after having dealt with all the menial tasks they assigned me.\n\n\nJust closing tickets does not make you a better developer. Often, this is what management thinks they want but it's a shit proxy for real development. You need to tackle difficult, risky, complex, hard-to-estimate issues that result in big, demonstrable improvements, and do this under proper refactoring methodologies so the rest of the team isn't disrupted. And then you need to convince your team they'll never find anybody else who can do this better than you. I didn't do this.\n\n\nAlso, I didn't really want to be a software engineer. I wanted to be a computer scientist, but judging from the above you can probably see how well that went. I naturally find most development work quite boring, and this makes it harder to go deeper and create better implementations for products and services I don't particularly care about. The tech industry constantly brags about being innovative, but the funny thing is, the amount of innovation in run-of-the-mill corporate work is close to zero.\n\n\nSo, my problems were:\n1. I didn't handle any complex implementations, just random bug fixes and features of small to moderate complexity.\n2. Near the end, management started giving me menial tasks and I didn't protest that hard enough.\n3. Because I didn't have any complex implementations to my name, I didn't have unique expertise in areas of the codebase that would have made it harder for me to be replaced.\n4. In my spare time I decided to teach myself impractical CS topics like theory of computation, when I really should have been working on the above.\n\n\nNow, I have a major problem going into the job market: I didn't create complex implementations for most of my past jobs. Of course, some of this is excusable because of mental illness, but you can't bring that up in a job interview. So I don't know how to answer the question \"what have you done\"? And I expect this job market to be the worst ever. Last year I applied to over 1000 jobs before I got my current contract.\n\n\nSo don't be like me. If you want to be a good software engineer, you have to take a little bit more responsibility. If you want to do outstanding work that will really stand out on your resume, you might have to take the initiative yourself as your team or your management might be averse to giving you important things to do. They might not think you're capable, even if you are.\n\n\nOf course, it wasn't all bad and my time wasn't all wasted. Some major wins for me were:\n1. Becoming vastly more productive in general.\n2. Improvements in communicating with teammates.\n3. Improvements in understanding and implementing product requirements.\n5. Implementing moderately complex features and solving some fairly difficult bugs.\n6. Getting better at pair programming, debugging, C++ and the UI framework we used.\n7. Getting familiar with new codebases. One of my co-workers said I learned the codebase in three months where it typically took new employees two years.\n\n\nThat is all. Goodbye.",

L5 will know what tickets to assign in the first place because they can scope out and plan the entire project from a technical standpoint, know what stack to use etc.\n\nHere, you “own” the entire project.

          "text": "Grok, please summarize.\n\nI kid, but I've been there too, been in the industry for over 6 years, coming up on 7.\n\nI learned the hard way too. What I ended up doing to help myself from getting overloaded with complex or untracked work was utilizing the agile method mgmt said they used. Ticket estimations are allowed to be increased, so once I've dived into the code for a ticket and seen that it's a bit more complex, I let them know the next stand up. If it's big enough, I tell them it needs to be broken into multiple tasks and the original ticket needs to be turned into a story.\n\nAvoidance, like learning theory of computation, when you should be doing tasks, for me with ADHD, is a classic sign of Overwhelm™️. It's something I've had to learn to overcome and I've had to recognize why it happens. For me, Overwhelm™️ happens when the ticket requirements and outcomes aren't clear enough and when I don't really know what to do, at a granular level. It's an easy trap to fall into when you \"get it\" at a high level but don't get what it means functionally.\n\nFor tasks like needing to add unit tests but not being documented as stories/tickets, you need to elevate that to the PM or whoever owns the backlog and **get them to do the work of prioritizing it or not**. Say, \"hey, this was asked of me by X, but this isn't captured in any tickets. How important is this? I don't want to risk my other tickets failing because I'm spending untracked time on untracked work. Where should this fit in our sprints?\"\n\nAnd failure is a crucial part of success, so you can absolutely use some of the lessons you learned as part of your interview answers. Just make sure they're oriented towards the improvement you learned.\n\nBeing someone who is good at working with others is really valuable, even if you didn't make big waves. Some examples I came up with, from your post:\n\n- by elevating issues/concerns, you helped get the project on track\n   - demonstrates ownership, communication, being concerned with project hygiene, focused on goals\n- being able to better estimate tickets and immediately communicating when your initial estimate wasn't accurate after research\n  - demonstrates humility/improvement for saying you weren't the best at estimation but got better, timely communication on issues encountered\n- learning a codebase faster than average and solving moderately complex features, completed on time\n  - demonstrates work ethic, eagerness to learn, team player\n\nHaving good communication and escalation skills, as I outlined above, is valued very highly and will get you far. You don't have to be a rockstar to land jobs. Just being someone who will make the gears turn smoother and quicker can be all you need to secure that position. Obviously, you have to know what you're doing, but it seems you also already have that covered.",

They also focused spare time on impractical CS theory instead of concrete implementations.

No SWE2s at the time (we did pick one up thankfully within a couple weeks).  That first week though I was chatting with the SWE1s and found out they were all industry hires and probably should be close to being promoted.  However when I asked them about career plans what I got back was \"I'm just happy to have a job right now.\"\n\nMorale is not great right now.  The team lost a significant number of people due to regional changes, then layoffs, and then finally PIPs.\n\nThe lower level ICs in general seem to work a bit shorter than a full day compared to most, and when WFH they don't always focus on work stuff (let's be honest I'm guilty of this myself after being off for so long) showing I guess a lack of motivation for the work itself and maybe wanting to get some of their time back on the commute (vs WFH never having a commute).\n\nThey also just seem to show a lack of motivation for learning.  Probably not helped with what feels like lots of rubber stamping of PRs and not truly diving into the underlying issues in code, and just asking AI \"how do I fix this?\".  That being said they do show passion for learning how to get AI to do stuff but to me that feels like the easy way out in a sort of way?\n\nLike, once you know how to do something yourself it's easy to tell if AI has done it correctly or incorrectly.  Asking AI to just do it for you and making sure it builds and the issue is fixed just taught you nothing, and may have introduced another bug that's even harder to find.  Maybe how to better prompt AI to do stuff but even then maybe not because there isn't necessarily a correlation between your prompt working once and it working every time.",

Could have just been the non-tech companies in non-tech cities that I have worked at in my career, but I found it rare to to find people that would actually sit down and teach rather than give you the answer and walk away.\n\nI make sure to always teach when I help people and give you context without them even having to ask.  Though saying that I have found a small set of SWEs that got annoyed with the context and just wanted answers.  Some even got annoyed you didn't let them know the context prior to that point.\n\nLike they just want you to tell them random information that you think they may need to know.  I actually tried that one time and told one of theses SWEs that I just got out a meeting with upper management and they are looking to do X long them.  This SWEs turned it back around on me and was like \"why are you telling me this?\". lol.\n\n> Someone would notice you were stuck and offer a perspective without you having to schedule a meeting.\n\nI find many SWEs don't want unsolicited help today.  It's like they think it makes them look bad or something.  I just look to understand the personalities involved and help the people that want help and shrug when others scoff at me for the unsolicited thoughts.\n\nThis is also harder when working in a remote environment.  You can't exactly tell when somebody is stuck like when everybody is in the office.  I'm not saying everybody needs to RTO, but it's a side effect of working remotely.  If you need help you need to be proactive about it and ask.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's different at tech companies as I have never worked at one.

More than the sprint could feasibly process.\n\nThe sprint planning meeting was a team all-hands Teams call.  The leader would read out the ticket, there'd be a little discussion and the floor would be open for anyone to question any aspect of the ticket.  Then we'd do a quick round of Planning Poker.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Planning Poker is a tool in which every \"player\" has a selection of cards marked with the first few Fibonacci numbers: 0,1,3,5,8,13,21.  And they select a card that represents the complexity of the task; changing a word, that's a zero.  Adding more fields to a form might be a three or five, fleshing out some API endpoints, thirteen.  When everyone has bid, they all show their cards - and the leader asks, in a spirit of curiosity not challenge, the lowest and the highest number to justify their bid.\n\nThis would usually result in something like unanimous agreement, and the ticket would be estimated and entered into the backlog for the forthcoming sprint.  But occasionally, there'd be a twinkle in the eye of the most senior coder and we'd find they'd bid extremely high or low and on asking why, they'd explain that they either did something heinous six years ago that would need rewriting or the form autobuilt and just needed an array extending or whatever, and the task would be harder or easier than expected.\n\nOr maybe a junior coder had come up with some new trinket they'd like to incorporate or whatever.\n\nAnd on the occasion the bidder just said \"I think I may have misunderstood\" or \"my attention went\" then everyone takes ten minutes to get coffee and wash their face or whatever brightened them up for the rest of the two hour meeting.\n\nOh, and if the consensus was 21, the leader would generally take the ticket away and chop it up smaller because the complexity was too great for one sprint to easily digest.",

The consultants came in, interviewed a bunch of people, then presented a doc with all of the problems in the org. The newly appointed, non-technical CEO apparently was very impressed. The existing tech leadership was fired and the lead consultant was named interim CTO. \n\nNaturally, they also brought on 20 to 30 engineering consultants from the same consulting company to \"help\" and emphasized \"everyone's jobs are safe.\" The interim CTO said several times \"we will have an initiative to get our code running on a modern kubernetes platform\"...which everything already runs on. \n\nThe newly appointed non technical CEO is very happy that the company is now going to be running much more efficiently.\n\n...as if I could make this shit up.",

I still believe that a team should make the process work for them and not the other way around.\n\nWe brought in a consultancy firm to help us move to Agile.  I can't honestly remember the name, but I remember the day we were introduced to them at an all-hands, they handed out a book on Agile... written by the firm's CEO.  (I still use it to prop up stuff in my workshop.  I've never read it.)\n\nOne of the main consultants actually had the gall to call one of my best devs lazy and entitled because she disagreed with him.  He did this publicly, I might add.  I pushed back, because he was ~~stupid~~ / ~~an idiot~~ /  ~~massively unprofessional~~ / wrong.\n\nI found out after I left that he did it again, only this time to the entire dev team.  In an all-hands meeting.\n\nSomehow they convinced management that the fact that I looked out for my team as their manager was a bad thing.  A VP, so far as I can tell, later tried to get me fired by massively misconstruing an email I sent.  I failed to rise to the bait, so I got laid off.\n\nI was an IS major in college.  We trained to be consultants.  By never being one, I dodged a huge bullet.  \n\nI always thought the cliche was just a cliche.

Most likely, your CEO had a good personal deal with that consultancy\n\n\n\n\\[TL;DR\\] Story from the past...\n\nOnce, I was a consultant at a company that hired me to be a lead developer. They found a CTO, a very convincing person, 30+ years as Ca TO. He pretty much killed the company as he ousted all consultants, brought his not-so-bright son as lead developer, and brought his son's friends as lead for frontend, etc. \n\nAs I checked, the guy was really CTO for 30+ years, but only in his own company, where only his wife and son, and son's friends worked, and every year they jumped to another country and another project, because they ruined every single one.  That CTO worked really well with german managers, who were ... questionable at minimum (no professionalism, quite hedonists, but super large ego). So the manager and the CTO got rid of all the seniors and consultants, then started to rewrite everything with Symfony (PHP), instead of something minimal and good, so they failed miserably. Then the investors hired a consultant firm to evaluate things, and they fired on the spot this CTO, the entire HR department, and got rid of the managers and one of the owners too, because everything was in ruins. The investors weren't happy to lose 5+ million EUR at that time. Then they bought into that consultancy and rewrote everything in Ruby, which failed (obviously), then they sold the company, then the next consultancy rewrote everything in Python, then the last owner, before shutting the entire stuff down, rewrote everything in PHP again. 3 years, many workers, iterations, and loss of money.",

My default decision right now is using LLMs and lots and lots of googling, but LLMs seem to be poor at these higher level decisions and googling is the just the default solution.

In retrospect, I think all of that architecture is terrible; there is a much simpler way to do it.

Only as a last, weak consideration should you move into speculating about possible benefits that nobody mentioned but that you can foresee being valuable to your organization. \n\nStart with what you *know* matters to narrow your choices as much as possible, as fast as possible.

Don't try to solve for everything all at once; figure out what you need for the next 1-3 months (6?) and build something that solves that problem.  Try to keep things modular and flexible so you can expand later but don't spend time building super flexibilility or abstractions that you may not need in the short term.\n\nIf you have an existing code-base that makes things more complicated.  It may be worthwhile to try and reuse some of it but it could very well also be a time-sink and compromise your long-term architecture.  Someone on my team suggests using an AI to answer questions and provide an overview of existing code but I absolutely would not let an AI write anything for you - not at your level of experience and the general fragility of AI-developed software.\n\nOh, and did I mention you should write down on paper your requirements, architecture, schema, major flows, etc.?

If it doesn’t work put it on the backlog and you’ll get to it someday. Revolving door problem don’t lose sleep here. \n\nIf your architecture decision results in make a rather permanent fixture for the life of you startup then you should really take the time to Google and understand the proper trade offs. However for these the decisions it’s often aligned with the industry standard way of doing things. So make sure to do a lot of research and talk to people in industry to come to a good solution. Copy well known architecture in the wild (similar to the adage “no one got fired buying IBM”. (1 way door problems)\n\nA couple irreversible (highly contentious to change) decisions areas:\n\nCloud: AWS\nDNS: Route53, sometimes Cloudflare\nDomain Registrar: AWS \n\nDatabases: pick Postgres and jame everything into the database until it causes issues (years from now). Might be a hot take but at least it’ll be a business problem not a you made a bad decision problem. \n\nProgramming lang: industry dependent but in general Ruby on Rails, Python, Java will be good everywhere. \n\nWhen in doubt pick boring technology. DO NOT PICK SOMETHING EXCITING Kafka, or Mongdb\n\nOTHERS \n\nCI/CD: CircleCI, GitHub Actions. (Jenkins is a big NO. Buildkite meh)\n\nSecrets: AWS secrets manager. Maybe sops. Don’t use Vault as a solo maintainer. \n\n\nEnvironment variables IS BETTER than hardcoded urls in source code. This is where you’ll run into most of the business issues and your Devops backlog because the app was not built with flexibility in mind. Which means it make it much harder to run the app in isolation, ephemeral (mock service urls instead of fixed prod and staging)\n\nFINAL NOTE\n\ntraffic architecture: in general if you add a traffic routing shim just after the DNS layer and before the database layer (usually app EnvVars) you almost guarantee your architecture to be infinitely flexible because when you need to make changes (even big ones) you can just flip a switch to route traffic to a different location. \n\n instead of doing weird wacky stuff at the app layer and having to deploy a new version of the app in maintenance mode and then redeploying to go back. And it usually ensure you don’t have to mess with DNS and wait for the cache to bust. It’s instantaneous. \n\n\n—\nI’ve been the solo Devops person many times so I’m very familiar with your position. \n\nIt’s not hard to develop intuition if you just build a lot of little POCs and test the migration paths given different scenarios.

Your position requires a person that is capable of great deal of autonomy and that you can think strategically, make compromises and prioritize things by yourself.\n\nThose skills are not easy to learn quickly, but there is a bunch of advice that can help a lot.\n\nHere is how I think about your particular problem:\n\n1. You are responsible for delivering a certain capability to your company. Talk to your bosses what that capability is. Let's assume for now that it is providing platform and tools for their quickly growing application and development and ops team. And yes, it is \"ops team\" because even if you are a single person today, if they are actually growing quickly, that is going to be a team in a year.\n2. Anticipate future needs. If the organization is growing quickly, focusing on \\*current\\* stuff means you are already late to the party and you will be a bottleneck. You need to be constantly in touch with your bosses to define what is the expected state in 3, 6, 12 months from now so that you can properly prepare and prioritize work.\n3. Run gap analysis. I do this personally -> I try to imagine the state we have to be in 3, 6, 12 months and then I try to think about anything that we do not have now that we need to have in future. For each identified item I write down what it is needed for exactly and then try to figure out if I can fulfill that need in some alternative way. Talk to your bosses -> they might be completely fine spending some cash to get you unblocked, for example. I also define it as a project and then I try to define returns and investments needed to get the project done -> this is important because I probably can't get all projects done so I need to prioritize them based on RoI. I also need to be able to talk to my bosses and what CEO wants to hear from you is to the point explanation of why we need it and what it is going to cost us.\n4. Think strategically. You want all your projects to be lego bricks that fit together to achieve a desired goal.\n5. Try to get 80% of outcome with 20% of effort. Or maybe 70% with 10% of effort. You have less resources and time than you need to get everything done. Rather than getting only some things done, try to get everything moving at some reasonable pace so that there are no things that suddenly become huge blockers.\n6. Do not be afraid to use unconventional methods (but maybe discuss with management?) For example, when I got hired and suddenly needed to do a lot of infrastructure work I had little experience with, I just hired a bunch of guys on Fiverr to do the job faster and better than I would.

Architecture is about the business: Make sure you understand how the business works/wants to work and your architecture should reflect this.  \n\n3.  Have a vision of the future: Have an idea where you want the architecture to go in the future, aligned with the business understanding above.

When taking high level architectural decisions you can no longer dig into details or you will simply get lost in a rabbit hole and entangled. \n\nWhen making architecture choices (or rather recommendations, I have very limited agency ATM) I spend some time on the problem statement, then analysis and ideation what could possibly solve the problem, then I drill down a little to play with the ideas and create some kind of a mind model to evaluate some what-if scenarios, both optimistic but also, and especially, pessimistic. I do not dig into implementation details of specific components but rather their capabilities, e.g. if I design for multi tenancy I will be interested in capabilities and various ways of implementing it in a distributed system but without looking at how exactly the code / IaC would be written. That's tomorrow me's problem. Today's problem would be \"how would this model affect security / scalability\" or \"how easy or difficult would it be to onboard a new tenant\".\n\nWhat I end up with is some sort of a pros and cos list for each option, cost and risk matrix, e.g. I may recognize that some multi tenancy implementations could be risky from time pressure perspective while others would risk noisy neighbours problem, and such. \n\nNow that I have several options on the table, I would be looking at each of them as a list of trade-offs, eliminate options that have obvious deal breakers, and then try to order them from most to least aligned with priorities and/or most to least promising if there's no clear priority. That leads to a decision (if you have authority) or recommendations (if your role is only advisory).\n\nLast, but not least: I didn't mention earlier that it's also important to pay attention to how the system would evolve, how much upfront investment is needed to see first tangible results, and whether the architecture would be easy or hard to change or evolve into something else later. Some decisions may be very difficult to undo later, while others may leave a few options open, like building from simpler solutions that can be used as building blocks to create something more robust later, without turning the entire architecture upside down and a major overhaul. It's generally a flaw I see as a grunt in many, many architects in their ivory towers. From their perspective, a system is often a static entity that should reflect exactly their designs. If the system is incomplete or flawed then blaming happens. But a system is dynamic and ever evolving, and design docs are north stars at best and outright fantasy at worst. Remember that when designing.",

The problem is that, when you move from low level implementation and design to high level architecture decisions, the amount of criteria you need to consider for every decision is maybe one order of magnitude higher. You need to think about security, availability, integrity of data, identity/access management, auditing, scalability, maintenance, operations, team dynamics and tech affinity, domain specific criteria, backwards compatibility, testability etc. etc. the list goes on and on. You need specific experience with each of those topics, even if very generic and shallow, in order to make good architectural decisions. I think it's very important not to set expectations for yourself that you will be able to \"quickly\" learn how to make these decisions. A lot of it is just experience, which involves a lot of bad decisions.\n\nI would also add that architectural decisions are a shared responsibility, not something that the architect does in their ivory tower. But that's a different topic.\n\nSo I would say, just do your best and try to embrace the process. Solve problems one at a time, try to think about the long term implications, and keep learning on the side. But it's a very long road, set your expectations (and your manager's) accordingly.",

Normally what I would do, is just spend a day or two learning about it myself.  Very rarely, especially when it comes to architecture are solutions really that 'hard' to grasp.  So first step is understanding the problem itself, specifically how it applies to your business and how this problem has been solved before.\n\n - Step 1: Start googling about the problem (or AI) and start writing down the name (whatever you can further google) of different solutions to the problem you find\n - Step 2: Start googling each solution and identify the pros/cons of each one.\n - Step 3: Identify which solutions would 'best fit' your current situation.  I would argue this is more about future proofing, so don't pick a solution that works now but you know won't later when your company continues on it's growth trajectory.  OR pick one that works now, wont in the future but is easily adaptable TO work in the future.  You're really trying to avoid fucking yourself by getting into a situation where the old solution needs to be completely replaced and can't just be extended.\n - Step 4:  Once you have a solution or two you think would work, try to spec out what high level tasks, or work on your end, you would need to do to integrate it.\n\nFrom there you can flesh out different details you think might be important.  I do this for things that I can't already see an easy implementation for in my head, just so I'm more confident the solution can be implemented.\n\nThen pick the one you like best and present that.

Comparatively the rest of my week at home is quiet and I can get things done with more confidence that others aren’t as stuck or heading in the wrong direction. Besides that, in our small office, we spend lunch together, we ask each other about our weekends, we know and understand each other better which I think helps us work together better. Maybe we can achieve some of that fully remote but when we’ve tried to onboard fully remote people, the success and outcomes of that is not even close to having days working together in the office.\n\nFYI for all of the last ~20 years we’ve had some remote working, at least once there was confidence you could spend the majority of a day working independently, it has been expanded since covid and is unlikely to decrease. If anything we’re more likely to end up fully remote which would be a big negative for me and we would need to consider how we actually are working day to day and likely introduce more team meetings over the whole week as a minimum while still losing out on the chitchat that we have now.",

I did have one job where it was 4\\\\5 days in the office, but the offices I've worked at have always been a very short distance away. I fully understand the benefits of remote work if the office is way further away, and I worked overseas at one point, so had to be done. It's also good if the company can save money by moving to a smaller office space, not needing to have snacks etc. at the office so much, cleaning and utility costs go down. The push to 'get back in the office' is nothing but politics, from people who have invested in real-estate and now those spaces sit empty because most people work from home and don't rent those spaces. So let's push people back in.\n\nEven as a 100% remote worker, my days are often filled with meetings. Can't escape 'em, be it office or not. But I personally like to work with people face-to-face. Hopefully I will eventually land a job where I can again. I've been at consultancies for a while now, and in there you often work in separate projects, or people are from different cities and can't work in the same space.",

Some compiled their business logic into Apache. Triggers and stored procedures in the database or avoiding an RDBMS and storing data in files. Backend services that didn't speak HTTP. No front end frameworks. No/primitive ORMs. Version control optional. Treating servers like pets. URLs that were actual paths to HTML files.\n\n\nI think the \"convention over configuration\" ethos of Ruby on Rails really changed everything (even for people who have never touched Rails).

Initially we did it on remote days, and before that traditionally  async, but after doing it in office a few times everyone dreads doing it remote.

Hybrid works great for some situations.\n\nFor example in my government job, everyone had an office that they shared with someone else. WFH one or twice per week meant that you could deconflict the office about half the time, giving employees that “private office” experience.\n\nAlso the pace of work was pretty slow, so WFH days were in-effect a personal day. As long as your were (relatively) reachable via email or Skype For Business (🤮), you could mostly fuck around. People would literally say “don’t schedule meetings on my WFH days”.\n\nAt the fortune 100, I was both fully-in office and fully-remote at times. In-office was stupid: my team was spread out across the country. I was commuting in order to sit on zoom. Remote was an easy schedule, but it’s more disconnected. We would try to do a team retreat once or twice a year, and it was really nice to see everyone’s faces. I think pretty critical for being an actual “team”, and I wish we could have done it more often.\n\nWe also had a bunch of teams that were hybrid — I think it worked well for them. Many of our software teams developed embedded systems, or worked with our manufacturing plants. There was plenty of work that could *only* happen on-site, and it was nice to stay connected to the fundamentals of the company (welding metal, turning screws).\n\nAt my startup, we’re 5 days in office, and it’s the right call. Technical decisions happen too fast for the pace of async. People can stay in the loop just by overhearing conversations across the room. It’s a lot easier to trust other engineers when you spend more time with them, you get to know them as whole people. The team is only 9 right now, so who knows what happens if we grow to 30 or 100. Right now sticking all of us in one big room is the way to go.",

I think that's true for more people than they like to admit.\n\nI like office culture, I like developing bonds with coworkers. Exclusively WFH is incredibly isolating, it makes work boring. My mental is significantly better when I go through the morning rituals, commute, and actually interact with people. \n\nCollaboration is objectively better in office. I don't really understand how anyone can argue against this. You can actually talk, align, and resolve things within minutes. Remote work seems to create endless repeating alignment meetings.\n\nOn a selfish note, if we exclusively did WFH, I feel like most jobs would be off-shored. Why pay more for a domestic engineer when you interface with them the exact same way as someone internationally?\n\nLastly, I have seen enough engineers successfully get away with barely working when they are fully remote.\n\nTo address your specific questions:\n\n> I see a lot of cons, expensive underutilized office space, not being able to tap to a larger pool of talent, etc. \n\nOn the contrary, it enables us to rotate seats in a smaller rental office space. Similar benefits, lower cost. As for \"larger pool of talent\"; I haven't personally seen a struggle to find people of the right skill set, and even then, knowledge only takes you so far.\n\nAfter a certain point, for most teams, various soft skills (with the benefits of working together in person) become _significantly_ more important than having an extra framework on the CV. \n\n> For people working this way (in office 1, 2 days a week), do you see a benefit from the development side of things? I imagine this will be \"meeting heavy/discussion heavy\" days. \n\nOf course it's better to do collaborative tasks in person, but at least in my company I frequently have office days without major distractions.\n\nEdit: Downvoted for not blindly praising WFH. Cool, very mature.",

And then they figured out that they don't want to pay US wages when they get the same result from someone cheaper - they'll both be just pictures on a Zoom call anyway.\n\nYou can directly match the layoffs in corps in US and Western Europe to massive hiring in India, South America and East Europe.",

That just tells me they aren't affective in their comms tools imo (back in the old days, I'd be on IM and ignoring shoulder taps anyway ).\n- hiring manager has a different opinion to HR. I've been in this situation where my roles were hybrid but I never expected anyone to go to the office unless it was their choice. The only caveat was \"unless explicitly asked to for an event\"\n- it does make on boarding easier due to physical setup and debugging key IT before you're able to access the remote tools\n- insert office rent excuse here\n\n\nI think it always depends on the role. As a much more senior engineer /manager, you do kinda need to mix with other people and teams. I've found even tho I personally push good remote habits for my teams, others don't. Therefore I'm more encouraged to bridge their silo by being in person unfortunately. Even hybrid, this is problematic as teams usually have non overlapping days in to avoid busy offices..

I mainly use AI to automate the toil I don't enjoy like writing Jira descriptions, generating commit messages, that kind of thing. It's been great for offloading the tedious stuff.\n\nThe issue is leadership wants us using AI/BMAD for everything. Cradle to grave. They want AI mapping out epics, creating subtasks, working those subtasks, then having agents review, approve, merge the code, close the ticket, and iterate. Full loop, minimal human involvement.\n\nI'm all for eliminating toil, but this feels like overcorrection. I already complete a substantial amount of tickets each sprint and get praised for my productivity so it's not like the current approach isn't working. But I'm genuinely worried about my brain starting to atrophy. I don't want to spend my days zoning out while Claude writes legacy code straight out of the gate.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to balance what leadership's asking for with my own satisfaction in the work—the craftsmanship, staying engaged, actually learning things.

The latter owns a roadmap/wish list that lives in a separate system, and tech leads work with them to decide what gets done, but it doesn't get linked to the tickets, by design, so no one feels the urge to use tickets as a progression mechanism.\n\nThis all stems from the fact that I worked at a _lot_ of companies in hundreds of teams and organizations over the year (yes, that many), and there's literally no correlation between how tickets are handled, and the success of projects. But there IS a correlation between micromanagement from leadership or Product managers, and the _failure_ of projects. We separate the two so that doesn't happen. Also so stuff like the OP posted doesn't happen either.\n\nIts hard, we have to do it with PMs kicking and screaming sometimes, but its worth it.",

The story points were weighted such that one could reasonably close 8-10 1-point tickets/day with no issue, but you might spend a week on a single 3. After I got burned *hard* in a review, I switched to what everyone else was doing: that 3-pointer got broken into 50-60 little 1-pointers. Meanwhile, the actual amount of code I contributed decreased because now instead of actually writing code, I'm fucking around in Jira and Asana all day instead of just doing my job.\n\nBut this mess?

What ended up happening is surgeons took far less risky surgeries and it affected the bottom line of the hospital. Not to mention they didn’t risk their career to save someone’s life if the risk wasn’t worth it.\n\nIt’s been shown over and over again that measuring tickets in development environments always affects user behavior if the company does not invest in the time and resources to have accurate story points or some other measurement of effort assigned to the ticket. Someone changing one line in in the deployment script may have to do way more work testing the new configuration than someone who can push AI to refactor thousands of lines of unit tests.\n\nIf management aren’t willing to measure it or they don’t provides studies or past experiences where produced a positive outcome in their specific scenario then your managers are bad at their job. ",

In my previous company, after a management change, Jira dates and ticket metrics suddenly became very important, at the same time as a strong push on AI. Officially it was about productivity and standardization, but in practice it felt more like insecurity—trying to make people replaceable, even though everyone knew the systems were not.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, this approach usually does produce short-term efficiency and clean dashboards. The tradeoff shows up later. For personal adjustment, it helps to go along with the process without letting it explode in your own hands. Let AI handle the mechanical work, but deliberately keep ownership of design decisions, edge cases, and the “why” behind the system. That tends to keep people both comfortable now and relevant later.",

My tolerance for bullshit is reducing significantly. \n\nWe have top down constant reorgs every 6 months. At times, it truly felt like we are playing musical chairs. Decisions are made by non technical leaders and deadlines are enforced top down without input from engineers. It feels like most projects are doomed to fail from the start.\n\nAI coding mandates from senior management. There is a huge push by senior management to force engineers to use AI. AI usage is heavily tracked and reported in your year end review. It's not just AI usage is mandated but AI acceptance. As in, how many LLM response you accept without modifying. Supposedly the more LLM outputs you accept the more \"AI native\" you are. Those are the words of the management not mine lol.\n\nAs you can see, this is absurd. \n\nThe pay is good but honestly it is absolutely not worth the bullshit and stress. It has been insanely stressful lately with many 60 hour weeks. If you refuse the insane hours, you are immediately labelled as DNME. I know the market is bad but I'm wondering how common this is for other people? \n\nI'm trying to be more selective in my next job search. ",

Also goes without saying but acceptance rate is extremely gameable, so they’re incentivizing engineers to waste time gaming it.",

There was large allowance for work from home equipment you can choose. everyone seemed to care about the quality of the software we were making. Opinions and views of engineers were valued on every level. Only bad thing was the pay. Overall great company if the pay is enough for you. \n\nThen I joined a big 1000 head company, with a lot of revenue (many magnitudes bigger). Everyone's tenure was measured in months and 1-3 years max. Nothing was overtly wrong with the company but no training budget, low tenure resulted in most people not giving a shit. People were openly saying they were keen on leaving after getting some experience for a better opportunity... Even though there was nothing overly wrong with the company. On paper it was okay, some good teams, some bad - but the problem is no one cared.  Quality wasn't a concern to most engineers, management did all things right but they too were on the lookout to jump ship. It's not even that people's morale was low, it's just that no one particularly liked the company - always complaining about our equipment, office issues or such. \n\nIt was entirely different vibe.

              "text": "And that is: the time needed to make debugger \"just work\" without it being \"just bind it to the IDE\" (because that hasn't helped).\n\nSay the next, I am debugging a test that runs over a program that heavily uses DI, and it only fails when running on the cloud, it succeeds on my machine. I suspect that the problem is that it's loading a different module on the cloud that it does locally, and that it's causing certain effects to differ elsewhere. Say I have a way of creating a test that recreates the error, and am able to run it locally and on the cloud, and recreate the failure consistently.\n\nSo the answer here is simple: I run the test with debuggers on both environments. First I run it on the cloud to identify where the bug happens (if I already don't know) and record the pertinent state that lead to the bug. Then I run it locally and break at the point of the bug happening and see how the state differs, and identify what about the state changed that might have lead to the bug. Then I start crawling backwards. It's going to be a mess because there's a reflection gap that doesn't let me know which module is being ran where, but I identify potential modules that could be causing the problem locally, then set breakpoints and see on the cloud if they're the same module or something else is being called, then on the cloud I find out what modules are different from the local ones. Phew. Finally I can identify what modules to set breakpoints on, and go through them identifying which of the modules are creating the problematic state. Then it's a matter of debugging that module.\n\nAt this point I'd probably use also some code-archeology. I'd try to see if I can identify the commit where the bug starts to happen, and see what that commit did and try to connect it to my discovery above. This all would be a solid 4 hours of debugging if I don't get a lucky break.\n\nBut wait: how do I run a debugger on the cloud? If I can SSH into a container in there and run the test inside the container it's 'easy' just make sure that the container has access to `gdb`, hopefully there isn't any policy against putting such powerful software on the containers, I mean they have their own SSH host so who knows. But what if I work at a company that is a bit more reasonable and doesn't let me just SSH willy-nilly into most containers? I could do this on staging, but what if the error only happens in production? Ok I could attach my local GDB to the remote process, but this needs us to allow this to happen. Again there's some security concerns in allowing this.\n\nSo at this point the company needs to allow a debugger to run on their containers, and allow remote gdb attachment, and then they'd need a system to turn this on or off (since you don't want the ability on by default), and engineers need to know how to do this. All this on top of knowing how to use a debugger effectively.\n\nMeanwhile I already know how to run a process in the cloud, and how to recover logs from it. So it's a lot easier to just get it done.",

          "text": "A lot of it is cultural. Visual Basic had debugger as a first class citizen in the 90s. Early day C/C++ devs were used to GDB/WinDBG since the dawn of time. I think Pascal had some too in its IDE? (I didn't do much there). Java IDEs have had first class debuggers since the beginning. People who started their career there early on are used to using debuggers all the time.\n\nThen you have early 2000 stacks with the popularization of Rails (Ruby), Django (Python) and people doing system or embedded development in C/C++ that was hard to run locally. The debugging tools existed for this, but they were often not as powerful, and they definitely weren't slapped in your face. For the web, browser debuggers were very basic (IE6's was insanely hard to use, it integrated with Visual Studio too and it was buggy as hell). A lot of people who started in that era found that just doing console logging was faster and easier.\n\nSchools don't teach more advanced debugging features like how to inspect threads, how to use conditional breakpoints and watches, how to build custom debugging UIs (common in .NET or Java to inspect more complex data structures in the IDE), etc. Lots of people end up using IDEs like VS Code which work out of the box for simple projects, but require some setting up to work with non-standard environments, and its often not done.\n\nVery few people know how to use low level debuggers (GDB/WinDBG), especially with high level languages like Java or C#. If you know how to debug a memory dump from the command line you'll generally be seen like a wizard.\n\nSo you end up with a very divided community on what people are used to.\n\nI worked in developer platforms at several large tech companies, and we'd often survey our internal population on this, and it almost always landed at 50/50 between people who use debuggers vs not, and it almost always comes down to which development environment and programming languages they learnt on originally. The habit then follows them forever. There's almost no correlation with seniority (as in years of experience). At the senior level there isn't much correlation with career success, but when you get at the principal level, especially for full stack, backend or embedded/system developers, you will see correlation with how successful they are, because debugging insanely gnarly issues in production with console.log isn't happening.",

          "text": "I think a lot of this comes from their experiences with poor tooling honestly. I hope to god this has changed, but every time I’ve tried to use the Python debugger, it wants to use stdin/stdout, and overriding the default is a PITA that requires writing a subclass to initialize it. Have you guys ever tried to debug a program where the debugger is not only stealing the program’s input and interpreting it as debug commands but also corrupting the output?!\n\nThen there’s the Ruby debugger, which also uses stdio, but is easier to override, but then the Ruby maintainers broke the debug API in some major way, so people were maintaining their own forks. I sent some patches to one of the more popular forks, and the new maintainer was doing some ‘optimizations’ to the REPL by removing the ‘print’ and ‘pp’ commands because he deemed them redundant. Of course, in Ruby those functions return the string they output, so when you’re going around inspecting expressions the output is always doubled. Like hey, have you guys ever used a debugger before?!?\n\nI’ve worked at several companies where the source maps for the frontend were either missing or corrupted in some way, nobody knew how to fix it, most people didn’t know what source maps were. I spent a long night trying to fix them but the build system was so perversely convoluted that I couldn’t figure it out. \n\nNeedless to say, now I’m very careful about who I work for, what I work on, and how much time they spend maintaining the ‘developer experience’.\n\nWhenever people mention the 10x developer, I always just think oh, the people who always run their code from the debugger in case it crashes or they want to set a breakpoint, the people who step through their code the first time they run it to make sure it does exactly what they expect. The people who are getting an automatic read back in their IDE of the return value of every function from an unfamiliar API instead of adding a printf statement on every other line like a fricken’ caveman!",

Probably microservices, this decouples your releases - except when it gets hairy\n\n  * make sure you have a communication channel that is just engineers. You don’t want to have a scrum master talk to another scrum master who talks to the head scrum master you flags you down with a burning impediment. I suggest the tech leads all have a meeting together. While I understand agile’s desire for transparency POs and scrum masters, if they have to join, need to be non talking\n\n  * need to have a way to communicate news and breaking changes around the project. Sometimes that news will be “the beta env will be a little weird today”, sometime that news will be “ok, we’re adopting new logging standards, here’s what the team need to do”\n\n  * work to build architecture decisions that decouple critical paths. If you have a change that requires service A to change then service B to change because of that, don’t require two simultaneous releases (ie: service A versions their API until service B is updated or whatever).\n\n  * echo the part about a standardized pipeline: *hits hood* there’s so much room for governance in this baby\n\n  * onboarding checklist.

The team that had better defined technical leaders contributors did better to steer the platforms into a clear technical direction.\n\nIf you have a single or small number of codebases, having strict conventions, in terms of code organization, patterns, technology, etc, can be SO beneficial. It makes it easier for people to switch teams and projects and get up to speed quickly if things look familiar everywhere. Otherwise, people get holed up in their teams and parts of the codebase.\n\nYou really need to push your team to document everything and get in that habit. At ~15 people you know everyone by name, know who knows what, it is easy to talk about things, you don't really need to document every weird thing. At 50 people that doesn't work anymore, there's too many people. But people aren't used to needing to document stuff so during the fast growth phases newcomers really feel the weight of the implicit unwritten knowledge.\n\nStandards of quality need to be set in stone, whatever they are. The people who owned and grew the codebases at ~15 will become a minority and the codebases will grow out of their hands. Without clear guidelines of how things should be made, the codebases will grow in disparate directions and your older staff will burn out.\n\nIf you manage to build teams that work well together and bond, keeping them together is a great investment.

It may make sense for life-threating software development like health technology or aviation, or finance, but for most SaaS that check will hurt more than it will help\n\nBUT I do agree that a central \"tools\" / CICD team is so important - not just for making dev tools and processes that increase development speed - but also for establishing consistent practices across the engineering org. \n\nEven if they aren't approving every PR, they are creating consistent CI/CD process requiring tests to pass, or linting, that  can enforce that every team has the same quality checks out-of-the-box.\n\nSo many companies that I worked for where there are 12 different languages across different teams all building REST APIs. Different database types - some using grpc, some protobuf, various different auth methodologies, some with versioned apis some without.  And that variance slows down development extensively as engineering scales up.  (Also infrastructure costs explode because noone is cleaning up after themselves during the hyper growth period).\n\nInstead imagine a terraform template anyone can use to spin up infra with the correct tags for costing, or a Spring Boot (or whatever your language of choice framework is) customized template that people can use to ensure all REST API services are doing things the same way, and a organization github repo with templated github actions that run the same checks and deployments on every project etc, etc.",

There is something called communication distance, it measures how \"far people are away from each other by language, work times, same building, beliefs, hobbies, political view etc.\"  \n  \nIf the communication distance is very high, lets say you have a completely international team where no one speaks english as their native language and is in their home office, everyone has different hobbies, differnent views etc. They will not talk to each other if they don't need.

The most things are done normally by the team (because the team normally knows best how they work most effective). The big job of a leader is to make safe, trustful working environment (and I'm not meaning the FORD Modell here, this have driven so many companies into trouble). \n\nWhen we talk about governance, if you work in a very big company.

      "text": "Context: we are a WordPress development agency. We build WordPress websites for clients, nothing special.\n\nYesterday, we had a presentation covering all changes being made for 2026. As of this year, we are mandated to use Cursor. Not just that, they also introduced a Figma + Cursor workflow demo and expect us to adopt this workflow as soon as possible. They forecasted that we would be able to cut development cost in half. \n\nEvery single person in the room was on board, except for me. I rarely use AI, apart from maybe writing simple, pure functions, or debugging stuff I don't really care about and just need a pragmatic solution for. Personally, I don't see using AI as something necessarily beneficial. It has its uses, but I just see it as a different way of writing code, which is only 10% of my job. This new workflow however, is really something else. I don't even know what to think about it.\n\nOn the one hand, I hate it. It goes against everything I stand for and everything I think is critical for writing quality software. But on the other hand, we're not *really* writing software, we're just building crappy websites. I'm the only one in my team who is actually an experienced programmer with a passion for it. I do open source in my free time, just not as a profession (mainly because writing good software is generally not important to businesses).\n\nFor this reason, I'm starting to think this way of working might actually be (economically) viable for the company. The Figma demo showed one of our developers building a section of a website in 3 minutes, something that takes an average dev about 4 hours. Yes, it will probably break and be a nightmare to maintain, but I feel the time saved might *actually* make it worthwhile, because our websites really are very simple.\n\nSafe to say, I'm leaving this place as soon as I find something. Pay is good though. I'm just wondering if somebody else is using this exact workflow and can give me some insight on how this will most likely unfold in the long run. I'm genuinely curious, because I believe it might work as much as I don't.",

It's also not clear that time-to-PR is the right thing to measure. After all, you might have a very large project where the total is not the sum of its parts. It could be more, it could be less. But tickets could just be LOC all over again. Depends a lot on the project, and there's a lot of subjectivity involved.\n\nNow of course, I don't want to be moving the goalposts to some unachievable level of expertise, that wouldn't be fair. But I'm also not sure what experimental design would satisfy me, so might as well be honest about that.\n\nYou also gotta ask whether you it is even reasonable to expect a speedup. How many of these 16 RCT devs were actually proficient with the new tools before starting to use them? I wouldn't expect someone new to the tool to immediately see gains.\n\nFor now, I've only got personal experience to go by, from a variety of devs. AI is great for taking the mental load off. You can get a lot of small edits done, to a decent standard. All I can give is my own examples, and testimony from a few friends. The stuff works, it is definitely worth more than $200/month.

I have a less senior colleague who has been on our team for about 3 years now.\n\nWhile he's generally progressing well on his career path, he seems to have trouble improving on one particular area of his work; specifically, as the title says, he jumps to conclusions quite quickly, and that ends up getting in his own way a lot.\n\nFrequently, he'll start to tackle a task, run into a problem, and then make a bunch of assumptions about the nature of that problem and its solution space, sometimes leading him on hours-long side quests trying to solve an XY problem, when simply taking a bit more time to understand the original problem would have overall have saved him (and sometimes his coworkers) a lot of time.\n\nHe has received feedback on this point repeatedly over multiple years, and I think in theory he knows that he should \"stop and think\" a bit more often, but he's really had trouble building intuition about when the right moments for that are vs. \"just\" trying to solve a problem.\n\nHe's otherwise a solid engineer, has pretty good technical depth and breath, is great at focusing on our customer's needs, etc., so I really want him to be able to make more career progress instead of getting stuck because of this \"one little thing\".\n\nSo ... any ideas? Anybody have had similar coworkers and had success guiding them? Maybe a type of project where they could practice these skills better? Or any resources that talk about this type of problem? I'm grateful for anything!",

      "text": "Been doing this for 13 years. Wanted to get into because videogames, ended up doing \"boring\" software, but actually enjoying the craft.\n\nI notice (now) that I've been slowly burning up these last years. While some personal issues (which will be finally solved during the vacation I mention on the title) have made things harder, I've been feeling more and jaded of the industry as time has passed and I've come to know the new trends on making software that \"modern companies\" have embraced.\n\nI fucking hate agile. Yeah, yeah, \"how agile is implemented in the places that are doing it wrong.\" Whatever. \"Dailies\" that take half an hour because everyone else is competing to say more things, \"Retros\" that never really lead to actionable changes. Cargo culture meetings where no one listens.\n\nI'm sick and tired of SAFE and their PI plannings. Hours lost on endless discussions over abstract requirements, \"playing poker\", \"selecting t-shirt sizes\" and other stupid ways to basically make the team do what I've always seen as the Team Leader's job of planning something, all to end up with the requirements being slightly wrong, but the blame if we don't get on the bullshit time we made up falling on us.\n\nAlso, I can't bear how all this nonsense (agile-ish and SAFE) only caters to the more extrovert personalities and how most of these meetings where \"collaboration\" is expected are dominated by one or two guys that never. stop. talking.\n\nA few years ago, reaching a similar point to this would have been a signal for jumping ship, but I'm *dreading* start doing interviews again. I can't bring myself to tell a recruiter that \"the current direction the company wants me to move does not align with my interests\", nor trying to show myself as someone interested in technology. Oh, a new Docker version. Groovy. Oh, you use this architecture instead of this other, how interesting. Oh, how could have I lived without the new Java version. Let me take a fucking seat because I'm dizzy.\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that jumping ship, on this economy, will lead me to lower wages and worse conditions.\n\nI don't know. I see other colleagues and they gleefuly engage on all this bullshit, but I feel that I can't keep up with the more \"extroverted\" types discussing that new abstract feature because I lost track of what a \"McGuffingRequestEngager\" is, and before I could ask, they have moved on to something different. What is worse, I feel like I don't give a fuck anymore, that I need to be handheld for most tasks because I don't remember that the McGuffingBO is used to hold orders not processed but also wishlist items. I don't remember when was the last time I could concentrate on something for more than 10 minutes, let alone \"being in the zone\" (our local development environments being awfully slow and hanging continuously doesn't help). I don't remember when was the last time I was confident on a task assigned to me. I don't remember when was the last time I gave a fuck about anything that happened in my company.\n\nSo yeah, besides going to therapy, which is something I'm going back shortly, what the fuck can I do. As I said, I'm on a short vacation to get some other type of shit done. I can't take more vacations shortly, and I need to turn around this and get my shit together, either to look something else or to start giving a shit at my current company.\n\nAny ideas?",

The symptoms you are feeling are just gonna get worse and worse and worse until eventually you're so burned out that you won't just be going a few steps back, but a few dozen steps back now. Accept that these are the circumstances and that there is no shortcut around them, you have to take some steps back in one way or another. You can either do it in a controlled and healthy way, or you can keep going until it's forced on you in an explosive, chaotic, and unhealthy way.

In my case it is a situation where I was basically left alone to rot because of going to a strict \"java only\" policy when projects with 6+ years on them are written in python or dotnet.  I'm the last dotnet developer here and they basically threw me on a java team with no time to reskill, to rewrite a project that provably through data evidence is not viable.\n\nI've been stuck alone for nearly 2 years having to man multiple servers and deal with several projects.  Sympathy from others but little relief granted.   And truthfully it has made me question a lot of things.  I've already started searching for a new job and actively applying to them.  I'm hoping for a layoff after explaining the viability problem along with the reasoning why this evidence was not presented ages ago (I was basically requesting additional staff so there was time to investigate but the product owner kept wanting to expand his product out without addressing these issues).\n\nWhat I learned from all this is if the guy who hired you leaves one year after hiring you, the guy he works for leaves 6-8 months after, and then the company changes hands a year later, it might be a good idea to find another place to work.",

Instead, I was sitting on a 3-hour meeting discussing a poorly defined API and trying to assign to the task, for some reason, a t-shirt size.

In my first job, I was paid only for the hours I spent in VS Code. If I was on Google, or anything else ( even Stackoverflow ) , I was considered not working because the person monitoring wasn’t a tech person ( I stayed in that job mainly because I’m from Algeria, a third-world country, and the company was based in Saudi Arabia.

It isn't a role that is essential or needed or one that can't be taken over by a developer.\n\n\nMy current place made the agile department redundant which a lot of us seen coming.\n\n\nThere is a running joke going around. \"Never ask a woman how old she is. Never ask a man how much he earns and never ask a scrum master what they do all day\"\n\n\nA friend of mine during calls would amuse himself by randomly asking \"and what do you think (scrum master)? \" He would always answer \"sorry what was the question?\" He was never listening.\n\n\nIt's not a real job.",

The fact that so many people have hitched onto the productive aspect of software development as part of a wider entourage is nutty. I'm not talking about marketing, sales, legal, design or whatever but rather POs / PMs / TPMs / \"Agile Coaches\" and the like who do not have any engineering background.\n\nIf there isn't sound technical knowledge, which doesn't have to be perfect but should be solid, that person should not be considered for these roles. And people will say that's \"gate keeping\" and yes, it is. I believe teams will be worse and less effective for having low technical excellence and it's a gate you should keep if you want a lean and functional organisation.\n\nI see so much in my current role how team leads can be undermined and put into incredibly awkward situations because of people who don't know their fundamentals and who aren't a clear part of the same reporting line so common expectations can be set from above.

I know that's a flawed analogy but the idea here is that we shouldn't prop up a false dichotomy.

The scrum master role is either picked up by Devs (rotated) or people managers.\nUsually these teams are 5 Devs with a people manager. None of the other roles are dedicated posts they are done by devs. The people manager might be for 3 teams.\nNever worked in a software company that had dedicated full time scrum masters, or testers come to that, that's always shifted left. So Devs basically take on all the roles aside from people manager. A people manager should never be a dev or ex dev, they usually make absolutely terrible managers. Usually they don't even prefer people managing to dev .. ridiculous doing a job you have no skill at and dont like! \nThey are pretty good at all the other roles though.",

      "text": "Context: I (\\~5yoe) have been working on a project, and a colleague is working on another project that is very similar (Python, ML, greenfield) at the same time. They are using AI a lot (90% AI generated probably) while I'm using it a lot less. I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to almost 1 to 1 compare and see where AI is still lacking. In the AI-generated one:\n\n1. Straight up 80% of the input models/dtos have issues.Things are nullable where they shouldn't be, not nullable where they should be, and so many other things. Not very surprising as AI agents lack the broad picture.\n2. There are **a lot** of tests. However, most tests are things like testing that the endpoint fails when some required field is null. Given that the input models have so many issues this means that there are a lot of green tests that are just.. pointless\n3. From the test cases I've read, only 10% or so have left me thinking \"yeah this is a good test case\". IDK if I'm right in feeling that this is a very negative thing, but I feel like the noise level of the tests and the fact that they are asserting the wrong behavior from the start makes me think they have literally negative value for the long term health of this project.\n4. The comment to code ratio of different parts of the project is very funny. Parts dealing with simple CRUD (e.g. receive thing, check saved version, update) have more comments than code, but dense parts containing a lot of maths barely have any. Basically the exact opposite of comment to code ratio I'd expect\n5. Another cliche thing, reinventing wheels. There's a custom implementation for a common thing (imagine in memory caching) that I found an library for after 2mins of googling. Claude likes inventing wheels, not sure I trust what it invents though\n6. It has this weird, defensive coding style. It obsessively type and null checks things, while if it just managed to backtrack the flow a bit it would've realized it didn't need to (pydantic). So many casts and assertions\n7. There's this hard to describe lack of narrative and intent all throughout. When coding myself, or reading code, I expect to see the steps in order, and abstracted in a way that makes sense (for example, router starts with step 1, passes the rest to a well named service, service further breaks down and delegates steps in groups of operations that makes sense. An example would be persistence operations which I'd expect to find grouped together). With AI code there's no sense or rhyme as to why anything is in the place it is, making it very hard to track the flow. Asking claude why it put one thing in the router and why it randomly put another thing in another file seems akin to asking a cloud why it's blowing a certain way.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I'm not the one responsible for fixing or maintaining this project. On the plus side the happy path works, I guess.",

It loves over complicating things and, while it can write a lot of tests it also writes a lot of identical tests that don't actually positively assert the thing they say they're checking.  (It's really bad for this...  Even with careful prompting!)\n\nJust yesterday I had an islands problem in some data, and hoo boy did it screw that one up.  The only good it did was point out that it's just the island problem, and I cracked out the actually good sql statement quick enough.\n\nToday I was trying to run some performance analysis, and it couldn't even do a simple convert from json to csv using powershell.  I mean really?  That's a one-liner.\n\nIt has its uses.  It's good for mundane repetitive things, and when trying to figure out a new-to-me problem it's like search engines before marketing figured out SEO.  Actually useful - a while back I needed to re-project some gis geometry into our coordinates and it got it right away, then when asked it gave me a dozen different well document algorithms to reduce the point density. It was great that day.\n\nFor comments, yup.  It over comments obvious stuff, but some real weird logic?  Nothing.  It's 50/50 on detecting magic numbers when asked to do a comments check, and never adds them on its own.\n\nAlthough for your negative assertions, that is often still worth checking.  You never know what someone else will do in the future, and a call succeeding when it should have failed can lead to bad data states.  Think of an api endpoint that needs, say, an id, but it saves without one.  You now have orphaned data that the integration thinks saved correctly.  I'd test that, because I've seen a lot of people writing integrations that really shouldn't be.",

The tooling mainly consists of a python framework for writing custom ETL workloads, and a kubernetes cluster to run said workloads.\n\n\nMost of our users are not software engineers - and as you can imagine the quality of the code they produce varies wildly. There are a \\\\\\~20% minority who are quite good good and care about things like readability, testing, documentation etc. But the majority of them are straight up awful. They write functions 100s of lines long with multiple levels of nesting, meaningless one-letter variable names etc. They also often don't understand things like basic memory management (e.g. if you have a 100GB csv file you probably shouldn't try to read it all into memory at once).\n\n\nThe number of users we have has grown rapidly in the last 6-12 months - and as a small team we're struggling to keep up. Previously we would have reviewed every pull request, but that's no longer possible now that we're outnumbered by about 30 to 1. And as the code quality has decreased, we have seen an increase in outages/issues with platform stability - and are constantly having to step in and troubleshoot issues or debug their code, which is usually painful and time consuming.\n\n\n\nWhile many of you reading this are probably thinking this is an organizational problem rather than a technical one (which I would agree with), sadly I haven't had much success convincing management of this. Also, it's difficult to draw hard boundaries in terms of responsibility - since it's rarely obvious if the issue is stemming from a users code or from our framework/infra (and even if it is obviously their code, it might not be obvious to them).\n\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has experience in similar situations, and what tools you used to help prevent tech debt spirally out of control without needing to \"babysit\". Some things we've been discussing/done already:\n\n\n- Linting in CI: has helped somewhat, but a lot of people find ways around it (e.g. using inline \\`ignore\\` comments etc.). There are also many legacy files which added before we introduced the linter which  have had to be added to an \"allow list\" as there are so many errors to address (and no time to address them). \n\n- Enforcing test coverage not decreasing in CI: Ensures people are writing tests, but most are just writing fairly meaningless tests in order to get the CI to pass rather than actually testing intended behaviour.\n\n- AI code review tools: a teammate suggested this, I am a bit sceptical but also don't really have any experience with them.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This is a very common challenge for platform teams. Here's some clear suggestions:\n\n1. Either keep the framework and the code that uses the framework in separate repos (best), or set up path filters and treat it like a monorepo. Either way, user code and framework code should not be in the same place. \n\nThis is important because you need to stop caring about the code users write. Instead of thinking about how to get them to write better code, you need to start planning for the inevitable horrible, buggy, and memory-exhausting code. Your framework needs to worry about the 1% worst-case, not the average case. \n\n2. I don't see you mentioning better process separation, and you mention you already do k8s. But then you also mention platform instability. So to be clear - the first rule of an integration platform is that it should be **impossible** for user code to take down the entire system for other users. This usually means process isolation and resilient failure handling. Again, this goes back to your mindset as a platform owner - stop assuming your untrusted users can get better, start testing against infinite loops, 'malicious' code intended to try to crash your platform from the user's side, etc. Then fix those one-by-one until users are truly isolated.\n\n3.  Forget linting, test coverage, and code reviews. Again, the mindset is wrong. You cannot change your users. If they are non-technical, they will always write horrible code. Your job is to make it very clear to everyone when it is the user's fault and not the platform's fault. This means learning more about observability. Take a look at the OpenTelemetry standard if your team doesn't already have a monitoring solution. This will also likely involve some refactoring to make it very clear whose fault a failure is. \n\nOkay, that's my most important advice. But there's one catch.\n\n\\> As the code quality has decreased, we have seen an increase in outages/issues with platform stability - and are constantly having to step in and troubleshoot issues or debug their code, which is usually painful and time consuming.\n\nIs this because you don't know if it's the platform's fault or bad user code? If so, then great - doing #3 will also solve this problem. But, if you are being held accountable for them to achieve their *outcomes* even if its their own fault their code doesn't work, then you actually will need to worry about making their code better. \n\nThe two ways of doing that are:\n\n1. Provide an SDK that makes some of the harder coding parts simple.\n\nThis way, you can reclaim ownership of some of the things that they would otherwise need to write themselves, and you can do it the right way. The downside is that this comes with the need to educate them on how to use it, debug/answer questions when issues arise, etc. It may get them to a solution quicker, but it puts the burden back on you.\n\n2. AI Verification\n\nYou mentioned this, and while I don't think just plugging in a vendor like CodeRabbit would work in this case, you could build a custom coding assistant that can help them write better code. I do this for a living and I wouldn't recommend doing it if you can't invest either the budget to hire someone like me, or the time and iteration cycles to build it yourself. There's a lot of people promising magic right now with AI, and a lot of it is smoke and mirrors. You're talking about 6+ months of dedicated effort to get to something that is reliable, and you'll get what you pay for (both in terms of model quality and engineering quality). \n\nBut sounds like this isn't really the direction for you and you should focus your time on the first part of my post. Anyway, good luck! I was working on a Platform team for six years, happy to give more insights if you have more questions or can provide more context.",

Here’s what I would do \n* Create a non production environment that analysts can use as a playground. They should be able to query whatever data they need and run code in an ad hoc environment. Preferably both their laptop and a Jupyter notebook type environment. This should make it so you get out of their way for non prod workflows. \n* For prod workflows if it’s feasible control the onboarding process. Each new application (I’m guessing they’re mostly batch jobs), give a well defined onboarding and deploy process. Make it so each application has its own directory. Teams can’t share code between directories and they can only deploy to prod if they go through your onboarding process. After that the control what’s in the application and when to deploy changes, but at least you control the number of applications and should have some idea of what each one does. \n* From there standardize observability and alerting. Each batch process comes with some boilerplate metrics that you can use to keep track of failure/success rate, runtime, resources usage, etc. This way you can create a dashboard to keep track of problematic applications. \n* Last make sure every application has an alert pathway. This will be part of your onboarding process. If a team is going to deploy something to prod, they have to be on call for it. If the application fails they get paged. You can be flexible with business hours vs all hours alerts, but this should create some incentive for teams to deploy better code. \n\nStretch goal \n* Define business SLO for each critical application. This can be part of the onboarding and you can force teams to populate this data by providing a framework they need to use to run the application. The SLO should be tied to the business goal the application is optimizing. If it’s doing its job and not eating up resources you can probably ignore an application.",

          "text": "The answer is, first and foremost, put a kiddie fence. What I mean is start looking into the code they are generating, and see if you can give them a framework to take that in. Personally I think that, given the expertise level, a specialized DSL scripting language that translates into python might be a good solution, but the costs are high, and honestly python is not that inaccessible.\n\nSo the first goal is to build an isolation system. Can you put all non-technical code into separate modules that do not interact with each other, and have limited impact on your system? Start to re-architect so that things are like this. You won't have things get better. So once you can put each one in modules separately, upgrade these modules to be optional, things you can turn on or off. After that put it into systems where you only run the modules specified. Python actually is very friendly to this, but there's a lot of ways to make this module framework work, what is best for you depends on your context. I can't really solve that for you per se. Now you can isolate jobs depending on their situation.\n\nThe other nice advantage of isolating and modularization the code people are putting in, is that it's easier for the authors to declare tech bankruptcy and start again, and you yourself limit what you need to maintain.\n\nThis should help limit the blast-radius that bad code can have on the system. Once this is done the next step is to create systems that nudge people to do better code. We don't want to force people here, and we want carrots, not sticks, at this point. Otherwise it'll never stick. What we want is to help all the people who want to be good developers, but just don't know how. I can vouch for AI code-reviews: think of them like advanced linters or error detecting linters like [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) or (if you're not afraid to be a bit more bleeding edge, which I personally discourage) [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)). The AI is just another advanced linter that identifies common mistakes and recommends certain things that can be done. AI code-review assistants can also assist in helping you start a conversation, or at least have the code be happier. Note that, as you saw yourself, this doesn't help with people who don't really care about code quality and just want to get things done and move on.\n\nThe next step is to start to add a bit more of regulations, but we're going to add them as carrots rather than sticks (even though they basically become sticks). So what we do first is we start tracking metrics for each module: how long has it lasted without bugs, code coverage, if it passes the linter or which linter warnings it has, and how many times are linters flipped off (per line)). Basically you find a way to get a how \"reliable\" the code is. When a PR on a module is done, based on how large the PR is, and what are the metrics of the module with the PR merged in, you decide that if the reliability score is high enough for the PR it doesn't need a review from the team. If it does not pass the score, then it needs a PR from the team. You set this number at one that lets you review a reasonable amount of PRs, with the confidence that you are reviewing the ones that probably need it the most, in general. Don't make this system hidden or implicit, be very explicit and clear, if the reason my PR needs a review is because I have 20 lint-switches in my 200 LoC module, that gives me an incentive to remove those and make the linter happy by actually writing good code. As more of the non-technical developers start doing better quality code, the bar for what is needed to avoid review goes higher (as there aren't that many PRs that are \"that bad\" left).\n\nFinally this is where we get to the crazy part. Consider using LLMs that are trained on how to use your module framework, and the conventions, and guidance, and all that, so that it knows how to improve the code. Have the tool only run on modules that have at least some testing and a minimum code-coverage, but it can improve everything else. At first let people just use it as a way to fix the PR so it doesn't need review, but once it becomes reliable and trustworthy enough, consider just having it run throughout the tools.\n\nAt this point you should have data that modules that have a certain score, or certain things not be true, are really bad. Here is where we get the stick finally. We collect data on how many extra eng-hours a module consumes, as well as resources (including CPU time) and other effects (delays on releases, etc.) Once you have this price-tag you take this to leadership, and show that \"modules with 40% code coverage cost us $XXXX less per month, if we updated all our module to have at least 40% CC our estimated savings would be $XXXXX per month or $XXXXXXXXX per year. Once you explain that, you can convince leadership to create a policy requiring that modules have at least 40% CC, with a transition plan and phase. Then you can now prevent submitting code unless it at least has that amount of test code-coverage.",

      "text": "I joined an early-stage startup as a senior/principal-leaning IC. The initial expectation was that I’d take over from another experienced engineer and bring ownership to a chaotic system area (unclear ownership, multiple migrations, overlapping initiatives, no tech leadership set).\n\nMy first ~3 months were spent understanding the system, identifying risks, and writing proposals / vision docs to align the team on its purpose. This was deliberate - alignment felt necessary. I saw this as the way to enable team because I felt they were dependent on senior engineers little too much. \nRecently, the founder gave feedback that this approach was “consultant mode”: the analysis made sense, but execution and customer-facing impact were lacking. Since then, expectations have shifted sharply to fast execution, tight timelines, PoCs, and visible momentum.\n\nI’m now on what I feel is a short PIP (~2 weeks) and being implicitly compared to engineers who have been in the org for a while. I was told to come with a project I want to own and deliver by myself. And It feels like I’m suddenly being evaluated more like a mid-level execution IC than a senior/principal owner, with very little room for mistakes or ramp-up. My ramp tends to be deliberate rather than reactive. I spend time upfront understanding the system and constraints - I do not consider hacking up quickly to be my strongest traits (something I called out during hiring) \n\nI feel the company has only seen people who have been in the org for a while rise to this position. They have not onboarded engineers from outside in this position and they seem to be of the assumption that senior folks should be able to enable themselves quickly on their own.\n\nAnother observation of mine is expectations have increased with the availability of AI. \n\nMy questions:\n- Is this a normal expectation shift in early-stage startups?\n- Is calling alignment/vision work “consultant mode” fair feedback or a red flag?\n- How do you tell the difference between underperformance vs role mismatch when goalposts move this fast?

Yes, the strategic direction is important especially over the long term. But IMO the undertone of this “consultant” feedback is that you are doing a lot of talking and no action. Most people don’t like being told what to do, let alone by the new guy, especially the one who hasn’t actually shipped anything.\n\nI like to do the “junior to staff speedrun” on new teams. Just fix a bug (junior task) on day 1. Then try and take on a feature (mid), then start steering a medium sized project as an IC/project lead (senior). Then you have more credibility to start making strategic calls. Show them you can walk the walk, not just talk.",

You need to be able to adjust, and 3 months is enough for a full rewrite at most startups at that size. \n\n> is “consultant mode” fair feedback or a red flag\n\nBeing honest - it’s fair feedback. It’s a little too slow (and their response is a bit too quick) but remember that they hired you and it’s expensive for them lose you and rehire - 2 weeks is a short period of time, but in a startup it’s enough to make a difference.

I never got formally PIPed, but after 3 months I was effectively reduced to a glorified IC; I still played the role of tech lead by buying space for my team to do their work. I justified it with my CTO by saying that taking over the grunt work will let me ramp better over the long run, while I let the rest of the team take on the big projects they have context for with me overseeing them. 3 months later I was let go, though it's unsure if it was due to performance (just 2 weeks prior he was praising me during stand-ups) or board pressure (they just had a board meeting the week prior, they hadn't made any sales in 2 years, etc.).\n\nMy opinion would be to suck it up and do your best while looking for another role that better fits your skill set and experience. Give your manager what they want to see, performative theatrics and all, just to buy yourself some time. This was my approach and by the time I was let go, I was deep into several interviews and ultimately only spent a month unemployed.\n\nYou seem to be in a position where you know what you're good at and what value you provide to an engineering team and org.

Maybe they copied and pasted from the leveling guide from a much larger company, maybe someone in their VC cohort gave them tips and they didn't do a good job of adapting those to the nuances of their business, whatever. It turned out that they needed something else, and you (unfortunately) were the beta tester that helped them figure that out. Sucks, but not uncommon for roles like this.\n\nThe reverse interview is really important for staff+ roles in early stage companies.

Early startups usually reward shipping and survival over long-term narrative clarity. Vision work tends to matter more once the company has product-market fit or real scale. Before that, impact is often measured by what actually ships, not how well it’s articulated.\n\nAs for underperformance versus role mismatch, from their perspective, role mismatch is just one cause of underperformance. Both can be true at the same time.\n\nThe key takeaway is mindset. In early startups, you’re expected to own outcomes and ensure important work actually ships, whether you do it yourself or delegate it. If that expectation doesn’t match how you work best, it doesn’t mean you’re bad, it means this startup may not be the right fit.

They only hire staff+ people because they see Google doing it and think they should emulate \n\nI've worked in all size of orgs from 2 people seedlings through scale up and corporate.

No judgement on your abilities, more a judgement on startups.\n\nStartups don’t care about code quality - the best code in the world doesn’t matter if you’re not making money and the company only has a year of runway and might not exist next year.\n\nI can’t count the number of times we made a shitty technical decision and labeled it a “happiness problem” if we had to go back and fix it - cause that meant we were still alive and popular enough that it would become a problem - the unspoken assumption being that we probably were going to run out of money before we had to fix it.\n\nWhenever I join a new startup, my goal is to get code in production in my first week. After a month I expect to be delivering whole features from the backlog, and after 3 months I’m trying to anticipate what we’ll need 3 months from now and build toward that.\n\nAll engineers at a startup are ICs, that’s a baseline. Your seniors/staff/CTO are expected to do their role responsibilities on top of IC work.\n\nGood luck dealing with the PIP. Start shipping and stop analyzing and you might be ok. Otherwise you might want to find a more mature startup or an established company to be a staff in.",
