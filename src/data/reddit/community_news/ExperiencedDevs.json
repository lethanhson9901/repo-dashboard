His most recent take:\n\n“everyone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n\\- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n\\- majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life\n\n\\- they're not using AI to be 10x more effective they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend\n\n\\- the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon\n\n\\- even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real\n\n\\- your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills”",

What made them so great early on were the constraints, and that is where innovation happened. \n\nA lot of companies given resource constraints really innovate and find themselves concentrated on the biggest bang for their time. When you can quickly build anything you want (abet poorly) you will find there is not enough push back to every question an idea. You end up flooding users with poorly built features and make it harder to do the one thing you were good at.\n\nI could be wrong. Netflix was making slop before AI, people loved doom scrolling social media, Uber’s interface is confusing and awful, and there is a reason why Amazon is filled with cheap items that barely work. Maybe in the end quantity really does matter.",

Back in the 90s and early 00s there were limitations to what you could do on both the technical and artistic side of video games due to the limitations of the hardware. This led to tremendous creativity and a focus on good art direction. This is how you get games like Silent Hill,  Halo, many of the great CRPGs and many many more.\n\nNow with almost no real limitations game design has not only stagnated in the AAA, but has also homogenized in both art direction and feature set. Limitations are the cornerstone of creative solutions. They keep scope under control, and allow the implementation of novel and actually exciting solutions.",

The guy who sent them suggested I could use a curl script to approve them but joked there could be an Easter egg. I told him I wasn’t going to do that and took 40 minutes to confirm every pr. One of them did in fact accidentally have a bunch of code unrelated to the expected change because his local branch was dirty. \n\nTo be clear I don’t blame this mistake on ai. He could have done it with a hand rolled bash script. I blame ai for the fact people don’t double check well enough anymore.",

And sales deps making ridiculous promises to clients. \n\nI will probably never forget the idiot in the company I worked at, that said \"Yes\" to my country's largest telecom provider when they wanted to scale up customer support. The company didn't even have enough space in the office building to put the extra fucking desks for the employees they needed to hire and they had like 4 weeks to figure it out. They also didn't have anyone available to manage the new hires or offer the on-hands support during onboarding. ",

I was a subject matter expert on a handful of internal systems, and I got that mastery by being embedded in these tools for a decade.

I find a tremendous amount of satisfaction describing a system to a new hire, junior, or experienced dev new to our stack and seeing the lightbulb turn on in their head and *get it*.

But say your NW is ~$3M and you make 500k$; after taxes, a bay area mortgage, and living expenses, you are maybe left with 150k to save. That is +5% of your NW, and that 5% is getting smaller each year as your NW increases. So you ask yourself, is this endless cycle of OKRs and performance reviews worth your time? The two options are: retire somewhere cheaper, or look for something bigger (either internally in the company, externally at a different company, or start your own thing).\n\nI chose the third option, as a 6-8 month trial.  Climbing the ladder internally at a large company was never pallatable to me.",

We've rolled out the product to like 6 pipelines in that time because the server sits on a protected Production-domain machine that devs have no access to from their workstations so the analysis is currently useless.\n\nThese last 6 months we've been waiting for the access situation to be resolved and for a \"middle-man\" VM to be set up between Entra and SQ so we can make use of SCIM and actually start testing the permission management solution. \n\nMaybe with AI I would've got my part done quicker but I don't see a world where that would matter.\n\nP.S: I know AI is often more talked about in regards to writing actual application code and not Ops stuff, but I'm also experiencing some push for AI usage on the Cloud teams in general",

Intentional value adds that succeed are limited. They are designed, discussed, evaluated, proven. They are not thrown at a wall, and the more you throw at walls the harder it is to point at specifics to increase sales/adoption.\n\nNobody needs Netflix to add 50 new features, they need it to do what they came here for better. Disney streaming will not compete by having esoteric features no one knows about or cares about, they will compete by having what people want and at a price people find more valuable. It doesn't matter how high the Disney app team productivity is or how many stories they complete every day. \n\nWhat this means is exactly what you said about the CFO asking about extra costs. You are putting no value in, faster, for more cost, and calling it a win just because there's more of it. It's insane. \n\nFinally, what we're doing with 'no one writes code anymore' is we're making documentation the true source of what we make and do. You know, the thing we've all abandoned for the sake of moving faster. So now we're saying that we need waterfall level of contracted functional designs in order to have our coders do their work properly - because what we've shown we're really good at is building and maintaining documentation.

I don’t just want to grind tickets and hope it happens.\n\nWith AI tools getting better and better, it feels like just knowing syntax or cranking out code isn’t really what separates junior from senior anymore. I’m guessing the bigger differences are around system design, making good trade-offs, writing code that actually lasts, and understanding the bigger picture of what you’re building.\n\nI mainly work in Java, but I’m open to anything, be it language-agnostic books, architecture, distributed systems, mindset stuff, whatever made a difference for you.\n\nI’ve seen these recommended a lot:\n\n\\- Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n\n\\- The Pragmatic Programmer\n\n\\- Effective Java\n\nWhat books actually changed how you think as an engineer?\n\nThanks 🙏",

          "text": "I find the age old \"senior for your org? Or senior engineer by measure?\" is a great question to ask. The books only go so far - and you've got the general stack covered here already.\n\nIf it's the former - learn to organize things that take up your time, focus on being able to communicate in terms your stakeholders understand and start doing the senior engineer job at YOUR company. If nothing else, sit with your manager and talk about identifying your current gaps as well as taking things off their plate.\n\nIf you want to be senior engineer by \"measure\", I have a slightly different opinion : learn by changing jobs. I genuinely think it's a time-driven thing apart from there being a natural talent ceiling. What that means is, senior engineers own a different share of different problems depending on the org you're at.\n\nWhat stays consistent is being able to communicate outcomes, risks, and owning deliveries at THAT org. Quit fighting with the non tech stakeholders and start learning how to communicate with them, so there is great social and political capital being built. Understand what they mean when they expect something out of you, and slowly build the trust/ their learning to help them understand what you mean. Back your team's concerns in the way the stakeholders understand, and take the heat when they don't.\n\nSpend a couple years hopping between two or more orgs (where you consistently deliver over 2 years or so). Within the next three-five years you should get there. Good luck!",

Long story short, I did a lot \"fake it until you make it\" to work my way up because I sought more compensation for a more comfortable life, and better employability, staying ahead of the curve. Especially as remote positions became the norm.\n\nAnyway, I think I overextended by convincing myself (let alone others) that I wanted to be staff level. It's been a couple years now, so I've noticed what has and hasn't improved. I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but it's less about capability and more about enjoyment and consistency. When I first pursued the promotion I was aware of some of my shortcomings and thought I'd work through them. My social battery is small. If I'm real, my ability to act like the adult in the room is limited. I cannot pretend to care about my company anymore. Lots of these things feel like facets of my personality and not skills to develop (I know I can fake some of them, it just drains me).\n\nI can afford a cut. I just don't know what that does for my career prospects. I feel damned if I do, damned if I don't. Other companies have their own expectations of staff level, and I feel like my company's standards are lower, and my organization's specifically are lower still. So when I do apply to other positions, I'm often looking for senior positions since I can often find similar pay estimates and my qualifications line up better, but previous attempts fell through. Job searching is demoralizing so I'm back to trying to make it work better at my current employer.\n\nHow does it come off on a resume to go from staff to senior, especially at the same company? Or should I try to rewrite history and claim I was never staff in the first place? Do I own it and explain why I sought demotion? Or maybe do I just get over myself and press on? Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nedit: additional context\n\nedit: Thanks everyone for your responses! For posterity, this is what I compiled:\n\ntl;dr: Address burnout, then come back to the question of demotion. Chances are it'd be better to switch positions and not worry about the title.\n\nI wanted to keep my post reasonably concise so I left out a lot of context I didn't think was important. I probably could've clarified a few more things such as what exact responsibilities I have in my current role. Ah well, doesn't matter now.\n\nThe one extra bit I'll add which I'm sure people could pick up on is that I'm undiagnosed but very likely neurospicy. Even in SWE the level of masking I have to do is a constant drain. Interviews especially. When I say \"fake it\" I didn't just mean competency but, like, being human about some things and professional about others. Pretending to care about various things. Who knows, maybe that's all part of the imposter syndrome too. \n\nI found it curious how different everyone's experiences were and how that shaped their responses. e.g. It seemed like a death sentence to ask for demotions with their own employers.\n\nThe titles are indeed arbitrary. I probably don't need to overthink this as far as switching titles between employers. \n\nThe elephant in the room is this sounds a lot like burnout, which is fair. I seem to go in and out of it in my position. On the one hand, as far as workload and benefits go, I shouldn't really complain. I would fear spending so much effort switching jobs only to realize it's worse elsewhere. On the other, it's a death by a thousand cuts. But I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. I don't know what to tell my manager either since so much of it seems outside of our control and I don't want to merely complain. I'll think on it.\n\nI have searched for other jobs, but I just haven't had any luck. Most staff-level positions clearly have higher expectations and it's rare for me to make it past the screening or the first interview. And while I've gotten further for senior positions, still no dice. This becomes a bit of a feedback loop and at some point I give up for a while. \n\nSo my plan of action for now is to hold my position and work on my mental health first. Especially since I need employment to afford healthcare. 🤪 Regardless of whether I stay or not, that's kind of the bedrock of my ability to make sensible decisions. I'll also need to do some soul searching to nail down what it is exactly I enjoy and what would motivate me. From there I should hopefully be able to either have a productive conversation with my manager and/or keep applying for new jobs and not get demotivated by it.",

          "text": "You sound exactly like where I was in 2022 and 2023, and I've been looking for an opportunity to tell this story here, so someone might find it helpful or insightful, so here you go.\n\nIn mid-2022, I applied to a company as a senior and did so well on the interview they offered me staff, which was a 5 year goal for me at the time, so I took it. For the first year, I stressed myself out feeling for the walls and trying to figure out what it meant to be a staff, even with tremendous support from my peers and people above me. I ended up in the same boat as you, often looking for previous advice in this very subreddit for whether or not I should try and down level myself because I missed the work of a senior crushing tickets. At the 18 month mark at the company, I asked my manager to down level.\n\nIt was the single biggest awakening and biggest regret of my career that I didn't feel for 2 years.\n\nMy manager was very kind and heard me out on my reasons and took it up a level to the VP of Engineering where I was told, effectively, I could do the job, or I could quit. In the moment I was bitter about it, but I decided to do the job. Six months later I received my first \"below meets\" on an evaluation, because I asked to down level, and that wasn't staff engineer level behavior.  \n\n\nNever the less, I persisted, and took that moment as an opportunity to let go of all imposter syndrome and stress, and decide that \"I am a staff engineer, therefore everything I do is the behavior of a staff engineer\" and made the role my own. It was getting told no by that VP that made everything click, and made me realize that I am a very effective player-coach in up-skilling engineers, teams, code bases, and projects around me that I interacted with and I needed to act like it.\n\nUnfortunately, after this finally clicked fully, the company was bought out and in early 2025 underwent a 300 person RIF that I was hit by, and to this day I suspect the \"below meets\" was the thing that put me on the chopping block.\n\nHalf a year later I joined a company as a senior engineer and found myself extremely bored because the work was so easy I could do it with my arms behind my back, and I was surrounded by engineers who didn't care about the effort of work I was putting in. I then found out that I had minimal room to get promoted back to staff, for reasons that are unimportant, so I left and realized that I needed to keep setting my sights higher, not lower. If I could go back, I would thank that VP for putting me in that position, because it unlocked what I needed in my brain at the time, but I suspect we'll never actually interface again.\n\nObviously do what makes the most amount of sense to you. If you want to do it, you just need to sell the narrative that \"I am an engineer who is looking for the right fit, and the title is less important than the work.\" If I was in your shoes, and I could do it all over again, I would get over myself and press on. You ended up in the staff role for a reason, and because the type of work is very different from that of a senior, you just need to figure out how to make it your own where you can, and not just the expectation.",

If they know you as the guy who self-evaluated themselves as an L -1 then you'll likely get a below meets. Most of the promotions and perf reviews I've seen happen mainly come down to what perspective higher ups have about you/your biggest project. Even if you worked on 10 different projects, no one has time to go through all that so it's often way more vibes based once it gets to the senior director/VP level.",

I smudged the truth a bit, as I was desperate and the fear of homelessness was getting closer to reality, I applied to both dev and lead roles, for dev I listed Dev -> Lead -> Dev as the second dev was a different project. Most interviewers didn't ask, those who did I was honest and said I tried LEad, hated the 6=8 hours of meetings a day, and went back to what I enjoy, most smiled and said they understood.

He lacks people skills but he is the most senior in terms of technicals. He gets totally defeated as he is attending more meetings (meetings I use to attend). So he is experiencing all this corporate politics first hand now.\n\nIn out KT (knowledge transfer meetings), that is all that is talked about. How to deal with certain personalities versus asking me about how a service works or explaining parts of the code base. My only advice is not to be the nice guy, he only should answer to his direct change of command in leadership -- engineering.\n\nI have a lot of political capital and when push comes to shove, I can get things done. Either by building consensus or getting support from leadership. I can steer the direction of the product roadmap and prioritize in favor of the engineering team. We want things that are secure, scaleable, feature rich, reduce user churn, and make the product better. Other teams want to redesign the main dashboard again for the 10th time. We rather make life easier for customers to connect to their data and automate things versus changing one card from the left to the right expanding it by two columns with a new color palette.\n\nAny good books or resources for SWE.

In a professional and business setting, being a \"nice guy\" is one of the easiest ways to set a team or project up for failure.\n\nThis guy needs to learn to say \"no\" as their default response, or at least say \"it could be a possibility but I will need to look into it and follow-up afterwards\"... Basically respond with anything other than \"yes\". It is absolutely crucial to avoid making promises that have no realistic guarantee behind them.\n\nBeing a \"yes man\" only works for weak ass middle managers who can easily shift responsibility of delivery onto anyone else - and ultimately everyone ends up hating those kind of middle managers. (Meanwhile the projects and teams they delegate to will deteriorate in the messiest ways possible.)\n\nIf the individual is as spineless as you're describing and can't learn to say anything other than \"yes\", then they are certainly doomed to fail. The consequences will come fast and hard, hitting them directly along with everyone else on the team. Are you sure they're ready for this level of responsibility??\n\nOne final thought is a mantra I learned from one of my most successful mentors... \"Under-promise and over-deliver.\"",

Eg I would suggest something and say why, they would say “no, i disagree, that’s not what you promised me” (i didn’t promise either way before) and I’d feel suddenly so unsure of myself that I’d agree with their plan. Over the next months lots of problems, zero willingness to try anything other than “doing it 100% by myself so i can learn” (no willingness to let me or others help, or show me what exactly was done). Eventually I put my foot done and said I need to at least see the weekly process in detail to give feedback. Agreement was very reluctant and starts each week with “i did it because you forced me, it’s a waste of time” (i explained why and how this weekly report should help, and judging from the progress now, it is somewhat working; also asked for other things they could think of, no alternatives proposed). Can’t get rid of person for at least another 15 months (and also they have many talents, just not the thing they insist on doing- they want to learn new things, while i’d quite like them to do what they can or accept my help for learning £",

Just for the fact the he's newer to this context, he's going to be a worse replacement for at least a whole after your knowledge transfer window is open.\n\nAlso be aware thst the new guy has a completely different standing than you. The guy that omboarded me as his replacement kept telling me that I need to be more assertive in my new role. The thing he doesn't know is that I kept getting reprimanded for standing up for my team against managers in my old project. I generally have no problem being assertive.\n\nBut he's asking me to be assertive about things that I'm not sure about towards people I just met, who I sometimes don't even really know what their role exactly is, in a meeting I'm missing a ton of context about. I have literally zero social standing with these people and when the new guy speaks up, people react completely differently to when someone speaks up who's been part of the project for years.\n\nSo I largely ignored his well meant \"advise\", took a ton of notes, met a ton of new people and know that everyone knows my face, I can be more assertive and tell people off. But it takes time.\n\nAnd you know what the most important part is? That I needed my onboarder to validate my thoughts and feelings about what happened in a meeting because sometimes the new guy is off-base on something that was decided before he joined the project. It was also extremely important that I can escalate issues to him without much of a fuzz. Sometimes I asked him to join a meeting or call and him showing up and showing that he backed my decision was huge for building my social standing with my new coworkers.\n\nMaybe OP's replacement is just a timid guy, but consider that in a new role, you lack both social standing and context and neither of those build up over night.",

Nothing like seeing the natural consequence of your choices to force you to grow. You can advise, tell him to push back all you want, but at a certain point he needs to see the consequences of saying yes to be nice so he knows why he has to say no. He’s got to develop his own style in the role. I’d continue giving him the lay of the land, who he should watch out for, who is likely to just say shit to get their way, etc, but he’s gonna have to grow to take this role, and it’s up to him whether he’s going to do so. It might be worse for the company, but that’s just a natural consequence of the evolution of talent, and your upper management might need to help structure things differently so it’s less the case that a single person’s personality determines its resilience to stupid ideas.",

CSS/JavaScript\"_ , POs only check if the latest feature is working as expected and sales only knows the current state.\n\n\nI don't know your product more than that is has a dashboard, but if your concerned about Devs asking for these changes just because, I'd encourage you (and them) to have a look at \"Visualising Streaming Data\" by Anthony Aragues.\n\n\nI know the title says \"streaming data\" but it'll give you a solid grasp about understanding how to best present data regardless. Who knows, maybe the Devs just lack the language to justify their requests. \n\n\nYou might be able to connect all the data sources in the world, but is your product looks dated, you'll loose customers. If it loads slow, you'll loose customers. If the visual data hierarchy is difficult to process, you'll loose customers.

There are many books but if you can find a basic harvard business article like 'Who has the D?' paper about it that is enough.  It really helps you navigate power structures and identify problems when trying to get to a decision.  Good luck.\n\n",

Basically, if a ton of people default on student loans all at once because they can't repay them, it makes it harder for the younger generations to secure loans, which has been a primary way the young get higher education.\n\nFinal note: There's a lot of millenial and xennial devs that are at the latest 42 years old.  If the shift happens in the next 5-10 years, there is an entire generation of people stuck in that ugly bit of not being old enough to retire.\n\nSo yeah, people have a right to be worried about their future.",

          "text": "First of all, you need to understand that there's a lot of stuff you don't have control over. You could be in for the biggest depression in the world. Your future could be one of famine, war, poverty, and it could all happen easily with no chance you could prevent it. I see no reason why AI existing or not should really change that, and it's something you probably need to spend some time with and think about, rather than your focus on this specific issue. There's no guarantee that things get better, that things stay stable, that you as an individual of the billions of individuals on this planet have some type of right to life, liberty and happiness. If you have it today, use it, but don't try to control it.\n\nSecondly, perhaps your thought of \"This group seems to be shrinking after Opus 4.5 dropped\" is because we've all simply gotten tired of saying it. I've been using AI for three years now. I've been using it at work and personally. I've simply gotten tired of it. Every time I point an agent at a code base and ask for something to be done, I have to change the code. I end up spending so much time going back and forth or modifying sections of code that it's not any different than if I had written it myself, from scratch. I work on critical back end systems. I can imagine that if I was working on stuff that it didn't really matter whether it worked well or not, AI would be much more useful. If that's something you're working on, then the problem was more likely the work rather than the tooling. It was always going to go away.  \n  \nPeople in this forum talk as though we are all similar, but we are not. In this subreddit you could be talking to a junior web dev, a senior PLC programmer, an architect for big data, embedded systems. You could be talking to a person who works at a critical system for a bank or a person who makes a web application for generating selfies. Some people might have jobs that change, some people might not. You can't ever know.\n\nI will end with this. Jobs aren't really jobs. You aren't hired for your expertise, or your skillset, or your resume. You are always hired for two reasons, and two reasons only. You are useful, and you are likeable. If you are useful and likeable, you will always be in demand.",

He outlines **three “rip-cord” traps** that should make readers disengage:\n\n1. **Vibe Reporting**: articles imply a conclusion by *juxtaposing* loosely related facts and quotes while omitting key context—creating a “vibe” (e.g., pairing layoffs with generic AI-job-disruption quotes so readers assume “AI caused the layoffs,” even if it didn’t).\n2. **Mining Digital Ick**: stories cherry-pick weird edge-case demos from “AI wireheads,” focus on how unsettling it is, but skip technical specifics and concrete implications—so the piece mainly manufactures discomfort.\n3. **Faux Astonishment**: especially common in YouTube—everything is framed as insane/terrifying/seismic, producing a constant panic haze without precise claims you can check.",

What you’re feeling is real and valid and a lot of people are right there with you even if they won’t admit it.\n\nBut I want to be straight with you about something. You said when you got your first job you thought you were set for life. That was never true, even before AI. Industries change, companies fold, entire job markets disappear. The idea that any degree or any career is a guaranteed ticket for life is something we all got sold and it was never real. That’s not an AI problem, that’s just how it’s always been.\n\nHere’s what I’d actually suggest. You’re a dev with several years of experience. That means you know how to learn, how to problem solve, how to think logically. Those skills don’t become worthless because AI can write code. If anything they become more valuable because someone still needs to understand what the AI is doing, why it’s wrong, and how to use it properly. The devs who will struggle are the ones who refuse to engage with it. The ones who lean in and learn how to work with it are going to be fine.\n\nBut more importantly, and I mean this genuinely, you need to step back from the doom scrolling. Half the takes on here are from people who don’t know what they’re talking about and the other half are people who are just as scared as you projecting their anxiety as certainty. None of them know what’s going to happen. Nobody does. You’re losing sleep over a future that doesn’t exist yet and might never exist in the way you’re imagining.\n\nGo learn how to use the tools. Get familiar with them. Once you actually understand what AI can and can’t do the fear gets a lot smaller. It’s the uncertainty that’s killing you, not the technology.",

People that not only have to deal with the state of the world as you describe it, but who didn’t even get “the good times” you’re experiencing now, either.\n\nOnce I realized I was super-worried about something that most people already experience, it calmed me way down.\n\nI also don’t really think what you describe is going to happen, to be honest. Until these models are perfect-enough that you don’t need any technical knowledge to use them (ever), developers will still be needed. I don’t think we’re really close to that point yet.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, we’ve come a very long way over a short time, but we’re still not close to where we’d need to be. We just barely passed the “hey, this thing’s not terrible!” checkpoint, but that’s about it.\n\nThe day Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI fire all their software engineers, I’ll start worrying. They haven’t done that yet. In fact, Anthropic themselves has positions open right now for SWEs on their career page.\n\nThink about it like self-driving cars.

Difference is that I probably wrote 5-10% of our code last year, the rest being architecture and design decisions. The rest of the code was written by AI. I’m getting the same output as I would’ve gotten in a strong team of 2 or even 3 good developers. I have friends employed in META and Google and their internal tools are even better than what I can use myself (Claude code now). \n\nI also suffer from anxiety and I can relate with how you’re feeling. You REALLY need to go to a therapist.  You need to get your sleep in order, start exercising and eating healthy. I know you probably don’t feel like getting out of bed sometimes, but I PROMISE you it will get better. You just got to start working towards managing the anxiety. So therapy, exercise, sleep, human connection. And stop reading stuff that worries you. You already have all the information, whatever you read next won’t make you more prepared. Managing the anxiety will. \n\nYou really need to start taking control of your destiny and accept you can’t control what happens in the outside world. Whether AI replaces all the jobs in the world or not, it’s not within your control. Anxiety gets better once you try and begin to find solutions. A few ideas to take control of your own destiny:\n1. Try to find a job in more traditional businesses. I doubt banks are going to get their software maintained by AI anytime soon. Or military equipment companies. So try to find a job in a sector like this. This will maximize your runway IF what you’re worried about ends up affecting your job. \n2. Do you have an expensive lifestyle? Try to simplify it. Ideally get your monthly burn rate down to what can be covered through other jobs. \n3. Really spend the time changing the physiological things affecting anxiety. Sleep, food, exercise. \n4. Try to get some perspective about your own capabilities . Even if the worst thing happens, you’ll deal with it. You can do it. Becoming a software engineer isn’t easy, you’ve already achieved something that most people are probably not able to. \n\n\nDo you have any savings or investments?",

AI requires a focused context in order to do its very best work as anything broader invites assumptions and unexpected outcomes. I believe this is because AI doesn't actually have the ability to know what it does not know. Now imagine how that will work when people who have ZERO systems knowledge want the AI to be their chief translator of a world they can barely begin to understand. It would take nothing short of AGI.\n\nSecondly, if you fear that there will just be fewer engineers. Then my question is why that didn't happen with all the frameworks and tools we use today. We have optimized development extremely before the era of AI and yet it only led to more demand for software. Software in your TV, software in your car, software on your toaster, and in your wearables.\n\nSoon AI will enable the rapid building of software for your shoes, your gym locker, your dental implants and your dog.\n\nAnd if the barrier to software development were to fall severely, then companies would no longer stay in their lane when it comes to what they build. So every SAAS can become more like Google, with software solutions for broader market demands.\n\nAnd if you think all that is wrong, then consider what a disadvantage it is for companies to shed all these employees who just replaced themselves with AI, as those engineers are now all 1-person companies ready to compete with their former employers if they just license once of these models. The concept of anyone making a huge profit by running away with the bulk of the market share suddenly dwindles in such a world.\n\nAll of this rapid change does not spell the end of our profession, it spells another step up in abstraction for building an even more deeply software integrated world and you are there at the birthplace of this moment.

The story of pretty much all technological innovations is that they improve rapidly at the start, but with enough time, the improvements start to become more diminishing. In other words: every exponential is a sigmoid in disguise. Think about when the first iPhone was released; it was pretty radical in terms of new tech. But how about the 7th iPhone or the 12th iPhone? Not too different from the ones before. The same is going to be the case with AI and LLMs. In fact, I think it's pretty much the case that we're at the beginning of the plateau phase. Training and inferencing LLMs is running into energy limits, data limits, architectural limits and computational limits; on top of all that, any increases in data, compute, etc. are tempered by the fact that neural scaling laws follow an inverse power law which is increasing but concave down. So in due time, we will reach a point where LLMs more or less \"peak\" and by then they will become more normal and less disruptive; and I think we are not too far away from that point. Hope this helps, dude. :)",

A human being has a context window of 24 hours. We need to sleep and process information. We distill past events such that we’re not recalling every conversation about a certain topic. An LLM’s context window is only a couple of million tokens. Essentially as the conversation grows the less precise LLM’s become. The bigger issue is that in order to process that kind of information you’ll need to scale data centers more and more. And that means bigger data centers which means costs start to increase.",

I'm just gonna give you a shorter version: literally no one here is going to have an answer to this. As you go through more life experiences you will realize 2 things, life isn't fair and will never operate how you think it operates, and no one knows wtf they are actually talking about. You will get an split on people's opinions on AI depending on where you ask, I think you made up your mind on the topic so i'm not going to agree or disagree with you. If you want my annecdote then I am a software engineer at a FAANG and my team of pretty much all seniors at this point has hired almost no one the past year or so and all of us use AI in our workflow. Will we be replaced? Find out on the next episode. I can give you an entire essay on why or why not AI can or cannot do my job and all of it can be rendered useless with another research breakthrough or update. And honestly this doesn't really tackle your root issues and insecurities. Even if everyone here tells you opus isn't good and you read all this feels good circle jerk hope slop about how \"AI is actually going away soon and was useless this entire time you guys, we are all about to get 300K TC jobs baby\" you will just have this cycle again the next update, then the next unless you genuinely believe 2026 is the year that technological progress halts for the rest of time compared to every other year in human history. GPT-3 barely came out 3 years ago and the world's perception of what was possible changed. Just a year ago no one was seriously using it for even 30% of the tasks and now it's usage is pretty darn high. None of us control if opus 5.0 or 10.0 is better.\n\nYou either go on with life or keep worrying about it and let it consume you. You are sold a lie that life works a certain way if you do x,y and z and you are \"set\" but no one knows what they are doing or what they are talking about. Not your parents, not your professors, not most people you looked up to. Not me, not the top 5 reddit comments that have the most upvotes. It's all survivorship bias, annecdotes and being at a certain place at a certain time. In this point of time in space you are complaining about AI, you could have easily been complaining about another economic great depression which would have wiped out the remaining jobs anyway and have you fighting for mcdonalds job applications. You have no real control over what happens and you can only control how you react to this. Either make a back up plan to pivot out of the career or ride it out really, everyone is going to be in the same boat if AI does get as good as you say it will. Seek therapy, get medication if you need for sleep and anxiety. Maybe go down the line of becoming less terminally online, doomscrolling less and maybe read a book or two on embracing life uncertainties. Things will happen that you will not like or know the answer to, reading every other idiot's opinion on it such as myself doesn't do any good and won't make whatever has you feeling uneasy disappear from reality.",

This study looked many fields of studies, not only programming. Multiple well-known current AI's were used (GPT5.2 scoring 2nd place with 2.5% of success rate if memory serves me right). This means that both AI and humans were given the same task to complete with the same input information. A failure for AI was considered every time it failed to complete the task; or did not complete the task at least as well as human participants did. Amongst most dominant problems were that AI left part of the tasks incomplete resulting in automatically scoring as a failure. This aligns with what I have also observed.\n\nThe current state of AI seems to be that human produces high quality work products. AI is significantly faster but the output is most of the times low-quality. I see them being used in tandem for a long time. I view AI mostly as search engine on steroids — nothing more.",

I'm translating client requirements into instructions... but those instructions aren't going into a Jira ticket like the days of yore. Instead, they go straight to Claude where it implements the requirements far more quickly and far more thoroughly than I typically would. Not sure how much longer it's going to make sense to have someone on a developer's salary spend her days doing that.\n\nStart looking into backup plans. Calculate how much runway you have in case you were to lose your job (and be sure to factor unemployment insurance and other benefits into that). Develop an set of heuristics for use in determining which warning signs to look out for and how to respond to them (e.g., a list of if-then clauses for yourself).\n\nBut ultimately, this train has left the station and there isn't anything we can do to stop it.

I think juniors are gonna get squeezed, but all signs point to things being probably more nuanced. \n\nIBM and Salesforce have already done major personnel reductions and regretted it. It seems many orgs just aren’t hiring as many devs. So in the short term the market is going to suck, for sure. \n\nBut I have opinions on why “something big” is probably bullshit. \n\nMajor enterprise orgs are slow, and AI so far at the enterprise level has had mixed results\n\nWhen you read a job description, does it usually say “tasks”? Nah, it says responsibilities. But this makes sense, do you think many companies are comfortable saying “we are ok with a non-deterministic computer program being responsible for our orgs functionality, product, finances, legal”?\n\nAlso competitive advantage, replacing workers with AI (and replacing is big here, cause giving people AI tools can really improve efficiency and the job itself for the employee) drains a company of its unique (maybe not always great) talent and replace them with basically AI contractors. \n\nNot to mention the comfort level of orgs to basically rent their entire workforce from a saas company. Companies can decide how much they pay for labor, and at a very granular level, AI is tokens baby, whether you ask for the cure to cancer or furry porn, it’s all just tokens. Companies are reliant on the relationship with their vendor. People freak out about vendor lock in with security tools, imagine your whole company. \n\nAlso the data centers, you’re dependent on their uptime and security, I’d imagine in a future with 20% unemployment those buildings would become incredibly flammable. \n\nOr incredibly soft targets for foreign actors. Imagine a hack that takes those data centers down in one region for maybe two days? Failover of course but man the ability to have massive disruption is technoeconomic terrorism (trademark) \n\nLook, things are changing, if your only responsibility is “write code” you’re boned. If your responsibility is “identify problems, customer pain points, cost savings, potential risks…” then lean into that. \n\nOh and I try and say nice things to the toaster JIC.",

I am a very seasoned engineering leading on some incredibly complex problems in non trivial areas with projects that span the entire gambit between frontend and backend systems.\n\nBefore AI - a good day for me would be 3-4 shipped prs.  Most days were 2 and i shot for 1 at a minimum.  \n\nAfter Opus 4.6 - The speed at which i can ship with a couple AI bots is staggering.  I still have to train them and correct them but i'm shipping dozens of things per day - and that is only because my capacity to review the changes is limited by me AND the number of things product needs me to do is limited by their brains.\n\nIf the rate of change from 4.5 to 4.6 continues where the next model ever 2-3 months is an order of magnitude better, i won't need to be in the loop directly in 9-12 months and i will be exclusively on the business and product side, which is ok because i have been leading multiple teams of humans like this for a long time. \n\nI definitely wouldn't want to be a regular engineer right now.  Senior engineers will arguably not be needed and i think the only people that will be left are the folks that have the unique mix of business, leadership and technical prowess to be able to target the bots in the right way.\n\nTime will tell.",

Getting started always feels chunky because you don't do it often, and the circumstances tend to change enough over context or time that it isn't quite the same each time.  Reducing the \"just work\" costs is a good thing!  They are inevitably steps that should be well-understood but not cost any more cognitive load than is useful for the initiative.\n\nThey become an anchor on productivity when they aren't understood or skipped \"for this one hot initiative\", which over time in a long-lived codebase becomes mixed zones of different standards.  The boring tasks become a productivity anchor because the last person who skipped them more-than-doubled the work of the next person impacted by their tech debt -- the interest payments always come calling.\n\nTo setup an analogy: when you're optimizing for performance a classic mis-optimization is to not take measurements to diagnose the performance issues before you start making changes. You might make some code run faster, but if the actual issue is lock contention -- your objectively better code on paper could make the real issue worse!\n\nThe boring work in my experience often isn't the productivity killer, even though it's a convenient punching bag for time not spent well and observable tech debt accretion.  The real productivity killers in my experience have always been higher level issues: ill-defined or understood contracts and expectations across separation of responsibilities, shifting and/or poorly-defined requirements, unnecessary context switching from a chaotic lack of planning, in-fighting over continuously punting the opportunity to disagree-and-commit over strategic decisions to avoid conflict.\n\nThe pet phrases I use to anthropomorphize these issues are:\n- rowing separate boats in the same direction\n- tactical solutions in a strategic direction\n\nBoth of which require sufficient product _and technical_ vision for separate groups to be properly incentivized to work together in a commonly understood direction.  If your boat is frantically zig-zagging for fear of heading in the wrong direction, the ride is going to feel worse than taking fewer and smaller course corrections because you can't generate productive momentum.  If your boat is tied to a dozen others all doing the same thing? It doesn't matter if the cost of checking the wind in a new direction or identifying your current position got cheaper -- you won't be going anywhere anyway, you're just making the boring work to change direction feel nicer.",

AI only helps with the 20%.\n\n  \nthe metric nobody's measuring but should: how much time does your team spend reviewing, debugging, and fixing AI-generated code vs. the time it saved writing it? on my team that ratio is close to 1:1 on complex features. the net gain is real but modest, and it's concentrated in the boring parts of the job.",

Not only is it time consuming to review AI-generated code, but you can also waste time _arguing_ with the AI during review.\n\n\nClaude Opus also has this annoying habbit of changing its thinking process mid way through a response when you ask it for help reviewing code, e.g. it can say _\"there's a bug in function Foo()\"_ and you go read function Foo() to see what's going on, you find nothing there, come back to finish reading its response only to find it saying _\"actually, this is correct\"_. After a few episodes of this game you start wondering: why am I using AI at all here?\n\n\nI think things will get better over time but as things stand AI is a _net unknown_ (i.e. you can't tell whether it's helping or hurting).",

Not the most complicated, but it involved construction of an internal state machine, properly implementing asynchronous callbacks on state transitions, and supporting multiple control channels...so not trivial. It required some back and forth, but it worked. It also wrote pretty good unit tests that gave 80+% coverage up front, and the code quality was higher than what most human developers could produce, including me (much more consistent style and organizational choices that were largely good ones).\n\nI don't have exact metrics, but clearly there is value in a tool than condenses coding work by an order of magnitude with some up front effort and produces results on par with or exceeding those of a human developer. It's not infallible and you need to review its output, but I will take some back-and-forth with Claude over trying to untangle human spaghetti code any day. If you're not getting good results like this, I think you should really look at how you're prompting it and managing context. If you just give it ambiguous prompts and throw your whole repo at it it's kind of a 'crap in, crap out' situation. If you give it a framework and requirements up front and let it break work into reasonable chunks (you know, what a human developer would also want), it can do small miracles.\n\nHonestly I don't know what universe the people saying AI is useless are living in.

I'll take that \"upgrade agent\" service I built with Claude as an illustrative example again.\n\nI had a pretty good idea of how I wanted the app to work before I wrote any code. I knew I wanted it to be driven by a state machine, and I already had a simple state machine class for it to use as a basis. It would have a CLI interface for monitoring/manually controlling the state machine, and an event-driven interface (basically it's a subscriber to some messages from other services). I knew exactly what state transitions I wanted to support and what behavior I wanted on edge transitions. I documented all of this in one big 'requirements doc', but didn't actually break the work up into sub-tasks or anything. I asked it to write documentation of the code it was producing.\n\nI gave it the document and asked it to implement the application and write unit tests to verify. At first, the code it produced didn't compile. I had to go through a few iterations of feeding back the compiler errors and asking it to fix the code. Then tests wouldn't pass. A few more iterations. After not too long, it got there.\n\nThen I reviewed its code. It took some weird architectural liberties. Partially I think this was my fault; I gave it a big blob of requirements and said \"build this thing\". Even though my document was pretty good, it left some wiggle room, and Claude went way too hard trying to cover edge cases that don't exist or adding functionality that was extraneous or redundant. I prompted it to remove things I thought were unnecessary, and it did a pretty good job cleaning up after itself when prompted. Sometimes it would break its own unit tests while cleaning up and it would need to go through some more debugging iterations to get them working again. Overall, its style was very consistent; good function and variable names, generally following SOLID principles. In some places I could see it was making the unit tests harder by not following principles like dependency injection and I asked it to refactor/use mocks in the tests.\n\nAfter that I asked it to implement the CLI tool. Similar kind of debugging cycle and hiccups. All told, I probably spent \\~2 hours on that initial chat session. Then, I had to take what it produced and load it in my staging environment and see how it worked. It had like 3-4 critical issues that prevented it from working properly, which I debugged myself but weren't very hard to figure out. I gave it feedback about what was wrong and it did a good job making appropriate changes. Overall, that was like another \\~3-4 hours I guess? After that my stuff was in pretty good shape, I think there were other minor fixes and refactors after that, but 6 hours or so of hanging out with Claude gave me a working service, CLI tool, and pretty solid unit tests.\n\nIts coding style was good, and maybe most importantly, consistent in a way that humans often struggle with. I find that humans often make typos, use inconsistent formatting, put logic in places it doesn't belong, create \"mega methods\" that are a tangled mess of if-else logic, tightly couple things that don't need to be tightly coupled, mess up shared state in multi-threaded applications...other cardinal sins. You can say \"well, the people who do that are bad programmers\". Maybe...but there's a lot of people out there making these mistakes and littering code bases with little idiosyncrasies! Claude writes in a way that feels like an amalgamation of generalized best practices, even if it doesn't have much creativity and needs some hand holding.\n\n\\--\n\nMy takeaways from this were that it is a bit of a Monkey's Paw; Claude will fill in the gaps in your prompts with its own interpretations that are only occasionally correct. It often over-complicates things and needs to be reigned in. It works best when given very clear instructions to do something cut-and-dry. But this is all true of human developers too...again, the up-front work of specifying what you want and breaking it into sub-tasks seems like a huge determinant of the outcome.",

How would I show you evidence of me working faster lmao.\n\nI can give you a recent example from my work, I opened an archaic-ass JSF project and had to add a new page to it for a client who refuses to migrate to our new Angular based UI (JSF one is handled by backend teams, unfortunately) and spent 10 minutes explaining how I want the UI to work, prepared a bean with mock methods for it to wire up and had it generate the entire UI in a couple of prompts. I think the entire process took less than an hour and then I just finished up the backend part myself.\n\nNot only did I not have to look through the *rather old* JSF documentation but also skipped, what is for me, the most unpleasant part of working on that system, which honestly does slow me down out of just really not wanting to interact with it. \n\nAnother recent-ish example I can give I was pretty stumped on some java agents not injecting/connecting to a service, seemingly out of the blue, and after asking Gippity it threw out a \"By the way, the parameter format for this changes from :\\*: to \\*:\\* in this version\" and lo and behold that was a few hours of digging through commits to find out that indeed someone had upgraded it recently.\n\nI'm not some AI apologist that believes it's the cure-all for software engineering, but if you can't speed any part of your work up with them then that's either a you-issue or you're working on something incredibly bespoke/have such perfect knowledge of your stack that you rarely look anything up.\n\nI already said this but I will reiterate that I have a set amount of mental energy for the day, having to deal with something which is simple but tedious (any kind of UI, for one) depletes it faster, because it's finnicky and boring to me - this is a \"soft\" speed increase in that I don't feel done for the day as soon when I have to deal with less things I dislike.",

          "text": "I think I'm going to repeat something from reddits that discuss research in important fields.  The problem is that AI lacks the human perspective and while it can \"help\" in tasks like organizing information and writing reports, it can also confidently present incorrect information which can completely throw off research efforts, simply because it was trained that way.\n\nIt has no true grasp of human intuition, the human experience, or empathy, which are often essential to forming research questions and interpreting findings in fields like psychology.  And ironically, psychology plays a significant role in software design since we build processes and often organize them in ways that make sense to us.  Object oriented programming is about mapping real world entities such as people, concepts, or things, into objects with specific behaviors in a system.  Our view points and feelings do impact how we implement those objects and while some parts are going to be identical, I've yet to see identical code between two people writing from scratch.\n\nAI does not improve readability, the user experience, or resource efficiency.  It forces compliance and rigid doctrine to code that is written to function rather than to be understood, built without any linkage to a living person, and maybe if we're lucky it will have some AI generated XML summary that states a generic message that will be created in a dozen or so unique iterations depending on how the dice roll.\n\nOh, I'm sorry!  AI DOES write code that is linked to living people because that is what it is trained off of!  It's trained off the hard work of other people who wrote books, code examples, etc.  It's great for replacing people and jobs so companies can spend less on \"human resources\".  \n\nBusinesses don't care if code is readable, simplified, SOLID, or anything like that. They want stuff predictably released without going back and forth with a human trying to answer the golden question of \"how long will this take?\"\n\nSorry I'm just a bitter person when it comes to this subject.",

          "text": "Well when I started at this startup (SaaS app) about a year ago — I’m 20 years in tech, senior tech lead, full stack, previous CTO in dev shops — our initial technical stack was:\n\nPostgres  \nGraphQL  \nNode.js  \nReact Router / TypeScript / Vite\n\nWe had expected to spend on a 4-person tech team.\n\nOver the past year that changed. It’s been one: me as the developer. Our PM even spun up a Playwright UX testing suite to run app tests. A year later I’ve delivered a first-gen product that’s performant and tested.\n\nImportant caveat upfront: at every stage I still needed to review AI output and check code. So it’s not necessarily faster.\n\nBut it absolutely requires fewer human resources. That’s the real lesson for me.\n\nHere’s where AI has made the biggest impact in my work:\n\n1. SQL and GraphQL — just easy to generate with modern coding models.\n2. Documentation — I’ve never had this much documentation (valid and updated) on a project in my past 20 years, including when I worked at NASA. These days (last couple weeks) I use Claude to auto-update docs and its Notion connector to publish our wiki from them.\n3. TypeScript — not only initial prototyping but ongoing backend and frontend development.\n4. Mobile — I added a full React Native frontend for native mobile since I had the time. Normally a 3–6 month effort.\n5. Unit testing — it’s very good. With the caveat that I validate each test to prevent performative “test theater” AI slop.\n6. Code review and GitHub management — added two levels of code review via LLM using GitHub’s MCP and code review models. For most of the year I had to be really careful because AI drifts on every run and makes stupid assumptions, but lately with newer models it’s gotten significantly better.\n7. Frontend — Opus is strong. Not as good as having a senior frontend dev with years of experience, but I have enough experience to manage things like useEffect overuse, bad UX decisions, and when the LLM doesn’t modularize properly on first pass.\n8. UX design — we had a designer on contract in the first pass a year ago, but now we iterate between CEO/COO, PM, and myself using [v0.dev](http://v0.dev), mock tools, and AI graphic tools like Ideogram for icons and SVGs.\n9. Cloud deployment and CI/CD — Docker, infra, all of it is much easier with LLMs handling syntax and boilerplate. I review everything before implementing. In the past I might have contracted a DevOps person. That’s no longer needed.\n\nAnyway, I could go on. Basically every aspect of design, development, and engineering work has shifted.\n\nAI needs a lot of review and overhead and makes a lot of bad assumptions and mistakes, especially not the overarching technical direction. You’re still the engineer. You’re still reviewing. You’re still catching the dumb stuff and reviewing at the code level if you want to keep your sanity.\n\nBut one or two experienced persons can now cover most of the surface area that used to take a team.\n\nIs it less stressful? No. It increases responsibility and cognitive load.\n\nIs it more fun? Yes and no. It’s fun to prototype and validate assumptions quickly. But the mental overhead is real.\n\nThis article feels accurate right now:  \n[https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it)\n\nWhat this looks like five years from now, I have no idea. Every layer of engineering is under intense experimentation as startups try to automate engineers out of existence. I don’t think full replacement is feasible.\n\nBut in my own experience over the last two years, it’s a real structural shift.",

Yet it's very difficult to. So difficult that even now, we don't really have a set of accepted metrics that we can judge our performance on. Obviously there are a few metrics that exist that absolutely should be looked at like service uptime/reliability and resource usage (that's why observability exists for these) but it's not really holistic enough to judge the software as a whole. Every other metric is either subjective (UX quality) or is going to be gamed\n\nSo your question would imply that there is a set of metrics that we can judge software on, when we've been unable to do so since the beginning of the profession. Thus the question feels somewhat flawed/contradictory.\n\nNow to management, the only metric that they care about is capex and revenue/profit. If they can get away with cutting wage capex without seeing huge plummets in revenue due to downtime and such, they will absolutely slash the fuck out of that spend. Even traditional software companies aren't free from this thought process, ex. Zuck's \"year of efficiency\"",

What it’s currently doing: just increasing code volume, which means more reviews, more integration work, and more maintenance, and it’s even used as a justification to squeeze productivity without hiring.\n\nWe need to organise and form unions. The current wave of AI output wouldn’t even exist without all of the illegally scraped open-source projects, Stack Overflow posts, blogs, and documentation written by actual developers.\n\nAnd honestly, this situation also reflects a culture in tech that too often pushes people to compete ruthlessly instead of collaborating and standing up for better conditions together.

Oh, and they're done in languages that aren't my primary language. \n\nAt work, we have significantly higher velocity with fewer devs. Quality overall one first pass is also much higher because we don't have to skip/compromise for happy path (e.g., we handle edge cases out of the gate) because it's trivial to write massive numbers of tests. The trend seems to be that a single developer can take on more scope in the same amount of time. So the the MVP we had planned is now effectively what we planned on the 3 year roadmap. This in about 6 months with a small team. Originally we had planed 3 or 4 teams after MVP.\n\nThs biggest challenge is that gaps in layers are highlighted. For instance, backend work with AI is much, much easier. The front-end is lagging but that's partly because of design and because actually *using* the software by users takes time.\n\nThere is also the risk of burnout and cognitive load catching up to everyone. For instance, doing all the security and compliance on top of all the code we've built is going to come to a head. Operationally we may also pay the piper but we're trying to adjust now before release. Our biggest challenge is hiring.",

The architecture, the reliability, the number of bugs in prod? No. If anything the bugs are more subtle now because AI-generated code passes the eye test but has these tiny logic issues that you miss on review because it looks so clean. Almost-right code is harder to catch than obviously-wrong code.\n\nThe bottleneck was never typing speed. It was thinking clearly about what to build and why. That part hasn't gotten faster. Might've gotten slower honestly, because now I'm also reviewing AI suggestions on top of my own decisions. More options, harder choices.\n\nMy honest metric: I ship prototypes faster.

I was able to manage it by accepting that's how politics works and keeping some social media out of my life.\n\nBut now it's coming from the inside, for my job. \"Your work will eventually be automated away. You must adapt or be obsoleted. You must increase your productivity. We're freezing hiring/laying off. SaaS is over.\"\n\nC suites panicking in full FOMO mode and expecting us to get in to this race to the bottom. Just open Reddit and it becomes instant doomscrolling.

This can't be solved by chatting with LLMs.\n\nMy point is that we *don't have to* buy into narratives. *We* shape the world, as part of society by forming, spreading and accepting these narratives, which partially become self-fulfilling by that.

But it's always the same with software - garbage in = garbage out.\n\nThe key is to actually understand the problems you are solving, collaboratively solving the problems with a set of friends/colleagues, then figuring out how to get that context into an AI agent and guide it through the implemention. Your value add is the experience you have developed over years of study, trial, and error.\n\nThe hardest part now is getting the business problems properly defined. This is hard as it's both a social and information compression problem. Specializing in typing syntax is basically worthless now.

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nAbout 17 years total experience, started off as a self-taught goofball writing scripts to make my job easier to working at big tech and startups, picking up my masters along the way.\n\nWhat really got me into tech/software was that I could solve a lot of business problems writing code and gain efficiencies. My love for it increased as I went back to school and worked with C and all its thorniness. I remember writing my own (shitty) web server for a class and load tested it on a potato computer, watching it serve tens of thousands of requests per second without fail. Or writing and managing my own (shitty) message broker.\n\nThen over time, a lot of things changed. You no longer write and host your own web servers; you have AWS for that. Okay, fine, I thought. There's still a lot of value in managing your provisioned resources, trying to figure out what your tech stack looks like, etc.\n\nA few years later, everything now is either server-less or otherwise managed. Why spin up your own Kafka running on ECS when you can just use MSK? Do you really want to manage your own message broker while AWS offers ManagedMQ now? Any time I need some sort of service to set up, my infrastructure guys would just be like, \"Yeah, let's just use this managed service instead.\"\n\n(On one hand, I get it. If managing a service ourselves takes up 10% of an engineer's time, then it might make sense to go with a managed service as your startup scales. On the other, it's a lot less fun and I have fewer opportunities to bolster my CV.)\n\nAt that point, my life was basically coming up with the architecture to manage distributed systems, but a lot of my day-to-day was relegated to writing CRUD APIs. And that was fine, too. You want me to pay me how much money to just write code that essentially delivers your request to a database and returns you some data? Sure!\n\nBut now with AI around, even writing CRUD is being supplanted (as much as people on this sub think otherwise, I've personally used it and it gets 80% there most of the time). And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that this has increased my anxiety and existential crisis. So my question to you all is, what now?\n\nI was thinking maybe moving into technical product management or maybe looking into the various \"forward deployed engineer\" roles where I can leverage my technical skills while doing work that is unlikely to be replaced by AI. But I think back to what made me so interested in software engineering in the first place and I want to see what else is out there. So far, I've played around with running my own LLMs, writing my own agents, etc. But even that essentially is CRUD with a wrapper around it. Not to mention that space moves so quickly that with a job and a child, it's very difficult to keep up.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts and ideas. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the thoughtful responses. I did read through all of them, but didn't reply to most. I appreciate the insights and thoughts here. Been a member for a bit of time and there's always something interesting going on.",

There are other kinds of software that aren't just a fancy spreadsheet that talks to a database, which do things like control robots, drive video cards, edit movies, or play games. These still have a lot of CRUD, but their non-business focus allows for more variety. \n\nAbout the fanciest coding I've found in a business application is the algorithm to convert a pair of latitude/longitude points into a distance (by approximating Earth as a sphere). The fanciest I've ever had to create from scratch was a means to calculate \"overtime\" *before* the time is worked. So it isn't good enough to check whether there *is* overtime, but to check whether *this next shift* would go into overtime. Maybe that sounds simple to you, but overtime rules differ by business and by state. California goes into overtime after 8 hours in a day, and double time after 12, while most states just go into overtime after 40 hours in a week. And this particular application allowed for customized overtime rules. AND this check had to happen on the database side in a query, because reasons, so the algorithm had to go into SQLCLR (C#/SqlServer architecture). ",

Alerting is supposed to be actionable, and customer oriented. The story you tell is not that. And if the Product Owner wants this, there are other, better ways to achieve it than sleep deprivation.\n\n> 99% of which are false alarms for a p90 latency spike for an http endpoint\n\nFundamentally, alerting is a statistical exercise. Your quote there has like three statistical concepts already! Yet pretty much every SWE and SRE I've ever met are statistically undereducated. Myself included! It wasn't until pandemic lockdown that I corrected this and worked through a stats 101 textbook.\n\nThe way I see it, we can't do anything about slow queries that already happened, all we can do is adjust the system to handle future queries better. So any alert fired should represent a high confidence need for human intervention into the system. Statistically, confidence is built up through piles of data -- evidence! An endpoint with ten queries per scrape interval has less evidence than one with a thousand, and alerting needs to account for that somehow. \n\nSadly, Prometheus et al don't have great confidence interval functions we could use to natively calculate these. Instead **we typically use durations.** The idea here is simple: every scrape the failure signal persists is more evidence that it won't fix itself. This is especially important in the era of Kubernetes, where self-healing systems abound. Health checks automatically restart failed pods, and hpa scales up busy deploys, but these take time to action and we should give them a chance. If you're constantly waking up to pages for outages that are already over, that's an immediate argument for increasing the duration required before paging.\n\nIf SRE can't or won't accommodate you by increasing short (or absent!) durations, I recommend putting an override in to put them on call first until it's addressed.",

The fix is making the cost visible to the people who made the decision:\n\n  \n\"We're spending approximately X hours of engineering time per week responding to alerts. 99% of these are false alarms that require no action. The response time requirement means at least Y interrupted sleep cycles per on-call rotation. Here's what we could be building with that time instead.\"\n\n  \nPut that in a doc.

Frame it as a trade-off, not a complaint: \"We can keep the current alerting posture and accept this cost, or we can adjust thresholds to alert only on actionable conditions.

      "text": "I'm an engineer with 5+ years of experience and I'm joining a new (small) company next week as a mid level engineer. From my friends that have worked or currently work at the company I understand that the culture is supposed to be very chill with a strong engineering leadership. To boot they are also completely WFH. It's a pay cut but on paper I feel like it's the right move for my mental health. However I feel like I can't stop looking at the news and my experienc from my last company is making me fearful of the future.\n\nI'm coming out of FAANG (the worst one, you know which one) and in just the last year I've experienced:\n\n1. My entire team (and manager) being forced out, fired, or quit due to toxic upper management. \n\n2.I was LITERALLY THE ONLY FUCKING PERSON LEFT THAT UNDERSTOOD OUR SERVICE. One of my previous managers was given the domain and I was responsible for onboarding them and the rest of the team. Oh and I had only started working on this service at the START OF THE FUCKING YEAR.\n\n3. I was basically on-call constantly for 6 months because no one else knew anything about the service. I was still responsible for delivering my normal workload in my sprints though.\n\n4. A round of layoffs. I survived but still I think the whole experience fucking shook me to my core.\n\n5. Last but not least, and y'all could have predicted this, they relentlessly shoved AI down our throats and monitored our usage to make sure we were using it every day. To be honest I like using AI for research and brain dead repetitive tasks and some debugging, but I really don't use it to write my code. However everyone else on my team was basically pressured into only using Claude to code. I think the only reason I got away with it was because I was one of the top engineers and I was so critical to the service we owned.\n\nDuring my interview my recruiter and the interviewers basically sounded like they all used AI in the same way I did, but now I've heard they all got CursorCode subscriptions this year. I think CC can be a great tool and I've used some agents to parallelize some of my work like running tests or debugging but I just don't want it to write my code. It feels like I'm one of the few people that got into this job because I actually liked the craft and honing it?\n\nI'm just (maybe irrationally) worried that I'm just moving from one bad situation to another, and it's because no matter the company or culture AI has now turned our work into a sweatshop with no ingenuity.\n\nI think I really just need to know if there are other engineers out there who work in a company that is sensible about their engineering and they aren't pressured like I see all over Reddit and YouTube and at my last company? That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?",

It also started happening to us.\n\nUntil few months ago using copilot and claude was optional if needed and I was using them whenever it was making sense. Recently, there are a lot of pressure on us to do any thing as much as possible with claude. Our managers are convinced it boosts productivity 5x to 10x and no one wants to be that person to tell them otherwise.\n\nI also has a deep understanding in our teams domain. I usually break a task into smaller parts, then write and verify each part very carefully. But the way they pressure us to use claude, I'm not sure if I can do engineering like before. Apparently I have no choice but give it a try.",

Most people don't dive right into learning how to use it effectively, they start by dabbling here and there. Using it for one situation or another.\n\nI am the anecdotal case where I tell you that for me personally it is into the 5-10x more productive. I have created one webpage and two complete applications, in the span of about 4-5 days. Work that would have taken me at least 1-2 weeks for each of those situations. \n\nMy friend, who has completely adopted it, created a course to learn the advanced uses and I went through that course and picked up many more useful practices that didn't immediately jump out at me while I was in dabbling mode. Now I have defined /agents, a code-reviewer, a test-writer. I have hooks to prevent initializing tools I don't want it to use (or that don't work in windows). I am working on building some /skills for repetitive tasks that come up each day.\n\nI have been a software engineer for the last 30 years and I don't want to type much anymore. I have become skilled at recognizing what is a useful unit of work to take on at one time. How to provide enough guidance per task.\n\nI don't open Claude and say build me and application that does X. I create a set of folders, place some empty interfaces and classes (the core), create the domain entities. Then I explain one unit of work using those classes and files, like build a crud service with tests. Review the work, commit it. Rinse repeat until you have the whole application.\n\nIt feels good seeing your idea materialize into a working application in one morning, while sipping some coffee and skimming reddit.\n\nThe result is not AI slop, it is a carefully crafted useful tool built by an expert programmer and his assistant. With code reviews, planning sessions, requirements. All the things I would have done by hand but instead guided by my hand.",

Centralizing power and control, creating dependence, for the sake of further centralization of power and control.  \n\nNothing to do with software development, per se, I just think this bears calling out.  The solution, I feel, is not to quash such progress, but to compensate for its negative externalities (polluting our world is another way in which industrial civilization steals and fails to compensate), and prevent the worst abuses.  And the main insight is to recognize that the instances of harm are continual, and therefore the redress of it all must likewise be continual.  A one-time payment to the descendants of slaves and natives does not fix the inherent problems of our society (though it would be a good thing).  What we really need is to recognize the permanence of the abuse, and put into place permanent and growing redress.  A UBI is an example of this, as would be things like carbon taxes, extraction taxes, land value taxes.  \n\nI'm off my soap box now.",

I'm one of two engineers for the whole company, we used to have three but are currently in a violent take over from an investor CEO who is cutting everywhere, so my job isn't secure anymore.\n\nThe original execs trusted us to do what we needed to do to build our internal tooling and support it so the business can operate.  They asked us about AI, one of the C levels loved to use it for work out advice and all sorts of random stuff.\n\nWe told them, it's basically a stack overflow replacement, great for boilerplate but ultimately is not a full on replacement for any real engineer.  We've slowly each, individually integrated it for our own selfs as we saw fit and shared things that worked.  \n\nOur UI guy I think got the most mileage out of it, for us in backend we used it for tests but really.. I mostly use it for looking up APIs and documentation, sometimes for creating unit tests boilerplate.\n\nI'm personally trying to learn more and more of it since everyone wants it and I'll probably lose my job in the next year.\n\nI'm even more of a dinosaur though, I can't stand editors other than VIM so I'll need a way to integrate AI without using a code editor myself, I ain't switching from VIM.\n\nI heard one of them, cursor or claude I forget, is basically like an AI terminal.  I'll try that route first.\n\nHaving AI actually write code seems kind of silly to me.  For UI I get it, at least our UI is a lot of.. redundant code (propagating properties through react components, same similar patterns to setup or create new react components).  There is redudency in backend but, it takes me a minute or two to just setup any boiler plate I need myself so AI doing it seems like a wash.\n\nAI has been EXTREMELY useful for things like, navigating AWS or Google UI consoles, generating or fixing errors in Docker and Docker compose files, configuration errors with different APIs we integrate, python dependency errors and basically as I said, a bunch of stuff i'd normally use Stack Overflow for.\n\nI tried VSCode + Copilot to implement a feature where we needed a celery task to pull data from a spreadhseet, make a call to a micro service we use to kick off a webscraper and write the webscraper function to pull the data from the site.  It.. kind copy pasted stuff to pull data from the sheet, but without context about what data was in the sheet or how to invoke our scraper, or what to do w/ the data from the scraper it was basically me writing the code but instead of writing code, I'm prompting the AI to write the code I would just.. write myself.  And it fucks up sometimes.  Basically pretty worthless for actual, local business logic.  \n\nPresumably I would craft a bunch of agents to like, look at the spreadsheet and determine from a header row I setup, what values are there and read the local python library we wrote to figure out how to read and write to the sheet and maybe access our microservice repository and automagically figure out how to make calls to it, run a browser to navigate to the site and generate XPath to use with selenium to find elements and navigate it appropriately.. but I would be spending weeks trying to figure out how to make all that happen.  I can just do it in minutes (hours including actually implementing the scraper and spreadsheet functionality).\n\nAnd of course, it's been basically worthless for debugging.  I get a bug report that a user is getting bad values in the system, a customer signs a contract indicating one thing but somehow it's stored incorrectly in the backend.  AI has no idea wtf is going on.  Since I know the entire system I can direct AI towards the problem areas and kind of baby it along it's reasoning but I'm still the one doing all the thinking anyways.  It's much easier for me to just run through and figure out stuff myself.   AI doesn't know the business logic, it just reads code, it doesn't understsand the product or how things are supposed to work, I do.  To leverage AI in this way, i'd need to spend all this time teaching the AI how everything is supposed to work and maybe.. it could at least figure out which code is relevant but it's a TON of context.  \n\nAI is basically just a suped up intellisense/autocomplete as far as I can tell and that's not really something I need when I have the whole programming AND product context in my head anyways myself.  As I said I'm a vim dinosaur so i don't even use intellisense for code completion or API information, I have most of it memorized by now.  When I do need to look things up I forget, like all the possible format options for formating a datetime string, AI is very helpful.  Again, it's just documentation stuff that i've found it useful for, not actually a junior engineer or anything.\n\nPeople say greenfield projects are where it excels, that makes sense to me.  Next time I need to setup a new service or build a new UI project I'll leverage AI and see how it goes, it's been helpful for things like that before.  Once you start having dependencies between different repositories and products/services and complicated business logic spanned across multiple systems.. it hasn't been very useful.",

I don't even know how I'd define happiness right now. I guess happiness for me is contentment, and contentment is the feeling that everything will be ok for who I love the most in this world.",

Similar frustrations - not FAANG-level but the same cultural drift toward process theater and mandating tools instead of trusting engineers to make good decisions.\n\n  \nThe sensible companies exist. They're just harder to find because they don't spend energy on employer branding - they're too busy actually building things.\n\n  \nSignals I've learned to look for:\n\n  \n1. How do they handle disagreements between engineering and product? Do engineers have real input on technical decisions or is it \"just build what we tell you\"? Ask this directly in interviews.\n\n  \n2. Does engineering leadership write code or at least understand the codebase? If the CTO hasn't opened a PR in 2 years, engineering decisions are being made by people disconnected from reality.\n\n  \n3. The AI mandate thing is a culture signal, not a technology signal. Good companies give you tools and let you figure out what works. Bad companies mandate tools and measure compliance. The companies forcing Copilot on everyone are usually the same ones that mandated Jira workflows and measured story points.\n\n  \nThe smaller company you're joining sounds like it could be the right move. WFH + strong engineering leadership + chill culture is basically the recipe. Give it a real shot before letting the industry anxiety pull you down.",

AI doesn't turn software engineering into a sweatshop, you have the terrible FAANG management you're working for to thank for that environment.  AI can actually reduce a lot of the toil of our job like you pointed out, there are several great use cases for that.  Ingenuity is still valuable and I would go so far as to say it is more valuable now than before.  Ingenuity is not something AI can do.  It cannot think outside the box beyond data it has been trained on.  It is not imaginative.  Humans still thoroughly dominate ingenuity and it will be what sets future companies apart from AI derivative outputs.\n\n\\> That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. This is not ingenuity. Wanting to hand write code is nice, but being creative and clever inventing new solutions is not actually tied to handwriting code at all.  You can have AI write code and direct it toward ingenius designs and never handwrite code.  Handwriting code has limited and diminishing value. However, reading and reviewing code and genuine creativity thinking of new designs and approaches that haven't been done before, that has increasing value.",

Without that history, everything looks like a mistake.\n\nLetting them fully repeat the cycle is tempting, but expensive. What’s worked better for me is reframing from “we already tried that” to “here were the constraints at the time.” Even better if you can quantify it. For example, “we tried X, it caused Y in production, and we rolled back because Z.” Concrete scars land better than abstract warnings.\n\nYou could also suggest short design review checkpoints with explicit risk callouts. Not to block them, but to surface assumptions. If they consciously choose to accept a risk after hearing prior context, that’s different from walking into it blind.\n\nStack loyalty is real, but usually the deeper issue is ownership. They need to feel accountable for the outcome. The trick is injecting history without undermining that ownership.\n\nAre they dismissing specifics you bring up, or is it more that they don’t ask about the backstory at all?",

I had started a bit earlier that day and no one else from my team responded. Since I was already online, I said I would take a look.\n\nWhat I thought would be a quick check turned into two hours of deep diving into logs, tracing code and trying to understand what broke. I finally found the issue and came up with a fix. Because of the pressure and urgency, I skipped full unit testing. We pushed the hot fix, hoping for relief. Instead, it made things worse.\n\nAt that point my heart honestly dropped. We had to roll everything back and start again, this time doing it properly. Even though my superiors were very supportive, it was one of the most stressful days I have had. By the end of it, I was completely drained and just grateful the day was over.\n\nCurious to hear yours. What was the day that really tested you as a developer?",

Insurance covered the damage.\n\nWe investigated and found that radar driver hadn't started after compute unit restart. Cause was that when radar is not yet ready, it tries to connect and if it fails, it terminates — basically race condition at boot-up. We had safety procedures in place to not allow autonomous driving and come to a stop when radar data timeouts which never got triggered.\n\nThe procedure interacting with radar driver forwarded latest received radar data with fresh timestamp. It was set on loop according to the expected requirement to send message every 100ms. When driver had update, a buffer was overridden. And when it was time, the buffer was sent out. However, if buffer was filled with old data (or nothing at all), it still got forwarded as \"no obstacles\". Timestamp was supposed to be of the data, not message timestamp. Requirement itself was correct but implementation side messed up data timestamp vs message timestamp.",

We were using it to automate complex application upgrades, although that was 100% not what it really designed to do. \n\nIt turned out that on the night that we were scheduled to do the first run in production we set up a war room in our offices, but it had been scheduled for a day when I was supposed  be at home recovering from surgery. At no point did I ever feel any pressure to reschedule my surgery or come in anyway, but after having been at home for a few days I was going stir crazy and decided to surprise my colleagues by showing up.\n\nTurns out it was a good thing I did. Not long after we started, we hit an error none of us had ever seen before. My manager was all set to call the vendor’s support when I realized that a) I knew what the problem was, and b) it had likely just fixed itself\\*.   So I said, “Hey, hit “retry”,” it worked, and thus was a long and involved support call that probably would have gone nowhere avoided.\n\n\\* So, the particular thing that failed: one part of our upgrade process was basically “take a backup of the database, fail it over to the hot standby, then do an extra differential backup just in case”.  The first backup worked, the failover worked, the second backup failed. The reason: it was the first time we’d run the process against a database of any appreciable size, and it took a couple of minutes before it became available. We were just trying too fast.",

          "text": "They published full details in status updates publicly so I'm luckily not breaching NDA to talk about this. I was in the Compute team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure at the time.\n\n\nWe had an incident about 4 years ago, a bug in a log rotation tool kicked in at midnight UTC (late afternoon Pacific Time where I'm based.) I forget what the bug was, or why it fired. I want to say it related to leap day logic, thought it wasn't a leap year.  The bug had been in production for several months, waiting for the right conditions.\n\n\nOn this day, the conditions were right and it triggered. It aggressively failed to rotate the logs, instead emitting error messages so fast as it tried over and over that it filled the disk within 5 minutes. This triggered on every single hypervisor, worldwide, simultaneously.\n\n\nEvery running VM was fine, but no mutation operations could take place (start, stop, reboot, add or remove storage etc), and almost anything else broke, eg there was no way to get onto a hypervisor as ssh couldn't log.  It was quickly diagnosed and became an all hands to deck. I got pulled in to see if I could see a way to automate repairs, while some folks started manual repair efforts, but the level of interaction with the ILOM wasn't practical to script. So we ended up with hundreds of us split up into breakout rooms on zoom, manually repairing as many hypervisors as we could. Once we'd repaired enough hypervisors in a region, we could then use our automated repair stuff to automatically migrate VMs from dead hypervisors onto the healthy hypervisor and then just terminate and reprovision the now empty hypervisor.\n\n\nIt took hours. I coordinated several people in one of the breakout rooms, while also repairing hypervisors myself. I want to say I was doing that from about 7pm until around 3am the next day? It was exhausting.\n\n\nI have one particularly enduring memory from that incident, and that was of our SVP at the time. Most SVPs and senior leadership that I've worked for feel an urge to manage incidents. They want to help fix, but don't have the direct technical capability to do so, so they try to apply what skills they do have, trying to do what they can, while facing down pressures from all around. As a more senior engineer, I'll often find my role in incidents is managing the leadership so engineers are freed to do the mitigation.\n\n\nThis SVP was different. They sat mostly silent on the incident bridge, trusting the engineers to handle the problem. They only interjected to stop conversations that were starting to rabbit hole that we weren't stopping ourselves. While listening in, they were writing notes to ask some incredibly insightful questions post-incident, and also organising all the VPs and senior directors into a rotation to ensure there was fresh leadership available throughout the call.  Once we'd broken off into breakout rooms, they'd come through about every half hour, _and make sure that we were drinking enough water_. Not demanding progress updates or hassling us to move faster, just making sure we were okay ourselves.\n\n\nEventually I'd been coordinating things for so long for my group that my brain was completely fried, and the SVP forced me off the call, over my stubborn protestations that I could handle the remaining workload. In hindsight they made the right call, I was exhausted.  I found out afterwards that at numerous occasions during the incident, they'd biased towards the health and wellbeing of the staff vs potential earlier mitigation time.  Their deliberate choices throughout made sure we had good coverage right throughout both the incident and the following days, and they followed up with every single one of us to make sure we were taking time to recuperate. It was part of a continued pattern of behaviour that meant I would probably choose to walk through a metaphorical fire for them.",

The helicopter was in the hangar.  The ship was rolling severely.  It was coming within 2 degrees of the critical angle.  If a ship goes past the critical angle, it doesn't roll back in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are replacement parts in crates mounted on shelves on the side of the hangar.  One of these parts was an auxiliary power unit (APU), a smaller jet engine used to provide air to start the main engines.  The crate was tied to the shelf.  On one ship roll the tie down broke and the APU fell of the shelf and went through the chin bubble of the helicopter.\n\nWe kept written records in folders that had a 2-pronged binding clip at the top.  This will be important later in the story.\n\nBy some miracle, the carrier had a replacement part.  They flew it over to us.  Petty Officer Dugan was assigned to do the repair work.  He brought a chair into the hangar, sat on it, and started removing jagged pieces of plexiglass from the front of the aircraft.  At chow time he left to go eat.  The ship took another roll and the aircraft lifted up on its shock absorbers.  The chair rolled under the aircraft, leg side up.  The ship rolled back and the aircraft settled on the chair punching two holes in the fuselage.\n\nOur aircrewmen maintained the records I mentioned earlier.  They used a two-hole punch to make holes in the records to add them to the binders.  One of the aircrewmen painted DUGAN on the two-hole punch.",

I let it run for 48 hours and the results reveal a shit show. \n\nmain find is a ghost transaction, the app thought it was updating ledger balances but thanks to a nested try/catch it was swallowing a specific pdo exception. transaction started but zero commits. the app was clueless and kept it pushing like there was no issue and logs showed success. my little shim called it's bluff and exposed 5 figures of loss vanishing into the void. \n\nI'm not selling anything or looking for a gig, just wanted to start some discussion and see how you guys are verifying data integrity in monolithic systems from before observability was such a big deal. I've been thinking about cleaning this shim up and making it a standard audit tool to maybe help some of my brethren get a little extra sleep if there's a need. \n\nif you have a legacy stack that's full of crap like this or you've caught similar ghost transactions I'd love to hear about it (and how you catch/mitigate them in legacy systems), especially if there's a better way I'm missing!",

They are the pebbles they own. A bucket deletion is a parallel pebble removal.\n\nYou may already see the race condition that existed for nine years. If a bucket had more than one pebble, there was nearly a 100% likelihood that the backend didn’t realize the bucket was empty and therefore didn’t generate the Kafka event to inform other services.\n\n(Because the bucket was empty it didn’t exist wrt what customers or we could see. This only affected downstream consumers from knowing they should drop their data that was related to the bucket. Most of this being pretty opaque to customers. Until I added a feature and this became pretty apparent.)",

They often see it as esoteric typing. I had a manager panic when I came in to work with a cast on my arm, afraid I wouldn't be able to type fast enough. As if my typing speed was why I was the most productive programmer in the office...\n\nSo with that combination of ignorance, attitude, and willingness to express that ignorance online, you see a lot of articles written that talk about how software engineers will be replaced by AI.\n\nFrom the other side, many developers at one time or another have thought about or even tried to build their own products. They've done all the work. So they know exactly how much thought goes into each part.\n\nSome jobs can legit be automated away. I've had \"sprint masters\" on my teams that sit in meetings and read off what's on the sprint board. If every employee is doing their job, then the board is already up to date. The sprint master's only real job is reminding developers to move tickets from one column to another, and that literally could be automated without even adding AI to the equation. On the other side, the sprint master is summarizing the project status to the product owner and manager, which again can be done with a properly designed dashboard. I swear that the only real purpose of the sprint manager was to have an excuse to bill the client for one more consultant. \n\nManagement is harder. They have to deal with interpersonal issues. They have to judge when a team member is pulling their weight. They have to look at the big picture and understand what the goals are. None of this is possible with AI right now. Some management issues can only be addressed by a human, because other humans won't care if they're told the same thing by a computer.\n\nAnd product owners need to understand the product requirements. As a lead developer on a product, I have also taken the role of product owner. I was on one product where the actual product owner had so little understanding of the product requirements that I was effectively doing his job while doing my own. I still wouldn't say that a product owner could be automated away though; it's a necessary role that requires understanding, which LLMs completely lack. It just often isn't a full time role and can be part of the responsibility of the lead developer.",

All the tech managers I've worked with were previously IC's and still do technical work. Not necessarily implementation, but higher level design and reviews, sort of architect adjacent. I'd guess about 1/4 of the product managers I work with were also developers at one point, and quite a few are also technically savvy enough to be competent with SQL and comfortable looking at code if they have questions about how something works. The managers I work with not in a tech department haven't interacted with AI outside of chatgpt.",

Business analysts seem so confident that they’ll just be able to implement requirements using AI without learning how to code, but I think it’s much more likely AI will be able to convert customer requirements to Jira tickets with less time spent talking to customers. That’s actually a much easier task for AI.

What I'm seeing in practice is that the roles aren't disappearing, they're merging.\n\nThe best developers on my team aren't just writing code. They're gathering requirements directly from clients, making product decisions, and shipping end-to-end. AI makes this possible because it handles the tedious parts (boilerplate, test generation, documentation) so the developer has bandwidth to think about the actual problem.\n\nBut here's what people miss: the same thing is happening in reverse. BAs and POs who learn to use AI coding tools effectively can prototype and validate ideas without waiting for a sprint cycle. That doesn't make developers obsolete. It makes the BA more dangerous.\n\nThe roles that are actually at risk are the ones that exist purely as translation layers. If your entire job is taking what a stakeholder said and reformatting it into a Jira ticket for a developer, AI can absolutely do that. But if you're the person who understands the business domain deeply enough to know which problems are worth solving, that's still incredibly valuable regardless of your title.\n\nThe real shift isn't \"BAs replace devs\" or \"devs replace BAs.\" It's that the people who can do both, understand the problem and build the solution, are going to be disproportionately valuable.",

Not a dig at BAs — they're great at what they do.

I spend half my day now writing acceptance criteria and talking to stakeholders directly because I can prototype faster than it takes to write a requirements doc, get it reviewed, have a meeting about the review, then hand it to engineering.

I \"lead\" a very small team of 4 engineers total.\n\nI consider myself an AI pragmatist as in, I will use AI today in whatever ways it is most effective today but I will not adopt unproven or unsubstantiated patterns in the hopes that \"one day\" they are more effective. I don't believe in \"tooling up\" WRT learning how to use AI now so that I'm an expert 3 years from now. If it's that good, I'll learn it then. That's how I treat 99% of all other tools, I don't replace our testing harness once a quarter just because some CTO claims theirs *will* be better in a few years.\n\nI use AI day to day for developing ideas (like a rubber duck), finding ways to articulate technical concerns in concise ways, quickly spitting out code snippets, passing it a file with a question like \"why isn't X function working\", etc. But I don't bother asking it to solve fully creative problems. I'm *not* anti-AI.\n\nMy company, while not being an AI company, has gone full AI radical. They actively tell engineers that soon they will not be required and they should be embracing AI now so they are not left behind, because soon they will have the same job as PMs - which will both be developing features from the ground up. Like, that's a non-exaggerated paraphrase from the CTO. They fully expect their software company to be developed by non-engineers very soon. They said they expect engineers to stop writing tests, and just having AI do it for us. And so on. They said they are very happy to increase the number of outages & bugs because \"that is just the way of the world now\"\n\nI think that is fundamentally stupid and besides the existential threat to my job / insulting internal discourse, I want to leave *simply* because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by \\~80% and let PM's and designers run wild will, in my opinion, irreversibly destroy your product within a few years. And I don't want to be here for that.\n\n*Buuuuuuuuuuuut* I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project.\n\nSo here I am. Stuck for another 1-3 years, watching the company be burnt down from the inside by people giving AI tasks that AI is not yet equipped to solve. Trying to steer the ship towards sanity but merely doing that makes me look like I'm afraid to adopt new tech.",

Absolutely insane value for quick prototypes to get a feeling what it'll look like and find edge cases. Medium sized repo in a non-mainstream language, still pretty good. It'll go through a bunch of files and find the right places very quickly. I use it iteratively most of the time. It'll be confidently incorrect at times so you have to double check. Specific guidance usually allows it to validate and catch itself. Once you have a good idea what you're going to do, make it write a plan and save to file. Then let it implement the change and once again guide it when it gets something not the way you like it. Global preferences of how you want to see the code in the corresponding md also help a lot. Working on changes spanning across multiple repos can get a bit wonky, but you can guide it out of confusion and context blowup with some md persistence. Closing the loop by giving it a compiler and tests is great as it'll fix silly mistakes. Asking it to add logs and debug an issue works some of the time. Pointing it to a CI failure and asking what happened can work surprisingly well. Pasting screenshots asking how to fix works some of the time. The key is in staying critical of what it's doing and working with it iteratively instead of expecting miracles. Sometimes it's absolutely stunning, sometimes it just falls on its face hilariously. Predicting which case it's going to be this time has been challenging.\n\nPS. Funny how y'all are downvoting facts. Good luck 👍",

Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by ~80%\n\nI completely understand. Like, a lot of the same, BUT. Leadership will come around. If you put yourself in their shoes, being promised +20% efficiency gains across the board org-wide for the price of a single engineer? Sign me the fk up! Unfortunately it's just all marketing bs so once the experiment will barely kill the company, leadership will come around.\n\nWrt downsizing that is just the stupidest way people understand \"efficiency gains\". It's +20% *per engineer*. If you fire all your engineers you get no gains anymore, duh.\n\n> Buuuuuuuuuuuut I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project. \n\nJust become leadership. Once you're there they *might* listen to words of caution. But until them, hunker down, and wait.\n\nMy anecdotal experience - I work in distributed E2EE systems - is that literally all of the projects with significant parts written by GenAI fail in some way because the engineers fail to acquire the related domain knowledge that working normally on those things would bring you.

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI recently started a new job.\n\nDuring my first conversation with the team lead, before the interview, he asked whether I use AI in my work as a software engineer. I told him that for more than a year I haven’t written code completely from scratch, but at the same time I’ve never accepted AI generated code blindly or shipped a feature without reviewing it and understanding its impact on the system and architecture.\n\nIn that call I explained that I had lost some of the dopamine I used to get from solving coding problems. Now I try to get that satisfaction from focusing more on system design and architecture, since AI gives us more room to think at that level. He replied that he now gets that dopamine from shipping features quickly and seeing things work.\n\nTo be honest, I needed the job, so I accepted it.\n\nNow the situation is this: more than 100,000 lines of backend code were generated in one month, and he is already talking about launching in multiple countries, scaling, and partnerships. Even a kid who plays games all day could probably find several security vulnerabilities in minutes. The codebase is complete spaghetti.\n\nThe team lead keeps telling me to “prompt correctly” because he thinks I don’t know how to prompt, and we’ve spent more time discussing how to prompt Cursor than it would have taken to build a proper system in the first place.",

My question here is more related to whether you have been able to find a better fit elsewhere. For some context...  \n  \nI use plenty of AI, it's a great tool when used properly. But my company is pushing for heavy amounts of usage. I had my performance review where I started talking about the projects and what I had accomplished. My manager had little interest in that and we mostly talked about how I could create better prompts and use the tools more, as well as their success stories with what they've been doing with AI. \n\nHonestly I really like the company otherwise, and I've been there 3 years. But this has been frustrating and I am considering leaving. **If you've been in a similar situation, have you been able to find a better role?**   \n  \nI'm hoping to hear that some of you folks have made a jump to a team that has reasonable AI expectations. But I'm worried that my situation is the norm. Thanks in advance. ",

More than half the engineers were either junior, weren’t engineers to begin with (CEO, etc) or were traditional researchers asked to build enterprise grade software. Badly prompted LLMs write so much slop, I think I spent most of my days reviewing and coaching/teaching others. Then came the mandate to switch to “if it works, ship it and put the review in the backlog so we can address it later” or “if you review someone’s PR just do the changes yourself and ship it”. The mantra on testing was “I built something and your test broke, can you fix your test?”. It’s wild to watch how everyone is burning out.",

I'd imagine there's a lot of companies/devs right now that are going through the same thing. \n\nPersonally, I use AI moderately throughout the day. Really as a replacement for Google/SO. And only ~1 out of 10 lines of code I publish are generated by AI. Right now, I don't think AI is good enough atm to generate enterprise level projects without having an experienced developer (and also a great team) behind the wheel. But, who knows what it will be like 5 years from now.\n\nAlso, I don't mind seeing these AI questions every day. This is one of the biggest changes/shifts in programming that I think most of us have seen. It's important to discuss it and stay up to date with how we feel about it.",

I usually do fine technically if the description is closeish to my background and I study a bit but I always struggle with the culture questions and selling myself properly. Any advice on improving this? I’ve been thinking about hiring mock interview coaches to help.\n\nI’m not looking for FAANG or the next tier btw, just somewhere decent to get out of WITCH. I will be able to put team lead on my resume now (though I don’t have to be a lead for my next job) which will hopefully help.",

          "text": "At 14 YOE it’s usually not the technical part that trips people up. It’s the narrative.\n\nA lot of experienced devs undersell themselves because they answer culture questions like they’re still mid level ICs. Instead of “I worked on X,” try framing things around impact and decision making. Why did you choose a certain approach? How did you handle tradeoffs? How did you deal with a teammate who disagreed? Those stories matter more than the stack.\n\nI’d honestly write out 6 to 8 solid stories ahead of time. Conflict with a stakeholder, rescuing a struggling project, mentoring someone, pushing back on bad requirements, handling ambiguity. Then practice telling them concisely. Not scripted, just structured. Situation, what you did, what changed because of it.\n\nMock interviews can help, but even recording yourself answering common behavioral questions is eye opening. You’ll catch filler, rambling, or where you downplay your role.\n\nAlso, don’t underestimate positioning. Moving from a big consulting setup to a product company is a story. You can frame it as wanting more ownership, deeper product impact, and less context switching. That sounds intentional instead of “trying to escape.”\n\nYou probably don’t need to become amazing at interviews. You just need to get consistent at telling a clear story about who you are now, not who you were 10 years ago.",

This was the strategy I was taught to use, and I still use it for interviews - memorize the overall story, not the answers to specific questions. That way, you can improvise in response to any question.",

I've always heard so many straight guys who play say girls are turned off by them saying that, but I've always found they tend to actually find it interesting, and my hypothesis is it's about the framing. If you feel ashamed of it and tell someone \"yeah I play ultimate frisbee\" in a sheepish way almost like you're ashamed of it, obviously people won't get excited about it. But if I talk about how yeah I play and talk about how I've traveled to cities across the country to play and how it's a really fun sport and community and show you're passionate about it then people are going to find it interesting.\n\nSo back to careers, if you say \"oh yeah I built a CRUD app I coded the APIs it was pretty basic nothing special\" it's going to not sound interesting. But if you talk about like \"My team built this app to improve the customer experience and we were able to build this really cool app that our customers really enjoy and it made it easier for them to do their jobs which is to \\[whatever your customers do with your app\\]\", that sounds a lot better and more interesting and they'll ask more questions about it rather than just think \"ok there's a thousand other applicants that can build a basic CRUD app if I ask them to.",

For years I was horrid at interviews, especially the behavioral but also the \"Tell me about your technical stories\" scenarios.\n\nWhat got me to the other side was *being* on the other side of the table. Both literally interviewing as well as more deeply learning the whats and whys for each interviewer.\n\nUnderstanding the interviewer's mindset (and various styles of interviewers) made an unbelievable massive difference. Now I can easily identify the person who's just going through the motions- and then not take it personally and even make them crack a smile at the end. And I can easily identify the common interview patterns, what to care about, and when to put more effort and concentration in.\n\nAll of that not only makes interviews far more successful, but it also makes them far far less stressful.\n\nHow do you actually achieve that? Especially if you can't get recruitment training at your current company or learn the hard way via going the entrepreneur route\n\nThe next best option is talking to people, then the next best option is consuming media covering the interviewer's perspective. Keep going - and keep practicing with interviews - till you get a good grasp of it.\n\nBest of luck to you and anyone else reading this",

          "text": "Tons of experienced developers are technically solid but stumble when it comes to articulating their value and navigating the soft skills portion of interviews. The good news is that with 14 years of experience and people vouching for your work, you already have the substance - you just need to get better at packaging it. Start treating those behavioral questions like technical problems: prepare specific stories from your experience using a simple framework where you describe the situation, what you did, and the impact it had. Practice saying these stories out loud, record yourself if you have to, because the difference between knowing your accomplishments and being able to tell them compellingly is massive. Mock interviews with a coach could definitely help, but even just practicing with a friend or recording yourself answering common questions will make a huge difference.\n\nThe key thing about selling yourself is realizing it's not about bragging - it's about helping the interviewer understand what you'll bring to their team. When you answer culture fit questions, tie everything back to concrete examples from your work. If they ask about handling conflict, talk about that time you navigated a disagreement with your team lead at your current place. If they ask about leadership, use your actual team lead experience. You've got the material, you just need reps articulating it in a way that connects with what they're looking for. If you want some help getting more confident with articulating your skills during the actual interview process, I built [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) which some people have found useful for that.",

I usually do fine technically if the description is closeish to my background and I study a bit but I always struggle with the culture questions and selling myself properly\n\nCant stress enough the importance of growing past that feeling. And thats all it is! \"do you work better independently or in a group? Do you prefer kanban or sprint cadence? how do you manage your time?\"\n\nTech interviews are 1 part evaluating your personality and 1 part \"how you communicate\". Practice your responses in a mirror! (that really helped me in my 20s) ...no stuttering or stumbling, keep the \"ums\" to a minumum and GOD HELP YOU dont be looking up answers on the internet while you are interviewing.  \nIf you annunciate better than the last guy? Know how to say \"i dont know\" (indicating youre trainable?) You are GETTING the job.\n\nOther reason going on a buttload of interviews is important is so you can \"get a feel for what and how interviewers are asking questions\" (its 2026 now and I can tell you the vibe now is very different than it was 15 years back )... and of course, determining the best way to \"sell yourself\" depending on what you're good at versus the current market climate.\n\n**Example: Ive been working on linux for 20+ years. Back in the day? they asked about OS level stuff. Now? its more about containerization scenarios. So yeah having a feel for  \"the current context of work\" is VERY important**\n\nI still do \"just because/rehersal\" interviews just for the sake of staying sharp.  \nIt might seem awkward at first but believe me, after about 30 or so, you'll find your stride (and whatever buffs you need to add to your resume to make it stand out)\n\nAnd learn how and when to add a little humor! Ive been on both sides and I can tell you, the guy that knows how to throw in some well placed levity during an interview? and makes people like and WANT to work with him? Thats the guy I ALWAYS hired\n\nSO GO WITH GOD AND LINKEDIN...GET THOSE REPS IN!",

They basically took people from their tech desk and marketing area who were proficient with Adobe (ik). \n\nThey hired me to come in and standardize their practices but also be here to train them to be proper developers instead of people who can only use Claude Code (and not understand what it outputs). \n\nWell my issue is, I am about 3 weeks in and I’m getting questioned why I haven’t gone in and reviewed all the current projects codes entire bases and point out their weaknesses. Remind you I am also designing the new systems Architecture, database schemas, designing and standardizing the UI for our suite of software, and trying to set up a data lake on AWS. \n\nI feel like with this departments constant backlog of bugs (probably because they vibe code only) and trying to kick this department into gear of being real developers. I just simply don’t have time to train them, review their code, and do everything else.\n\nThey are letting me hire a Senior below me but the HR people keep sending me more vibe coders, which I blame the Job Description that my boss wrote, so thankfully I worked with HR to rewrite the job description. \n\nI really don’t know what else I can do other than giving up my time after work or on the weekend that I spend with my wife.\n\nP.S. it’s not like they are mad at me, but I think they expected a quicker turn around of the department",

However, just clarifying, I meant passing some QA functions on to the developers - e.g., writing the tests.\n\nHaving been in the same spot, one way to argue in favor of putting time towards setting up QA is that you can't have QA agents without the automation that backs them up. The \"easiest\" setup would be to have automated testing working at least locally, this way programming AI agents can run the tests to make sure they aren't breaking things.

The reality is you can't train people to be proper developers while simultaneously fixing their existing mess and building new infrastructure. Those are three separate full-time jobs.\n\nWhat worked for us: stop trying to fix everything at once. Pick the one thing that will have the highest impact in the next 30 days and focus there. For you, that's probably CI/CD and mandatory code review. Not because it fixes the code quality overnight, but because it creates a checkpoint where bad code gets caught before it ships.\n\nThe training piece needs to be embedded in the workflow, not a separate initiative. Require PRs. Write review comments that explain the \"why\" behind changes. Make them fix their own bugs instead of generating new code on top of broken code. That's how they'll actually learn.\n\nBut I'll be honest: if leadership expects you to review every codebase, design new architecture, set up AWS infrastructure, AND train non-developers to become developers, all in the first month, the expectations are fundamentally broken.

Junior dev uses Claude to build a feature, it works in the happy path, gets merged, and then three weeks later we're spending two days tracking down an edge case that would've been obvious to anyone who actually wrote the logic themselves.\n\n\n\nThe honest answer is you probably can't train them and do everything else they're asking you to do.

At the same time, I've heard comments from other devs akin to \"grass is not necessarily greener.\" \"We are struggling here too.\" \"Every company has its shit.\"\n\nIn an ideal story book world, I'd love to work on a team and in an environment that's like the second scenario. I know it's out there because I hear about. In the companies I worked for, I've recognized that the times when my peers give positive or compassionate feedback, it inspires me a lot more. It makes me want to voluntarily do more work because it feels like there is a reward there, and something to move towards rather than some thing to run away from. The problem is a lot of times these kind of companies don't hire much/are competitive because - there is no attrition! Who would want to leave environments like that? \n\nSo I feel like that day may not happen immediately and in the meantime, I have to figure out how to embrace this suck. I'm no stranger to it, I've dealt with motivation by fear since childhood so I know how to survive, but I know it has also damaged my mental health in ways that I'm fighting to recover every day. I think I'm kinda exhausted and I want to choose not to deal with that kind of environment anymore...\n\nDo y'all have any advice on what you do when you are in environments like this? Considering \"get out\" is not a straight-forward option, of course. I'm now switching companies for the 3rd time, and from what I've heard, I might get what I want at this company. But I don't want to have any deluded expectations and want to keep cultivate my strengths in dealing with the suck, in a way that doesn't affect my mental health at least.",

                  "text": "But it really wasn't agile, this already happened before. Management liked waterfall because it was always easy to make everything sound amazing on paper. When it didn't work out, they just blamed the engineers for failing to stick to the spec.\n\nIt's easy: whenever you fuck up you need to justify why you still deserve to keep your job. In concrete \"we actually do shit\" jobs (which includes jobs that you may not see that way, like sales, or such as long as we focus on the specific job, vs pure leadership that is just guiding people to work together) it's easy to have a way to fall back and say \"here's the evidence I am competent\", not that it matters that much, eventually a justification is needed.\n\nAgile fixed this by having leadership and stakeholders doing checks as often as possible, ideally twice a month. This brings accountability back to the curve, in theory, because if a project fails after a year's work, this means that leadership failed to act earlier, and as such are accountable too.\n\nBut as your quote says, it didn't happen. There's a perverse incentive for leadership and management to simply delegate fault as they can. Which is a shame because many otherwise great employees could lose their job (or leave burnt-out) before a bad leader is finally recognized as the problem and dropped.\n\nSo what happens? Well there's certain things that we can't say. \n\nMusk can't say \"we came and disrupted the industry, and became industry leaders, but this is still the car industry in spite of it all\", because he needs to keep that going. Tesla will grow to be like Toyota, and we'll try to find other markets before we plateau.\n\nSundar can't come out and say \"Google has a lot of potential with the cloud industry, but we aren't going to get another 'huge hit' this decade, but we have some projects we believe have a lot of potential still\".\n\nZuckerberg can't tell his stock-holders \"innovation requires risk, and a lot of failures before you get a (really worth it) victory. This is how the tech world works\".\n\nThese are all admitting victories, but understanding there's caveats and nuance in what you win. People want a simple key, easy to understand, and fun story. So these companies need to be \"about to do something more insane that ever before\".\n\nAnd this is why you see such a weird interaction with AI, it's kind of the new thing, but also not. CEOs are already saying the red flags they see (but also clearly don't believe in, cannot believe in based on their actions) as CYA. When shit hits the fan they can say \"we saw for this and planned ahead\" (and then hope they actually have something to show).\n\nSo the next excuse is \"we're saving on dev costs\". But this can't quite be. The companies aren't working with a much smaller amount of employees. Nor do we see an explosion of products as we'd expect from a company whose engineers are suddenly insanely more productive.\n\nTake early Google, which in the mid 2000s to early 2010s invested in a lot of things we understand as good nowadays: automated testing, containers, CICD, teams focused on engineer productivity, platform teams that standardize access. The result was a myriad of 20% projects, while the company did start many company projects hidden as grass-root 20%s (e.g. Chrome, Google Docs) there were a lot of actually 20% tools that came out, some amazing and beloved (and later abandoned as they came of excess engineer productivity) tools (Gmail, Google Reader, Google Now, Google Wave, Inbox, Appengine, etc.) Now of course leadership did start projects, and they did bless or redirect other things, but ultimately the point is that all these things were coming out because there was just that much engineering freedom. Companies that copied Google early got a similar explosion of projects, and they were able to move so fast they could just \"pivot\" into an entirely new model overnight.\n\nBut as these became standard, the bar and expectations for the minimum increased. And bad habits started to take over (both in and outside) that lead to ossification, engineers struggling, with crappier products and an apparent slowdown of innovation (it was still happening, but hidden behind the big leadership-led cathedrals, you don't see as many scrappy little game changers).\n\nNot seeing this with AI, and the tools have been used a lot. While AI is a great tool, it isn't as great as a solid CI/CD pipeline with good tests.",

Frankly I found it tiring and their praise meant nothing to me. \n\nI don't know what that experience is like so I'm curious if I'd feel the same way. I wonder if I might benefit from something like that at this point in my career based on my past experience. If I had a new coworker, my approach would be praising them more often when they on-boarding and getting situated because I think that's the time it feels like more effort is needed to build momentum.",
