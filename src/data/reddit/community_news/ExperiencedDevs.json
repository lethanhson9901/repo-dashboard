Below it there was a GREAT discussion with \\~500 comments where other people shared their experience. I copypasted link to this post to two of my friends that are also programmers like me. Today I entered the link and I saw that post was deleted because of \"Low Effort\" without any other explanation. I don't understand why they are doing this,  what's the point?\n\n",

If that ain’t the point of Reddit idk what is. Yes that can apply to other careers but it’s dumb to take down a thread like that. Why? Because lawyers or other professionals can do this too? I don’t get it. Developers have different options and considerations than other careers. Where else can you get through to from other experienced developers?\n\nI like this sub and the thoughtful discussion even when the post at hand is the “same” as others in the past. But everyone and their situation is different so it’s really false to say these are repeated threads. All of this is to say I think the mods take down way too many posts that have interesting discussion \n",

In this sub the content that gets upvoted most are posts against AI. It would be awesome if we as technical people could adapt. \n\nFor example I’ll say the thing that will get me downvoted I’ve been partially vibe coding with an astonishing amount of success. I’m more than a decade and a half in too. I built out the bulk of a basic MVC, multitenant, subscription app with go just by carving out the bones and architecture of the app, documenting the coding standards of the app (two docs) and then giving a prompt for a CRUD action at a time and it’s been doing great. Things that took me a week now take an hour. The longest thing for me to do is code review. Truthfully it’s even fun again because I got in this to create. \n\nSome people absolutely hate that I said the above. They’ll chalk it up to either me being a shill, me being previously bad at my job, or all sorts of things. The reality is there’s a lot of jobs that took a lot of talent that could be moved to India. There’s a path for Western devs and it’s build more innovative stuff and extend what can be done. But it seems the limitation is insecurity leading to inaccurate criticism, being forced to use AI for everything, and a lack of capital to fund the new innovation.\n\nIt’s left the sub to be one of the worst technical subs on Reddit.",

The mods start lumping in good posts with bad posts because there is just so much to moderate, so anything remotely helpful likely will get removed.\n\nI still scroll and read this sub on occasion, and occasionally you find a gem of a post or a comment.

I skip most of the AI topics posted here too, as I don't use LLM based tools, but this particular one OP refers at I read and I found it an interesting PoV, one which **is a reality for many**, even if you don't like AI/use AI tools; if you have an OSS repo on github, chances are you will be confronted with this precise problem: people do drive-by PRs generated by LLMs and it's then up to you to wade through the mud to see what's useful (oh of course, you won't even look at them, and then you will be confronted by angry people who blame you for being lazy and/or asking you why you haven't merged their PR. It all increases time spent on irrelevant things). \n\nSo yeah, it's relevant, even for people who don't use AI tools (of which I'm one).",

          "text": "Here's what irks me about all subreddits that have a heavy hand for moderation regarding general content directionality: you're literally working against the core primitives of Reddit at the platform level. It's a fool's errand and the outcome is entirely predictable: user frustration across the board because the platform doesn't work as expected, the people who disagree with the moderation are going to be very well equipped to complain about it, and the people who agree with the moderation probably don't even know the moderation happened *and probably didn't need the moderation to happen in the first place*. So you're giving some users marginal to no benefit, some users a hugely visible negative experience, and *everybody* is getting treated like a child who can't be trusted to have nice things. There's barely any upside and very obvious much larger downsides.\n\nReddit is *literally* designed to be self policed, at least in terms of content direction. The core platform mechanisms of upvoting, downvoting, commenting, and time-based score decay are designed to algorithmically elevate the visibility of content people are *actually* engaged with, and to quickly bury content that people aren't engaged with. That is how Reddit as a platform intends to steer content directionality. Fighting against that as moderators can have no outcome other than annoying users. Yes, more than the annoyance users would see from observing an actual industry trend being repeated in their feed. \n\nHere's the simplest way I can put it: who should be in charge of determining what experienced devs talk about: experienced devs! It really is that simple. Let people talk about what they want to talk about. A moderator's job shouldn't be to gatekeep conversation topics. Trust me, commenters are more than willing to do that job for you and tell OP that their content sucks if it sucks. And sometimes there's good conversations to be had in the meta discussion about people agreeing or disagreeing about whether content sucks or not.\n\nModerator actions specifically in the dimension of content directionality should be exceedingly rare and the bar should be very high for such actions. It's not only a practical impossibility, but it's downright stupid to presume that you *should* stop developers, experienced or not, from talking about AI right now.\n\nI can not stress this enough: this is a pivotal moment for this subreddit. Continuing down this foolish path of trying to play conversation police via moderation will decimate this subreddit's engagement and stymie its future growth, especially once you get to the point of trying to enforce ridiculous policies like putting things in weekly threads. Again, Reddit is *literally designed not to work this way*. Over time, heavy moderation leads to fewer threads (whether strictly forced into weekly threads or not), which leads to the platform itself promoting the subreddit less often to existing members and less often to potential new members.",

          "text": "I can't speak for what the moderators thought.\n\nHowever, regarding AI, what kind of money do you think is currently circulating in this field, and what threat does this pose to those who are responsible for it? They still have budgets for huge advertising campaigns, and right now, as we speak, there's a gradual understanding that AI can't replace humans in complex development tasks.\n\nBut it's very well suited for deception, because even an experienced developer can't discern how well everything is done in thousands of lines of beautifully formatted code?\n\nIncidentally, a historical aside: When a bubble inflates, it first begins to grow in secret meetings and discreet discussions. Then it reaches the masses and usually turns into widespread hysteria before bursting, because it's necessary to reach even wider audiences with the smallest amount of money that can still be obtained.\n\nHowever, we use AI ourselves and can say that it's very good for some non-critical tasks. But only for non-critical ones, where the cost of error is low. This doesn't apply to development. In development, it's good for searching for certain information and, for example, viewing logs.\n\nI believe that critical discussions of AI are currently harming those who still hope to gain something from this market, and they are making efforts to suppress these discussions. These are temporary attempts to slow down the understanding that is already brewing. So much for the conspiracy theory. True, I think they're solving this through an incredibly large amount of AI advertising of all kinds. They've literally clogged the entire information space with it.\n\np.s.\n\nA scam (from the English word \"scam\" meaning \"fraud\") is a type of fraud based on the abuse of trust to obtain money, valuables, or personal information. Unlike hacking, which exploits technical vulnerabilities, a scam relies on social engineering.\n\n\\- So, if you were promised that by paying for a subscription to some AI client you'd receive fully working code or a real solution as a product, and you received something that doesn't meet your expectations, something that just doesn't work as expected, that means you were deceived and cheated out of your money. Now imagine that almost every day people come to me offering me work for $5 an hour, about 10 times less than I usually ask. They do this, believing that the work of fixing the code that was generated for them is cheap. But no. They've already spent their budget on a product that is very difficult to fix. And it really is better to rebuild it from scratch, simply because it's cheaper. So I have reason to believe they were deceived.",

Ironically, a post about passing responsibility without understanding the work gets removed by mods who didn't read the discussion it generated. The engagement showed it wasn't low effort. This happens across tech subs. Mods choose what they think should be valued, not what members find valuable. A post with 500 comments from experienced devs sharing war stories is perfect for ExperiencedDevs, but it was removed for not fitting someone's idea of \"high effort.' The AI/vibe coding topic often triggers removals because it's seen as controversial, already discussed, or low-effort. These topics resurface because they reflect real industry shifts. The frustrating part: those comments are gone. Genuine dev experiences are deleted because someone decided the post didn't meet an unstated standard. Subreddits decline from over-moderation, not spam or trolls, killing organic discussions. Members stop posting after many good threads vanish. What remains is sanitized and dull. Save valuable screenshots, as the good discussions are increasingly temporary.",

A bunch of out of touch devs who don't want to learn a new tool complaining about it in the saddest ways possible, blaming everything bad that has happened since 2023 on it, while everyone who tries to discuss it seriously or points out that times have changed gets blindly downvoted.\n\nThe problem with discussions like that is that they are pointless. They are full of the same people refusing to learn in every thread. The same arguments, the same biases, the same refusal to learn. It's really stupid to have the same \"WAAAH I have to use AI at my company woe is me\" thread at the top of the subreddit _every single day_.\n\nThe post you linked is honestly about as stupid as could possibly be. Of course using AIs shifts dev time away from writing and towards review. If people would just shut up about \"REEE AI\" for a second and actually consider what is going on they'd find it wildly obvious why AI creates more review for people to go over. _It's because there's being more code produced_ and produced code needs to be reviewed. Why do you need a different thread every single day to go over this?\n\nThe \"Waah they deleted my waah\" posts are getting old too",

They generate the code, push the PR, and let reviewers review “their” work.\n\nAs a reviewer, I'm honestly tired of pointing out bullshit 500+ lines super verbose Claude slop code filled with complicated logic and small mistakes that could've been avoided if the author wasn’t too lazy to review their own work properly.\n\nThink about it. These people are basically offloading their work onto the reviewers. All they did was write a prompt in basic English and pass the generated code along. Then reviewers do the hard work of actually reviewing and fixing what they were supposed to write in the first place. After it’s merged, they still get to claim the full credit. Reviewers get nothing.\n\nTo put it simply, they’re just middlemen between Claude and the reviewers. So why not just assign the task to me, let me prompt Claude directly, and let me claim the credit instead?\n\nMaybe it's just my incompetent team. I'm curious: are others seeing the same thing?

If devs are not doing their own thorough reviews for code generated by AI, they are just straight up not doing their jobs. It's like a worse version of copying and pasting directly from stackoverflow from loosely related problems.\n\n\nOP, depending on your role on the team, I would either create a policy or work with management and get buy in that you will auto reject code that is clearly just thrown over the wall/generated by AI. In the before-times, if there was an intern or someone junior who PRed something and clearly misunderstood or was way off down a rabbit hole or submitting broken code, you'd sit down with them and walk them through how to do it properly once or maybe twice.... If they continued to just not get it, they would not last on the team. \n\n\nWe should all be taking a similar approach, if a PR clearly hasn't been (thoroughly) human reviewed, reject it and talk to the dev directly about what they should be doing and why.... and if they continue to submit garbage code, handle it like it would have been handled previously. I haven't encountered laziness this extreme, but I'd start to escalate to upper management with references to wasted money on man hours and on the ai subscription, not to mention the massive risk of the company being a victim of, \"slopsquatting\".",

As he was going to a take a leave I looked to some PR to gather a little context.  \n  \nOMFG  \n  \nHe was accessing directly other project DB. That project has an endpoint to expose that data.

The front end guy in the past implemented some of code, including this stores. He did it correctly for sure. I am not sure if AI is now doing things in the same fashion or doing mistakes.\n\n\n\n>A.3- what do you mean? if a material is added to db, surely we need do nothing\n\n  \nI closed the threads (not that they mean anything in that project anyway). \n\nBut I let slip in the next meeting with the CTO that it was a little to much AI for me, and if that is that what he expected of me.

I don't really read most of that - I only look if there are any glaring issues that could cause problems outside of its scope. My bigger concern there is that AI might see some of those ugly patterns and repeat it in future changes in other pieces of the code, where it matters more.\n\nI am also less strict in demanding all of my comments be addressed at the time of the PR, because with CC it's easy to do that in a follow-up PR, and our devs are willing to do that. If you can merge in 5 PRs, 4 of which are cleaning/improving the original structure, you're probably better off quality wise than getting 1 PR up to perfection as you'll likely get to try the thing in some sort of staging environment and see what the \\*real\\* problems are, all the while you're simultaneously writing up the improvements to the original comments.\n\nWith business I've also made clear that we cannot guarantee a good level of quality & maintainability for much of the prototypes they're asking us to churn out. That's sorta OK as they get to try out a lot of ideas and we're free to completely restructure/rewrite the code later without worrying about producing the exact same results - which is usually quite a lot of work when you're having to refactor existing systems.",

Can't get the agents to run it is my biggest problem, the model tool calling reverts to what is appropriate for the language, rather than https://github.com/titpetric/atkins as clearly stated in prompts/agents/claude.md. lefthook + atkins is a little bit of of a guardrail, but it again gives LLMs ways to fuck up a process by just disabling the gate.\n\nExternal test suites have been called excessive in my line of work just two years ago.

They’re generally helpful with generating CLI commands for tools I’m not familiar with, small SQL queries, or code snippets for languages I’m less familiar with. I’ve even found them to be pretty helpful with generating simpler one file scripts (pulling data from S3, decoding, doing some basic filtering, etc) that have been pretty helpful and maybe saved 2-3 hours of time for a single use case. Even when generating basic web front ends, it’s pretty decent for handling inputs, adding some basic functionality, and doing some output formatting. Basic stuff that maybe saves me a day for generating a really small and basic internal tool that won’t be further worked on.\n\nBut agentic work for anything complicated? Unless it’s an incredibly small and well focused prompt, I don’t see it working that well. Even then, it’s normally faster to just make the change myself.\n\nFor design documents it’s helpful with catching grammatical issues. Writing the document itself is pretty fast but the document itself makes no sense. Reading an LLM-heavy document is unbearable. They’re generally very sloppy very quickly and it’s so much less clear what the author actually wants. I’d rather read your poorly written design document that was written by hand than an LLM document. \n\nWhenever I go on Twitter/X or social media I see the complete opposite. Companies that aren’t writing any code themselves but instead with Claude/Codex. People that are PMs who just create tickets and PRs get submitted and merged almost immediately. Everyone says SWE will just be code reviewers and make architectural decisions in 1-3 years until LLMs get to the point where they are pseudo deterministic to the point where they are significantly more accurate than humans. Claude Code is supposedly written entirely with the Claude Code itself.\n\nEven in big tech I see some Senior SWEs say that they are 2-3x more productive with Claude Code or other agentic IDEs. I’ve seen Principal Engineers probably pushing 5-700k+ in compensation pushing for prompt driven development to be applied at wide scale or we’ll be left behind and outdated soon. That in the last few months, these LLMs have gotten so much better than in the past and are incredibly capable. That we can deliver 2-3x more if we fully embrace AI-native. Product managers or software managers expecting faster timelines too. Where is this productivity coming from?\n\nI truly don’t understand it. Is it completely fraud and a marketing scheme? One of the principal engineers gave a presentation on agentic development with the primary example being that they entirely developed their own to do list application with prompts exclusively.\n\nI get so much anxiety reading social media and AI reports. It seems like software engineers will be largely extinct in a few years. But then I try to work with these tools and can’t understand what everyone is saying.",

          "text": "The big issue for me is I basically never see these \"AI good\" posts actually address the issues I find. AIs do some interesting things but ultimately too many little details are too wrong for it to be useful.  For instance when generating a test suite there's always test cases without assertions, test cases with plain wrong test data, coverage gaps, etc.\n\nNow I can clean up after the AI but I find the time lost doing so is much larger than what it would cost to just do stuff myself. In particular I'm not finding that the amount of editing I have to do is going down as these \"better\" AIs come into play. Because yes I commit the AIs output and then commit my edits and I can compare the two.\n\nNow if any of these \"AI good\" posts treated the situation like an engineer I'd be less sceptical. Because even if I found the AI to be overall useful I'd basically write half a book about all the problems I've found and why overall the cost/benefit is still in favour of the AI. All these flat \"AI good\" with no context are just bots, no engineer talks that way. At the very least engineers tend to address responses pulling up all the obvious problems with the product today.\n\nThere's not a single good source out there talking about AI from an engineering perspective. It is either flat hype or some meaningless comparison to some other technology with the insistence that because somebody was wrong there that AI must be good too.

I made a similar comment on here (maybe on my alt account) sayying about the same thing; they're pretty smart, but really just can't handle complex codebases or complicated instruction. Helpful, sure, but really has a limit.\n\nMost people agreed, but a few people told me I should try the new claude model, so, I figured \"why not\" and got upgraded at work to opus. Ive been using it for the last couple weeks, and don't want to draw conclusions too quickly, but it's pretty wild how it's closed like 80% of the gap that you're talking about. I won't make any crazy claims about how it can just churn out some perfect project from a single line or anything, but honestly, when it comes to how it can reason, and build on context, and interpret what I say, I actually think that it's roughly on par with what I am able to keep up with.\n\nIt's still so messing using these things, and you really need to keep them on a tight leash/tight feedback loop, but I think, at least this last claude model, is about as good at complex reason as, and has as good of intuition as, a decent mid -level developer.",

I agree with a lot you said except the anthropomorphization via comparison to a mid level developer. I think it's absolutely super human some ways like research and control flow analysis (way beyond the best programmers in terms pf speed) but find that on both complex and green field projects it farts out absolutely garbage junior code (junior-I-wouldn't hire code). \n\nLike the abstractions appear organically and are just awful, i.e. methods that are either 300 lines long or take 10+ parameters, no logical sense of responsibility or encapsulation, repetition _everywhere_, subtle bugs, etc. I can't really do spec driven development at this point as half the internet seems to do. Even with a test/CI/linter harness feedback loop, it only converges on something reasonable when I give it very detailed instructions.\n\nIt does do refactoring amazingly fast but I have to refactor sooo much *because* I'm using it. That's why I'm kicking myself that I don't actually measure my productivity with it. I don't actually know what the effect is. For certain things I know 100% its a time saver but for others I can't shake the paranoia that it is slowing me down and burning me out. Jagged knowledge frontier they say...",

But pretty equivalent-ish in that slice.\n\nAnd yea, you really have to stay on top of it. I haven't noticed many straight up logic bugs, but the real problematic ones are when there's any ambiguity around some instruction, it's still going to silently \"guess\" what you meant, and fuck up the business logic.\n\nI'd say with Opus, compared to Sonnet 4.1 (model I used before), it's gone from happening 80% of the time, to happening like 20% of the time, since it's just way better at deciding when to get more context and crunching it. It's still an issue, but a manageable enough one now.\n\nI'm really not sure how much of a time saver it is or isn't yet, tbh. There's been a lot of \"encouragement\" to, ya know, leverage AI and all that, so I really just decided to give it another earnest shot only in the last week or so, so I've definitely spent more time exploring and setting up (modern, detailed agent instructions, setting up mcps, etc) than building stuff, but I've done a few bug fixes, and a couple \"greenfield-ish\"/bolt-on type feature pieces as I've gone along, and it's pretty effective. \n\nI work on a lot of across the stack feature dev on a large consumer mobile app. I've been putting together a kind of monorepo that has our React Native repo, our application server repo, the repo with our gRPC client and host, and the repo with use to deploy our DB schema/profs. Basically everything you need to build a new feature in the app. I told it I wanted to work on setting up agent instructions, then spent a bunch of just explaining how everything works, what is responsible for what, and a process for how it should work (for example, it can't connect to our QA database, so I told it \"when we make changes to the Database project, write a copy of the new table/proc\" to a TODO/ folder, so I can copy it and run it myself\").\n\nAnyway, we have \"message inbox\" screen in the app that doesn't get a lot of love, so I picked up an old ticket where we want to add a way for users to delete and also undelete messages (archive, really). Not huge, but it requires a new button in the app, new settings option, small screen listing archived messages, a net new endpoint in the server, new args and logic in 2 others, protobuf updates, new proc, DB index ups, new table field...it was a lot of little stuff, across a lot of layers, and our codebase is not a particularly hygienic one....and this little terminal clanker bitch talked to itself for about 10 minutes, read some shit, wrote a bunch of stuff, and ended up with something that was not quite fully working, but only a couple tweaks away from it, and pretty much production quality code..overall, not too different how I would have written it. It followed the instructions I laid out, and after a couple back and forth (maybe 5 messages, over 30 minutes), it was up and running in QA.\n\nI feel like that particular one was pretty in its wheelhouse, since it was pretty simple to convey the full set of requirements, but it was impressive. I know the perception study, and I know I'm not above my own biases, so I'm not going to conclude it's way fast or not for a while, but damn it kinda felt like (for the first time I've experience with an LLM)",

Matching your requirements against the logic, and making sure that your code really meets what you *should* be doing in a way that's going to also meet future requirements is whats hard, and kills projects. When you're dealing with large application's, that's very tricky\n\nI suspect that initially people get very hyped because you've suddenly got a tool that can generate code, which can and will solve problems. But its not helping with the stuff that's actually *hard* about software engineering, because it inherently can't design a custom system for something with how these tools work. It can't get you to understand what's actually happening, and the more you vibe code - the more you distance yourself from understanding the code - which is directly counterproductive in the long term. The nightmare situation for any software project is when you've completely lost track of the architecture, and its all spaghetti\n\nWe've gone through several cycles of people being incredibly excited for these tools, and then pulling back again when they realise that writing any old code that works in an isolated context is not the challenging part. I could crack out a basic app in a short space of time that solves a problem (and I have done many times, especially if you permit plagiarism), but making something that can be built on and last is what's hard\n\nEdit:\n\nMost people in this sub are also extremely junior despite the name",

                  "text": "Anthropic's own [documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) is a great starting point for context engineering.\n\nHonestly, my own workflow at the moment looks more like the sort of pair programming / interactive approach you describe rather than massively parallel and automated. But even that has allowed me to get so much more done so quickly. It's really a matter of giving myself the time to get comfortable with the workflows and developing a good intuition for what works and what doesn't. Steve Yegge's [stages](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) are a pretty good mental model for thinking about this. I'd say I'm squarely in stage 5 myself.\n\nThere are easy things you should always do, like creating a CLAUDE.md file and/or an AGENTS.md file, agent skills in the form SKILL.md, and being very liberal about having the agent create new skills for itself whenever it manages to nail down a workflow, [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for roles and context management. I've also found that having it create a scratchpad for itself where it will write down any important findings or insights that it discovers in the course of trying to solve a problem helps a lot with agent handoff and context compaction.\n\nOn the harness side of things, the fact that it's running in an agentic loop rather than a chat interface already gives you a really good starting point, and the way you extend that is going to depend on the nature of what you work on. To give an example: I had some JSON files that followed a schema that I needed to migrate over to a newer version. Rather than have the agent try to do the conversion itself, I just had it look at the two schemas and write me a schema migration script. And then it just calls the script. Or I might need it to make some API calls and figure out some kind of workflow. I don't want it to have figure out the workflow and make the API calls itself every time, so I have it write me a deterministic script that makes the API calls, and then it just runs the script. Or I might need to do a bunch of math or graph processing. I don't trust it to do math, so what do I do? You guessed it: write me a script that uses a specialized math or graph theory library, and have it run that every time. And it can adapt the script in response to edge cases that it might encounter or evolving requirements. And it just gets better and better at working in the environment you've built for it because it can encode the domain knowledge it's learned in the artifacts that it's produced for itself (the scripts, the scratchpad, etc.), so a new agent doesn't have to rebuild all of that context from scratch.\n\nThere's at least three modes of agentic loops that I've seen people experiment with: there's the script/CLI-driven loop (what I've been talking about thus far); the functional/service contract loop (using something like [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to encapsulate the functionality you want to give it in tightly-scoped functions with typing and validation), and there's the MCP approach.\n\nThe latter two are conceptually elegant because they look a lot like how you do good software development. But then you try the script/CLI approach and you realize it's much more powerful because it can just write software to better enable it to do things that it couldn't do, and it almost starts to look like recursive self-improvement (at the agent level, not the model level, of course).",

Even with the massive advances in hardware, software quality is way, way worse than it used to be and the culprit is these fucking MBA idiots trying to automate thinking and demanding that you do the same.",

When we have programming languages that let us interact with a computer in a clear and deterministic way, to tell the computer exactly what we want it to do, why would we want to introduce a middleman?\n\nTo me, using LLMs to program is like using a reacher/grabber tool to build lego while wearing shutter shades.\n\nI suspect that LLMs are very attractive to the Cargo Cult/Uncle Bob cult people; they don't necessarily understand how to solve problems with code, nor how the computer works, so having a machine output code that looks like what they've learned is \"good code\" feels like a superpower. I have complete sympathy for this, and I am by no means saying I am a better programmer.

The people that kind of shrug at them mostly seem to be people that were doing fine in the first place.\n\n  \nOne last thing. I bought Steve Yegge's book on Vibe Coding because, well, I previously respected Yegge and I wanted to see if maybe I've just been doing it wrong (turns out I was already following best practices before reading it, apparently). All I can say is ugh. It feels like it's written for toddlers. He's constantly mentioning the horrible challenge of.. understanding syntax.

And AI is so much better at me at doing these things. \"\n\n2.\" I am a CEO/something and I just used 6 agents to do something my team would have taken weeks. Furthermore, I don't have to worry about waiting the next day as they can do it after hours (implying AI >>>> productive than team and giving green light we'll be needing less people to do the same task over the years) \"\n\nI'm not denying this can be true to an extent but I also feel like the hype language without clear \"good\" examples makes it hard to understand the impact - is AI good for low-hanging fruit or is it truly a game-changer for even more complex tasks? My work is not clean cookie cutter cut requirements, yet everybody is sounding like AI can work off if even vague requirements better than a human can. Lots of posts even suggesting AI is not just going to tackle technical problems but business ones too where things like causal inference and the such will no longer need a human but AI. All this in the backdrop of CEOs saying AI will take all our jobs by 2026. \n\nI am still learning how to maximize the potential in my workflow and I imagine my team will get us access to claude where I can better observe the capabilities.

          "text": "Hey, I’m a SWE in a FAANG and an AI power user, I’ve been coding without AI for years before ChatGPT came out.\n\nI’ll be very honest, I get that all this can feel like hype, it’s very hard to find the right tool/model if you don’t spend some time knowing what’s the best, and everything keeps changing. But if you don’t feel a huge productivity gain with AI yet, you are doing something wrong. It’s not anymore a matter of knowing if AI is good for your use case, it’s a matter of knowing how it can be.\n\nFirst of, if you are not using it already, use Claude Code with Opus 4.6. Sonnet 4.6 is also good but I suggest trying what’s best first, to have an idea of what’s possible, then do bother with cost saving.\n\nThen, by experience, 99% of the tasks that this setup cannot achieve is because of a lack of context, or lack of capabilities, it’s almost never intelligence. So if you work in a big codebase, ask Claude Code (CC) to update the CLAUDE.md with a high level overview of the repo and its architecture, and keep some up to date lower level CLAUDE.md in each main submodules.\n\nFor context issues, ask yourself « what would I tell a newcomer that has to work on the project? ». If you’d give him a link to the internal docs, do so with Claude too. Use the plan mode (Shift + Tab) when asking for a big feature so that the agent asks questions back. Leverage the Skills feature to store information about internal tools that he can open anytime and not fill the conversation every time. If you are using a library that has been updated recently, ask the agent to read the whole documentation online and build a tree of all the relevant URLs so that he can find up to date knowledge by himself.\n\nAs for capabilities, ask yourself « what do I DO when I’m working, to debug, to deploy, etc ». If your app runs in docker, give the agent docker access, specify the names of the containers and ask to run and debug himself. Don’t add any friction where you would need to copy paste anything, run a command, you should just validate commands (make sure they are safe), and whitelist all commands that will always be safe. If there is something you do that the agent can’t do (needs physical intervention, needs to browse the website visually to test it, click some buttons…), it’s better to spend some time trying to find an alternative/a solution than do it manually every time, it will have a huge impact on long term. If you are searching for answers on Slack, add the Slack MCP. If you use Chrome to navigate the frontend and trigger some workflows, look into Computer Use feature, or web automation frameworks. If you need to go to a VM and do whatever, setup an SSH connection for the agent do that he can do that.\n\n\nAnyway, my conclusion would be that these tools require new skills for the users. You need to understand the limitations of LLMs and how these tools work around them. It will not work perfectly out of the box, and I think the main issue is that the models don’t have much initiative. For example, they assume you know exactly what you want and if there is a better alternative they will not mention it and will just follow your instructions. You need to explicitly ask them to be more critical, to be more autonomous. This will probably change in the future, and there is definitely a progress in this with the 4.6 series.",

I recently worked on one od those 4 developer $600k projects scoped for 4 months of engineering. And we are just replicating the POC/MVP that was built.\n\nIn fact, it is better than any Figma I've used. We know what they want and those sloppy MVC teaches us the business domain and illustrate way better than any Jira story write up. One day, some day, those POCs will be it. Right now, they are 80-90% good enough. We just have the last mile , last 10% advantage. I am honeslty fine with it. My whole team knows that. \"We are competing against people using AI\"\n\nI am glad this is happening as it exposes the wasteful projects done in the past that costed millions and millions to develop and maintain when we could of either bought it off the shelf. Or minimized resources just to build \"Just enough\" without the traditional over-complexity. If someone cost $150 an hour and spends 4 weeks to do some front end responsive scaling and sprinkle some random layout, is that effort worth $24,000 for that user story? When it is used by two people maybe twice every 2 years? When a now-code automation does it with 2 clicks? Then it is thrown out 6 months later because design fancies something else, a different layout. Do that three times a year, the org is wasting close to 100K on what? A button click that is hardly ever used by no one?\n\nI rather focus on the last mile, the last 10% value type projects. As those work will always be harder to replace by LLMs. Some devs have blinders. But when I dissect user stories and ask, is that worth worth $60,000? Wouldn't the company be better served with buying a license for a COTs system that cost $200? So this is a shakedown to expose these ROI value propositions. I hope more engineers see that.",

They get sloppy because the spec is underspecified and the feedback loop is weak.\n\nThe big productivity gains people report usually come from two places. One is decomposition. You keep the plan in your head and use the model to execute tight, well-scoped chunks. The other is iteration speed. You let it draft, you review, you correct, you regenerate, and you keep the loop short. That turns it into a high-throughput assistant rather than a replacement engineer.\n\nDesign docs are a perfect example. If you ask for a design doc from scratch, you often get generic mush because the model has no ground truth about your constraints, tradeoffs, and decisions. If you instead feed it the actual decisions and ask it to write specific sections, add edge cases, or tighten language, it becomes useful.\n\nSame with code. The “2 to 3x” stories are usually people using it for boilerplate, tests, refactors, glue code, migration scripts, API clients, UI scaffolding, and repetitive internal tooling. They are not letting it drive architecture. They are compressing the parts of engineering that are time expensive but conceptually straightforward.\n\nOn the “PRs merged immediately” point, that’s a process choice. If a team stops reviewing, they will ship faster until the quality bill comes due. That’s not evidence the models are flawless. It’s evidence the org changed its risk tolerance.\n\nSo you’re not crazy. Your experience matches reality. The hype is conflating two different things. The tools can materially speed up execution when the human supplies tight scope and judgment. They are still unreliable when you ask for autonomy over ambiguous problems.",

But it will 100%. It’s here to stay. And it’s only going to get better as time passes. Seriously dude, learn how to use it. \n\nHere’s something I’d like you to try. Take one of the architecture a design documents for a system that you built or had a hand in building. Using Windsurf (that’s what I use now), paste that into the prompt box to give the llm context. Then using the keyword “megaplan” tell it to plan the implementation. It’s crazy shit.",

It's less a dev mindset and more a dev manager mindset.    \n  \nThing is, it doesn't matter.  I've been in the trenches with this stuff since pre-release beta.  It has gotten progressively better at a pretty measurable rate and that rate is not linear.  Within a year or two here, it won't matter whether you're \"good\" with AI or not right now because it'll just be good enough to compensate for the relative lack of clarity that drives most people to think AI is crap.  I'd say, don't sweat it.  There is a really tight window here, where if you're \"good\" with AI, you can do some real damage ahead of the curve.  But pretty soon the models will be good enough that everyone will be able to get those kinds of results.  \"Software Engineer\" will be replaced with something more along the lines of an architect that puts systems together - a sort of combined dev/pm/bsa/manager.

Took 5 minutes, and was near perfect. 90% of unit tests passed, and the GUI I built worked out of the box too with sql.\n\nI just had to do some minor touches and I could switch over.\n\nI did spend some time to ask cursor to refactoring the code, because there were a few repeated patterns that lacked the right abstraction.\n\nWhat would have taken me several days took less than 2h.\n\nI have several examples like that.\n\nIf my productivity was 100, with chatgpt it went to 150, and with cursor it went to 500.

If anything, it makes mediocre programmers be able to write, okay stuff, effectively making the SWE distribution go from a balanced one, to a positively skewed one, at least code wise. Some of the shit I saw during the beginning of my career would never exist with today's LLMs, simply because they would pump out OK code, no matter how mediocre the dev. \n\nNow, will they CHANGE the world? I'm not sure. The way I see it, it all hinges on whether or not AI can review its own code. From a programming point of view, it can use tests as a guidelines for \"fixing\" things, so it could be a helpful tool to fix bugs, but I believe it still can't understand intent that well, as in the intent behind a feature, or if a PR is good or not.\n\nSo Unless you're at a startup where pumping out code is more important than it working, or it bringing value, I don't see humans being taken away from the equation, and I would go out on a limb and say that any perceived gain of productivity is squashed by the gigantic amounts of code LLMs can pump out. Now, you can't ask a software engineer to squeeze out more brain juice, so my only logical conclusion is, now we spend whatever gained time reading code and correcting/iterating on generated code. Are we more productive? It's not really important. The bottleneck is still mental energy, and LLMs aren't giving us any.\n\nIt's a weird state of things right now. LLMs as of now are just a way to squeeze us out more. Give a little bit of convenience when generating code and in return being asked to take 10X the mental load just because. Non technical people don't understand. They think writing the code is the hard part, and touting LLMs to be such a revolutionary technology is political suicide for any SWE. Is giving in to the new expectations, new expectations where you're supposed to deliver a lot more at the same salary. \n\nOn my end, I embrace AI. It's okay, for the most part. It makes a lot of tedious shit easier, and reduces friction in a lot of places!!! But it isn't taking my job away. And it's important that people temper their expectations of it. Touting llms to be all this and that is political suicide for all SWEs.",

With some really good engineers and in one case an elite nerd that was a top ten in the world in his complicated niche domain. \n\n\nWe have reached somewhere into the realm of oscalating between \"pretty good\" to \"really good\" engineer but it gets there 50x faster when given the task with guidance still needed especially around the architecture and high level vision. \n\n\nWe are still a ways away from it cracking into the level of the elite nerd especially on the innovation front... but damnit I don't see a reason why it can't get to sparks of that.\n\n\nAnd so many are yelling about AI hype and coming up with the most copium petty comments when just zooming back 5 years and how far the space has come since the Will Smith eating spaghetti days... just kidding that was JUST three years ago. \n\n\n\n There is no \"incentive\" for me to push this. \n\nCall me whatever or think whatever, but it doesn't really matter. You'll look back and see how many signs there were that this is the start of the new era. \n\nI don't really need to argue the same way i don't need to argue that exercise helps increase strength, gives you longer life, or helps mood.\n\n\nI don't need to hear from Twitter how great it is or watch some YouTube bro. I'm just actively living out seeing it in action. \n\nI'm going to continue to build my side projects and iterate on the workflow and other implications (it's not just about code). I'm going to continue to see my team be able to build in whole new ways and have so much more autonomy to just go solve problems.\n\n See us do the hundred tasks that are \"easy\" but have sat for years. Do all the huge complex bits that needed so many iterations now have 3 learning loops in 3 days and be 50% of the way for a 3 month refactor. \n\n\nSeeing the absolutely soul sucking work of sorting through hundreds of jira tickets and thousands of slack channels and threads for all the shit of conversations and Google docs and confluence pages and scattered documentation reduced by 80-90% so I can focus on work during my deep work time.\n\n\"But it made this one stupid thing happen and wrote bad code\". Do you work with people?!? I guess you've never started at a company and had a look at their 10 year old codebase.\n\n\nNo one gives a shit about the code. Do you ever admire a bridge? Is an elevator art? What about the sewer? The scissors your barber uses? Pick whichever of that list you really don't give a shit about and imagine less shits. So probably not the sewer. \n\n\nPeople want things that work. And lots of what they make work. Some doesn't. Just like all of our stuff.\n\nThe tooling to fix those things and smoother out the rough bits has the best talent in the world plus 1000x people at companies working through that. Do you not think those things will be consequentially better still in 5 months? What about 5 years?\n\n\nIf you've reached the end of my rant then congratulations. I award you no points. And may God have mercy on your soul. \n\n\nI don't know what the end game is. I don't know what the future of work looks like. I don't know if it's an actual Utopia or something of what we fear.\n\n\nAll I know is that I didn't start the fire, but there are clear flames everywhere and people want to dismiss the heavy smoke as simply bad weather. Ignoring the evacuation warning until they the heat gets to their doorstep. \n\n\n\n",

There used to be quite a few fresh grads hired every year, now there are less, and only very occasional hiring of junior folks.\n\nI guess the aspiration is that the junior stuff gets done by India, AI, etc...the reality, though, seems to be that lots of experienced, senior people end up doing pretty mundane stuff, like, you know, upgrading libraries, adding metrics, doing releases, whatever else, because there are no junior people to do that.\n\nWhich then means that, there aren't really people around to actually \\_do\\_ any architecture or strategy stuff, like, upgrade to modern libraries and frameworks, make things cloud-native, make things fast, etc... because they're too busy doing all the busywork that the missing junior people can't do.\n\nIt's a bit weird.

Company (stupidly) took on a contracting company 6 months ago to do some work on a platform upgrade and the delivered code is clearly AI-generated by the juniors and they gave us at a reduced rate. Now I'm spending most of my time cleaning it up and (in some cases) rebuilding entire features because the AI built it in such a way that it's totally unmaintainable and broken in production due to edge cases that are a product of that bad design.\n\nFun fact: I got a glowing performance review from my boss the other week off the back of this work and that I'm ahead of most of the rest of my team for bonuses this year. Needless to say the contractors in question are actively being off-boarded and we're not using them again. \n\nThere's going to be a lot of work in remediating AI generated code, especially in critical services so I don't foresee senior devs having any job security issues in future.\n\nLooking forward though, AI will (eventually and undeniably) become the mainstream way of generating code. The question will be does the generated code move from being AI Slop that takes the effort of a full time emplyeee to maintain or does it become good enough to replace those jobs. The former of those 2 is preferable and IMO the likely outcome. \n\n",

The grad program was two years, 4 x 6 month rotations on different teams, after that, they get a permanent placement on some team at the next level up.\n\nThe attrition rate was pretty high, some of them would leave during their two year program, and a lot of them would leave after 1-2 years in their permanent placements.\n\nHowever, the ones that stuck around for 3, 4+ years were pretty good, and ended up being really well connected to multiple teams from their rotations, and a lot of very senior people started as grads 20+ years ago... honestly, as a \"lateral hire\", in some ways its like you can never quite catch up / replicate what the people who worked up from grads have.\n\nI think it worked, because there are some economies of scale from hiring / training so many of them at once, and although the chances of a winning \"investment\" in any one of them was low, some single digit percentage of the ones that did stick around were real lifers that live & breathe the company and all that stuff.\n\nAlso, even if you hire someone, and they stay for 2 years and then leave, the company gets publicity when advertising for the job, hiring people, and the person ends up with the company name on their resume which serves as an ad for the company for the rest of their career.\n\nThat's how BigCo seems to work... it the model is built around a certain level of churn, thats why they're always simultaneously hiring and firing... it is not built around \"investment\" in individuals.",

I am at big tech, coming off an 18 month long project where I was the team lead.\n\nI'm on a \"stacked\" team right me, not even the team lead, but that goes to someone with like 10 years experience at the company, there's 3 other engineers, 2 seniors, one of which is just as ambitious as me, the other one is a solid contributor, and we're onboarding a mid.\n\nThe \"center of gravity\" for talent on this team is \"high performing senior\". It's wild, and the first time in my career where there isn't a leadership gap to step into.\n\nTaking a step back, this is all happening because leadership want to take control over an AI project that started elsewhere, so the decision making isn't happening with my manager or skip level, but skip-skip level. Because this project is so sensitive to upward stakeholders, it means they want the highest fidelity executors they can get. It's not all bad for me, I've carved out a pretty interesting project that uses AI in a high leverage way, but it's certainly a level of company wide visibility that compresses the talent gradient.\n\nI'm still hopeful, because the model of how we're using AI is new, and could be the direction we take the entire org. In a lot of ways, we're still in the drivers seat, but for 3 years of being a team lead, it's definitely weird to look around and not see an immediate need for leadership.",

And, while they are learning, you are pretty much guaranteed that AI will do something better than they will, or at least as good as what they do.\n\nSo what we’re really looking at is: **do we want to burden a senior with some AI agents, or do we want to risk investing in a junior which will take a long time to be useful, and maybe when he does he will actually leave us to get a pay raise?**\n\nObviously, there are ways around this, such as giving better wages to junior people. However, this, again, the equation shifts towards AI, which ends up being much cheaper.\n\nI think we have a real issue with how we’re going to form and develop more juniors into seniors, and it will take stronger investment from companies.\n\nBut the little guys can’t do this, or they will be outpriced. So to me, it must be the big guys that have to be willing to do this, because they _can_ afford to put in the extra money to form people.\n\nI do think the little guys are getting the shaft, unless they find juniors who are very good. But, then again, if they are very good, they should probably go to a place where they will earn more.\n\nThe equation is very unbalanced. No one wants to pay more to juniors because it's a high-risk investment. And, yes, I think it's short-sighted. We **will** need people to develop skills and go from junior to senior.",

I already saw this in 2024 - AI slop PRs, AI rising early in their career meant most of them will never actually learn to program by themselves. At my non-FAANG company the median junior was kind of terrible *before* AI and I can confidently say that Claude Code with Opus 4.6 simply produces better code. Yes, it needs more hand holding, yes, sometimes it will do absolutely stupid things, but on average it's better and it's also superhumanly fast.\n\nWith the things other commenters mentioned - the AI aided cheating, the massive AI slop resumes, etc. WHY in the world would you try to hire juniors when you can pick up experienced seniors, that presumably learnt to code without AI and due to wage compression you can probably pick them up for lower salary than a couple of years ago?",

Without it, you get architecture by tribal memory, and tribal memory degrades fast especially when the team is already at capacity just keeping the lights on.\n\n\n\nWe went through something similar a few years back at a place I was at — not an AI story, just a round of layoffs that took out almost all the mid-level folks. The seniors were fine, technically, but within about 18 months the codebase had drifted in ways that were hard to explain. Not wrong exactly, just... internally inconsistent. Nobody had been asking \"why\" enough. The juniors who ask annoying questions are actually providing a service.\n\n\n\nThe AI angle makes it worse because the implicit promise is that the productivity gap will be covered by tooling, so you don't need the human pipeline anymore.

The idea made total sense, but it was genuinely one of the dumbest business ideas I’ve ever heard.\n\nTheir idea was essentially to subsidize movie costs long enough to grow to large enough user base that they could then threaten to take theatre chains off their service and use that threat as leverage to negotiate lower ticket prices or a percent of concessions. They also planned to sell analytics data to studios to help them understand trends.\n\nThe problem was that the movie industry is dominated by just a few, massive chains who could replicate their idea in an afternoon once MoviePass proved the demand was there and MoviePass would have no leverage to do anything about it.\n\nFor customers, the only advantage MoviePass had was their pricing model. Whether you’re buying through MoviePass or the theater directly you’re still going to see the same movie, buying the same snacks, and sitting in the same seat. That meant that as long as MoviePass was still losing money all someone like AMC would need to do is match their price and wait for them to go broke. Since AMC is much bigger and could run at a loss for a lot longer than MoviePass it was never going to work out.\n\nI get why the Uber comparison seems to make sense at first glance. They both kind of fit the “we’re just going run at a loss and burn VC money until we have the leverage to raise prices”. The critical difference is that when Uber was starting up they were competing with much smaller, highly local companies who couldn’t just lower prices indefinitely and build a dispatch app over night. Also, the pricing dynamic is reversed. If you’re an Uber driver and Uber says they’re reducing driver pay, you can’t really go do your own Uber. You can quit, but that won’t meaningfully affect Uber. If MoviePass demands a better deal from AMC and AMC says no, so MoviePass removes AMC from their service, like I said before, AMC could just copy them and run at a loss until MP went broke which is essentially what happened",

The thing that OpenAI and Gemini will get from free-tier users is their sweet sweet human-generated input.\n\nI expect that some point they'll en-crapify their services, like we've seen happen with every other platform, but there's still incentive for them to keep a free tier, because they'll be gaining something from it they want. It's just that the user experience will BARELY be good enough to keep people using it; which will incentivize people to switch to a less-crappy paid account (where there will still be ads).",

Reality disagrees. While I agree that this is likely the viewpoint of some at the top of the chain pushing AI so hard... this isn't the ground level reality. Many companies using AI are already openly admitting they gain little to no benefit from AI, while pushback is already increasing.\n\nYour average business on a day to day are currently spending $0 on AI - most of the spend is highly concentrated near the top. This won't improve any if these companies were going to start charging. There are specific more targeted fields such as developers where AI has shown real gains. I don't want to make it sound like I think AI is useless... it's a legitimate technology with a lot of room to grow, but currently the primary value is in very targeted applications, and in many of those applications consumers are pushing against the use even when it may be useful (think AI in videogames etc.)\n\nAs of now at least, there are still a huge amount of jobs that require minimal computer use at best... while requiring effectively 0 AI use. If my plumber started bragging to me about using AI on his work... honestly I'd probably change plumbers. \n\nUntil we have high-end robotics with a functional near-AGI, many of these jobs will never adopt AI, because it does nothing for them. We are nowhere near a functional AGI or the necessary level of robotics, and there is a lot of research and evidence indicating that this current path of LLM's will likely never achieve true AGI. \n\nSo while use might expand out as they make AI versions more targeted at different areas other than development... this isn't a simple, or quick, or cheap thing for these companies to do. \n\nSo while I agree this might have been the intention here... we aren't actually seeing it succeed, and they are already starting to run out of \"runway\" of blowing a lot of money for little to no gain. Which leads me to your other comment...\n\n>And since it's all funny money (an A gives to B gives to C gives back to A circle jerk), they can keep this train on track, no matter how absurd it seems.\n\nFor a while they can... they absolutely cannot keep doing this indefinitely. All it takes is 1 piece to fail and the entire structure starts to crumble. Once that happens the entire circle jerk collapses.",

In 12 months that will be a ,500 machine. In 24 months, a high-end consumer GPU. The ceiling on price increases for hosted models is not set by demand -- it is set by the point where local models become good enough for the 80% of daily tasks where frontier model quality does not matter.\n\nThe real risk is not price, it is workflow lock-in. Tools like Cursor and Copilot are designed to be sticky. If your entire muscle memory and project config is built around a hosted tool that later triples in price, switching costs are high even if alternatives exist.\n\nThe hedge is not limiting AI use -- it is staying model-agnostic in your tooling where possible, and making sure you understand what the model is doing well enough to catch it when it is wrong.

Which makes sense because this is ultimately just software and software is cheap to run but expensive to develop.\n\nMy thoughts on these implications:\n\n1. So for the foreseeable future, there's gonna be a seemingly endless push to the next model, because 1. they've already dumped billions into the next gen, and 2. if there's an arms race, no company feels like they can be the one to stop first.\n\n2. If the entire industry *does* grind to a halt in the research and frontier model areas, we won't necessarily be priced out of the current model at the time because again, it's cheap to run inference. I do expect prices to go up though, but how much is still in the air imo. When this happens and what might cause this collapse is anyone's guess.\n\n3. It's a weird thing that the current model is profitable, but they have to keep shoveling increasingly large amounts of money in to create the next thing. It's almost like the pharmaceutical/meds business model. Except there's not as big of a reward.",

Frankly I think automating more white collar work would be good for human welfare overall, and I wish we could get more compute online more quickly. On the other hand I think there are certainly a lot of potential risks associated with smarter and more capable AI systems coming online, and the more quickly they come online the less time we have to address those risks. I also think TSMCs natural monopoly here isn't great, but they literally made the market possible in the first place, so good for them I guess. Just wish they had some real competition. \n\nThere's also the possibility that we (or we, with the help of smarter AI) discover ways to create far more efficient and intelligent AI models, I'm talking about something entirely orthogonal to the current LLM approach, all this compute build-out becomes obsolete as a result, and we become obsolete as well.

          "text": "I do think you’re overreacting a bit, yes. This is the importance of open weight models. I think we are headed toward AI inference being a commodity. Right now, I’d say the open weight models are about one, maybe two, generations behind the SOTAs from the big labs.\n\nYou gotta remember that this time last year, we had just seen the release of Sonnet 3.7, which I’d say was one of the first models to be somewhat useable for real code. Today, the open weight models are easily exceeding what was possible with Sonnet 3.7, with most of them within spitting distance of Sonnet 4.5/4.6. Hell, some even challenge Opus 4.5/4.6 in some tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to open weight models, what you see happening is people applying the well known pattern of any other form of hosting to inference. Calculate amortized CapEx and OpEx, and charge accordingly. Even if the closed weight SOTA models disappeared tomorrow, we’d be ok with the open weight ones.",

I've answered hard questions properly and still didn't pass interviews, I felt that I bombed interviews and yet still I passed them.\n\nI was a team lead for a few years and I got to interview people quite a bit, and let me tell you, the interviewer is as much of a factor in this as you are.\n\nIt takes effort and time to set up an interview pipeline, what are the right questions to ask? How do I gauge your skill? Do I have alternative questions in case I land on something you're not very good at, but perhaps you have something else that is better? How do I sprinkle you the right hints and how do I test whether you're good at communicating? It's an insanely fucking hard job, and like any job, the skill of the interviewer and the effort put in the pipeline is a huge factor.\n\nYou could be a genius engineer, but if a shitty interview pipeline only asks leetcode hards, and only measures you whether you pass all tests in 60 minutes, is that really a good filter? Does that even say anything about you other than you know how to code leetcode?\n\nDon't take it personally, a lot of companies are shit at interviewing, and revel the fact that you might just work for their competitor instead and drive them out of business. If you're good at what you do, then you will game their systems or stumble on a company with a better engineering culture.\n\nAnd even if the pipeline is good and the interviewer is skilled, there are other factors, such as not needing someone exactly of your profile/skillset at the moment, or not really having chemistry with the interviewer, or they simply not liking the look of your eyelashes. You can't control any of these things, except the eyelash part, but since we're developers, we are doomed to a life of somewhat un-attractiveness anyway.\n\nTake the L, give them the finger for being too stupid to see the brilliance of [TheTopG\\_\\_\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTopG___/), and move on to the next one.",

I thought about it for a couple days then declined to proceed. Not only because I really don’t have the time or sanity to go through that bullshit right now, but even moreso because if that’s how they’re hiring senior devs then they’re focusing on the wrong things and I don’t have high confidence that the team I’d be joining would be a good fit.",

Anyways they didn't ask me any coding questions for a Senior SWE role.  It was behavioral type questions learning about how I operate day to day along with technical type conversations.\n\nI guess they assumed my 15 YOE was good enough to verify my coding skills.  Anyways I grew suspect of the company since the 4 interviews were basically just conversations.  The people that interviewed me were all from big tech companies like Waymo, Apple, and Google looking at their LinkedIn page.\n\nMany employees graduated from Stanford and other big named schools.  Yet here I was graduated from some no-name state school working at private no-name non-tech companies in non-tech cities on the east coast.  The recruiter randomly found me on LinkedIn and that was how I heard about this company.\n\nThe quoted salary range from the in house recruiter was something like 175K - 210K.  I guess they liked me so much that their initial offer was for 225K.  The problem is I couldn't shake the nagging feeling the lack of technical coding questions was a red flag.\n\nAnyways I turned down the offer.  Since then this company has had a series A in 2024 and a series B in 2025 for 100 million.  It grew from about 30 employees in 2023 to, according to LinkedIn, over 100 employees today.\n\nAnyways I didn't have a strong point to this story.  It was just an anecdote I thought of as you said you don't do Leetcode interviews and I thought that was a red flag for some company I interviewed at years ago. Obviously I was wrong, lol.",

I never got a formal DevOps education either and learned it all by doing it.    \n  \nA lot of interviews I had see me as Junior because I bomb them, some see me too good for Junior but too bad for senior but they currently don't search the golden middle. And no one really sees me as a senior here, since senior here means people leading and management which I don't really want to do anyways. It's less about how you can contribute and more about how you can talk. IC tracks don't exist here.    \n  \nEvery job I ever had they asked me back tho. The last one they asked me back twice in a year. (3 months/12months) even tho I was technically employed as a Junior back then. I got my coding skills complimented ever since I started the career and had senior compliment or even respect me for the knowledge when I didn't even have 1 YoE.   \n\nNot saying I'm good. I know by a fact that I have a lot to learn, but I have a non-linear way of thinking which is why I see stuff others don't see, but this comes over as stupid.   \n  \nIt's very demoralizing. I gave it up trying to be a senior hence my flair. Mid-level would be nice, but here it's more about fit and polticis rather than impact.

They are often at the dentist or had to go pick the daughter. Their definition of work is booking meetings and literally have someone start some podcast nonsense; sometimes you catch them not able to answer questions because they are not listening during their pointless meetings. These are the people interviewing! I started creating technical videos to showcase work for solutions provide to things the never had or imagine having, then suddenly everyone has an opinion and start throwing jargon which they seem to understand at surface level but not deep enough, as in practice what the claim have done doesn’t work as they think. I show them data, graphics, performance, benchmark examples wasting my time, they don’t even check. Eventually the manager complain the are taking too long to approve PR and there’s no actionable feedback and these losers approve. Zero chances since weeks! Then complain there are too may PR to review that depend on each other. Or, that the experimental library release is way ahead to the actual “latest” version.

Technical skills are only half of what I'm looking for, and you can often judge those through looking at previous work and conversation with experienced techies.

Can they adjust their communication style based on who they are talking to. \n\nSadly, there are very many poor interviewers out there who over-index on all the wrong things.

Millions of desperate people will be trying to survive at the exact same time. When everyone is forced to sell off their homes and liquidate their stocks just to buy groceries, the market will completely crater. Your assets will be worth pennies. Without a middle class to spend discretionary income, the fallout will be absolute. The restaurants, hotels, and local businesses that rely on that money will be wiped out overnight, leaving hollowed-out ghost towns behind.\n\nThen you realize you have no good prospects of pulling yourself and your family out of poverty. People love to say you can just go back to school and get a new job, but that is a fantasy. What bank is going to approve a student loan for someone with absolutely zero income? Even if you somehow find the money, the few trade and college programs tied to the remaining human jobs will be violently cutthroat. And with a massive, desperate population begging for those exact same scraps, corporations will pay rock-bottom starvation wages.\n\nFinally you either starve to death or kill yourself because there’s no hope.",

Our Director told us that if we don’t start using AI they’ll find someone who will. The messaging on his end was terrible but in the interest of keeping my job I kept my mouth shut.\n\nThe issue with this whole AI business is that the tech gets hyped but the benchmarks they run? Nonsense. For example, $20K in tokens and Claude built a non-functioning C compiler that ran Doom slower than dirt. This despite using 37 years of torture test data and a clean slate. Yet it was hyped as this massive achievement. Oh and still relied on GCC and without GCC it didn’t work. So what were they hyping?\n\nDoomsayers are right to be skeptical but the reality is that AI is a good productivity tool. It’s a way to scaffold oft used code. It’s a good way to have a second set of eyes. Rely on what AI can do well and I’ve found that it’s a wonderful tool to use.",

If they keep saying that it will replace all software engineers, that essentially means everyone will use their software which increases their revenue and some more investor will get excited and decide to fund them and then they can individually sell their stakes bit by bit and turn out a multi billionaire from the other end.\n\nWhy is it so important to tell us this?\n\nBecause they know humans in general are stupid. They will fall for this shit and hence start talking about it all over the internet and along with their family and friends. That gives them a free marketing.\n\nWhy don't we let output speak for itself?\n\nThe output currently is not good enough to speak for itself that I will replace all software engineers and all engineers who knows their stuff knows this. And hence it can't currently speak loudly enough that could help raise their valuation exponentially.",

Design, planning, architecture, and translating business needs into actionable deliverables are the job.\n\nWe're seeing a big shake-up right now because most developers are CRUD monkeys. They are at risk, but anyone doing real work understands that AI is far from replacing actual SWEs. The only potential risk here is whether your management agrees with this post. If not, you can either try to educate or plan to leave before shit hits the fan.",

They see AI and people creating more competition, more slop for editors to lose their submissions in. They see people publishing hundreds of books on Amazon written by AI and actually making hundreds of thousands of dollars while they have been slaving on one book for years in a tiny crappy apartment.

          "text": "There's a few aspects to it.\n\nOne is the simple notion that AI productivity gains gives companies a free license to conduct layoffs without fear of public backlash or running afoul of other laws. At least that's how their risk assessment frames things. So it matters not whether these productivity gains are real or imagined; what matters is that they effectively let the company pin the layoffs on something that's hard to push back on as a practical matter. Meanwhile, please don't look at the number of H-1B Visa applicants that same large company is applying to sponsor and please don't note how that number is suspiciously similar to the number of layoffs they just announced because they're now so much more productive.\n\nAnother is the notion that \"increased productivity\" from AI comes with tradeoffs that companies simply don't like to acknowledge: the AI output is lower quality than the previous human outputs, but it's way cheaper and faster so they simply don't care. There's nothing *inherently* wrong with trading risk and quality for speed and cost, but the perverse incentive here is that companies have every reason in the world to not acknowledge the full magnitude and consequences of the tradeoff being made here. They only want to see the \"faster and cheaper\" part, not the \"worse\" part and they certainly don't want to think through the negative externalities that might result from their outputs being lower quality. Depending on what domain this is being applied to, the consequences range from annoying to lethal. Customer support bots being shit is annoying, but a medical device company slapping AI into their products might literally kill people. Do you think that medical device company is going to explicitly acknowledge that their most profitable quarter came knowingly and predictably at the expense of X number of excess deaths and they made that tradeoff deliberately? No way.\n\nFinally, I think some people are simply not skilled enough in the domain to which they're applying AI (or imagining how AI will be applied) that they genuinely don't realize how bad it is. Whenever somebody not skilled in a domain talks about AI replacing people in another domain (or their own domain that they're junior in), I always ask them some version of this: \"Imagine the difference between me using Chat GPT to do your job, versus you using Chat GPT to do your job. If you're imagining an immense difference in output quality and the way the interactions work because of your domain expertise and my lack of it, that's exactly why AI isn't going to take anybody's job any time soon, at least not without a large drop in quality. It's just a tool for people already skilled to use.\"\n\nI'm not sure if this applies outside software development, but there's also the idea that productivity gains only come if you're willing to not invest the time to fully understand the LLM generated code. Yes, LLMs write very plausible code quickly, but if you're not actually taking time to *fully* understand the system and the implications of the code changes from the LLM, when you're actually trading off (besides quality) is simply *knowledge* of how your system works. This is one of those things that doesn't cause any acute damage, but it slowly chips away at quality and scalability and cost and it just generates so much code that nobody actually understands that it sets things up for a massive cascading system failure mode that will absolutely kill you when it triggers.",

          "text": "I’m not going to write out a whole argument because I feel like most devs in this subreddit have already formed their opinions. I sort of feel like you’re asking a loaded question and don’t really want me to explain how AI tools help me.\n\nApologies in advance for any typos. I did spend a while on this comment, but I’m writing on mobile. \n\nI agree that 10x productivity numbers are suspect. But some observations:\n\n- The tools have continued to improve. Even in the last quarter and the last month. If you’re company isn’t paying for access to frontier models, we aren’t really having the same conversation here.\n\n- The “omg your company pays $500-$1000 per dev per month for AI token” posts are super disconnected. That’s a pretty normal productivity tooling budget for most companies even before AI. If you think that number is shocking, then you are either an outlying working at cost-center companies like banking, or you’re disconnected from how much tools normally cost. I guarantee that your company pays overheads like this on its profit centers. So if this number sounds crazy for a dev tool to you, I’m sorry that this is the first time you’re finding out that you are viewed as a cost center. \n\n- With that said, vibe coding still doesn’t work. Debugging, architecting, code structure, test practices, etc have become more important, not less. Now that AI can generate the easy stuff, the hard stuff becomes more of my job. \n\n- Additionally, a lot of my job has been about scaling out AI tools across multiple engineers and dev teams. Really no different than my previous responsibilities as staff engineers. 50 devs using AI tools effectively still generates more productivity than me generating code myself. \n\n- With that said, I *do* generate about 95% of code that I check in. No, it’s not slop. Clear design vision, technical specs, and written down business context really help out. You should’ve had this anyways, right? This was a good practice even before AI. \n\n- I’m not 10x more productive. But maybe 2-3x more productive. Obviously this doesn’t always show up in any metrics that can be measured. If I spend an afternoon fixing 3 user facing bugs instead of 1, obviously that’s not going to show up in any sort of metric that matters. I know all the devs here would flip out of their managers asked them to quantify their productivity, since we all know that measuring the effectiveness of developers is incredibly difficult. So why are my claims about AI tooling being held to that standard? Can you pull numbers which show that your favorite IDE or programming languages makes you x more productive. I will recognize that this is an problem for AI labs: they are investing real money but it’s possible the benefits won’t show up in monetary returns or GDP growth. Obviously those things only *sort of* measure human well being. It’s possible to build genuinely better software that benefits humanity without it reflecting in GDP growth. \n\nAnother important point is that I was an AI skeptic until a few months ago. I predicted we would hit a wall, but frankly we didn’t, so I admitted I was wrong.\n\nI also am not a bot and I don’t financially benefit from AI in any way. I’m skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims about the benefits of AI. But I do believe that the current tools make me 2-3x more productive.",

I don't want to add to the noise but I what I actually don't \"get\" is the unrestrained excitement people have over this. There is, I have to say, from this community, a little bit too much dismissal as well.\n\nI am a very experienced engineer now (nearly 3 decades) and I have helped build an \"AI company\" in the early doors times. This stuff is different, it is very good and it is improving. I think a few of you out there will already be learning that it is as good as it's steering, but as you evolve that, you can get it to stay on track for more and more cycles and the redirections it needs become increasingly minimal.\n\nIt is \\*incredible\\* tech, and I do think we are in trouble. Nobody should be happy, because even if you feel you can wield it like prometheus, many can't (across industries and fields) and could well be swallowed, and they will not sit back and die without an awful lot of turmoil.\n\nFrankly, there are pretty significant fields and professions that are \\*already\\* redundant and just haven't woken up to it.\n\nI also have to say that as the industry has grown in my tenure, the average quality of an engineer has dropped significantly. Sorry to say that, but too many bootcamps and people just looking for a comfortable office job. Those people are dead fucked. When your colleagues are sharing their experiences with this tech, pay careful attention to who is finding success with it (even if they complain). I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid national average wage and I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid minimum wage... and those people do very well with this tech as a partner and assistant and eventually get it doing their bidding largely with nudges and pushes. They know how to architect a codebase, and to avoid confusion in the context and they can iterate and build increasing complexity.\n\nThe people who haven't paid attention, don't care, and it works on their machine.... are the ones saying, \"this shit doesn't work at all, it keeps falling over, introducing stupid bugs, getting caught in a loop....\", etc.\n\nThe reason I have not replaced all the shit code that barely works that has been written by this people... has been a lack of time.\n\nAgain, I suppose I am adding to the noise here, but I hear \"wrongness\" from both sides (imo).\n\nI think it is simple and scary. This stuff is not perfect, but it is very good. We should be very alert to the fact that had somebody told you 10 years ago that your computer would happily work for hours on a coding problem and you would be a little bit excited when it finally got confused... you would call the men in white coats. Yet here we are...\n\nWorry is legitimate.",

Throw away the influencers, the machines and everything.  \n\nTake a minute to think about AI conceptually.  What problem is it trying to solve?  What TRILLION DOLLAR problem is it trying to solve - because that's how much money they are pouring into it.  \n\nThe answer to that question, my distinguished colleagues, is the single most expensive line item in nearly every single company in history - wages.  They are trying to solve for having to pay employees wages.  \n\nNow, given what you know about the average CEO, assume I am right about the above for just a moment - that they are basically trying to solve for paying wages.  Can you think of a single thing that would stop all of these margin-obsessed people from pursuing the ability to stop paying employees?  In a rational market, is there any way the market itself wouldn't punish a company for not trying to incorporate technologies that mean they don't have to pay their biggest line item?  \n\nThe doomsayers, as you call them, are trying to sound the alarm, I would imagine.  It's too late, but they are at least trying.  The tools have gotten better at a predictably geometric rate and are accelerating.  The tools this year are orders of magnitude better than the tools this time last year.  And those tools are being used to further accelerate the pace of development.  The better the tools get, the faster and better the NEXT generation of tools, which produces the faster and better NEXT generation of tools.  It's not going to stop improving.  It's not going to be legislatively slowed.  Better smarter AI is always going to be around the corner for the next little while unless we run up against some theoretical wall of which we are not currently aware.  \n\nI'm not even wading into the defense angle, which is a whole other ball of wax.  It's OBVIOUS most of the world powers think that the next wars will be fought in part by AI and are gearing up accordingly.  \n\nThis IS a transformative technology, and it WILL continue to get better.  The business world smells blood and can't see beyond the next quarter's results so they will continue to barrel towards a world where they don't have to pay knowledge workers anymore.  It's not there yet, but each generation of model is bringing us closer, to the point that it's scary close right now.  \n\nOh yeah, and before you go out and get a job as a welder, check out all the latest innovations in robotics!  You really think they're not gonna slap AI in those things the second they can and hire them out as robo-plumbers?\n\nThe writing is basically on the wall.  We're in for major disruption one way or the other from this technology.  People who don't see it - I'd just point you to the comparative benchmarking of the different generations of models.  It is a verifiable fact that they are getting better, and matching or exceeding human capabilities in a large class of general tasks.  And they're not likely gonna get much worse moving forward.  ",

That's my perspective on the subject. If you don't understand how benchmarks work at this point and can't read a graph plotting model performance on benchmarks, well as I've said here and elsewhere doesn't matter.  I mean of course your subjective experience is more important than data to you personally but how do you just pooh pooh away data and results that measure efficacy of models?  Data is data and there is very little wiggle room to interpret published results.  I'm a data guy. I look at a graph of claude performance on benchmarks the last 3 years and there is nothing but inevitability written on a graph like that.  I've seen the curve in a thousand datasets and I know how it ends. I'm not even a doomer - I'm just saying disruption. I'm actually all in on ai and personally can't wait for AGI. I genuinely believe thr benefits will end up outweighing the negatives even if the ride is bumpy getting there. I'm banking on something like AGI will solve the problem even if humans can't.  If I'm wrong then no big deal. But something tells me you're going to end up thinking about comments like this a lot in the next few years regardless of what you believe right now. Might not end up the way I'm predicting, but if you think its nothing, you're probably not accounting for the fact that AI is getting better in leaps and bounds by measurable metrics.  ",

Obviously the \"Everyone will be replaced\" rhetoric is the most dumb conclusion one can get.\n\nHumans are here to stay. Unless our planet becomes so unbearable to human life that we all die and robots will outlive us, nobody is going to be replaced by anything. We will be served by AI and bots and our lives will be exponentially better. Companies need costumers. To have customers, companies need to employ. That's basic economics and companies know that. If they fire everybody, they are just creating infinite amount of competition, since 1 engineer can now produce alone the equivalent of 10, and those laid off engineers have industry knowledge. To survive they will need to create their own business. Big tech also know that and CEOs will need to be reasonable about how much risk they want to take by firing highly skilled people.\n\nPhilosophically speaking, I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where everything is trusted to AI. We all want a reassurance that there is a human in the loop in case things go south. If money disappears from your bank app, do you seriously want to talk to an AI engineer? No! You want someone who you can put in prison for violating the law. AI can't go to prison right now... its kind of a problem, isn't it?\n\nFinally, coding will become an increasingly scarce skill as younger generations have no incentive to code without AI assistance.  Experienced devs will retire. Just like Cobol engineers are still needed and rare to find, so will be experienced engineers that actually know how to code, instead of prompting.\n\nKeep on coding, and everything will be fine.",

Devs who work at companies that rapidly adopt new tech and have the resources to go balls to the walls in implementing it. These devs are seeing what this tech is capable of when given extensive documentation, tooling, and a very large repository of high quality code.\n\n\n2. Devs who work at smaller companies or non-tech companies that are slow to adopt new tech, have shoddy development practices, poor documentation, and basically just use AI out of the box. They might also be using obsolete AI products like Copilot and old models, or their company may not allow LLM usage at all and the devs cant be bothered to experiment with it outside of work.\n\n\nGroup 2 hasn't seen what Group 1 has. Group 2 thinks AI still churns out error ridden spaghetti code with no understanding of domain or business rules, while Group 1 is in the process of adapting to a new engineering paradigm.\n\n\n> I can't help but think we are being bombarded by a concentrated marketing effort by AI companies employing bots to disseminate their narratives.\n\n\nThe neat thing about this mindset is it makes it impossible for you to consider you could be wrong.

After spending an ample amount of time on Hacker News and now here I feel like the internet skews the perception of how experienced or knowledgeable the average software developer actually is. These sites automatically filter for developers who are passionate (or at least interested) in the field, so when we read through HN we're getting a veritable who's who of some of the best developers in the world.\n\nBut when I look at my career and the developers I've actually worked with there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nJust curious to get some thoughts on that and if my perception matches reality.",

              "text": "The problem is that the primary software development \"skill\" is solving \"math word problems\". This is different from being able to do math or do logic. It's the talent to phrase a problem in words, then convert that problem into math and analyze it in math terms, and then convert that math result back into words so that a normal person can understand the answer. \n\nWe should all be familiar with our school experiences where very few students were good at math word problems, and that was a huge differentiator. Personally, I've run into students who can get a 100% A+ result on a calculus test (back in the 1980s, so not a grade-inflated A+), yet give them a simple physics problem (block on a frictionless inclined plane) but move \"theta\" from the horizontal angle to the vertical angle. I could give hint after hint after hint (that it's a different formula) but they'd still answer \"m\\*g\\*sin(theta)\" and not \"m\\*g\\*cos(theta)\". So you can have a lot of very smart people, but they're smart because their memory is good, not because they can look at a problem and figure it out from scratch.\n\nSo employers are necessarily trying to acquire the top 5% or so of all possible candidates. The competition is so steep that most employers can't afford that level of talent, so they end up with very bright people who can talk the talk because they can remember everything, but they are much slower at actual problem-solving.",

Most are not going to find themselves working at these types of companies.\n\nSame logic applies to the strength of the average developer. Most people are adequate and can do their jobs. You're in the minority if you are a 10x developer who eats, sleeps and breathes programming. I've worked with exactly 2 developers like that in 7 years across 3 different jobs. Most everyone (me included) is just an average developer who gets their work done and contributes, helps out where they can, and then goes home at 5 to do anything but stare at a screen programming.

Is it \"as a partner to stakeholders, they insightfully guide the refinement of the business statement and build the code and automation to suit the goal in a clean and meaningful way?\" then how do you measure that? If it's by the speed and financial success of the project, a personable developer who may not have as much familiarity with data structures as someone who doesn't engage with the ask but memorized a dozen DSA books would be more successful in that metric that no doubt matters more to the business, but we wouldn't call the former a stronger developer in a CS-class vacuum. \n\nIf we were to look at total outcome of career, again define that. Total earnings? The outliers are significantly based on luck, a weak developer who skated in as engineer 150 at Meta would be better than someone strong who chose a series of startups that failed to exit well. Plus, for some money isn't the goal. \n\nIn addition, people lie and talk big game on the internet, I'm sure plenty here have been on panels where someone's HN/LinkedIn presence is full of big talk about creating outcomes but then you put them in a whiteboard session and they can't do a tenth of what they post about. \n\nAll this to say, don't worry much about the internet presence unless you want to leverage that for your career (then back up big talk with skills, please).

In fact, it’s pretty normal. Not everyone wants or desires to be incredible at their job. Most just want to pay the bills, so you get good enough to do just that. So, most devs are going to be mid.\n\nI also think, and this might just be my own issue, that because tech is constantly shifting and expectations for what you as a dev should know is always changing, it makes it hard to keep your skills sharp. By the time you get good at one thing, the industry has changed and you need to start picking up a new skill. Or the definition of what your job entails expands meaning that you always need to be learning more. I think this can cause a kind of burnout or a decrease in interest to try and be at your best. It becomes tiring to try and keep up, so, again, you just settle into being good enough to keep your job.\n\nIt’s really just the nature of work itself, or at least how we currently do work, that causes a settling of mediocrity in almost every field.

Someone who's able to roll up their sleeves and get to work and do a lot of cool things, but largely at the application layer. I know enough about various technologies to configure and use them, but I don't really get into the nitty gritty details unless/until I need to. But I have enough foundational knowledge to do so.\n\nThe thing I CAN talk for hours about in depth is security.\n\nI would imagine most engineers are similar, at least in my experience. The main difference I've seen is how individuals treat their \"craft\".",

You occasionally see underskilled devs who bubble up, but often either not for good reasons or not for very long as their voices don't tend to add value to the broader dialogue in which they're participating.\n\nYou see this in other industries as well. Academia has its own version of this. Arts and entertainment have their own version of this. The medical field has its own version of this, and so on.\n\n> there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nDespite my remarks above, I'd still hesitate to make this extrapolation - it's akin to mistaking the mean for the median. I've worked and liaised with various orgs in various verticals. My observation has been that the talent distribution across an org typically seems to be at least approximately normal/bell-curved, with the majority of that org's devs in their own mid-level range (regardless of title or designation), but the bounds of that curve can vary significantly between orgs. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels could be senior or even principal engineers if they just went elsewhere. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels were essentially budding juniors who picked up enough to teach even newer juniors (but budding nonetheless, no slight intended).\n\nCommunication skill tends to vary along the same axis, but \"poor\" communication skill can mean different things when dealing with software engineers. Do they have a generally poor grasp of language itself (i.e., do they write with poor punctuation, spelling, broken SMS-style syntax)? If not, do they have the insight to translate literal code decisions to technical requirements? If so, do they have the insight to translate technical requirements to business requirements? If so, can they articulate those requirements in precision language that enables genuinely compelling dialogue with stakeholders?\n\nMy point being, tailor your expectations not to the market at large, but to the context into which you're sunk. Most of the engineers in that context are going to reflect its average, which may or may not be an objectively low bar to meet.",

Once again, they made very \"you're not good at thinking logically are you?\" type mistakes with case logic.\n\nJust this year, a senior DEV sent some code down and it caused some issues on production. They couldn't figure out an until loop, so they switched it to a FOR NEXT loop and set it to loop 1000 times.\n\nThe problem is, that loop cycles millions of times in certain instances, so you'd really want to verify the loop count, then go, if that's what you're going to do.\n\nThe senior DEV instead set the loop to 10 million times and now it takes 3 minutes to run every time it runs.\n\n  \nAnother time, a guy who has been developing longer than I've been alive, figured out copy/paste in notepad++ and instead of utilizing a function or subroutine, copy pasted the same code 200-300 times in a row. Now the process is 100k line long. When I explained to him to how modulate the code and centralize the business logic, he instead added GO to the next block of copied code, so after each block processes it goes to the next.

Your average developer isn't capable of solving even moderately complex problems. \n\nNow, among those are are employable, they produce sloppy, buggy code... But they produce.\n\nI would estimate about 60-70% of employable devs can only solve problems brute force and do not understand a thing about \"design\" or \"architecture\" regardless of their tenure. There are many problems that are well beyond them. They mostly parrot technical opinions previous team leads have admonished them for.\n\nProbably about 25% are capable and can stumble through all but the hardest problems. They have learned to avoid the worst pitfalls through being burned. They do not actively hone their craft, but they do learn from experience. So, they can solve most problems with \"good enough\" solutions. The hardest problems are still beyond them and they are only sometimes capable of innovating new ideas and thinking through them thoroughly. \n\nAbout 10% are capable. They can move into any field and figure out how to be productive. They actively read and educate themselves, so they know lots about things even if they've never directly experienced them. They can solve just about any problem, but not always optimally. The only exception might be highly scientific problems that require deep training with specific knowledge. They can lead, they can mentor, they can guard dog code bases, projects, business problems. These are your team leads. \n\nAbout 5% are savants. They dream up solutions others cannot. They are truly stimulated by hard problems. They have very high standards. They are constantly educating themselves even as a hobby. They have side projects to play with new tech they've discovered. Their friends and them mostly talk about tech and science. They can do things like imagine a new container orchestration mechanism with a custom kernel designed to achieve specific guarantees. They talk about designing hardware systems with variable baud rates for some arcane reason. They know what the downstream effects of storing principals in a token vs a database and what the trade offs are. They know how to distribute processing across 15000 different compute resources and calculate exactly when it will be done processing. \n\nThese are your principal engineers. You won't get to work with them much. Companies usually identify them early and put them on high priority, critical problems.

I know that everybody has talked about this already and that’s not my point.\n\nMy point is, since we’re not the ones actually doing the dirty work, it gets much easier to create more microservices than you have users, or adding 10 layers of abstraction to anything.\n\nI think that, for me, at least, I have to be careful not to become that astronaut architect, designing that “perfect” white marble tower",

          "text": "The problem with complexity, as I see it, is that we focus it on the code alone in a vacuum.\n\nLet's start first with what I claim is true: \n\n* Developers will solve problems as complex as they can and no more. If a problem seems too complex/hard to solve developers will make software that over simplifies or scopes to a simpler subset of the problem. \n* Developers will create solutions as complicated as they can handle. If a problem is easy they'll take on extra tech debt, over engineer it, or use ridiculous platform tools (e.g. electron) to make it.\n   * Note that most of these solutions make it easier to develop, or at least the developer will think that's the case. Such as using a myriad of npm deps for every trivial thing. \n* We can decrease apparent complexity with tools/frameworks/tests/etc which handle and solve that complexity for us (it converts the complex problem to a simpler one, even if it is harder!). We should note this isn't guaranteed to decrease dev time, and may even increase it, but the perception is generally of it making things faster. LLMs are a tool that reduce a lot of the complexity in making ambiguous specs into code, though it needs the other to be clear and has other limitations. \n* We can increase complexity by accruing tech debt, making dogmatic decisions (e.g. I want to make a very fast grep tool using only pure functional code, or I'll rewrite my blog host entirely in Rust), increasing the scope of the task, tackling more ambiguity directly (ie started l software that can do everything), it reframing the problem. \n* Complexity compounds. If I take modules foo and bar and use them together, the solution is going to be far more complex that either module alone. \n \nFrom this we can reach some interesting conclusions. Fire example: as we add more modules/features to our software, all the previous code needs to become simpler so that our software stays at the right limit of complexity. You can't do this preventively because we need the same level of complexity, so you'll end up with an el over-engineered solution that doesn't solve the problem that comes up. Similarly if you can't reduce the complexity of existing software it'll be impossible to add new features/modules as the complexity will grow to large and old features will have to be dropped. \n\nSimilarly it's easy for complexity to get out of hand. Because the complexity LLMs are hiding is the complexity of managing complexity. You still have to do it, but it's easy to be blindsided if you don't understand how to best use the tool. LLMs are this tool that seems like it could do anything, but many times there's a better tool already.\n\nNow this seems to keep us doomed, because any progress we do to improve our software will simply result in us becoming lazier (the wrong way) until the problem gets as hard, it even harder than before.\n\nSo what to do? Do we just force ourselves to code with old limitations? (Keep RAM usage to 10MB max, and binary system under 2MB?) I mean in some contexts that can totally work, but what about when we want to explore and be creative? Those limitations are against, but once we're done we can't just rewrite. I guess that's another solution, restart again, lose all progress and hope you get somewhere interesting, but even with hindsight it almost never works. Another solution is to go as fast as possible and manage tech debt with speed as the target, and that works well enough (though paradoxically it generally ends up being but the fastest possible, but it is consistently fast). But this is an issue with LLMs because it becomes really hard to manage and track tech debt if you misuse LLMs, and not only so we but know a lot about how to best use them, but it's very easy to misuse them and many times they push you towards the misuse, instead of solving and fixing things effectively. Thing is that the focus on speed misguides us on how to use LLMs and it easily leads to excessive complexity which means the program will start to crash and have issues until we drop features, abilities or slow down, none of what we want to do. \n\nSo this leads me to my final alternative. I reframe the problem as one of having to consider the many contexts in which the code exists. And this includes other developers. So when I write code I think of all the different reasons a programmer would interact with it, also ask the different things they may choose to do, and not only that I think of the different ways a programmer can think: what if they're more junior? What if they're not as familiar with the paradigm I use? What if their area of expertise is different (and once in but even familiar with), what if the strategy I used to approach the problem is one that they don't like? What if they're neurodivergent? What if they're an SRE, or a UX engineer who has to deal with my code? What if they're someone who knows the language conventions from 10 years in the future but not the ones now (that would be seen as bad habits by then)? And then I do the same for the clients.\n\nThe complexity of dealing with different human minds very quickly becomes overwhelming and it forces me to make the simplest, most straightforward code possible, because that's the limit of complexity at that point. It gets messy, because other coders will not use that strategy and will not understand the reason for the simplicity, making the code complex again either way, but the beauty of this is that I force myself to account for that too.\n\nAnd that has been leading more on how I use LLMs. I find that they are really good at parroting how other people would look at my code. I just need the stimulation of another viewpoint to help me see what I normally don't think like. And it works, a few passes on documentation, tests that consider edge cases I haven't, guidance on how to make the code guide the reader towards understanding better. I get to be lazier on the chores that take time, which lets me move faster, but still keeping my code simple enough.",

Sometimes someone's spreadsheet solutions stick around far longer than they should.\n\nWith all the debate around vibe coding, I’m starting to think EVERYONE is right, but only in context. The arguments talk past each other because we don’t have precise language for why each position makes sense in different situations.

The definition of disposable has expanded. \n\nAnd just like one off scripts and proof of concept code that shouldn't, that code will inevitably leak into systems that were meant to be clean, stable, and engineered.\n\nSo the real question isn’t whether vibe code belongs—it’s when it’s acceptable to plan for it, and how to with the trade-offs. \n\nWhen is it reasonable for the business to intentionally rely on an Excel-level (or vibe-coded) solution? What differentiates:\n“Use Excel, then import the data” from “This no longer fits in Excel”?\n\nThose boundaries used to be fuzzy even with spreadsheets and macros. They’re fuzzier now with AI-generated scripts (slop) that feel oddly powerful but remain fragile and disposable. \n\nI shake my head at a critical business process running on Excel… while admitting it’s been “working” for years.\n\nOne critical thing though: a challenging problem with Excel was macros and security... and now vibe code.",

In the past, the friction of writing a new microservice or adding yet another abstraction layer provided a natural 'laziness filter' -- if it was too much work, you'd find a simpler way. Now that the work of 'writing' is subsidized, we have to develop a much stronger internal 'simplicity muscle.'\n\n  \nI find that the best way to combat this is to strictly enforce a 'value-first' architecture. If a new service or abstraction doesn't directly solve a known scalability wall or a massive developer experience friction, it doesn't get built. We should be 'lazy' about maintenance, not just 'lazy' about typing. A simpler system with fewer moving parts is the ultimate gift to your future self who has to debug it at 3 AM.",

      "text": "I've been writing about the Agile certification industry and what actually ships software, and the most common response I get isn't disagreement. It's some version of \"I agree with all of this but I can't say any of it at work. I need this job.\"\n\nFigured I'd write about that part because it's actually the hardest part. Seeing the dysfunction is easy. Changing it without torching your career is the real skill.\n\nI once nearly got put on a performance plan for suggesting we cut a meeting that everyone on the team privately agreed was useless. The problem wasn't that I was wrong. The problem was I said it in a retro with the person who created the meeting sitting right there. That was a lesson I only needed to learn once.\n\nThe thing that actually works is boring. You measure before you say anything. I spent two sprints tracking every meeting. Duration, number of attendees, decisions made. Put it in a spreadsheet. No opinions, no editorializing, just hours and outcomes. Then I showed it to my manager. Same guy who shut me down three months earlier when I told him sprint planning was theater. He looked at the spreadsheet and said \"huh, we should probably fix this.\" Same message. The spreadsheet didn't threaten his authority. My opinion did.\n\nThe other thing is you never bring it up cold in a group setting. You find one person who agrees with you first. Everyone knows who that person is. It's whoever checks slack during sprint review. You show them the data privately. Now it's two people with a spreadsheet instead of one person with a complaint. At one company I spent three weeks having quiet conversations with senior engineers before I raised anything formally. By the time I brought it up in a team lead meeting, four people in the room already agreed. The conversation wasn't \"Greg thinks standups are broken.\" It was \"several of us have been looking at the data.\" Completely different dynamic.\n\nThe framing matters too. \"Let's eliminate daily standups\" triggers every immune response the org has. \"What if we tried async updates for two sprints and measured deployment frequency before and after\" triggers almost nothing. It's temporary. It's measurable. Nobody has to admit they were wrong. I've used this exact approach to kill sprint planning at one shop, cut standups to twice a week at another, and replace retros with monthly health surveys at a third. The experiment always \"worked\" well enough that nobody wanted to go back. But the entry point was never \"this is broken.\" It was always \"let's try something for two weeks.\"\n\nAnd you have to translate. Engineers talk about efficiency. Your manager cares about delivery risk. The VP cares about cost. \"We spend 22 hours per sprint in meetings\" works on your peers. \"Deploy frequency dropped 30% since we added the third weekly sync\" works on your manager. \"Roughly $280,000 in annual salary going to ceremonies\" works on the executive. Same problem. Three different languages. Most engineers speak engineer to everyone and then wonder why nothing changes.\n\nOne more thing that took me years to learn. If you've tried everything, the data, the allies, the experiments, the right language, and the answer is still no, that's information about the company, not about you. At that point you either accept it or start looking. Both are fine. What isn't fine is staying and resenting it for three years while your work suffers. I've been that person too and it's not worth it.\n\nCurious if others have navigated this. Especially interested in what worked at larger companies where the process has more institutional momentum behind it.",

While that's my top team, I've also been on many huge full site redesign teams. \n \nSecond best was 50+ people divided into many teams for a full on-shoring with a multi-stage site replatform. At the time it was loosely based on the Spotify team and agility models. \n \nQuickly got rid of the off-shore companies. We devoured the 2 year backlog those companies had built up in 4 months. Used a strangler pattern to move logical chunks of functionality. It was a well oiled machine with great velocity without having to work any long hours. Ended up being one of my longest contract give spanning many years.\n \nThat team was so good, even though we haven't worked together in years and the company has long since been acquired over and over into oblivion we still have big happy hours annually. \n \nWhat worked was again: No bad apples. No A-holes. No Architects that aren't part of the implementation teams. Embracing that failure is a learning opportunity. Having management that actually understands technology and agility. We're talking people on a first name basis with Martin Fowler. \n \nI do think a lot of big corporations try to use agility as a magic bullet in some transformation process they want to stake their name to for a fat bonus. Bring in some big national consulting companies that are better at booking executive golf trips than they are at being thought leaders.

There are some utterly broken processes and yet it took me years to figure out why everyone hates me for trying my best to fix them! \n\nA few things I've also learned:\n\n1. NEVER bring anything up cold. Everyone's first instinct is to always resist change. You have to bring up the issue with people 1:1 first, or spend a few standups circling the problem (but not addressing it yet). You need to plant the seed first and give it some time to grow.\n\n2. One of the most effective ways to make people realize a problem isn't by pointing it out to them, but by raising it as a question to them. Instead of telling someone that their solution won't work because of X, ask them instead \"how do we handle it if we encounter X scenario?\"\n\n3. Never frame anything as anyone's fault (even if it is) if you need their buy-in to change things. Find something, anything else to absorb the blame from them. Blame the process. Say it was a team decision. Claim that it wasn't possible to predict such a thing in advance. You will get less resistance from them when they don't feel they have to defend their decisions.\n\n4. Make you teammates feel supported and/or respected. You'll be able to suggest and implement changes much faster if they trust you.",

          "text": "Definitely take feedback from what others are saying, but here's my personal experience.\n\n\nSome of the smartest software engineers I know deeply care about technology and software.They take pride in writing good code and adopting latest technology. Company leadership on the other hand doesn't care about it. They need to solve business problems and deliver features/revenue. A manager/lead job is to quite literally be a bridge in between. You have to figure out how to motivate some of the smartest people you know to solve the problem the company cares about.\n\n\nWhat you're describing is pretty much a byproduct of this friction. It shows up differently in different companies. Some have strong processes, others have strong engineering culture. Sometimes your leadership can let some red tape slide, other times they won't. Sometimes the team you lead cares about the processes other times they're least bothered. Your job is the coach the team and manage up so these two sides of the coin gel together to produce results.",

If you close one as \"I'm not doing this,\" at most places, at least some of the time, someone will come to you and tell you to open it back up and pretend you're going to do it. If you explain that you're not going to do it, they're fine with this, they just want the appearance that it's \"being worked on.\" So soon you accumulate a bunch of tickets that don't reflect reality. Or else you try to reassign work that doesn't belong to you, and it comes back along with someone telling you that it's politically sensitive and you just need to keep it in your queue for now.\n\nNow multiply this across every tool in the org that a SWE deals with on a daily basis. You end up with a bunch of noise, and since you can't rely on the tools to tell you what actually needs doing vs. what merely needs to be maintained as the appearance of work that will be done, you start to ignore updating the real work because it's too much effort to separate it from the fake work.\n\nThe place I worked where this was not allowed, it was very transparent what everyone was doing at all times. You could just look at the issue tracker and see someone's actual work queue with the prioritizations. We didn't bother making predictions more than a week or two out because the org had found that the error bars were so large on those plans that it wasn't worth wasting time on, so we just put things in order instead.\n\nAlso, everything was tracked in the issue tracker. If you're working on something, then it's documented in a ticket, even if it's not code-related. Status reports pretty much went away because your status was always available for anyone that wanted to look. Doing a weekly sync was simply pulling up everyone's queue to see what their next couple of weeks looked like, and no one had to do any prep for it except scan their tickets to make sure everything was up to date.",

They believe they are just getting people to be accountable to their commitments, but in reality, they are the link between individual contributors and the decision makers.

Even when you ask to work on some other project they will drag their feet and hope you just forget about your request.\n\nThis ends up with a company that has lots of followers who are happy to just do what they are told.  The people that stand out as \"leaders\" get promoted because they drank the company cool-aid and mirror what current managers do.  Everybody else ends up leaving the company for better opportunity.",

Part of that can look like the ”human reminder system” you mention for sure (mine do this from time to time), but generally it’s more about managing customer expectations and being willing to tell people “no” on behalf of the dev team.",

If you are the one holding context, chasing updates, and connecting dots across Slack threads, then you are the single point of failure for information flow. That does not scale and it burns you out.\n\nWhat actually fixed this for me was making the team own the status, not me. A few specific things that worked:\n\n1. Standups became async. Everyone posts blockers and progress in a channel by 10am. If someone does not post, the team notices before I do. Peer accountability is way more effective than manager reminders.\n\n2. PRs got a 24-hour SLA. Not enforced by me, enforced by the team agreement. If a PR sat for more than a day without review, it became the top priority for the next available person. We tracked it for two weeks and review times dropped by 60%.\n\n3. I stopped being the router for information. If two engineers needed to coordinate, I would connect them directly instead of relaying messages. Took about a month for people to default to talking to each other first.\n\nThe underlying issue is usually that the team treats coordination as the manager's job instead of everyone's job. Changing that expectation is harder than any tooling change, but it is the actual fix.",

Because of that, I let my manager know that if she noticed any hint of a drop in my performance, I would like to know so there was absolutely no chance of me getting fired.\n\nA bit of background for my manager and myself. She gave me a bad performance review last time round(it was totally fair, I wasn't performing due to health reasons and being very down mentally) and then she gave me goals to complete. I crushed all the goals, she said that I was doing a great job and that it was a night and day difference in how I was performing. \n\nTwo weeks ago we had a 1:1 and I asked her about her expectations for a promotion and she was guiding me on how to frame my performance review to be more likely to get it.\n\nToday, I was let go. As it happens I was about to hand in my notice and it worked out perfectly. \n\nThe reason I received was that I didn't have as many PRs as the next person, I'm the lowest in that regard and in points completed. We have a minimum rate of 1 point per ticket so people can just spam 1 pointer tickets that take no time so their points are inflated while mine are mostly bigger tickets where 3 points require work. I also got let go for behavior reasons yet she didn't provide a single concrete example.\n\nThe HR guy was sympathetic and he said that my manager dropped the ball and that I should have had chances to catch this. They're at least paying the full notice period and as it happens, my pay ends one day before I start the new job, so I have a few months of paid holiday!\n\nIf I didn't have the next job lined up I would be completely screwed. Word around the office is that the company is cutting headcount and I think this was a case of \"if you beat the data hard enough, it'll tell you what you want to hear\". \n\nThoughts? \n\nThis isn't in the US btw.",

The problem is that companies rarely offer Visa and if they do, it's usually low pay because the people who go to work for them are very likely just looking for a job to keep the counter going to get citizenship.\n\nThe way the Visa works here is that as long as you have a sponsor, you are ok to stay in the country. The previous sponsor lets immigration know that you are ending the employment with them and after a bit they give you notice that you need to find another sponsor within a certain amount of time or you're out.",

They are often repetitive, superficial, exaggerated, baseless etc. We combat it by removing such posts under Rule #9, which is fine\n\nHowever, it's still very easy to find multiple threads repeating the exact same discussion. One common suggestion is to limit LLM related posts to a megathread. In my opinion megathreads rarely work outside of big events. Doing so would practically mean no more LLM discussion allowed\n\nI do believe LLM discussion is, at the very least, a reality. It's not wise to be a luddite about it. There's real engineering in this field, there are real challenges to experienceddevs and therefore completely banning it isn't an option \n\nTLDR: What you would think if LLM related posts were only allowed on some days? Let's say Tuesday and Thursday. This simultaneously helps with the spam, but also doesn't completely kill the discussion like a megathread",

This tends to be fairly technology agnostic, and a lot of that advice would have been applicable 20 years ago, and will hopefully still be 20 years from now.\n\nCertainly LLMs disrupt how we interact with other colleagues and process changes so it can't just be ignored, but I'd really love to keep it in the super abstract.\n\nWith that said, there are a lot of the same conversations being had on repeat. I for one wouldn't mind limiting the number of posts (if it's easiest to have days of the week, then sure). I do think there is a difference between \"This is how I use it, and wow!\" vs \"I have a junior that relies on AI and I'm concerned in their ability to grow as a developer\".",

I think there could be LLM discussions relevant for this subreddit, but they're not happening. Instead, it's a daily \"I have a unique take about why you're wrong about LLMs\" post that just repeats the same points the last one of these made and is probably itself written by an LLM. \n\n\nI'd actually be interested in, say, somebody with 20 years of experience doing an in-depth comparison of the strength of different models, or something like that. Something valuable and with at least a modicum of evidence, rather than hot takes about why everybody is wrong, filled with em-dashes and it \"it's not just..., it's...\" ",

But there is so much bait to make horrible decisions during this AI adoption cycle which is basically blasting marketing into their heads that they should have rando employees vibe code apps for production. The outcome will be mostly no measurable benefit, while incurring massive security and privacy risks and diverting engineering resources.\n\nIt's their decision to make, so I'm rolling with it, plus it does present some interesting/fun engineering problems to solve, but it's really making me realize how rare it is for senior leadership to not be idiots, and to realize how so much of the recent former status quo was niceties, lip service, and pseudo respect for engineering, all of which evaporates when they see a vibe coded mvp and basically admit they only pretended to understand the importance of maintainability, simplicity, and security because the experts wouldn't stfu about it.\n\nIt really seems like leadership handling this paradigm shift gracefully is going to be an absolute rarity.\n\nEdit: does this sub have mods anymore?

In other words, in their position, I'd do the same thing, because it's rationale.\n\nSecond, it seems like narrative really bothers you, but in many organizations, doing stuff like pay lip service is the silent power best left unsaid. For companies, the signal is alignment with the greater goals, and that's what all this language and other stuff is designed to do.\n\nSo do you believe senior leadership are idiots? Because they are playing a different game than you, with different values than your own, and the results are going to mean compromising your technical values.

      "text": "I scroll through here and it's absolutely not lost on me how shitty the job market is, how ridiculous development work has become at a lot of places and the disillusionment it's all causing in people. I have worked at such places and gone through such disillusionment before. But I'm pleased to say I'm quite enjoying things at my current job. I'm not here to gloat. I just thought it might be nice to share something positive.\n\nWe are a pretty small scale-up that's working towards profitability. There's a lot to do and it gets a bit chaotic, but communication is generally no-nonsense and travels fast. It's a fast-paced work environment so it kind of has to be that way.\n\nI work in a platform team with just one other guy. We have two development teams and every one (except one or two) is friendly, talented and dependable. If I need something, I feel comfortable just reaching out to them directly.\n\nI don't feel people are obstructed from innovating and bringing new ideas to the table. For example, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement with the branching strategy that teams were using. It was kind of like a half-baked GitFlow. There was general agreement that it was painful to keep branches organised and it was slowing down our release cadence. So I organised a workshop on trunk-based development and it was a big success. There were lots of good questions, great conversations were had and proper action items were taken to migrate all of our branches to it.\n\nThere is no on-call and work-life balance is great. Everything just runs pretty smoothly in Kubernetes or on Lambda functions. Incidents have happened but they are few and far between. The boss has said that we just don't have enough people to have a fair on-call rotation, so we simply accept the risk that comes with that.\n\nRecently there's been gentle encouragement from both leads and some engineers themselves for people to be less remote. That doesn't necessarily mean being in the office more (some of our engineers work remotely in other countries), but it does mean talking to each other, putting heads together to solve problems, knowledge sharing and interactive sessions where needed. So far I feel we've been very good at keeping these concise without them descending into spiralling soul-crushing meetings. It's very satisfying and I see it creating a noticeable bond. I've observed that it's getting more common for us to finish our office day (usually Thursday) with drinks together. Even some of our more reserved devs seem more willing to come in and join in later for a drink and a nice chat.\n\nIt's not all rose-tinted. The company are very stingy about hiring people and will only do so if they absolutely have to. There have been numerous painful lay-offs in the last few years that have left a very bitter taste in people's mouths. The AI adoption is very real across the company and it's led to some horrible results on our website which have had to be scaled back. But the perfect place doesn't exist of course. And in regards to AI, there is definitely agreement from us in engineering that it needs to be used as a tool and we really have to be mindful of its potential misuse.\n\nThat's it! Hope it gives you some semblance of positivity in these trying times. If anyone else has some recent success stories, feel free to share.",

Not that I'm convinced it's transformative so far, but I'm more concerned about management deciding it is and making changes based on that.\n\nI work at a consultancy and juggle anywhere from 3 to 20 projects at a time. The CEO likes to sell jobs with little pre planning, so deadlines are often short with extremely fuzzy guidelines. I have an entire new system integration due in a little over a month, but I still don't have the documentation or credentials to get started ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIt's a pretty shitty job though, so I'm considering looking anyway. Thankfully the pay isn't bad and the benefits are mid. Short list of more recent bullshit issues:\n\n* My vacation this year is contingent on the aforementioned project being done in time, despite not having any of the resources I need to complete it.\n\n* To have PTO approved, I need to provide a personal emergency contact and their phone number so they can be called if I'm unreachable, and the specific location of where I'm going.\n\n* We're considered on-call 24/7. If a client needs me to work at 8 pm on Friday and lets me know at 4 pm, I'm expected to do it without compensation. This includes PTO and holidays.\n\n* The majority of my co-workers are MAGA, so almost every stand up is political or conspiratorial after any major event.\n\n* I have to track every minute of work in an Excel sheet that gets sent to the CEO at the end of the month because he refuses to pay for time tracking software.\n\n* Code needs to be written how our CEO does (i.e, from the earlier 2000s), so he can work on it as well. He doesn't use an IDE or understand package managers if that helps you understand how bad it may be. Luckily, for a lot of projects I can get away with writing it in a more modern way.",

Ironically not even talking about AI.  I chose .NET over Java, and whenever I try to go back to working with Java, it feels like the language is constantly on the backfoot trying to catch up on features that other languages implemented.  \n\nAnd then when I hear someone say \"we're using AI because the code would be too verbose...\" that just does not sound like good reasoning at all.  It's like refusing to move off of objective C because you have a magic button that can automatically generate objective C code, when that magic button could produce that code in swift, .NET,  etc.  And if it is too verbose to write, what does that say about the maintenance outlook?",

It's so boring and I have to do a ton of context switching almost every day which takes it's toll.\n\nTo me it's a new language and a platform (or somewhat new because last time I used it was back in school), but .NET is just so well designed for everything enterprise that I have this internal loathing for it that I can't explain. Everything in me tells me it's a great platform with tons of features etc. but it's just so verbose and everyone around me is a Microsoft fanboy, thinking you need a SQL server and Azure cloud and VIsual Studio with a Windows machine to develop everything.. Ugh. Nobody has even looked outside MS technology for options.\n\nSorry, bit of a rant.

It's a lot of fun, we go bar-crawling after work, we get to have big-picture conversations together that are harder to do over zoom and slack.\n\nThe company pays for LLM tools and the devs use them as they see fit. And they do get plenty of use. Nobody really expects them to take the place of a seasoned developer but the hiring bar for juniors is definitely being raised. That said, even before ChatGPT got released, we were _already_ determined to rise the hiring bar across the board. It takes time and personal attention to recognize talent at the interview stage; no one has ever found a quick-and-easy way to do this. A bad hire is an incredibly expensive mistake.\n\nOverall I like my job a lot. I'm clinging to it like a life raft!",

You (probably) need to implement \"undo\" for that action, support multiple file formats for input and output, program checks for something every 2 weeks? oh, add an option that customizes that at settings/preferences...and omg settings are strangely elusive to implement. Dark theme, admin-privileges, draggable UI panes, auto-updates, localization, imperial vs metric system presentation options. There seems to be no end to how thorough a piece of software can get. \n\nI'm my own boss, btw, so, I don't have any of that middle management breathing down my neck problem, for better and for worse. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to voice my appreciation for this craft.

Looking at it another way - if someone introduced a high availability architecture with scalability from the get go and it scales incorrectly with the problems of today then not only is the program bad and costly when load isn’t there, it may actively make fixing things worse.\n\nIn the end, we’re all making decisions without full context - no one has a crystal ball that tells them if a project will succeed and hindsight is easy because it means we’re able to make decisions with more context.\n\nThe question may be “what is the role of the senior+ engineer outside of immediate firefighting?”\n\nI think the answers are:\n\n* Put tools in place (tests, CI, observability, reviews, etc.) to ensure that the fix is applied consistently and has the same effects over time.\n* Convince the culture to build things with more reliability - get things hooked up to observability and get the right notifications firing\n\nBasically - now that the fire has been put out or at least put into a manageable state, how do we implement processes technical or otherwise to stop firefighting?\n\nNot every manager or culture will be receptive to approaching things like this but in those cases it’s best to vote with your feet. There are good engineering cultures in the world and it’s possible the one you’re in won’t let you make the necessary changes to get out of firefighting due to any number of reasons - The software isn’t perceived to be critical to the success of the business, leadership doesn’t value engineering, the rate of business to keep the company alive requires a pace of development that requires more/better people and the investment budget isn’t there, etc.",

That's not a compliment, even though it feels like one when they say \"you're the only one who can do this.\" That sentence is a trap dressed up as praise.\n\nThe \"team player\" question—I think you already know this but haven't said it out loud: \"team player\" in most orgs means \"person who absorbs costs that should be distributed.\" You're not refusing to be a team player by pushing back. The team is refusing to be a team by making one person the backstop for every architectural shortcut.\n\nThe real question isn't \"how do I say no,\" it's \"what am I getting for saying yes.\" Because right now the answer is: more yes. If the fixing led somewhere—a principal title, an architecture role, a mandate to actually prevent this stuff—that's a different calculation. If it's just an infinite loop of fires, you're not building a career, you're maintaining someone else's.\n\nStart making the cost visible. Write the postmortems that trace the fire back to the decision that started it. Make the pattern legible to people above you. That sometimes works. Sometimes it just makes you \"the person who complains.\" I wish I could tell you which one it'll be.",

Selling electrons.  Capital expenditure vs. revenue, cost of production of each unit vs. revenue for each sale.  Google/Yahoo did similar for the value of \"the internet\".\n\nSo modest investments from venture capital turned into huge revenues, which skyrocketed the valuations.  That let the janitor with 100 pre-any-splits shares of Apple/MS/etc. be really rich because of that.\n\nBut that just won't happen anymore, outside some completely new industry that nobody else sees coming.\n\nNot only are things like ideas and intellectual property easier to value, now (within several orders of magnitude, at least), but the investment class is careful to keep much more of the profit for themselves.\n\nBasically, unless you literally got a stake in the company *before* any sort of VC got involved, the stock options are almost certainly designed to leave your payout pretty modest.  If you're very, very early in the company (in the first 10 or 100 employees) and it does very, very well, then you might get a can-buy-a-house-in-Silicon-Valley chunk of change.\n\nStock options at a company with good management and a good idea can yield you a very nice, comfortable bonus.  It's not going to bump you up a social class.  Never take stock option in lieu of decent pay.",

          "text": "Never trust anyone that makes specific assertions about payouts for equity comp in a private company.\n\nThey are either financially incompetent or dishonest. Unless they are currently finalizing a deal to sell, they can't know. And even then, deals fall through all of the time, so it would STILL be reckless to assert a number even if they had the term sheet in front of them.\n\nThey do not know what company will buy them, what their own financials will be then, what the macro environment will be then, what multiples their kind of business will get at sale or how their business will be slotted into that range, how much leverage they will have in the negotiation, how much flexibility the buyer will have, how long in the future that will be and how much dilution there will have been by then from additional fundraising in funding environments that they can't predict. They can't know basically anything, really. \n\nThat said:\n\nThe math is that you are either paid in rsus (stock) or options (the right to buy stock at a specific price).\n\nThe company overall has a number of shares it is divided into overall, some valuation, and a number of shares you are given.\n\nIf you are given shares rather than options, the present value is the price of the company times the percentage of the company you own, aka your shares over total shares.\n\nIf you are given options their value is far more complicated (usually the exercise price is the current value when you're given them so naively they're worth $0 [convenient for taxes]), but assume they're worth somewhere between a quarter and a half of the share value above. That is roughly what a financial model would say. No normal financial model would say they are worth more than half a share. Anyone who tells you otherwise is incompetent or lying. That is a common lie, pretending options are worth 1:1 with shares. There are tax advantages, but they have massive downside risk that shares don't have because they are worth $0 if the company doesn't grow.\n\nThat is the present value of the equity, which is the only thing you can know at all, and even still that is not super real because you can't sell the shares. They are illiquid. Even in a sale there are liquidation preferences and people in front of you in line might eat before you can get fed.\n\nThat said, if you really believe in the specific team and their company, and you have a decent slice as calculated above, where they have a real chance at winning a big market, the future value can be extreme and worth betting on.\n\nGenerally though, someone asserting a particular exit value when communicating about comp is either not sophisticated enough to be that guy, or thinks their team is stupid, and in either case they probably won't be the winner.\n\nIn terms of future value, basically the future value of the business is a multiple of how much money the company holds plus how much money people believe it will make over time, with the strongest evidence being how much money it currently makes, and with a very strong preference to making money sooner. If you have a clear path to the company making a lot more money than it currently does, probably it will be worth more. Although, sometimes the market is wrong about predicting how much money a company will make in the future in both directions, or the market is just not buying. So even that's hard for a full time professional investor to model to turn it into predictions about share price in the future, even if they somehow knew how much money it will make.\n\nBut yeah, evaluate the equity at the last round value, or shift it up by the amount they've grown since they last raised, maybe some leeway if growth accelerated and product market fit really seems obvious now and wasn't before. Do not value it based on some absurd claim about a specific future value. The investors in the VC that bought in aren't dumb. They are better at valuing the business than you. And they shouldn't get a better price than employees. So what they pay is what you should consider yourself to be paying, as in that's the value of that comp.\n\nSource: I have gone through acquisition from joining a small startup and have fought for, defined, and then educated people about the employee equity program at a decently large company.",

Did he mention that too? :) Company might do not well in the future, gets forced to sell and only ones with the special class stock might get a payout (founders, investors) and none for employees.\n\nCalculation is simple: you get stock options. ISO likely but NSO too. Companies does external valuation called 409A and sets the FMV (fair market value). It's \"external\" because company isn't public yet. Initial FMV is the strike price (the price you pay to buy the stock). Once a company goes IPO, you can sell your options after 6 month. Your gain is sell price - strike price.\n\nRemember that it's all \"high risk, high gain\".\n\nLet's just say company does make $100M ARR, and, for the sake of simplicity, the valuation is 10x of that so $1B. Also lets assume you join at $1B valuation and your grant is stock option that's worth $100k.\n\nIn order for that $100k to go $1M, you need company to grow 11x. 100k\\*11 (appreciated) - 100k (strike price) = 1M.\n\nWould it trivial for $1B company to grow $11B in N years? Depends. I'd say it's pretty hard.\n\nI've been at many failed startups and their story is about the same. \"We are valuated at D dollars, ARR growing mega fast, our customers are fortune 500s, picked as top K Deloitte ABC, etc, etc\". If I had a secret formula that could tell which ones will succeed and which won't, I'd be an angel investor making a fortune :)\n\nIt's very likely you won't exit with $1-10M.

IF you're not the first dev or founder, you're likely getting like .01 to .001% of the company. If the company sold for a billion.. or IPO'd at that valuation.. 1% is 10mil, so .01 is 1mil.. if you're lucky to get that and that is over 4 years of vest. Your strike price is what you have to pay up front before you can cash/sell (usually covered on sell though with fees). Even so.. assuming you either fully vest (I'd make sure you indicate if the company is sold that you fully vest immediately so the buying company cant screw you over, fire you and you dont get to vest the rest.. that's a big deal).. if you dont get your full vest and they IPO'd in a year or got bought out, you'd get 25%. You really REALLY would want to have them tell you your ACTUAL percentage which most company's wont. You'd have to be told how many total shares the company is offering to everyone to get a sense of your share amount and value.. which most wont do that because they almost always hide that so that each employee cant find out some HR rep got 10x more than you, a developer who is likely contributing FAR MORE to the value of the company, just because they got in a bit earlier than you. It's a shit situation sometimes. I found at at a startup I was at a PM who started after me got WAY MORE stock than I did.. and EARLY developer.. and was worth 20x what I was on paper. That person did shit all and I worked 12+ hours a day 7 days a week (USA too) because I was hard core going nuts to try to get MORE stock, raise, etc.. which never happened. \n\n",

          "text": "The math is pretty simple to value a given amount of equity. Take the share price, and multiply it by the number of shares you have (minus the strike price if they’re ISOs rather than RSUs).\n\nThe question is “what is the value of a share.” If the company is actually close to an IPO or an acquisition, they will have a 409a valuation calculated by a bank. This represents what they are *actually worth,* given their cash and capital assets, revenue, and intellectual property value. It’s still made up, but it’s at least made up based on standard accounting practices. ISOs generally have to be issued with a strike price near the 409a valuation (it’s the whole reason it was invented after the Enron debacle).\n\nThey will also have a “fare market value.” This is what investors paid at their last fund raising round. The further away the startup is from IPO’ing or being acquired, the further away this number will be from the 409a. This is usually the number that recruiters will use to make claims on what the value of equity is, and it’s usually the number that equity grants themselves are valued against: a company will give you, for example, a $1.2mil grant, and this will be converted into a number of shares by dividing that value by the FMV on a given date.\n\nOnce a company is public, the stock price is the FMV is the 409a, so all these same calculations are just done off the public stock price.\n\nBut as for the feasibility of the claim: a $1mil payout would require you to own 1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $100mil, or 0.1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $1bil. 1% of a company may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually quite a large ownership stake, so I would not expect a company with more than 10-15 employees to be giving grants that large. Even founding engineers generally only get in the 2-3% range if their VCs are generous with the cap table.\n\nBasically, for this person’s statement to be true, it would probably mean they’re expecting an acquisition/IPO in the $10bil+ range. That’s a lot of money. You would know if this company actually has a chance to do that.\n\nBut it can never hurt to ask how they came to that valuation. \n",

It wasn't retire now money, but it did put me something like 10 years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe basic arithmetic is just the percentage of the company you own times the valuation if it gets acquired equals the payout you get. The things that complicate it are dilution and stock preferences. I'm happy to explain the mechanics of both if you're interested (TLDR: dilution means that your percentage decreases every time they raise VC funding, preference means that at sale time investors can choose to take their money back and squeeze everyone else out), but it almost certainly doesn't really change how you should think about equity. \n\nIf you're early enough to have a significant number of shares, you don't have enough information to predict how all of the fundraising and sale details will shake out. If you're late enough to have useful information about all of that, you won't get enough shares to be worth anything. I just mentally ballpark startup equity as having an expected value around $10K and move on. Maybe it will go out of business and be worth nothing, maybe it will exit for way higher and pleasantly surprise me, I have no idea. My priority is to make sure I'm happy enough with the day-to-day and the base pay that I don't mind gambling. Don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose.",

If you’re in series a, and most companies in your space are exiting after multiple funding rounds, then you’re going to get really diluted.

You need to know the number of options/shares in the pool. \n\nIt’s hard to get that number out of some companies, and it obviously grows with every round of funding. \n\nOn average say there is 100 million options (or maybe 150 million) in the pool by the time the company IPOs. \n\n$100m is the magic number companies use to IPO at, early 2010s it was $50m ARR. Now, $200m ARR? Wallstreet moves the goal posts. \n\n$100m revenue / number shares at IPO gives the price per share simply put. \n\nThen you have the multiplier that recurring revenue SaaS companies earn because their revenue can be predicted forward some years. \n\nIt use to see crazy multiples, 35x 50x revenue. These days I hear it’s mostly 6-8x revenue. \n\nSo if your company is making $100m revenue a year, times the 6x multiplier, divided by number options in the pool, you get the rough share price at IPO. Then it goes crazy up or down from there. \n\nMost companies will aim to IPO at $20 a share, no idea why I have just always heard it’s a magic number for NASDAQ IPOs. \n\nSo you can work out if you will have share splits/reverse splits and what your equity is possibly going to be if at $20 a share at IPO the company needs to reduce the number in the pool to make “$100m ARR * multiplier / pool size = $20” revenue math to work out. \n\n\nI wrote this pretty quickly but if anything doesn’t make sense ask follow ups. \n\nIf anyone has anything to add I got wrong let me know, at the end of the day I am much more an engineer than I am a business guy.",

What would you do to fix this?\" have a handful of intended answers. Regional servers, CDN, geocache, round trip analysis, etc.\n\nBut there is a different bucket of answers that don't really answer the question but are valid in other ways.\n\n\"Do we have / want to have users in Africa?\"\n\n\"Is there enough traffic in Africa for a geocache solution to even work?\"\n\n\"Africa is a really big place... how is this 700ms figure being calculated? Equally weighted across all nations would skew this significantly if 99% of users are just in South Africa for example\"\n\nHow would you feel if a senior engineer / staff engineer / EM answered in this way? Rather than jumping straight to technical solutions.\n\nE: re all the people talking about \"do we want users in Africa?\" my point is, not all businesses need to serve all regions. A regional newspaper, a cable company that only services some states, or a boot strapped B2B company should probably not spend any money investing in Africa. It just doesn't have a good ROI.

          "text": "This, to me, is one of the most frustrating parts of interviewing at modern tech companies.  The questions you're asking are the real life correct questions to ask.  They are also the types of questions most engineers don't think to ask until they hit staff level or higher, but -havent- gone up the management ladder yet (which atrophies this a bit, i speak from experience).\n\nWhat this all means, is delending on your interviewer, these questions are very likely correct, but -above- the interviewing person's skill level to see the value of.\n\nIf I'm being asked this interview question by a senior dev, theres a huge chance they would assume a response like \"how is this 700ms being calculated\" as a delay tactic because you don't know a good answer.  Because if they were the type of person to realize that africa is too big of a place to fix with \"add more cdns\" and that a single 700ms latency doesn't make sense for an entire continent, then they wouldn't still be a senior engineer.  \n\nThat said, part of being a staff eng is knowing how to talk to people with kess experience than you.  So you could, and probably should say, something like \"well there are a lot of ways to fix a latency issue like this.  We would probably investigate geocaching and regional cdns for example.  I could list some strategies like these if you're talking about fixing geographic katency im the general sense.  But if you're asking specifically about the example you've given, then I'd want to dive in a but deeper, because a 700ms latency fir the entire continent of africa seems a little suspect.  Do you know what the geographical distribution that elad to that number is?\"\n\nI would think in most situations that would impress the senior and be the right answer.  If the senior is open minded to it it would work.\n\nBut if you do this to every question, then they are never going to get to the point of testing your technical chops either.\n\nWhere this gets really bad, though, is when you get senior engineers asking leetcode style questions, which is what a lot of them do nowadays.  The hardest part i have with leetcode is how, if you actually think about the question for a few minutes, many (most?) of the questions completely fall apart with the type of analysis you're talking about.\n\nThe last time i opened a leetcode study book, which was admittedly a decade ago, I couldn't get passed the first question.  Because while it was obvious the question was looking for some sort of fancy breadth first search algorithm, i knew the actual domain the question was supposed to be about, and realized that 95% of the traffic was going to come from one point, meaning that any generic search algorithm would be irl wrong.  But good luck explaining that to someone reciting from a leetcode question sheet.\n\nSo i guess the answer is, know your audience, i suppose.  And chalk this up as yet another reason why modern tech interviewing is broken.  You need to show your ability to ask these questions because this is what separates you from younger devs, but chances are, you are soeaking to a younger dev and have to speak their language as well.",

I'd be wary of someone who, based solely on two latency measurements for two continents, jump to \"this is what we need to do\".\n\n\"Do we want users in Africa\" *specifically* is probably not a great question to ask, both because it easily gets racist connotations and because that's above your paygrade. If they're talking about latency for African users clearly they *have* African users and care enough about them to monitor their latency.

If the target is all users have 80ms latency then it's a different answer than all users having 500ms latency.  Africa is also a big place--is there a nexus of users in one country or all over the continent.  This would be like saying Asia has high latency which could mean Israel, Indonesia, or Russia users which can be 5000+ miles apart.\n\nI understand that tech interviewers may expect a pure tech answer, but honestly if I were asked this question in an interview where the answer was superficial and as simple as setting up a CDN then I would assume this was a junior role or it's a screening call with HR.  A senior level position means dealing with nuance and IMO showing product-level thinking.\n\nIf you are setting up a CDN for a JAM stack app and it still has to make 700ms round trips to the backend, or even worse, use a more local backend that requires multiple 700ms round trips to the existing database for every single query, you haven't fixed anything and in certain cases, actually made it worse.",

Good interviewers are looking for people who challenge assumptions and ask clarifying questions before throwing solutions at poorly defined problems. The \"outside the box\" answers you listed aren't outside the box at all - they're the fundamentals of engineering leadership. Anyone can regurgitate CDN and regional servers, but understanding business context, validating the problem scope, and questioning data quality shows you've been burned by jumping to solutions too quickly in the past. That said, you do need to eventually provide technical solutions after establishing context, so the sweet spot is asking 2-3 clarifying questions that expose your thought process, then walking through potential solutions based on different scenarios.\n\nThe catch is that not all interviewers are good at their jobs, and some will mark you down for not immediately diving into technical details because they're reading from a rubric. You can usually gauge this in the first few minutes - if they seem annoyed by your questions or try to rush you past them, pivot faster to the technical stuff. If they engage with your questions and seem interested in the discussion, you've found someone who gets it. I'm on the team that built [AI copilot for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and from what job seekers tell me, practicing this balance of strategic questioning before technical deep-dives is what helped them land senior roles.",

I'd still ask for a technical solution but you'd get bonus points for this.\n\nAssuming this is technical interview - if you come up with a some outside of the box technical solution (even if it's a stretch) I'd definitely be interested in exploring it further instead of the standard answers.

In real life I've seen teams spin up expensive infra in regions where we had like 50 users total because nobody asked the \"do we actually need this\" question first.
