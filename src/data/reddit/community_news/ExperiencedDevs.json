      "text": "I've been working in bank tech for 25 years and this pattern just keeps repeating everywhere I go.\n\nTeam sits down for sprint planning. Takes forever. Probably 4 hours by the time we're done arguing about story points and breaking shit down and mapping who needs what from who.\n\nEveryone leaves knowing what they're doing for two weeks. Board looks great. All organized.\n\nCouple days later something breaks. Or priorities shift. Or we find out another team needed something we didn't know about. Plan falls apart.\n\nNext sprint? Same thing. Four hours. New plan. Dies in a few days.\n\nTracked this once because it was making me insane. Out of 20 sprints maybe 3 actually ended close to what we planned at the start. The rest just completely different by the end.\n\nSo what are we even doing? It's not planning if nothing survives. More like... I don't know. Making management feel better? Having something to point at?\n\nTeams I saw shipping well never did this. They'd just grab what looked important and start. Things changed? Cool, adjust. Keep moving.\n\nAnyway. Been watching this happen for years and nobody ever questions it. Starting to wonder if it's just me or if everyone knows this is bullshit but we all just go along with it anyway.\n\nYour sprints actually go according to plan?",

And I mean this roughly (think of it as a guide to follow in spirit) because 10 work-days does not divide into 6 at all.\n\nAnd you change the proportions depending on what the project is. If you are doing an early prototype, where you are iterating quickly and still learning and discovering fundamental things, you probably have no hard-commits at all. If the project is in chaos and there's a lot of firefighting, you may leave 1/3 open to handle firefights from the get-go (and this is also true on oncall weeks).",

          "text": "Here is what I do: when people keep consistently demolishing my plans, I refuse to make effort on planning.\n\nSometimes you need to exert a little bit of pressure on people you are working with to behave rationally.\n\nFor example, when somebody is consistently late to meetings (he/she set) or if they keep cancelling meetings, I stop coming to those meetings (except my boss, can't do much about that). Recently one guy asked me about that and I responded \"You cancelled last 5 occurrences, I just assume the meeting will not happen anyway\"\n\nI am currently in a situation where my product owner keeps making irrational plans. He is pressured to deliver at a certain date and rather than work to find reasonable solution he is pressuring everybody to accept his estimates. Those estimates obviously have nothing to do with reality and instead are made to prop up the idea we are on path to achieving success (success defined as meeting a self imposed deadline). Recently I stopped giving estimates and my official response is that \"every time I make an estimate it ends up with a long series of discussions about the merits of my estimate and my estimates end up replaced with the estimates of my PO. Frequently, the amount of effort on those discussions approaches the effort needed to perform the task. Therefore, I will no longer prepare any estimates, please, let PO fill in estimates by himself. At least this will free up my time to do other work.\"\n\nOf course, these estimates have nothing to do with reality and the only thing that is achieved is great amount of chaos, confusion and scope cutting when nearing development cutoff date.\n\nAnd the issue is that if I let in to the pressure I become responsible for the estimate because POs unrealistic wishes becomes my commitments.\n\n\\> Out of 20 sprints maybe 3 actually ended close to what we planned at the start. The rest just completely different by the end.\n\nHere is what you do.\n\nMake copious notes about \\*causes\\* of the sprint plans not being met. Try to find commonality. Try to find causes that are associated with majority of problems. Try to figure out some solutions to fix those.\n\nFor example, my current team has problem in that developers cannot reliably predict how much work a particular task needs to be done. I figured out significant cause of this is that most of the time the start of development is essentially a start of a research task to find out what are the requirements. This tends to require a huge amount of communication, meetings, frequently with senior people outside of our organization who are not available at moments notice.\n\nSo what I did is I created a checklist that lists what needs to be met before a task is accepted. Part of this checklist is a statement that a task needs to be defined in such a way that a developer can pick up and finish task without requiring to gather more requirements (and also other problems that require communication with others). All tasks are first assigned to me. What I do is I check if the task meets the criteria and is specified clearly and only if it is specified clearly I allow the task to be presented on sprint planning.\n\nIf the task does not meet the criteria I simply bounce it back and this way I try to protect the team at the cost of pressure on me (which I am fine with, I know how to deal with it).\n\nUnfortunately, the team can't do it because the developers frequently feel pressured to accept the task even if they don't really understand the task. That's another problem I am working on.",

The point is to learn to quickly iterate and improve the process.\n\nThe checklist is \\*outcome\\* of an ongoing improvement process. It has items that are only relevant to our team. It is being constantly updated as new problems are identified and old problems stop being problems so we remove process that support solving those.\n\nWhen I join a failing Agile team, I am doing almost exactly the opposite what others are doing. Others are coming with books, papers and ready made checklists that are supposed to improve the process. But this is anti-Agile. Agile is about improvement and what these people are doing they are trying to standardize process and take away the team's ability to shape it.\n\nWhen I join the team, I come with exactly zero process. Every process that is instituted is exactly in response to and directly related to the problems that team is having. Every member of the team is part of creating the process because I want to make the team feel responsible for the process and be part of the improvement. I also want them to understand why we are doing things.\n\nNow, if I shared the checklist with you, you would ask \"Is that it? Is this really the thing that is supposedly improved the team's performance by multiple orders of magnitude?\" And the answer is that the journey is more important than the end. If you helicopter yourself to the top of Mt Everest you will not feel the satisfaction of conquering it. And if you take a train instead of completing pilgrimage, you will not feel the spiritual effects you wanted. And if you take existing checklists and rules and process from external sources you will not achieve the goals of Agile.",

Make sure they're clear to everyone & everyone agrees what \"Done\" means for that story.  When that happens, mark it as \"Ready\" to be worked on.\n\n\\- The sprint planning/kickoff should be pulling in stories that are already well-known and \"Ready\".  By then there shouldn't be too many more questions as to what \"Done\" means and what the priorities are.  It shouldn't normally take more than an hour to sort out what you're pulling into the sprint based on priorities and cost estimates.\n\n\\- Priorities shouldn't change mid-sprint; obviously that moves the finish line back.  The point of a \"sprint\" is that it's already short enough to get that amount of work done; then, if priorities need to change, you change directions in the next sprint.   \n\n\\- If you have to throw away the sprint and start over with new priorities, that's supposed to be OK (although I've never been on a team that does that).",

Any Stories being pulled into a Sprint are known by the team and have been estimated, and prioritised (by e.g. Product with team in partnership, or with team and stakeholders by some kind of passive-aggressive negotiation; it is a bank after all) previously. 1 hour TOPS for team of up to 12 or so. 30 mins if 6 or less and your game is tight. Nothing should be a surprise in here. (You might need 30 mins of admin/close-down for previous Sprint if you're not getting finished/suffering distractions or your sprints are wanky/getting crashed. Keep it to a separate session though or _ideally_ have the devs/testers do all the close-down admin themselves, in advance of planning. That's what my best teams used to do and it's fucking amazing.\n  \n\n2. A prior session to prioritise (rank/discuss dependencies/weigh up what the next few weeks look like and make some decisions about what gets dev-time) e.g. \"go time now for that tech debt thing we talked about last Retro cause feature X is gonna need that sorted\". Called \"Prioritisation\". 30 to 45 mins tops. Every sprint to keep it short and relevant: i.e. soon/upcoming.\n\n  \n3. A session prior to that to break down Epics into Stories and/or Estimate the Stories. Called \"Refinement & Estimation\". I'd recommend sticking up a recent but Done \"5 pointer\" on the wall/on-screen somehow and using it as a benchmark to calibrate sizing of new work. Obvs pick a 5 point Story that mostly everyone agrees was a solid 5 points. \n\n\nAnything that is wildly unknown or unknowable should be given Spikes (time-boxed to X days) or turned into a KDD for research, or given a 20 or 40 and retyped as an Epic and broken down into Stories in a future session. 1 hour TOPS. Do it every Sprint to keep duration down.\n  \n  \nNever let the team neglect these ceremonies; teams tend to eat each other when they run out of work.\n  \n  \nNone of these good practices will prevent your sprints from being crashed by the way, by shit systems breaking and/or shit management grabbing your engineers and demanding output from them. That needs to be tackled separately.\n\n\nBut four fucking hours of \"sprint planning\" where you're trying to do all of the above in one session is ineffective and just a bit weak/immature agile-wise. People will be in various states of interested/disinterested/bored/fed up if you try to do all of the above in one meeting.",

All three sessions you described? Consultants said do it in one 4-hour block. So that's what we did.\n\nAnd here's the thing, when you try to push back and say \"this should be split up,\" management's response is \"McKinsey charged us $500k for this framework, are you saying they're wrong?\"\n\nIt's what I call risk management theater. Leadership hides behind the consultancy. If it fails, they can blame the execution not the decision. \"We hired the best consultants, did what they said, must be the team.\"\n\nYour breakdown is exactly how it should work.

This also helps to satisfy folks who “want higher velocity”, as you can increase perceived velocity by breaking down tickets more and more.\n\nThis sort of pattern leads to being able to more accurately predict how quickly things will get done, given a known queue depth. Every so often (week, month, quarter, etc) just add up all the tickets completed, and that count is your “velocity in points”. Track that against a given project or backlog to see your burn down.",

          "text": "Our record for deviating from the plan was 20 minutes. 20 minutes after our methodical 4 hour planning session, we completely deviated from it and took on new work that wasn't on the board 😂\n\nLive by the board, then die by the board. If the board is used to measure productivity and delivery of work, then it should absolutely be used to nip unrealistic work and scope creep, as well as track capacity. Unfortunately that rarely happens, most PMs/managers aren't willing to stand their ground and defend the board, they just care about optics of velocity and agile half-heartedly. Closing more features, steeper burndown charts, illusion of delivery to management. Eventually the board becomes theater, they tell a fairy tale plot, and you dance on stage, performing vanity projects on top of operational tasks.\n\nA lot of this is due to incentivization and lack of understanding what is actually required for delivering a technical solution, there is no architect to enforce reality. Performance is largely based on how many projects they had their hands in and how many people they manage, not quality or effectiveness of technical delivery. The org incentivizes bandwidth, not throughput.\n\nUnderstanding this concept was key for me. One mistake I made was trying to be the defender of the board. I thought by defending planned work, reducing congestion, and protecting throughput to deliver better products was the answer, but this only gets you seen as a naysayer and reducer of bandwidth. Some orgs don't have any mechanisms for recognizing or rewarding throughput as they don't measure effectiveness of technical solutions, congestion, latency, or quality of service, this requires an architect to measure. They only measure on bandwidth, velocity, and loudness.\n\nOnce you understand this, the agile framework only follows suit. The business actually wants waterfall but agile is there for formality. The goal is to sell bandwidth like you're an ISP, not throughput. The plan becomes less about being accurate or even detailed, it becomes an interpretive dance with loud features, flashy lights, selling your work (maybe some belly dancing?), and promising things that you can actually deliver quicker than expected and dealing with what actually needs to be done off the board.",

But we don't want to pay that up-front cost, so the only antidote we have is mumbling \"we'll have to cost better next time\".\n\nThe whole thing is much more for management and product's sake, I think, so they can give certain commitments to stakeholders.

          "text": "Everything that enters a sprint unplanned is called a fastlane (at least in Jira). At my last company, we had a similar problem to yours. Until the team leaders set down together with management and decided that every fastlane needs CTO-approval. Suddenly, a lot of things could wait a sprint or two.\n\nAdditionally, in the sprint review with all the stakeholders, fastlanes were explicitly discussed, giving us the backing from different departments when denying them wherever possible.\n\nYou mentioned a VP suddenly standing in your office and demanding stuff. That is already an issue. A foreign VP shouldn't give tasks to a development team, they should give them to your manager/director/department lead/whatever. They then decide how to prioritize things and, if needed, they bomb your sprint. Then they can also discuss with you once they notice how every sprint dies.\n\nI had a similar issue once at a startup, where sales and marketing directly walked to the devs to ask for help with something. That resulted in the dev lead not knowing what the devs where working on and made him very sad, thus it got changed at some point.\n\nOverall, this has to be solved by management. Now, assuming your manager doesn't care, what can you do?\n\n1. Inform stakeholders. Whenever you get a fastlane, or no later than in the next sprint review, let the stakeholders of the stuff you planned to work on know that their things got pushed back as authorized by VP Bob. If they don't care then why should you, if they care let them talk to Bob, not your issue. Of course, make that more informative and less finger pointing; as always, office politics apply.\n\n2. Involve your manager/VP/whatever, let it be their decision.\n\n3. Plan the unplanned into your sprints. If you get interrupted regularly, plan with less tickets. If you don't get interrupted for once, have some low priority tickets in the backlog that you already wanted to do for months.\n\n4. Switch to Kanban, as already mentioned by others, and let other people fight about priorities. If necessary, implement a process letting stakeholders see why their ticket got pushed back, what ticket was put in front of it and who authorized it (see 1.).\n\n5. Figure out how there can be such major bugs in production systems regularly (because some issue on a test system doesn't justify a fastlane) and address that. Maybe you need better testing? Hire a QA guy?\n\n6. Stop caring so much, obviously no one else does. Figure out what you need to do to satisfy everyone and then simply work. Who cares about sprints anyway?\n\nIn the end, it's understandable. Someone is blocked and you can unblock them, and instead of blaming their poor planning they blame you and want it fixed asap. Their manager only hears \"I do no work because...\" and of course demands you fix that right away. If you neither have the right to push back nor a manager to handle that for you, then this strategy works for them. But again, that's not a problem you can solve. You need to convince management that it would be beneficial if you could actually do the work you planned, without buy-in from them you can't change much.",

Also, 1 person from 2 teams, so about 10-12 devs is on call every week and also is responsible for various adhoc requests/issues.",

Never worked in a team that did that but the cutting scope to fit timeline makes way more sense than extending timeline to fit scope. The 3 sub team rotation thing is clever. Dedicated adhoc team means the other two can actually focus. We tried to do both simultaneously and it killed us.\n\nHow does the rotation work in practice? Like do people actually switch every 6 weeks or does it end up with the same people stuck on adhoc forever?\n\nAlso 6 week sprints with less ceremonies - that alone probably saves you hours compared to the 2 week sprint treadmill.",

I actually don't mind working on adhoc stuff, especially because some of the work is just small, self contained feature work that isn't enough for a full project.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's cool about Shape Up is instead of getting all of this proposed work and trying to figure out how long it will take, we ask the company how long they are willing to invest in a feature. If it's something really important, we'll dedicate a full cycle to it, otherwise we might batch a few smaller items into a cycle, and leave some even smaller work for the adhoc team.\n\n\n\nThe ceremonies every two weeks were killing me. Grooming, story points, retro, standup with the full team, etc. With this, we do a 6 week cycle and then a 2 week cool down. We will do one retro during this time. Sometimes we will knock out small design defects, user reported issues, as well as work on shaping for the next cycle. Our PM usually has some features nailed down pretty well, we usually talk to her, come up with some high level designs, get some initial feedback from a designer, spike on some code a bit, and put everything into a doc outlining the problem, the solution, initial designs, etc. \n\n\n\nIt also gives more junior/mid level devs the opportunity to lead a project, especially if it is a little smaller in scope. You can help them do some planning and support them during the project while they lead the project and interface more with the stakeholders. And let them run with more and more of it over time.\n\n\n\n\nIt's worked insanely well for me at 2 different companies. I like being part of digging into the issue as well as helping ship it.

Commitments mean nothing and the plan means nothing.\n\nWanted to clarify that this is true in the described scenario and that when done well all these things mean something. First priority is getting control of destiny and making a realistic plan. Your first goalpost with it is “most stories get closed out within the sprint, stories are only rarely added in the sprint.” The majority of your team’s work at this point is *inherently* tied to a sprint and can’t really fail; the sprint is over, so covering a rotational duty for said sprint just *IS* done. Significant events and contributions are logged in each story. At the end of the sprint anything pending or in flight under these rotational stories (cross team/vp ask/bug patrol/release duty) is either neatly handed off to the next sprint’s rotational story or captured in a proper story.\n\n70% of your stories are planned coverage for known varieties of high priority work. the way the stories are conceptualized means you now have a FLOOR of 70% story completion.\n\nNow you’re in a position to start realistically concerning yourself with the other 30%. Whatever your pointing system, hopefully fib, you align on what point value maps to “a mid level dev would need to work on this and only this with minimal interruption to reliably complete it within the sprint.” Your lowest point value is “this could reliably be completed in a single productive afternoon.”\n\nThen you stop thinking directly about time for everything in between. You talk and think about the factors that contribute to these estimations. “Updating the values of 80 constants is a 2 because there’s nothing complicated about it but also it’s going to be tough to make sure all 80 were updated correctly.” “I estimated this one as a 3 because I *know* there are places where the constant value is used without the variable so we’ll need to fix that as part of the story. Some analysis is going to be involved and it’s probably best to update one by one.” “For those same reasons and more I went with a 5; we also misuse the variables in a few places which has been the root cause of some recent production bugs. It’s really just not as simple as editing 80 constants, and our tests are absolutely going to need fixing.”\n\nThe discussion about points should be like half the value of the meeting, as it’s  a great way to get further clarity and consensus about what’s really going into a story. It builds communal literacy in assessing a story, and also works as a tangential knowledge sharing.\n\nIt’s possible for points, commitments, plans to mean something, your team/org just hasn’t really drawn the boundaries or put in the work/discipline to make it happen. Agile ain’t perfect and I agree that it’s become a snake oil pyramid scheme, really a munchausen by proxy role. Dedicated agile coaches have a built in incentive to make some improvement while keeping teams sick. They have a conflict of interest where having the team depend on them and being able to say they are still teaching and correcting people on the team about pure agile stuff is at odds with what will actually work with the team.\n\nBut agile itself is totally serviceable. It just requires smart and experienced engineers like yourself to lean into it and apply all your problem solving skills to the process itself. It’s like a language or framework that you’re stuck with in a shitty legacy application. Instead of abandoning the language/framework, figure out how to use it well and clean up the app.\n\nGlhf. Your team’s gonna love you when you get this sorted.",

My work is very niche, and about a third of the company's business depends on the projects I deliver.\n\nI have been working with this company for 3 years, and they'd been my client for 9 years prior. Up until two months ago, my boss was one of the two company owners. However, two months ago they hired a new manager to be my boss. She manages myself and 3 others who are not developers. She worked as a manager of engineering teams at her previous jobs.\n\nSo far, every one of our 1:1s has only been negative feedback for me, given in a somewhat scathing/demeaning manor. I have received zero positive feedback. I am taking it on the chin and am doing my best to apply everything she is asking. There is no acknowledgement of progress.\n\nI have asked for candid feedback from my teammates, and while they had minor points to share, the severity or quantity does not match what my manager is expressing.\n\nIn addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory. \n\nMy assumption is that the company owners want to fire me, and they have instructed my new manager to set me up for failure so that they have cause. But this confuses me, as they have not hired anyone new and the company would be screwed without me as we are in the middle of large projects that only I can do.\n\nFor context, I am not perfect. I have issues with communication and availability. I do not miss deadlines however. And my manager has acknowledged consistently that my work is top-quality. I am known in our little bubble of our little industry, I have spoken at conferences, and we have gained work from Fortune 25 companies as a direct result. They hire us just for my expertise (I'm not particularly skilled, but again my work is niche). In addition, our team has won awards for my work at these conferences.\n\nWhile I genuinely appreciate the manager's feedback, the severity and manner is causing me more stress than I can handle.\n\nWhat do I do? I have never applied for a job. In 22 years, I have only been offered work and employment. A few weeks ago a competing company offered me a job, but I like the people and the work here. I don't want a change.",

Why do you think that is?  Based on your statement, your manager likely isn't qualified for the job and sees you as a threat who will eventually expose them since you're the only one who would be able to identify that they have no idea what they are doing.  Your manager is trying to get rid of the threat, but they aren't savvy enough to understand what it would mean for the business if they actually get you fired.  Perhaps this is wrong, but if your manager isn't providing any sort of coaching to solve the negative feedback, at some point only one of you is going to be working at the company, and it's not going to depend on whether you jump through their hoops to address the feedback since they aren't giving you a way to do it.  I'd say your best bet would be to reach out to your old manager for casual conversation and eventually broach the subject of your past performance and ask if there was anything they thought you could have improved upon while they were your manager, and if they have nothing negative segue into your current performance feedback asking for advice on how to improve.  If anything, this will give you information on where the owner stands on wanting you around without explicitly asking if they want to fire you, and if they have no idea what your manager is doing, it will give them some breadcrumbs to start paying more attention.",

Express concerns about communication issues between the two of you, that you have the impression she is looking for something specific from you but you aren't sure what it is. Ask her to explain the things she has been saying in your 1:1s in front of the owner (s). She will either stutter out something very different than she has been saying to you, giving you the chance to call her out for changing her feedback. Or she will try to shred you in front of the people who have total confidence in you for many years. Either way she looks exactly as bad as she is. This will be much more effective than trying to describe her behavior to higher ups.",

It might be the case that the manager is very bad, and wants to manifest the power she has over you; don't re-interpret her actions as company actions unless you're 100% sure that's the case.\n\nDon't offer the control of your employment to her. If you offer the control and you leave by your choice, she will pay zero consequences for your dismissal. After all, it was your choice that you left. Nobody will ask you about your side of the story because you won't be there anymore. Her side of the story will be the official story. She can't just fire you on her whim; she needs to document it somehow. She needs to have arguments against you. Somebody *will* ask her at some point \"why do you want to fire this guy\". Think about what could those arguments be, and address them before hand, so she can't use them. If you know what the arguments could be, but you can't address them or you can't fix them, then accept that *she may have a point*.\n\nImagine how a conversation could look like between you, her, HR or some boss. What arguments could be raised against you, what arguments could you use against her. Prepare yourself for these arguments by resolving them *before this conversation happens*. Make sure you make her acknowledge these potentially important arguments are resolved on any 1:1 you have with her.\n\nBut also *don't fall into the trap of thinking you need to have more than everyone else just because you always had more*, or because you're an old employee. New managers love to exploit that. Maybe this is this case.\n\nIt might also be some kind of \"women's empowerment\" ideology going on, especially if you're a middle aged white male.\n\nHave in mind that in the management chain, it's very common for an employee to *not like* their supervisor, and you need to have *heavy and documented evidence* if you want to walk this road. Without evidence, it might be seen as \"he'll complain, complain, complain, but eventually he'll get used to it\".\n\n> In addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory.\n\nPlease give an example of what those accusations looks like.\n\nEscalate to higher management that you need those answers, but your manager doesn't provide it to you. Don't accuse the manager of anything. Make sure higher management knows that there is a problem with providing information. The manager also has her work. She needs to follow the rules as well. Make sure you point out those rules.",

My boss in like 2012 paid me $50 cash to make this little jQuery web app for his cousin, who is a music teacher. The functionality is silly, but I was really proud of the CSS. At some point somebody added a donate button and made mobile app wrappers for it, but other than that it's exactly as it was when I shipped it.\n\nAnother one that comes to mind is a script I wrote a few years ago that analyzes images produced by a Scanning Electron Microscope and calculates the thickness in microns of various features in the image. I was proud of it because it was a side project outside of my sprint work that I spent two evenings on, used zero dependencies, and it ended up being used by scientists in the lab for like two years after that to save them from manually measuring these things. I don't think they're still using it, but I was proud of it.\n\nFunny, I can't think of any actual business products I've worked on that I'm proud of.",

Over five years the company scaled from zero to $1B+ in revenue across four core products. I contributed to three and owned two end to end.

Not cutting corners, but being explicit about tradeoffs. \n\nWe spent real time discussing design decisions, avoided premature complexity and resisted chasing new tools without a clear payoff. \n\nIt was less about being clever and more about making informed decisions.\n\nLastly, communication was open and broadly shared. \n\nThe environments were mostly remote, which acted as a forcing function. \n\nWe prioritized written communication over verbal, with most discussion happening in shared chats rather than meetings or formal docs. \n\nMost formal documentation lived in our tests, which were heavily commented for historical context. Maintaining this was enforced in code reviews. \n\nThat working style came largely from open source backgrounds, where async collaboration and visible context are the norm. \n\nIt’s opinionated and not for everyone, but it worked well for us and for the type of people we hired.",

          "text": "My favorite ones are the projects that succeed and destroy a bigger project.\n\nI was once working for a agricultural startup that supposedly took data from all kinds of data sources, and used it to predict how well crops would grow. I have this strain of corn, how well will it grow on this field? how about the next? They were trying to sell this as a very accurate way to tell farmers which land to rent or buy. I wasn't doing any of that work, but to sell the model well, they needed good visualizations.\n\nSo I am then asked to lead a project where we'd visualize the results of the model, on every field in the united states: You load a map, and can zoom in all the way to each individual plot. As you zoom out, it aggregated to median data. A fun, interesting little visualization project, right? Well, it was a complete success. It allowed us to see exactly what results the model was providing, and you could see exactly how reliable it was.... except of course, it wasn't reliable. The numbers were plausible on most normal fields in the corn belt, but as you zoomed out, you'd see... a map of US states. People would ask me why I added the staets.. .except I didn't. It just happens that the data was so broken, a key important factor was being decided at the state level in the model: So big you could see the states as you zoomed out. Cross the border between Iowa and Illinois? 20% difference in corn yield. And the model was equally broken on every crop. No matter what, the soil maps, weather maps and all of that were just not all that important.\n\nNeedless to say, while this was an accurate visualization of what the startup's technology did, it was also something that said its core technology was an unsellable disaster, because every farmer would laugh at the numbers, as in the real world, states don't matter. Not much later came major layoffs, as I had successfully shown execs most of their company's \"valuable\" IP was not in a sellable state.",

Our company is also not big enough that there’s someone else coming along and doing it. I haven’t been genuinely excited about work ever before this. We’re trying to scale this and improve and there’s so many more ideas than people. In our townhall recently, they named dropped this project and the scaling pressures (bc so many people started using it) we’re facing quite a few times. Upper management has also rewarded us well in terms of comp. I feel very motivated.\n\nUnfortunately they’re forcing me off the project. They’re forcing me to change team, with the carrot “oh maybe you’ll get to lead this subpart of this other team” . This probably wouldn’t happen because I have 0 interest in the other team and the resume value is just not there. I’m pretty upset but I don’t think I had any (real) choice to say no, and leaving the firm is off the table unless my comp drops a lot this year.\n\nBack to not caring I guess. Guess it’s time to focus on my other hobbies",

As a result you get unnatural abilities to solo entire hardware/software projects (and some products too) and train/educate your team when there are skill gaps.\n\nIf you don't dedicate your entire life to engineering my advice is to find someone who does (that can teach) and join their project to learn faster.

Mostly projects that I had ownership of a rather big part and did them almost from scratch. The impact was non existent as nothing went to production. However I was proud because I did grow a lot and did a lot of things that I never thought I would do.\n2. Projects of big organizations where the end product is very impressive but work was meh. Bad tech, 0 ownership, vast (pointless I would say) processes, bureaucratic boomer attitude. Well I am not proud of that because it didnt feel like building the product. It felt like I was battling some Kafkaesque nightmare.\n3. A \"successful\" project that ended up in a product sold globally, where I was solely responsible for the software of half the system. The bad management, the bad client and the absurd deadlines made the whole process traumatic. I was so burnt out that I quit shortly after and never wanted to talk about that project. Today I see it used in my city's metro system but I largely don't care.\n4. A project that was 2 of the best years of my career. A very good senior colleague that taught me so many things made that special. Very nice processes that made sense. Good management that did not get in the way. I did have ownership in some critical features but I contributed to a lot of others as well. I even made an internal tool that was praised by everyone and ended up as a significant step in the process. Cool product, something I never thought it existed, yet we were writing the new version of it. Bad proprietary hardware that made software super interesting diving a lot to low level and compilers etc. Yet the project was killed because of politics... This was essentially the project that made me a much better engineer and it was a fancy product that I would be super proud if it succeeded. I am still very proud about the internal tool that we used it for 6 months.",

It was rad and I loved that job so much. Later in my career I worked in medtech and at one point the software I worked on was used in > 90% of all nationwide treatments of a specific acute medical condition. We had a big counter that was on the wall in our office space that counted the number of patients who went through our system. When I started there, we were around 10,000 (it was a startup and I joined in year 2 or 3) and by the time I was leaving (~8 years later) we were heading towards 1,500,000. We really helped move the needle on patient outcomes there. Now I am in gamesdev and get to work on stuff that's played by millions of people.\n\nIt would drive me *completely insane* to work on software that went nowhere.

I pitched my VP that I could build a custom publishing system that would meet all our needs, quickly and cheaply. Just give me an equipment and personnel budget and I'll make it happen. I led that project, did a ton of coding, supervised the other programmers, acted as DBA, system administrator (we didn't have the word devops back then), wrote a whole system to process user submitted video (much trickier in the pre-smartphone era), etc. It was a smashing success. Editorial was thrilled. Ad sales was thrilled. I gave presentations to the rest of the company about it. It served millions of visitors for over 10 years.

That code brought in millions, never got hacked (that we know of) and ran financial payout calculations for several clients - which I only found out after it'd been happening for about a year.

I ended up working for *Benoit Mandelbrot* on his now famous Fractal Mathematics research. I also was a part of the creation of the first 3D modelers, and first 3D animation systems. \n\nMy first job out of college was for Philips, in their research group creating the CD-ROM and streaming media. I was the guy that originally wrote the streaming media support in multiple operating systems, including all the game consoles of the time. I was on the OS teams for the (failed) 3D0 and the original PlayStation, where I wrote their video subsystems. \n\nWhile it Philips I wrote an award winning documentary production system, and that was used to make over 100 documentaries, which I was the technical director. \n\nWhile at Electronic Arts I was on the OS team for the 3D0 and the teams for Road Rash 3D0, the original Tiger Woods Golf, NCAA Football, and several others.\n\nI worked briefly at a dotcom during the dotcom era, and there I wrote the world's first live video codec for streaming video over the Internet. \n\nThen I went into feature film VFX and worked on about a dozen high profile films as a digital artist, a programmer, and then a financial analysis (I was getting an MBA at the same time.) It was the 3D live action versions of the Scooby Doo movies, the Garfield films, and the Narnia films, I worked on those and several more. \n\nIt was making film VFX that I figured out and then patented what are now called Deep Fakes. I was trying to create personalized advertising, see yourself in advertising, but the world wanted personalized porn. I and my team of film VFX pros refused to make porn, and I went bankrupt. I put my life savings into that technology, people did not believe it was possible, and then they did they insisted it be used for moral crime. I refused. \n\nI ended up going into facial recognition, where I helped a company that wrote 3D reconstruction software become a facial recognition company. Our work ended up being the #3 globally ranked facial recognition server and probably the most popular one after Genetec, the global leader. \n\n...and my wife is more successful than I.",

The second was converting one of the business domains to use AMQP as part of a PoC for a major bid.  We won the bid and were able to production-ize the PoC. \n\nAs for the projects I've been on that have failed, well there's been a hell of a lot more.  The common threads are poor product/market fit, poor adoption, or inept strategy.  Without naming the projects here's my perspective on why they failed (one point per-project):\n\n* Leadership decided that the work could be done in 8 weeks by 4 independent contractors under the guidance of a Director setting the strategy, a Solution Architect devising the implementation, and an Engineering Manager guiding the day-to-day.  That's 4 devs, 3 \"leads\", and 2 months to try and deliver a complete rearchitecture of our data pipeline.  The Director was a kiss-up/kick-down idiot, the Solution Architect was inexperienced and created a solution involving 8 Lambdas for a system that would service 1500 users at peak load with a TAM of maybe 5x that, and the manager was me insisting almost daily that this wasn't going to work but being told that I had to \"make it work\" by said Director.  Unsurprisingly, it didn't work and was cancelled after 6 months. \n\n* The product itself was excellent, had great product/market fit, and was devised by one of our guys with 10+ years experience.  New leadership came in, didn't like the timeline, and insisted that we gut 70% of the feature set to deliver it faster.  Adoption was poor because it no longer solved the problem it set out to solve. \n\n* The integration we built was part of a partnership to cross-sell each others' product.  It worked fine but sales were poor and it was later deprecated. \n\n* We converted a crazy VBA-laden Excel file into a web-based tool for an internal team.  Nobody wanted to use the web-based tool and they kept using the Excel file with VBA.  \n\n* It was a startup bet to act as a lower cost of acquisition for new customers that we could upsell on other core features of the product.  What we built didn't work reliably and hemorrhaged money because we couldn't recollect from our customers.  It was shut down.",

          "text": "I know this is counter to 95% of the people on this thread, but I honestly can say Scrum (very strictly followed scrum, in particular) is what made Successful Projects possible for me. Before then, it was hit or miss. Almost by chance. Chance that we got the cost estimate right and didn't run over budget. Chance that we got the time estimate right and didn't have to sacrifice features, functionality, or spit & polish due to timelines. Chance that the client correctly communicated what they want and/or what they wanted didn't change before project end due to external forces; that the finished product met the overall desires and expectations of the client. When a project takes more than 3 months, it's simply unrealistic to expect nothing to change for the client. Budget, expectations, needs, and desires _will_ change and it should be ok for them to do so. \n\nWith scrum (_strict, to the letter_ scrum), we were able to roadmap work in iterations. We were able to to continually review the work with the client and ship it, continually reverifying and re-analyzing direction and goals. With each iteration, the client was able to not just see the resulting work, but use and play with it. If the client decided, \"hey, actually, i don't need those other things, this is meeting my needs as is!\" then great, client is super happy and spends less money and we're free to move on to the next project. If it ran over, it was because the client made an informed decision to add new items or priorities or was involved in the process enough that it didn't come as a surprise; that they had already been made well aware of delays as they occurred. \n\nWhen we found ourselves on the wrong path, the biweekly sprint review with stakeholders would put us back on the right path. When the client had required changes or emergencies, we could add new tickets, working with the client to remove or deprioritize others of equivalent point value to keep things on track re: time and budget. When the team found themselves not operating or producing as expected, the bi-weekly retrospective allowed us to self-analyze, call out issues, and make improvements. \n\nOn the whole, the transparency, the inspection, and the adaptation (as it so happens, the \"three pillars of scrum\") ensure that by project end the client can't be anything but pleased with the result. \n\nI'm sure I'll get some comments to the contrary. And they won't be wrong. I've seen first hand so many instances of Agile-Gone-Wrong. At my previous job leading the account/checkout division international e-commerce platform, we had great success running our own little team with Scrum. Once the company-at-large got wind of our success, they wanted to implement it site wide. We advocated Scrum Nexus, they went with the horrific monstrosity that was SAFe. It was a productivity black hole. All this is to say, there are so many variants of agile, so many ways to run it, that are fucking terrible. But in my experience, hardcore, strict-as-fuck scrum is a near guarantee for project success.",

All companies start small, and most companies fail and die, often because they are poorly run, have bad tech, bad product, or a combination of all three. In big companies you see survivorship bias, which in this case biases them to simply being better companies on every dimension.\n\nI'm not saying every big company is better run, or has smarter people at it. That's obviously not true. In fact, the best companies statistically will be a great startup with 30-200 people, because at that scale you can have 90% top performers. But on average, small companies will be worse companies, and larger companies will tend to be better.",

          "text": "I went from a mid size to a megacorp to startups back to a megacorp. Midsize is honestly the best. Startups often aren't connected to reality and delusional about the product in really strange almost cultism ways. The success of the product is often decided by what mental abuse the CEO wants to inflict and who they inflict it on. It can be fun if you are really into what you are into and the product is making enough money that the success overwhelms the higher ups. \n\nMid is more balanced. There is productive levels of stress. I think I worked 1 Saturday a year for 8 years. I had input on my work before it hit my desk. I could say no to stuff and yes to others in a way that allowed negotiation with product teams. We had money for tools, established widely used standardized software tools. I could use Windows and Android and not deal with culty logic and sub optimal tooling and hardware when things went really wrong. I just pulled some parts out the closet and went about my day. When we needed an AI we just bought a mining rig and some gpus and did the work and expensed it.\n\nAt the second mid size, if i left my desk i would pass a bottle of vodka under a coworkers desk. Then a mini bar. Then a kambucha tap. Then a convince store bar deli. Then a hard liquor store. Then a brewery before getting  to my car. When I got a memo about when and when it is not ok to expense strippers I decided to go back to megacorps.\n\nMegacorp there is no talking talking back. Its not slave labor but it's the mindset of slavery. You don't express anything that would make anyone uncomfortable about anything ever, even if what they are saying do something kinda non-compliant. The environment was cheap, often smelled of farts or microwaved fish.  I think I met my coworkers two times in 4 years. \n\nThese are not bad people. There are just so many rules, the reality of capitalism, and the reality of survival. When someone disappears for the day silently you don't say anything unless it interferes with work. It's much harder to get ahead because of all the rules, funding wars and downsizing. It sucks in a different way.\n\n\nI would rank it mid, megacorp, then startups.\n\nMid at 90\nMegacorp at 50\nStartup at 30",

Endless red tape and process. You have a great idea at a startup? You could have it in prod by end of day. You're lucky if you get that idea into prod in two months at a large corp. Gotta get buy in. Get permission. Get it on the backlog. Argue about it in refinement. Then hope you get the chance to work on it before a random reorg happens or priorities shuffle. \n\nAlmost everyone is incompetent but plays nice, but is politicking behind the scenes. The corp keeps raking in money because they're a big fish already. They've captured the market. Inertia. You have to meet your own ever-increasing list of performance metrics but it's all bullshit and everyone around you knows it. Yet if you rock the boat too much, you're hosed. \n\nIt's the most inefficient endeavor I've ever been a part of. National labs, startups, even grad school were more rewarding and more likely to get things done and give you some sense of satisfaction. Big corp? You'll be lucky to have a meaningful and satisfying project once every 3 years. Everyone tries to hide their depression and burnout behind their hobbies and behind endless meetings. But deep down we all know it's just window dressing. Or nipples on chest armor. Or any other adage for pointless. \n\nMy god I'm so desperate to get back into R&D but the job market is uninterested in ML PhDs I guess so I'll just keep putting on the clown makeup and going to my meetings and sprint ceremonies and try not to show how absolutely sick of this mundane mediocrity and endless process I am (the same things everyone else is doing)\n\nPay's good at least",

My place of work does not and I am heavily involved in hiring, we all are. I just ran one the other week, and the poor guy, I could tell, had melted his brain running LeetCode too much.

Ask questions, try to work out whether you want to work with these people, don't let people disrespect your time.\n\nIf you actually are experienced and skilled enough that you deserve the title you have, there really aren't that many people available with your skill levels so you can be at least a little picky.",

I'm not saying you need to brag at all, but you really need to be able to come with the expectation that \"Graph algorithms? Really?\" and understand that companies that do that to you aren't worth your time because they are looking for team leads, and not high ranking ICs that influence teams,  and don't pay attention to the job titles. Pay attention to the job description. Always. Focus on companies that are looking for their senior level ICs to influence teams and actively ask you questions on how you did it. Avoid companies that still insist on having you solve basic coding challenges long after the initial interview.\n\nNow with this being the new age of AIs, you're going to be up for a challenge because companies are going to want to know how you can leverage those tools to upskill teams, and they'll also want to know how you navigate tough situations and get buy in from the teams and prove yourself. A lot of the interview questions you'll get will be to test your soft skills. Once you get to Principal Engineer, it is lonely at the top, and the higher you go, the less direction you will get because you will be expected to set the direction. \n\nIt's a tough market right now, but with the right amount of persistence, you'll eventually land a better role.

I'm not talking about tech, I'm sure you do have that, but everything outside of tech.\n\nSitting in a new organization and trying to generate buy-ins from stakeholders and fellow devs is an absolutely grueling task. If you haven't needed to navigate the political landscape of a new organization in 15 years... you are going to fail a lot. You are (probably) used to ICs listening to you, but here you will meet senior/staff ICs who has been with the company for 6 years and they really wanted that principal promotion, but instead here comes you, telling them the direction. It's hard staff to pull off.\n\n\nI also firmly believe one cannot enter an organization at the Principal level. You need a couple of years with the org to understand their business, tech and build rapport and respect with key tech/business players, before you can start to execute Principal level initiatives. \n\nI'd suggest applying for Staff level jobs as well.",

If you're familiar with most leetcoding patterns (bfs, dfs, sliding window, etc) and can spot those patterns quickly when given a problem, then coding shouldn't be much of an issue.\n\nSystem design is just going to depend on your comfort level and what you know.  I would recommend studying a few big ones, such as Bitly, a web crawler, ticketmaster, dropbox, whatsapp, and a few more.\n\nBehavioral can trip people up.  At our level, they're going to want to know what impact you've had on an org, how you've resolved conflict between engineering teams, what you've broken in prod, what you've shipped, etc.  \n\nI was laid off back on Jan 5.  I applied to about 24 jobs, most in line with my experience.  I've gone through about 14 interviews and I've passed the final round of 3 companies.  I'm expecting offers tomorrow.

          "text": "I think it's mostly a mindset thing. One thing I've noticed trip up a lot of is this attitude of: \"I was X badass at Y company for Z years therefore blah-blah-blah\". The key to success is to humble yourself and understand that you're not too good for anything. Given that you're asking these questions here already puts you miles ahead of a lot of \"how dare they ask me to do leetcode\" people.\n\nBeyond that, just treat this as any other technical problem to be solved: identify the problem statement, prepare your tools, iterate until output is acceptable.\n\nMost large companies have glassdoor or other interview review sites where you can get an understanding of how their interview process looks like. Ask recruiters what kind of things to expect during technical interviews. Heck some companies will give you their grading rubrics. Figure out exactly how the company is ranking their candidates and optimize for that. Generally speaking most tech companies will try to imitate FAANG-shit, so by going through a current \"Cracking the Y interview\" book you can generally get a good read on a lot what to study for.\n\nFor system design you wanna make sure you study up on the latest relevant tech so that when you namedrop something you understand why and don't accidentally say something self-defeating.\n\nFor leetcode stuff you can practice those questions pre-emptively. Ideally in whatever language/domain you'll be applying for. The benefit of these sites existing for forever is that you can actually get down to pretty specific domain stuff (like there's leetcode primers for modern react). Doing those through the \"hard\" ones in my experience is usually good enough to be ready to get through most coding interviews. It's usually best to focus on getting any kind of working solution first (even a bad one) and then explain that if you would've had more time to iterate you would implement an XYZ solution (instructor might even prompt you to do so right away). While many companies won't care about leetcode for principal positions, you will be graded a lot more harshly on mistakes if they do. So beware.\n\nMost interviews aren't going to ask you to implement a specific algo, but they will ask you why you chose that one and what are the trade offs of that vs other options.\n\nHowever at the one of it, remember that this is a numbers game. Corpos get to pick through a bunch of candidates and you're just a number to them. However, they will need to keep on hiring people. Where as you only need one to say yes. So make it a habit of finding sites that have new positions opened frequently and only apply to ones posted in the last couple of days. Keep on doing that and eventually you'll find something that lands, if for no other reason than the fact that you've done so many interviews that you've gotten really good at it, for interviewing is trainable skill as any other.",

Not exercises, just two engineers talking shop. That is also how my interviews with the company went. They did have a take home coding project, but that was almost 10 years ago. They don't do that now. I believe most companies are doing the automated code screeners before interviews now. I don't like them but we use them too.\n\nLike u/kubrador said, if you have to do a \"live\" coding exercise, \"just be direct about thinking out loud rather than writing perfect code in 45 minute.\" Really good advice.",

Coding exercises I've seen in the past few years have tended to be more of the \"solve a simple problem.  Just get it working, then discuss how to make it more performant as a stretch goal\" variety.  I think big companies are still doing leetcode etc and might get into that stuff, but I've only been interested in small to medium sized companies, and none of them have really played that game.\n\nEspecially for principal roles, you definitely need to be ready to handle system design questions though.  Those are still hot.  \n\nBehavioral interviews have traditionally been my weakness, but I did a lot better in my latest interview cycle by using ChatGPT to practice.  Basically I told it what kind of roles I was looking for, then asked it to help me build a story bank.  It gave me bullet points about the kinds of stories I needed (i.e. \"a time when you had to tackle a big production issue\", \"a time when you conflicted with management\" etc etc).  I told it stories and it kept a checklist of which stories matched which common questions, gave me advice on what areas to add more details in etc etc.  Worked out pretty well.  \n\nAlso asked it for resume feedback in a similar manner and it did a good job.

They may still include some coding problems but they aren't  really to weed you out so I've never encountered anything harder than a medium-ish difficulty problem. However, in system design they tend to go much deeper into your particular domain. For me, I've dove into architectural/design problems that I've personally had to solve in the past at prior companies. Oftentimes this is highly relevant because prospective companies are facing similar bottlenecks and issues.\n\nAlso, are you applying via references (old colleagues)? If so, they will generally walk you through the process in depth and are really the most valuable resource you have when interviewing",

          "text": "As someone who freelances, I'm constantly talking to people--which means, at some level, I'm constantly interviewing with people. And prior to that I was on the other side of the table (and, weirdly, I'm asked to interview others while freelancing).\n\nThe idea of an interview--ideally, unless you're interviewing with a bunch of nitwits--is to see that you're intelligent, that you know *something* about the technologies people are using, and that you can think quickly on your feet. Beyond that, the point is to see that you're personable and sociable--that is, that you can fit in well with a team, and that you're easy to be around. \n\nSince you're a contemplative coder (I'm one too), the best way to handle any \"coding on the spot\" interviews where you're asked to crank out code is to talk through how you'd reason about the code with the people you're interviewing with. That is, instead of quietly just writing code for 45 minutes, ask them questions, and talk to them about what you're thinking as you turn the code over in your head. (\"Well, first, it seems to me that this is really a sorting problem, right? That I need something to sort against, but once I have that, I can use quick sort to get the final answer...\") In my experience this goes over very well with most interviewers. (And it would go over well with me, because when I ask coding questions **I am not interested in a correct answer. I am interested in understanding your process on how you get to a correct answer.**)\n\nOther questions, like Dijkstra, NP, and the rest--I don't see them asked very often, but when they are, they're looking to ask you breadth of knowledge. Me, when I interview others, I pick through their resume--and my technical questions are less about \"do you still remember your CS courses from college\" and more \"is this guy lying on his resume?\" That is, if you put down the fact that you worked on DSP programming for an audio system, I may ask you about Fourier transforms--and if you make a confused Pikachu face, I may suspect your DSP programming experience isn't as deep as your resume makes it out to be. \n\n(Of course other interviewers have different strategies. And in my experience being interviewed--and keep in mind I do this **all the damned time**--it is perfectly fine to say \"I don't know,\" or to venture a half-remembered guess after confessing the limits of your knowledge. Being honest is more important here than faking knowledge; after all, all answers are just a Google search away once you're on the job. Like, if you did DSP programming but you don't know Fourier transforms, it's okay to say \"I don't know; my job was to code the algorithms given to me by our software architect and optimize them for the blah blah blah processor.\")\n\nRemember too: your job during an interview is to *understand who you are interviewing with.* That is, to some extent, you are always interviewing the interviewers. If you get some asshole who keeps interrupting you and asking you increasingly difficult questions while trying to act like he's the smartest person on the block--and I've had a few interviews like this--is this an asshole you want to work with for the next 15 years of your career? If they act confused or try to gaslight you in the interview--do you think they'll improve *after* the interview? If they act like they're doing you a favor even talking to you in the first place--you know it's going to be a place where they'll act like you should be lucky to be working for them, when, in point of fact, **they should be lucky to have you on their team.**\n\nSo have that conversation, see if you're a fit for them, see if they're a fit for you--and don't worry if they decide to go another way. And **never be afraid to tell someone you're not interested.**",

People have been asking me questions for 25 years so that’s a lot of confused questions. \n\nA place I worked at paid for a multi day training course from a guy who used to work with Vlissades and I think in three days he spent a solid hour to 75 minutes bitching about what a dumpster fire DP was. As he put it, it’s Erich Gamma’s masters thesis in print form. Christopher Alexander has a whole speech about how we have misused his theories, to our own and everyone else’s detriment. \n\nI remember that time. Everyone pumping that book had read Alexander already. Maybe if you’ve read the source the book makes sense, but nobody else had the context and Alexander is more systems thinking, which we all need more of anyway. \n\nI tell people, don’t read design patterns, read Refactoring instead, which will give you the why and how and you can work out the what if your IQ is above 120. If you still want to read DP after that, read Refactoring again because you didn’t absorb the material.",

I read the book several times and understood it. Refactoring is great but it sort of just formalized something that I think a lot of us already had a mental model of. I found that one helpful too because it gave me the framework I'd been ready for, but yeah, it wasn't the brain breaking moment I had from the GoF book",

This second edition applies a highly practical approach to Structured Query Language (SQL) so you can create and manipulate large stores of data. Based on real-world examples, this updated cookbook provides a framework to help you construct solutions and executable examples in several flavors of SQL, including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. SQL programmers, analysts, data scientists, database administrators, and even relatively casual SQL users will find SQL Cookbook to be a valuable problem-solving guide for everyday issues.\n>\n>No other resource offers recipes in this unique format to help you tackle nagging day-to-day conundrums with SQL. The second edition includes: Fully revised recipes that recognize the greater adoption of window functions in SQL implementations Additional recipes that reflect the widespread adoption of common table expressions (CTEs) for more readable, easier-to-implement solutions New recipes to make SQL more useful for people who aren't database experts, including data scientists Expanded solutions for working with numbers and strings Up-to-date SQL recipes throughout the book to guide you through the basics\n\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals. *Reply to any comment with /u/BookFinderBot - I'll reply with book information.

It's clear how much love Bjarne put into writing each page; the target audience is people who have programmed before (in C or Java, for example), but are \"ready\" for the next steps, and the beginning of the book says as much. It is not an introductory text and doesn't pretend to be. It's also not a theoretical computer science book, and is clearly meant for working programmers/practitioners who need to get things done.\n\nFinancially, it's a steal: the first 200 pages or so are the same as \"A Tour of C++\" - which on its own costs around half the price of the book - but you get roughly 1k more pages. Each section of the book could be a book of its own, and each chapter starts with a guide on the topic at hand, and helpfully numbering every section that you can easily revisit or jump around the book if necessary.\n\nOn a personal level, I haven't had as much fun reading a language book since \"The C Programming Language\" by K&R - or maybe \"Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World\" by Joe Armstrong - but Erlang and C are not nearly as \"general purpose\" (for lack of a better term) than C++, for better or worse, and are also a lot simpler by comparison.",

It's FULL of these absolutely helpful truths that saved my actual mind!",

Oh you wanted to try that new message queue? Cool, hope you enjoy debugging why it randomly loses messages at 2am. That distributed database you read about on Hacker News? Awesome, except now deploys take 6 hours and nobody knows why.\n\nAt some point I just got tired. Tired of explaining to product why we're three sprints behind because we're fighting our own infrastructure. Tired of being the only person who understands how some piece of critical infrastructure works because we picked something obscure.\n\nNow I'm boring as hell and I love it. Postgres? Yeah sure. Proven message systems? Absolutely. Things that have documentation written by humans who actually use the product? Sign me up.\n\nYou can still build cool shit with boring technology. Actually you can build way cooler shit because you're not spending half your time debugging your infrastructure instead of writing features.\n\nAnyway yeah, I'm officially old and boring now.

The reasons are exactly the same as why OP suggests embracing proven mature tech: reliability and predictable behavior are king.  \n\nApache, MySQL, and PHP peaked before we learned many painful but valuable lessons about webserver, DB, and framework/language design. Often their mistakes were *how* we learned -- or drove the industry moving in different directions.  Some of those problems cannot truly be fixed retroactively.\n\nIn this day and age, Postgres is better than MySQL in almost every way... and I say this as someone who has gone DEEP in MySQL and DBs in general.  Similarly the alternatives to Apache are generally stronger -- whether it's different webservers (Nginx etc) or alternative architectures such as static CDN-hosted assets + API servers or lambdas.  PHP hasn't aged quite so badly, but other mature languages are stronger on readability and encouraging maintainable practices.",

And that now you have to maintain the database schema in TWO places (in the database, and in the ORM you implement), right? And when the queries break, instead of being able to foist that job onto the database team while you work on something else, you'll have to debug both your code and the database schema just to figure out what's going on? The problem was never that SQL is difficult to deal with, the problem was that *databases* of any substantial complexity are difficult to deal with.\n\nAnd then there's AI, which I don't totally object to, but my prompts keep it very tightly controlled. Even when I do so, I find later on that it did something stupid, like create the exact same method in two different files, which I didn't notice because I only saw that the code was correct, not that it was in the wrong file.\n\nAnd then there's the infinite JavaScript frameworks, where I remember being interviewed as to whether I knew Angular.js (the original version) at the height of its popularity in 2016, and then watch its popularity decline rapidly as it was deprecated for the new version. Code bases aren't very resilient when the language they're written doesn't even last for a decade.",

If the database is simple, there is no problem to solve.\n\nI will point out where ORM is useful: when you need your application to run on the client's servers and talk to their databases, which might be Oracle, SQL Server, MySql, Postgress, etc. An ORM is great as a layer to be database-agnostic. Another aspect is that in this situation, the only place to edit schema is in the ORM, not in any of these databases. Contrariwise, when you have several applications talking to a central database or databases, where they all need to share a common set of data, stored procedures are to be preferred, as they act as an API that enforces all consumers to be limited to valid database actions. An ORM in the later case would imply that any change to the database schema to also be implemented in the dozens of applications using the database via ORM.\n\n",

              "text": "Here's my own spicy take: PRs aren't about reviewing the code, they're about reviewing the change itself.\n\nOn the most superficial level, unless you are dealing with very junior engineers, or very bad engineers, you generally trust that the code works.^1 Instead we focus on two things: how the change fits with everything else. Is the code in the correct style? This isn't about correctness, but about style, the conventions and what not. The other area is about the minimum necessary (i.e. removing functionality that isn't strictly needed, or in the more extreme scenario splitting the PR), ensuring that the code has the explanations (i.e. \"why does this work like this? Or why do we do it this way\" which should be answered with a comment explaining that why in code, but it isn't a change in the code but clarification). Finally we ensure that the code has the necessary work to be resilient (i.e. *enough tests* which are the ones that actually validate that the code is correct).\n\nIn a deeper, more complex setting, PR reviews is an exercise in [building, sharing and spreading the theory that is the actual program](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf), it's not about the code itself, but rather what the code is just an encoded projection of, the theory behind it all. It ensures that things fit within this theoretical framework and move forward.\n\nAnd that theory is not just done by the coders, but everyone involved, QA, SREs, TPMs and even EMs and leadership.\n\nSo it actually makes a lot of sense to have QA review the PR. They may not have a lot to say on the code, but they have a lot to say on ensuring that the tests validate it sufficiently so that we can say it's safe, and they have a lot to say on seeing the code as outsiders, on trying to understand the concept and how the code fits. They'd question things on the theory and philosophy of a change (why, why, why) that a programmer would just assume and ignore, and this are the things we should test on a PR itself. Meanwhile this makes the dev have to take a moment to put on their QA hat and see the code from a point of view that attacks it and tries to deconstruct it, so it results on more resilient code.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be QA alone. If a PM has a clear goal and user-story with an API, having them review the PR that writes (but doesn't implement) the API and some docs might be useful. Doing changes on observability, error reporting, or logging? Bring an SRE to review and give their insight. Let everyone share their view of the theory behind the software beyond what is \"just the code\", but rather all the other things the code interacts with.\n\n^1 Yes there are exceptions where you'll go and critique the code itself, but many times this is about setting expectations and semantic conventions (i.e. it's better to use simpler objects or what not).",

You can elide edge cases by not caring about them, you can renegotiate what you consider mergable because it's just you. You can just take the first thing Claude returns because of this.\n\nSo I can be really productive on side projects at home, where I simply can't be at work. AI at work makes me, idk, in aggregate over a month, like 2% faster? \n\nDon't get me wrong: there are **blocks** of time where it makes you way faster. Eg today I had to quickly knock out some scripts to debug a prod issue. It made something that would have taken 15min take 30 seconds. But I'm not 30x faster all the time, I'm 30x faster for 30 seconds.",

What is tagging? where are the images? how can they check project state? without this genre of information, they will forever be wary of breaking something.\n\nlow confidence devs are paralyzed in an environment they can't navigate. it's impossible to focus on problem-solving when you can't move or orient yourself. \n\nthe best way to get them familiar with these is to show them what they are and what you can do with them in zero-stakes scenarios. Ask them to find things. ask them to check if a trigger in the db exists. ask them to enter a container for secrets or find a function in the repo based on what its name could be. ask them to make a docker image from code in a specific branch. just focus on tasks that have them interacting with a dev env harmlessly until they can do things without needing to ask you how. \n\neven if they still need to google it a month later, they will at least know that they are able to manipulate their environment with a bit of work, and that goes a huge way toward autonomy.\n\nto help speed up their progress in memorizing things however, it can help to export some aliases with them in their *shrc\n\nwork with them on this. have them suggest things they struggle to remember, or things they want to do more easily, and get some basic macros built out. \n\nunfortunately, all that is the easy part.\n\nlow confidence devs will languish here at the stage of 'i can move now' without ever taking these steps further or combining them. they will never trust that these steps can be left to work on their own or automated or chained or piped. They need to see a feedback cycle in action. You need to give them a problem that will hammer their ability to make a change, push it up, see the effect, and then force them to make another change based on the feedback. \n\nI recommend nomenclature updates for this. changing names of functions, classes, variables, etc., in our case, especially useful when they run into .proto, where it isn't as simple as just changing the name. more generically, nomenclature updates that hit external APIs can be a nice lesson in stakeholder management. \n\nnomenclature updates are fairly valuable and fairly low stakes. they're easy to match parity with prod, they make the codebase more understandable for humans and ai, and they touch wide swaths of the codebase. people also tend to feel ownership over things they name, and it can be a great way to get the dev further invested.\n\nhave them follow every step as visually as possible. generic k8s example, they make a change, they save it, they run tests, they commit. head to whatever is running CI: image builds. head to dev env. deploy new image. trigger smoke tests. watch for green. remote debug to see new name in action. check error logs. error? back to code, make change, repeat. hit regression button when you're not spotting easy errors, head to whatever is running your regressions and watch what it's doing. look at logs as regression runs. jot errors down for repeat.\n\nwork on similar exercises as the dev becomes more confident. this is not your or their failing -- they were never supposed to be in this position.\n\nalso, this is all fairly tedious work and it will quickly become apparent if they're trying to take you for a ride anyways, because it's nearly impossible to not learn at this level of direct feedback unless you're actively not engaging with it. I have worked with extremely unintelligent developers on processes to keep them productive; all you need is motivation, the willingness to try, and the courage to ask for direction.",

You need to be having this conversation with their manager first and foremost. Come at it from a perspective of genuinely trying to do the best thing for the company and everyone involved’s career: that due to the intense deadlines you have been put under, you are finding it difficult to have enough time to both mentor this junior engineer and accomplish your assigned workload.\n\nYou may have concerns about the ability of the junior engineer can ever improve, but you also need to consider the possibility that the problem is you, not them. That is, that your teaching style does not resonate with the junior engineer, and given the tine pressure you are under, you are not able to both alter/improve your mentoring ability while simultaneously keeping up with the non-mentoring workload you have. It’s ok, it happens, not every teacher is the right teacher for every student. But you need to be open to that being a possibility, and come at this from a humble place of just trying to set everyone up for success as best you can. Avoid adopting an attitude where it seems like you think you are the ultimate arbiter on if someone can hack it or not.\n\nPresuming you share a manger, this conversation should then move on to how to best handle this situation: either reducing your world load so you can focus more on mentorship, or looking to assign someone else to mentor the junior engineer so that you can focus more on non-mentorship tasks.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your manager, this should also result in an honest conversation about _why_ the junior engineer isn’t improving, which will help the manager understand if it is likely that the junior engineer might improve under different circumstances, or if they really don’t have the chops to ever make the grade.\n\nFinally, leave any implied assumptions of nepotism out of this. Going anywhere near that is only going to hurt you, not help you. If it is nepotism, you’ll just make yourself the bad guy for calling it out and you will get burned. If it isn’t nepotism, it will not look favorably on you that you immediately jumped to that conclusion instead of honestly introspecting on where _you_ may have been failing them as their mentor, and you’ll get burned.

Our product at this point is in the 1,000+ microservices, which helps at scale because most services are tasked with doing this small chunk of work really fast.\n\n1) No, while ideally the producer does a best effort on maintaining order per partition (not per topic). Our data can be visualized as time series data, we care about some device working (being online basically) and when was the last time we saw it. If an event arrives and we have seen the device more recently, then at persist time the event is dropped. \n\n2) Fortunately no, again we are lucky here and can keep things simple. If a batch of events is dropped, we can tolerate it. It’s not ideal, specially for devices with low activity, but at the end of the day it’s a device health system and the data itself is not critical. \n\nWe keep events in memory after consumption from the Kafka topic, our biggest problems would be OOM Kills or pod restarts. Good monitoring prevents the first one, or at least catches it while happening and alerts us to scale the application limits while we debug the root cause and the second one is mitigated by taints on the pods that schedule them as critical backend pods which means they don’t restart unless absolutely needed. In that case the application shuts down cleanly and we can persist whatever is in mem before terminating.",

Naturally, the \"fake it till' make it\" exists on the leadership level, so bad/no experience pretty much encourages even worse decisions, hence the bloated infra & software everywhere. \n\n",

Most roles are trying to protect you from hardware and systems.  So you’re insulated only prioritizing code output with no real care about how what you’re writing is interacting with a broader system.\n\nYou can only get this as a lived experience.  This isn’t some exercise or something you cram for.  You have to feel it in your nervous system. You must design from fear not confidence. You must design as if you are going to be woken up at 3 am to fix it.\n\nThis is hard to imagine when it has never happened to you.  So you seek it only as an abstract risk.  \n\nSo my recommendation is to think in failure modes.  Not only what a system can do, but how can it fail? And if it does fail, how do we recover? What does good vs bad recovery look like?",

Nothing super cool. Simple route that just increase the counter in database table column. \n\nSounds simple right . Then I used load tested that endpoint with k6 first with 10 concurrent users seems good. \n\nThen I tried with 100 concurrent users my request got dropped. Learned how to configure nginx and database connection managers like PG bouncer. \n\nPrevious it’s it PHP then I moved to scale it further to node.js. Still at high scale now single server cannot handle added nginx as load balancer. I felt database as bottle neck where one database can’t push more. Now I have two database and on get I just query two database to show total counter. \n\nLater I added redis to buffer db writes so first write goes to redis which super fast then every 5 sec there will be sync. \n\nSo I learned a lot and trade offs. Then i extended the project as distributed logger. Now it’s a different set of problem. It’s fun and hands to understand key things than just reading system design books.",

What I mean is that there’s multiple SRE teams, but I report to the director and push initiatives based on his need across a few teams. Some of these being POCing new projects, revamping processes, driving cultural improvements. I’m excited to have such an opportunity, but I’m realizing that in the industry this is typically expected of Staff level engineers with about double my YOE. I’m also hitting a bit of a wall, where the teams I’m working with look to me as an extra pair of hands, so I either don’t have enough time to work stories or work team/dept level improvements.\n\nSo similarly to the title, how did you guys grow into the IC role? How did you guys skill up for organizational needs, how do you ensure you’re performant when working many initiatives across teams? What were some of your core learnings when navigating this transition in responsibilities?",

Because that would mean they initially mis-leveled you, and you accepted this “mis-level”. \n\nStaff is all about being a force multiplier for teams and providing leverage. Creating that leverage or multiplication rarely comes from actual work, but rather from architecture or cross organization process. Less “here’s a PR to fix this bug and implement this feature” and more “we have a serious misstep in logging across our app, leading to longer debug time and harder ticket resolutions, here’s a ADR/TDD that we need to implement across the org, starting with this project/area”. \n\nYou need to do more by doing less. You’re not implementing the changes or plugging holes (sometimes yes this might be the case), you’re valued for looking at it at a higher degree and getting your other counter parts (product, infra, data, etc) aligned without your skip. Your team is the one you entrust to actually get it done, and you oversee that to make sure it’s happening. THEN, if you see your team still needs a hand or there’s a skill gap, jump in to get the initiative done.\n\n\nI would also have a frank discussion with your skip about leveling because you will resent thinking you’re operating levels ahead and not actually progressing with the title/promotions.",

It seems so overwhelming and I can't keep all the changes in my head at the same time.\n\nAs an example, one of my coworkers used AI and in a few hours built a custom http server metaframework to allow exposing arbitrary internal library function calls over the network to enable us to split off parts of our application into services. But figuring out how to actually connect any of my work to it and understand how it's configured gives me a migraine. I can't ask for help because nobody on the team really knows how it works or what technologies it uses under the hood, and needing to ask and look manually instead of getting AI to do it means I'm a bad dev. It's gotten to the point where I dread interacting with any new code. How do you deal with the volume of stuff you have to understand on a daily basis?",

There are ways to deliver BETTER solutions faster. It's just painful as fuck to get to that point and it sucks the joy out of coding (for me personally - vibecoders seem to love it).\n\n\nI despise the impact \"AI\" is having on the world. I wish it could have waited another 10 or so years for me to semiretire, but unfortunately it's here. And it's mostly bullshit.

I think with AI, it's like 2 hour AI \"plan mode\" that generates a spec to execute, 5 minutes of coding, 1 hour of testing, and 2 hours of self human code review just so I can understand the code myself, then whatever time for AI and peer code review.

We should all be 'managers' with fleets of AI agent junior devs, and in the same way you wouldn't read every line every junior dev coded you shouldn't read every line your AI agents make, and if you had a question for a junior about strategy you would ask them instead of diving in to look at the implementation.\n\nThe problem I have is that the tooling lies, you can ask the AI \"why did you do X\" and get something completely wrong out, but I seem to be the only one who cares.",

Or when garbage collectors came around and we stopped memory management. People complained about compilers generating inefficient code, there was a lot of skepticism. Garbage collectors are STILL not 100% always more efficient than doing it by hand. \n\nBut the results mattered more. Portability, scalability, saving on human hours, etc. So people iterated on these optimizations and made them more and more robust over time. Nowdays I don't think there's much of a gap left where you would do better than compilers by hand. As in, most programmers rarely care about what's going on under the hood anymore. The same is likely to happen with AI. The code that is written will just go under the hood and we will likely stop caring about them. Smart people will figure out what kind of guardrails to put in, what kind of automated processes to put into place to get things to a state where it won't matter whether the code is clean or human readable at all. \n\nWhat you're seeing is just the transitionary state...there will be confusion...there will be inertia to hold on to the old ways...it will be hard to \"let go\" of the control that writing code by hand provides. But it's best to learn the new way (based on historical evidence). The best of the new ways is probably not figured out yet, but this is transitionary. You should pace yourself and adapt to the paradigm shifts. Understanding the code is still important today but only because it's in transition and it might feel rough for now, but you can still figure out the \"good enough\" approach (ie. maybe move towards rigorously testing behavior/results rather than review every line of code, etc). Over time smarter people will make it work if the trends are to stick ie.\n\nI know there's a caveat that AI is fundamentally non-deterministic (vs compilers for eg are deterministically \"correct\"), and what I said is a bit extreme, but directionally that's the way things are headed. Code readability will likely still matter but less so and it's gonna be about where the balance ends up. It'll be a higher level of abstraction and the change will be profound, even if you can't fully treat it as a black box entirely.",

My experience working with AI coding agents so far has been they are both more capable than the engineers say, and less capable than the PMs/executives think. \n\nI am a mobile engineer by background, about ~15 YoE at this point and have worked professionally in about every space except front end web. I am also late to the AI game. I have been in the \"this cannot build scalable, maintainable code\" camp for years. But in the last 2 months I've gotten access to more or less arbitrary amounts of Claude. \n\nWhat I've found is, in short, it is not very capable of thinking. But it's very capable of implementing. And that itself is a major capability. \n\nI'm used to working in code base with very rigid architecture patterns derived from foundational team libraries. High degrees of decoupling, very perspective in how state and data flow are managed. These patterns were developed to handle introducing new grads into our code base and not have them immediately knock over prod / break main and make 500+ developers waste their time.\n\nWith those requirements both enforced by the compiler and the basics of the good practices guide dropped into CLAUDE.md, I've found that it does an excellent job working inside that well defined box. The blast radius of its mistakes is small, and the scope of the changes is associatively equally small. \n\nIt certainly is not \"write me an app\". But it can be \"write me this state inside this state machine that makes this call to this service and then maps the output into a new view model instance consumed by the renderer\" and it can handle that very well. \n\nReduces the implementation time once I've decided what needs to be done by from ~ an hour to 5 minutes, scaling at about that rate. I do legitimately feel about 500% more productive than I was previously. \n\nPro-AI people, is this the use case you imagine? Do you think I'm handicapping myself not giving it larger scope? \n\nAnti-AI people, am I deluding myself? What do you think the invisible impacts will be that I'm not anticipating? ",

Master it and I guarantee you can get pretty good code out of AI models.\n\nAt the end of the day you still gotta come up with a system, understand the constraints, and then decide on how you want it build.

Even if the features are entirely different, the structural patterns and API/human interface requirements are essentially the same. \n\nDo you feel like that's not the case?

It can read all of your docs in seconds, but it can only hold so much context in memory at one time. So you have to be judicious about how much responsibility to give it, how much information it needs to fulfill that responsibility, and how to efficiently present that information without overwhelming its memory.\n\nThe more agents you onboard, the more you tasks can get done, but that shifts your burden from writing code to reading and reviewing it. The better you are about establishing and enforcing clear patterns, the easier that will be.\n\nIf you structure your applications so that all changes flow through a few common files, you're going to have to resolve a lot of conflicts whenever you have work being done in parallel. If it's structured so that different features live in different files, you're going to have a much easier time.\n\nIn so many ways, it feels so similar.

All I want is something that can run a bunch of automated Java tests without requiring like a month-long manual QA cycle that still manages to miss things.\n\nLet me know if you've brought a company out of a similar situation :]\n\nI've already tried throwing large language models at the problem with some Junior Developers, but even then it looks like it would take over 10 years of solid progress to get to a reasonable point. I'm just hoping there's some standard industry test generator that I'm not aware of 👀",

Even a few coarse tests around critical paths can cut fear way down. Trying to backfill clean unit tests everywhere usually fails, but adding tests only when code changes slowly moves the culture. Auto generation rarely helps much because the hard part is deciding what behavior actually matters. Once people feel changes are safer, buy in tends to follow.",

We updated the old system to be a bit more verbose in logging, and then setup log scrapers that could capture all the inputs and outputs.\n\nWe built into the new system a way to write end to end tests, and a parser to turn the logs into inputs and assert expectations. We used Java, so we leveraged JUnit Dynamic Tests so that we could generate tests automatically from a structured test case json we put together from the logs.\n\nWe then would replay all the activity from the previous day/week and find which cases broke. The cases that broke got committed to the repo, and the passing cases deleted. This carried on for a month or two until we routinely could play an entire week without any failures.\n\nEffectively we turned the current production behaviour into BDD test cases. \n\nIt worked great, and is something that could be applied to existing systems not just rewrites.\n\nThe main thing is refactoring the application to allow you to run it up in a mode that allows for deterministic tests like this.

When I worked with them for a few months in 2020, the code base was 8 years old, had zero unit test coverage, and was full of spaghetti.  After a few weeks of wrestling with it, I decided to go all in on testing and ensure that all work I did was 100% covered by unit tests.\n\nWell, one of my first bug fixes involved fixing a 800-line function inside a 12,000-line file.  There was a lot of spaghetti and a lot of dependencies going on, and I had to do a bit of surgery so that I could mock things.  Long story short, it took me days to get it into a testable state, I introduced a few bugs along the way, and then I was banned from further experiments in testing.  The PR that introduced the tests sat abandoned and was finally closed 4 years after I left.\n\nFast-forward to 2026 and there's still zero test coverage, and last week I revisited the scene of the crime - the function is now 1400 lines long and the file is 14,000 lines.  I'm taking a more realistic approach of trying to write as much as possible of what I change inside new files/classes that can be more easily tested.  At the moment I'm working on a new integration with Microsoft Graph API so that's fairly easy to keep out of the spaghetti zone.  For my 5% time I also have three ideas for separating bits of logic out of the 1,400 line function into smaller, more testable classes.\n\nI don't anticipate progress to be fast, and at this stage I don't anticipate that either of the other devs who work on the code base are going to join me.  Neither of them know anything about testing, and it would be very difficult for them to learn on code that is very poorly factored for testing.  If I can build up a good set of examples of testable code, and figure out a couple of the refactoring challenges, hopefully it would be more approachable for them to learn.",

You won't be able to practically use AI to generate meaningful unit tests, but if you disperse the work and the policy is to write them on a go-forward basis, then AI should be very helpful.\n\nMake sure all affected unit test suites pass before code is allowed to commit, and ideally you can start working toward a CI/CD pipeline that begins by setting up some continuous test servers that can tell you what the last green build is.\n\nBut unit tests will not suffice, not nearly. You should also create e2e tests that cover the basic functionality of the app. Just nail down the major user flows through the system, and make sure those are run as part of the deployment to every environment.\n\nFrom there, you can start writing integration and functional tests that exist in the middle space. The smaller the test, the more functionality it should cover. e2e tests should only verify major user paths through the system, integration and functional tests should try to hit the 80/20 rule, and unit test coverage at the lowest level should cover pretty much everything (that's the goal, obv you're pretty far away from that).\n\nYou should also invest some time in monitoring progress. Set up some publicly visible dashboards on TVs that display team progress toward test coverage, and for each team they should easily be able to display metrics for each team member. Also do some monitoring on the functional side. Publish some dashboards about code quality in production and chart progress by following how improved code quality reduces production issues.

I’ve dealt with something similar. \n\nI was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm in 2020 after a urgent care nurse heard a heart murmur at a Covid test who referred me to a cardiologist who had a top doctor referral to repair my valve and replace that section of aorta. Wild year that was.\n\nTurns out a side effect of open heart surgery where the heart and lungs are bypassed by a heart and lung machine is “pump brain”. Very foggy for many months and definitely felt a dozen IQ points knocked off for a while.\n\nPersonally I switched from the high output grind to a higher level but slower paced role doing mostly design, architecture and reviews. Kept up with the development and it did get easier for me though. Now with LLM tools I find it a nice boost in productivity. I use it for areas that I’ve thought and and designed thoroughly so it’s really just saving typing time and the plug and chug. Remember to keep your doctors in the loop with what your feeling and solution it together as I’ve had to make a LOT of med changes along the way, beta blockers especially.\n\nDealing with a diagnosis like yours can weigh on you emotionally as well, even beyond the meds, so stay open to therapy, supplements, meds etc. that could help that.",

Brain fog can have all sorts of causes, and you are on meds, so this might not work, but most people are deficient in these nutrients:\n\n* Vitamin D (especially if you have dark skin, stay out of the sun, or use lots of sunblock)\n* Magnesium\n* Zinc\n* Iodine (especially if you don't eat seafood or use iodized salt)\n* B-1 and B-12 (you need all B vitamins, but these are the most important for nerve health and most likely to be depleted, and B-12 deficiency is associated with brain fog symptoms)\n\nIf you drink alcohol, just stop. It depletes your body's ability to sleep and regenerate. Getting enough sleep is a key factor in avoiding brain fog.\n\nIn general, research nutrition that promotes nerve health, mitochondrial function, and the ATP Krebs cycle. With luck, researching and focusing on nutrition might mitigate many of your symptoms. Research what nutrients your meds might be depleting, as that might provide a good place to start. Googling \"nutrition deficiencies that cause brain fog\" will confirm what I've said here and offer more detailed information. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

No other design patterns like factory, no inheritance, no interfaces, no event firings for listeners, etc.. Only a container and a composition of services. And frankly I don't see a point to use any of the patterns. Anything you can do with design patterns, you can do using composition.. Input and output matters more than fancy architecture.\n\nI find it is easier to maintain and to read. Everytime someone on the team tries to do something fancy it ends up being confusing or misunderstood or extended the wrong way. And I have been doing that even before drinking Casey Muratoris cool aid about how OOP is bad and things like that.\n\nI know there is a thing in SOLID programming called \"Composition over Inheritance\" but for me it is more like \"Composition over design patterns\".\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n",

You can use factories to compose your composition-based structures.\n\nLet's say you have a config system. You want it to have get/set functions.  That's your interface.  You want it to save to the DB, but also load quickly from redis if it's available. You make a class each for DB and redis, and you make a class for \"chainable\" config drivers which calls the primary (DB) if the cache (redis) can't get the data.  Composition.\n\nBut you've got that get/set as your interface. You can replace your storage classes without worry, just implement behind the interface we defined.\n\nYou might want to support redis in one world, apcu in another. You can use a factory to pick by configuration which set you assemble.\n\nCan you do all this by hard coding the class construction? Sure, but now you just have a factory with poorly defined boundaries. The code is exactly the same.\n\nI would say be careful of recency bias - the last learnt tool being reused for everything - carefully view the world through the lens of \"that probably has, or had a reason to exist\" and be wary of dismissing it before finding specific justification.  Just because you can achieve your goals without something (like events) doesn't mean they aren't useful.\n\nHighly recommend a skim read of the List of Cognitive Bias page on Wikipedia, shit will change your life.",

The result is that you're discovering that \"better design is better than worse design.\"\n\nThe next step is to identify the most stable, core parts of the architecture that encapsulate behaviors of the system that are not going to change over time. The design might not have been structured to encapsulate these in the first place, in which case you have to refactor things just to get things to this point. But once you have core business concepts and behaviors encapsulated, these are **points of stability** in the design. A bank customer has this set of fields that describe them today, they will have that set of fields tomorrow, and ten years from now. A bank customer owns a set of accounts today, that will be true 20 versions from now.\n\nIt's important to identify points of stability in the design because things that don't change are dependable, meaning that they can support dependency. Things that are unstable cannot support dependency.\n\nIf you get out your compiler and start compiling things, you should be able to compile code that represents stable business concepts and behaviors without anything else present, these should be independent. All arrows should point toward these things. The more stable, the more incoming arrows it can support.\n\nThe problem in our industry is that for decades we have heard rules of thumb like \"depend on interfaces instead of code.\" Yes, in general that's true, but there are cases where it's better to depend on super stable code that's unlikely to ever change than it is to depend upon an unstable interface that encapsulates experimental behavior of the system that's still being worked out. You could argue that if there are direct code dependency on stable code, then it's even better to abstract that behavior by encapsulating the contract in an interface and depend upon that as well, and you're absolutely right, but if you prioritize that work over fixing dependency on highly unstable behavior represented in interfaces, you're losing the forest for the trees.",

Part of it is everyone's busy so review gets deprioritized, part of it is codebase complexity meaning understanding the impact of changes requires significant context that takes time to load. Assigning dedicated reviewers just creates bottlenecks when those people are unavailable, and the async nature makes it worse where someone leaves feedback, the author addresses it 8 hours later, then the reviewer doesn't see updates until the next day which stretches everything out. The other thing is review feedback being subjective style stuff rather than actual bugs, so there's multiple rounds of back-and-forth over variable naming or formatting which seems like a waste of time but people have opinions about it. Some prs apparently sit for a week before merging which is pretty absurd for any company trying to move fast, and pair programming helps for critical stuff but it's exhausting and doesn't scale…. what approaches actually work for keeping review quick without it becoming rubber-stamping where people just approve without really looking?",

The style guide should specify enough detail that it should resolve pretty much all of these subject issues by taking a stance, not because it's a better or worse way of doing it, but because consistency across the entire codebase is better than inconsistency, even if the style guide chooses the worse option. Or, in cases where inconsistency has little to no cost (or even benefit), then it should clearly state that coders should either defer to local style (meaning that style should conform to whatever is the prevailing way in that file, module, or team), or that it really doesn't matter and reviewers that raise it should be redirected to take it up with the style guide instead of the code author.\n\nThe second thing is that your org needs an SLA around code reviews. For changes that total less than 100 lines touched, < 4h, for changes greater than 100 lines, 8h per 500 lines of code added/changed/deleted. Whatever the SLA is, set up a dashboard and display everyone's last 30d of code review activity.\n\nThe problem your org likely has is that PRs are too big. Changes should be split into the smallest cohesive set of changes possible, and the above SLA will encourage everyone to keep their PRs under 100 lines if at all possible. At the very least, people will be encouraged to collect bigger changes that are conceptually weighty into PRs that require more review attention instead of clubbing together a ton of little, independent things into the same PR.\n\nYour issue tracker should also allow issues to be tagged with specific PRs. The way to keep all of this organized is to create a tracking issue for each task (preferably that belongs to a parent issue for each project an individual owns). Then individual issues can track conceptual sub-tasks and accumulate tags for the set of little PRs that contribute to changes. This seems like a lot of bookkeeping, but if your tooling is good enough to handle this, it has tons of benefits. It becomes easy to track down issues when a CL needs to be rolled back, it creates a fine-grained view of where things are for task tracking, and it makes it very easy to substantiate your contributions in your self-eval at perf time.\n\nI actually keep a running self-eval doc. I book fifteen minutes after lunch every Friday which I allocate to updating that doc with detailed links to what I'm working on and notes to myself. When self-eval time comes it's pretty much a cut'n'paste for me because I've been keeping it all year long, so it's easy to adapt into whatever format is requested.",

Larger PRs have the potential to generate more comments, and for it to take you longer to address those comments.\n\nRe variable naming and other subjective things - this is an indication that other people aren't finding your code as easy to read as it could be.  In a year's time, you will also not find your code as easy to read as you do now.  I default to accepting any suggested changes there because I think it produces the most legible code longterm.

Linters and formatters solve the style debate thing completely, there's no reason humans should be arguing about that in 2026. The other thing is that review work is invisible. If your team tracks velocity in tickets completed but reviews don't count, of course people deprioritize them. We started treating review as explicit sprint work and the turnaround dropped from days to hours. We're also building [axiomo.app](http://axiomo.app) to help with the context side of it, pulling up contributor history and risk signals so you're not reading 400 lines to find the 30 that are tricky.",
