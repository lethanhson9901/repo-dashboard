      "text": "You sure have heard it, it has been repeated countless times in the last few weeks, even from some luminaries of the developers world: \"AI coding makes you 10x more productive and if you don't use it you will be left behind\". Sounds ominous right? Well, one of the biggest promoters of AI assisted coding has just put a stop to the hype and FOMO. Anthropic has published a paper that concludes:\n\n\\* There is no significant speed up in development by using AI assisted coding. This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.\n\n\\* AI assisted coding significantly lowers the comprehension of the codebase and impairs developers grow. Developers who rely more on AI perform worst at debugging, conceptual understanding and code reading.\n\nThis seems to contradict the massive push that has occurred in the last weeks, where people are saying that AI speeds them up massively(some claiming a 100x boost) and that there is no downsides to this. Some even claim that they don't read the generated code and that software engineering is dead. Other people advocating this type of AI assisted development says \"You just have to review the generated code\" but it appears that just reviewing the code gives you at best a \"flimsy understanding\" of the codebase, which significantly reduces your ability to debug any problem that arises in the future, and stunts your abilities as a developer and problem solver, without delivering significant efficiency gains.\n\nLink to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245)",

          "text": "Interesting study, thanks for posting. This seems to be a key passage:\n\n>Motivated by the salient setting of AI and software skills, we design a coding task and evaluation around a **relatively new asynchronous Python library** and conduct randomized experiments to understand the impact of AI assistance on task completion time and skill development. We find that using AI assistance to complete tasks that involve this new library resulted in a reduction in the evaluation score by 17% or two grade points (Cohen’s d = 0.738, p = 0.010). Meanwhile, we did not find a statistically significant acceleration incompletion time with AI assistance...\n\n>Through an in-depth qualitative analysis where we watch the screen recordings of every participant in our main study, we explain the lack of AI productivity improvement through the additional time some participants invested in interacting with the AI assistant. Some participants asked up to 15 questions or spent more than 30% of the total available task time on composing queries... We attribute the gains in  skill development of the control group to the process of encountering and subsequently resolving errors independently. We categorize AI interaction behavior into six common patterns and find three AI interaction patterns that best preserve skill development... These three patterns of interaction with AI, which resulted in higher scores in our skill evaluation, involve more cognitive effort and independent thinking (for example, asking for explanations or asking conceptual questions only).\n\nThis study isn't so broad based as to say \"AI is useless\" (other studies find mixed results). But with a new library that's probably not in the LLM's training data, it may not help much. The study does seem to confirm that using an AI means you don't learn as much.\n\nSo it seems to confirm what we already knew: AI is best at re-solving problems that are already solved in its training data, and not so good at solving original problems. If you rely on AI, you don't learn as much as if you did it yourself.",

              "text": "OP seems to be wildly misinterpreting the meaning of this, and the crowd is cheering lol. There is no contradiction between some tasks moving faster and, at the same time, reduction in people's understanding of the corresponding codebase. That's exactly the experience people have been reporting: they're able to jump into unfamiliar codebases and make changes that weren't possible before LLMs. Now, do they actually understand what exactly they're doing? Often not really, unless they're motivated to achieve that and use LLMs for studying the details. But that's exactly what many employers want (or believes that they want) in so many contexts! They don't want people to sink tons of time into understanding each obscure issue, they want people to move fast and cut corners. That's quite against my personal preferences, but that's the reality we can't ignore. \n\nThe big question to me is this: when a lot of your time is spent this way, what is it that you actually become good at and what are some abilities that you're losing over time as some of your neural paths don't get exercised the way they were before? And if that results in an increase in velocity for some tasks, while leaving you less involved, is that what you actually want?\n\nFWIW I think many people are vastly underestimating the value of LLMs as education/co-learning tools and focus on codegen too much. Making a few queries to understand how certain pieces of the codebase are connected without having to go through 5 layers yourself is so fucking brilliant. But again, when you're not doing it yourself, your brain changes and the longer term effects are hard to predict.",

                  "text": "the biggest difference, at least for me in this field is seeing what LLM did to those that cant code comfortably vs those that code comfortably.\n\nSome of my team members main manual QA and EM that rarely code got \"elevated\", mostly on greenfield project or tasks. They suddenly realized they can do it, of course at the expense of \"we have to review it\". Ofc they still wont be able to create more than we do because lack of \"experience\" and in my opinion, they still learn because of the review process (they are not solo vibe). This wont scale but it is much better utilization of a tool.\n\nFor me, the biggest benefit for LLM is that I spent little time on research and just ask LLM to explore the codebase for let say adopting new tool. Like yesterday, I just want to see if asyncapi can  be used to what I wanted. LLM generated the code for bootstrap, I tested it and there were some blocker issues so I opted for easier approach or solution. I spent maybe 30 minutes and disrupted many times. Without LLM I probably spent way longer than that..\n\nOn another project, I asked the LLM \"I want to migrate this endppint to another repo, tell me if there are any PII data that is exposed and not being used by client\". Put several project inside 1 folder and ask the LLM, results are out no need to ask the FE side to invest their time on this. They can just review the code or agreed with the plan.\n\nSo different level will have different usage. Rubberducking is a must for me and devs need to prepare more at the beginning with proper testing now since execution CAN (i said can, not must) be delegated to LLM",

The differences in this AI adoption style correlate with completion time. In Figure 13, we isolate the task completion time and compare how the method of AI adoption affects task completion time and quiz score. Participants in the AI group who directly pasted (n=9) AI code finished the tasks the fastest while participants who manually copied (n=9) AI generated code or used a hybrid of both methods (n=4) finished the task at a speed similar to the control condition (No AI). There was a smaller group of participants in the AI condition who mostly wrote their own code without copying or pasting the generated code (n=4); these participants were relatively fast and demonstrated high proficiency by only asking AI assistant clarification questions. These results demonstrate that only a subset of AI-assisted interactions yielded productivity improvements.\n\n...\n\n> For skill formation, measured by quiz score, there was no notable difference between groups that typed vs directly pasted AI output.

AI just regurgitates over confident comments and hundreds of lines of code, it’s impossible to review or to follow. You need to use another fucking AI to review the PR and this is clearly AI slope.\n\nNow, these AIs are good to put together MVPs and going from 0 to 1. But more often than not this MVP is just smoke in the mirror to present to some executives. The real product has to be rebuilt from scratch after you realize that the AI put together something that isn’t scalable, breaks with many edge cases, isn’t following any security standards, it’s just spaghetti code mixing up some medium tutorial with random docs on the web…\n\nAI didn’t increase productivity. It increased the rate at which teams build MVPs and dramatically slowed down real production grade development, it’s creating a lot of “fatigue” for engineers to review hundreds of lines of spaghetti code and adopt whatever hyped up tool is out there.\n\nObviously if you’re building a “personal project”, now developing APIs and websites has become trivial in the context of a personal project that likely will never make 1 dollar of revenue.

I wanted to know exactly what they meant by 'competency'.  \n\nWhat they did was they got some novice programmers on a timed webapp that presents leetcode looking interface to solve their programming tasks.  You use python and they provide a library that they created, so you are forced to learn how to use the new library to implement the tasks they set out.  It looks like a simple asyncio wrapper and the questions are like, run some async functions in the correct order that print out \"Hello World\".\n\nThen afterwards they quiz the participants on different types of questions, multiple choice questions about how the library works, code reading questions where they have to answer what the code will do and debugging questions where they ask them to identify a bug in example code.\n\nI can totally see how someone coming into a task like this with AI could come out less competent and I think it's actually a pretty good test.  The most interesting graph to me in the abstract was where they graphed 'ways to use ai' on competency/time axis.  You can see that people using AI iteratively to solve debugging problems scored very low on competency and low on time (took longer).  Whereas people who used it to generate code and then they took time to read it scored still lower on time but the highest on competency.  \n\nSo basically there are different approaches to using AI that offer tradeoffs for competency and time.  All of this is pretty much obvious I think to what experienced people who've used AI would expect but it's nice to see it demonstrated.\n\nAlso I don't put much weight on their findings for negligible speed improvements.  This sort of task is not a good demonstration of speed benefits of AI imo.  Even they point out a significant amount of time wasted just writing the prompts over and over.  Keep in mind, these are novice's that don't even know what async programming is, they are going to suck at prompting because they don't know what to tell the AI to do until they spend time learning.  I bet I spend way more time prompting AI to generate me some CSS than a professional webdev who already knows CSS would.\n\n**TLDR** There are good ways and bad ways to use AI.  Be sure to use the good ways, if you feel like it saves you a bunch of time it probably does.  This test wasn't a great way to gauge professional developer time savings but the competency pitfalls are there and IMO professionals can easily fall for those.",

And when the code base becomes so spaghettified that the agent creates a bug for each fix it produces, and the human has to chip in and understand, shit hits the fan. Also I wouldn't trust that person in design meetings because he has no awareness of the \"nitty gritty\" so he can only talk in high level concepts out of his ass that ignore the reality he isn't aware of. \nPersonally I see more and more code in my company that doesn't align with the design that the people who \"wrote\" claim it follows.\n\nI guess part of the problem is that people equate ai assistants to how high level languages replaced c. You don't need to know c when you work with python, right. But with python, your product is the python code, alongside with your knowledge of the product requirements. With ai assistants, your product is still the python code. So it is just another tool, one that replaces thinking, but doesn't abstract the need for understanding, just postpones it until its too late",

I've been working on it for 2 years already—not a big service. 2 other guys wrote it in 7 months 4 years ago, then it was handed over to my team for maintenance and further development.   \nB: the related UI written in react. It is handcrafted as well, but in a bad way, quite messy..\n\nA few months ago a contractor came to help out. He did some vibe coding, and managers were amazed.. That left me with no choice—I had to pick it up as well. I am using Cursor, licensed from the company.\n\nAnd it does have a multiplier effect, but I think it's because I had time to understand the codebase deeply. In the contractor's PRs, I had to reject a lot of changes because he just wasn't as familiar with the code and took the AI's advice and it would have break other features.\n\nWe actively integrated vibe coding into our workflow, BUT quality and maintenance come first.\n\nIf we have a new feature, we start to vibe code the happy path - usually done in one day and it is great. We use it for getting early feedback (like we figured out that it looks good on the design, but it's hard to use for the user).\n\nAfter this is ready, we still break it into small actionable items and go through it the kinda \"traditional\" way. Because the vibe coded version does work... but the amount of junk it creates is terrible.\n\nSo for me it's funny when I see this \"done in one day\" post on Twitter. I know that the code behind it is an unmaintainable mess.\n\nwent of topic, sorry, my point is: You have to have a good understanding otherwise you just making random changes",

It also affords me the ability to iterate quickly, because changing the code to match fluctuating requirements is trivial. Anyone claiming otherwise is full of shit.\n\nI suspect that these \"studies\" and dev reports are comparing apples and oranges. I can certainly write happy-path solutions really quickly.

They mainly supervise, create specs and acceptance criteria, and act as product manager, QA, and dev ops. They review a plan made by the AI agent and give approval before moving forward.

Those devs that aren't able to leverage the agents correctly continue to produce bad or broken code, often facilitated by incorrect assumptions about the system. We're trying to standardize the workflow so they at least have to function as a sort of solutions architect if they're not going to upskill as a SWE.",

      "text": "EM with 10+ years of experience as both an IC/senior engineer and a team lead. This and the other programming and AI subs are making me feel like _either_ the rest of the world is losing its grip on reality, or I already have. Please help me figure out which.\n\nMy team fully adopted Claude Code last year, after some unstructured experimenting with Claude, Cursor, and Copilot. We all agreed having a single \"target environment\" for any \"agent instructions\" we might want to share team wide. We've set about building a shared repo of standalone skills (i.e., skills that aren't coupled to implementation details in our repos), as well as committing skills and \"always-on\" context for our production repositories. We've had Claude generate skills based on our existing runbooks in Confluence, which has also produced some nice scripted solutions to manual runbooks that we probably wouldn't have had time to address in our day-to-day. We've also built, through a combination of AI-generated and human-written effort, documentation on our stack/codebase/architecture, so at this point Claude is able to reliably generate plans and code changes for our mature codebases that are at an acceptable level (roughly that of an upper mid-level engineer) in one shot, allowing us to refine them and think more about architectural improvements instead of patching.\n\nBeyond that, we've started using OpenSpec to steer Claude more deliberately, and when paired with narrowly-focused tickets, we're generating PRs that are a good, human-reviewable length and complexity, and iterating on that quickly. This has allowed us to build a new set of services around our MCP offering in half the time we normally experience. As we encounter new behavior, have new ideas, learn new techniques, etc., we share them with the team in a new weekly meeting just to refine workflows using AI.\n\nMost of our tickets are now (initially) generated using Claude + the Atlassian MCP, and that's allowed us to capture missed requirements up-front. We're using Gemini notes for all our tech meetings, and those are being pulled in as context for this process as well, which takes the mental load of manually taking a note to create a ticket and then remembering to do it with appropriate context off the table entirely. We can focus on the conversation fully instead of splitting focus between Jira-wrangling and the topic at hand. When a conversation goes off the rails, processing the Gemini notes in Claude against the ACs and prior meetings helps steer us back immediately, instead of when we might later have realized our mistake.\n\nThis isn't perfect, as we occasionally get some whacky output, and it occasionally sneaks into PRs. From my perspective as a manager, this is no worse, if it better, than human-generated whacky output, and because our PR review process hasn't had to change, this hasn't been a problem. Most of the team is finding some excitement in automating away long-held annoyances and addressing tech debt that we were never going to be allowed to handle the old-fashioned way. We've also got one teammate who just _does not appreciate_ in AI in general which... I'm not sure what to tell anyone with that attitude at this point. I get that feeling, and it's my job as a manager to coach people through that, but I can't _make_ someone take an interest in a new tool. I'm still working on that.\n\nBut, while it's not perfect, it is _good enough_, in the sense that it's at least as good as the results we got in a pre-AI world (and yes, I hand-wrote this bulleted list):\n\n- Crappy notes if any got taken at all, because dividing your attention is hard\n- Crappy tickets because engineers would rather write code than futz with Jira. See also: defective PM behavior\n- Manually integrating documentation in 15 different systems because engineers want to use Markdown files in GitHub, managers want to use Confluence, some people want to create multiple versions of the same Google Doc even though versioning and tabs are natively supported, and PMs are using a still additional platform that's not even integrated with Jira\n- Documentation or runbooks that didn't get updated until after the incident where they'd have been relevant\n\nBuilding workflows and content with Claude around all this has sped things up to the point that an otherwise overwhelmed team can actually keep up with all of the _words words words_ around the code itself that contribute to making long-term maintenance and big projects a success. You just have to be judicious about how you're building these workflows.\n\n...Meanwhile, half of what I see here is \"slop slop slop\", complaints about managers pushing AI for no good reason, concerns about brain rot, predictions of AI's imminent demise and a utopian future where AI idolaters are run out of the industry because they can't remember how to code by hand and the graybeards are restored to the throne, etc. I hesitate to just say \"skill issue\", but the complaints and concerns here just don't reflect the reality I'm seeing on my team, or peer teams that are similarly engaging with the tools. And we're not even a good company! Leadership sucks and doesn't have any interest in empowering Engineering as a department to improve itself.\n\nAm I missing something? I'm not suggesting this is sustainable, because I can't help but feel like we'll get too good at this and upper management will decide the \"team in a box\" we've built out of skills/context/scripts is all they need, but that's a leadership problem, not an AI problem. But aside from that... maybe you're doing it wrong. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong?\n\nNo AI was involved in this post, except for the time I saved by importing/summarizing my EU colleagues meeting transcripts from before I woke up.",

That's software design questions like how do we handle migrating to an event based architecture. The vast majority of Devs do not engage with this theoretical discussion, they just want to progress their own work which has a much smaller scope, and they just want to know enough to do that.\n\nHaving AI able to structure my thoughts and translate them into something understandable for those junior Devs is an absolute game changer. I can monologue my mental model and thoughts into a text file with no paragraph breaks or punctuation, get copilot to structure it, and then get copilot to *re*structure it for specific purposes.\n\nFor instance, someone working on data layer fixes needs to know how we handle transactions and concurrency. I can now query my own thoughts, have an LLM read through the documentation I've generated, have it translate it into a form this specific individual will understand, and only share the information they need. All I do is scan through for accuracy and clarity, tweak it a bit, and send off. A project manager needs a ELI5 of some component for the steering committee? I can do that in seconds.\n\nThis only works because I have such an in-depth understanding in the first place, it doesn't replace that. But it means I can very quickly answer very complex questions with almost no thought required, because checking an output is much faster than writing it myself.

Caching is the best example: if you don't explicitly tell it to cache something, it won't, and it shouldn't, because there's a _huge_ amount of requirements relating to cache management that can't be figured out without human input.\n\nI recently used AI to build a service that implemented a tiered caching strategy (local disk, then NoSql DB) but the data was sensitive and needed to be client side encrypted before writing to the DB. The data to be cached was also very expensive to generate, so distributed locking was needed for cache population as well. It took a LOT of iterating to get to the final result. \n\nWas that my fault? Absolutely! Because I didn't originally write the gory details of caching into the spec. I just said \"the response should be cached for 24 hours\" and it just generated code for a thread-unsafe in-memory cache. It did what I asked it to do, but it didn't stop to think about how that code would function in a high volume, highly concurrent, distributed environment. Is that also my fault? Probably, because I forgot to include that information in the specs.\n\nAI code is only as good as the requirements you give it, and if you can't think of _all_ of your requirements up front, it'll never generate the code you want.",

The plan was as follows: use Claude to build a Redis Pub/Sub feature into our microservice driven application. At it's most basic form, it's an broker microservice and a tester. Both horizontally scale on K8s.\n\nOkay... I prompted Claude and used my engineering expertise to guide it. Nobody without engineering chops could've done this. But whatever. I directed for about 6 hours and eventually we had a working end to end system that did what I needed it to do.\n\nI created a draft PR and then decided to try rewrite the same feature by hand.\n\nIt took me roughly the same time (actually a little bit less). \n\nThe results was kinda insane to me and has made me a much bigger AI skeptic than I already was.\n\nWhat I thought was \"decent AI\" code was absolute slop. It was creating custom types everywhere rather than reusing them. It had missed endless error checks (it's Golang. It's a best practice to return an error and check the error). I had no real idea of the underlying codebase. When I first checked the draft PR... it kinda looked okay on paper. But once I compared it to the code I wrote myself... it was abundantly obvious how many edge cases you just don't think about when you're not building a mental model by writing a feature up yourself. Prompting does not build the same model and you're relying on AI to try do everything for you: it's not going to happen.\n\nMy takeaway from it was... ALWAYS write the code myself first. And only once completed... use AI as a fresh grad to look over my PR for obvious mistakes. I won't be handing any features to AI in the foreseeable after this experiment. It has a LONGGGG way to go.",

We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. \n\nOdds are, you aren’t creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementation.

They won’t be watching, skeptically, for assumptions that are excluded in coded  conditionals and api calls. They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- it’ll be lgtm’d and shipped. You’re shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write. \n\nAnd that’s not even getting to consider that the requirements no one’s bothered to digest are well written.\n\nI’ve gotten into the habit of tacking “-ai” into google because when I read that top blurb, I’m already influenced to think a certain answer.

The cost of inference probably won’t drop fast enough. It might not drop at all given the short lifespan of GPUs. The cost of just keeping things going would exceed the current revenues until new entrants or new factories are spun up to meet demand and that’s like a decades long process due to the proprietary tech behind GPUs and the complexity of manufacturing.\n\nI use AI in parts of my workflow.

Ideally with detailed instructions on how to innovate (in other words, they can't innovate).\n2. Most people will give an afternoon's attempt at a naive implementation and then say it's worthless because they were pretty much ready to drop it from the start \n3. People do not understand that this process requires harnesses and frameworks and processes in place. It's not fire and forget and no one leveraging it successfully is claiming it is. We are not taking about vibe coders. We're talking companies with actual products and architectures using it. Of course you weren't just going to plop the thing in and say \"do a magic!\" And watch beautiful code roll out. \n4. There are legitimate problems with using AI or low-health codebases or codebases that have real limitations on the ability to reduce complexity or produce reliable documentation.  These people have identified a very real boundary of AI\n\nAI gains are not free. Making your AI platform is as much of a product as anything else. \n\nUsing AI is a skill as complex as using any other dev tool. This is a little counterintuitive because it used natural language as an input, but that is not the extent of the depth of interaction there.\n\nNot all codebases are healthy enough to support it realistically. If the cyclomatic complexity is dog crap, if there are no feedback mechanisms (tests, code scans, security gates, etc) for AI to use to see if it is done or not, AI will go off the rails. If dependencies are super non-standard to the point the AI has to load everything in context to reason about it, you have blown your efficient context window just trying to figure out how to use a dependency. Etc etc etc\n\n\nThose projects have no hope of using AI in any substantial way beyond a helper tool, at best. \n\n\n\n\nAnd some people just hate change. Especially java engineers. They will fight against this until Oracle puts AI in the compiler... Then they will talk about how AI was always a best practice. If it's not in java it's a violation of God's will, and then when it finally is, it was always a best practice and java supports it as well as it needs to (despite it looking like a baby mangled by a pitbull in its implementation).",

You paint a VERY rosy picture here, and there are no mentions of the problems you've faced or still face, roadblocks, tradeoffs etc. Every engineer I ever knew or most of the engineers that discuss AI on the internet constantly mention the tradeoffs and the problems.\n2. On a related note, why is that one engineer not adapting? Have you heard their concerns and thoughts, are they completely invalid? Are engineers fully onboard except for that one or are people not free to voice their concerns? The narrative just paints them as rhe annoying dev that refuses to adapt \n3. Many things here just do not match my experience. Gemini meeting transcripts are very hit or miss in my experience, I've found that Claude consistently produces sub-junior level code if used without heavy handholding.\n4. Just the documentation step you've described would've taken months for us. Is the project a greenfield one? \n\n\nEven though I'm skeptical due to the reasons above, if it actually works for you, great! It just doesn't match my experience or general outlook that a tool this flawed would work this perfectly for someone. ",

              "text": "A friend of mine who is an engineering manager described two engineers who worked for him and their use of AI. His company decided to mandate the use of AI by all developers, so everyone was forced to use it. \n\nOne guy was struggling before AI, but now a ticket that might have taken him a week or more would be completed in less than a day. His productivity was seriously accelerated by the addition of AI to his workflow. It's been a force multiplier, and he was able to close five tickets a week where he previously would barely complete a single ticket. \n\nAnother guy, before AI came along, it was hard to keep him busy. He'd close 15-20 tickets a week and still have time free to help others. His code was always flawless and he left everything he touched better than he found it.\n\nAfter developers were required to generate code using AI, his productivity *fell*. It cut his productivity in half. He complained nonstop about the requirement to use AI for everything. He still managed to complete more tickets than the first guy, but it absolutely slowed him down. \n\nI'm pretty sure this is the real divide we're seeing: There is a tremendous range of skill of professional developers. At the low skill end of the spectrum, AI is a strict win. They didn't really understand what they were doing to begin with, and so having an AI that also doesn't understand anything do all their work is an improvement. At the other end of the spectrum, developers know how everything should work, and when AI gets it wrong, which it does frequently, they need to keep massaging the results until it's correct, or they need to just write the code by hand.\n\nThe two guys above are extremes, and most of us are in the middle somewhere. But developers at a company often cluster around similar skill levels: Companies that don't screen for high skill at all will be like OP's company where mostly everyone agrees the code is perfect except for the one guy who is objecting, who might turn out to be the highest skill developer on their team. Other companies have a stricter hiring process and have mostly developers who are already higher productivity than the AI can sustain.\n\nSo we get two kinds of contradictory reports about the effectiveness of AI because AI helps some of us much more than it helps others.",

While there's always human editing after the fact (everyone's reviewing their AI generated meeting notes... right? right?), for documents that don't really matter in the grand scheme of things (lots of words that have a low chance of ever being read again but are good to have for record keeping) this is a good productivity boost.",

We wrote a spec to do a fairly simple task.  At the end of the session we had a 500 line spec document we had generated.  We then ran this through claude to write the task code and ended up with a 230 line code file.  Does it work? sure.  Did it take several hours to write a spec that was far more complex than the actual code generated? yes.  \n\nThe actual problem i have with AI is it is going to answer you.

We have basically unlimited funds for tooling and we're big into data collection for everything possible. We have quarterly dev surveys for all kinds of topics, purely so the tooling teams can get a sense of what people are feeling. I'd say 70% of the engineers answer these surveys, with a large percentage of them giving very detailed feedback since we actually use the surveys to push for new tooling and technologies, so a lot of people are quite vocal.\n\nIt's a large org with many types of people from all walks of life, all working on very different things, so there's a diverse set of opinions always.\n\nThe latest one about 2 weeks ago had a section about AI tooling, specifically agentic coding, IDE tooling, PR/MR bots like CodeRabbit, summarization and note taking tooling, and other categories I'm forgetting. The feedback has been overwhelmingly \"meh\" for pretty much every single category. \n\nI wish I could post the full thing because it's illuminating me on the reality vs what the online hype would lead you to believe, but from where I'm standing it's *at best* a moderately useful tool in some niches, specifically for handling tiny tasks that are not complex, but are annoying to handle manually while being easy to verify.\n\nAnything outside of that window, it hasn't really improved efficiency for anyone all that much. *None* of the teams are getting more done, at least nothing appreciable anyways. We can see from the number of MRs that it's basically as steady as ever. Tickets get closed in the same amount of days as before, projects and epics aren't progressing any faster. The only real noticeable difference is an uptick in documentation like READMEs, ADRs and other things like that which, sure can be nice, but does that really justify the valuations and the crazy bubble we're in?\n\nThat's the gist of many people's problems with LLMs. I think they are undeniably useful for certain applications, and hell from a pure nerd POV it's kind of insane that we can use plain language to talk to our computers, but all of that coolness and semi-usefulness is being propped up by an INSANE hype bubble, all built on lies and deceptive practices, and often outright theft.  \n\nWe're at the point where OpenAI is buying out 40% of *the world's supply of RAM* in order to feed the infinite data centers they want to build. All for a technology that, AT BEST, makes work mildly more convenient in some circumstances. All in exchange for massively increased energy and electricity usage, a MASSIVE financial bubble that will be devastating once popped, bot farms and scammers having the times of their lives, and so much more crap.",

You find them post releases because review is less thorough since AI is overtly verbose and human are generally lazy. On top of that, the overall codebase loses all of its form. No strong patterns, no clear structure, just random slop with deduplication and overtly verbose comments all over. \n\nIt wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so aggressively pushed down on us, I think the technology would speak on it's own if it was that great and you wouldn't have to convince people. I guess you don't get that either.",

It is not aware of the distinctions and nuances of the individual languages any more than the sample code used to train it, and it would need new training every time a new language version drops.  That second part is what leads to issues as building on a prior model means the prior learning is still there, and eventually if there are many possibilities to the same pseudo code it causes hallucinations, where it can muddle the answer.  \n\nAnd if the AI learns something wrong, well now we really have a problem don't we?",

          "text": "I get downvoted for talking about this a lot. I build for big enterprises, early startups, traditional data engineering, backend dev, and building agents, work with Claude Code for all of it, and it works very well.\n\nSome reasons I think it works for me:\n\n- Most of my career I've been in small startups (or founded them) and owned everything I did end to end. I was dev, manager, and PM, met with customers (usually internal) to clarify and deliver on their needs. These skillsets are really necessary.\n- Architecture and design >>> keypecking. While I enjoy writing code in flow, more than anything I like to design the major systems and produce an outcome even more.\n- I always have done a lot of upfront work before working on code. My existing workflow fits really well into working with coding agents.\n- It's a tool. You can't (and shouldn't) one-shot most things, ignore the outputs, shirk responsibility for code you push, or think of it as a magical machine god and get good output from it.\n- Communication skills are important. I'm also a writer, and in my days of having to PM and wield all sorts of communication skills to get my work done, so this method of interaction is really aligned with that.\n\nWhy I think people here don't like it?\n\n- A lot of people in the industry and here are used to receiving tickets, coming up with good solutions, and implementing them. There's less interest or experience in bigger-picture work.\n- Didn't take the time to learn the tools. These still have a learning curve, and a lot of people don't have the time or desire to spend time on a tool when they have other deadlines and life stuff. There are techniques, workflows, and more to learn to get the most out of these tools.\n- Had a bad experience with other tools & models. Copilot is hot garbage and always has been, as far as coding models go, Opus 4.5 only came out in the last few months and blows even Sonnet 4.5 out of the water. Non-Anthropic models can barely touch either.\n- Had bad experience with older models. The rate of change happening is mind-boggling. Even just 1 year ago I wouldn't trust an LLM beyond 1-4 lines autocomplete (justifiably). Now? Working on massive codebases is nothing and I can one-shot simple stuff from my phone.\n- Feel threatened. This is entirely natural. I don't think our industry will disappear, but it's going through another sea change, and this is terrifying.",

Without Opus and claude code I'm sure it would have taken more than a month of work and the quality would have been garbage too since this is a tasks that no one wants to do. \n\nAnyone who says \"no productivity gains\" has no skill in using the LLM or is just not a good software engineer.\n\nIt is deceptively easy to think you know how to use it because the interface is a text box but using the right words, structure and details makes a night and day difference in the models output and many people just don't get it.\n\nLike if you say to an AI make me a beautiful website it spits out garbage and people are like \"Hey! Look at this slop!\"\n\nIt's a fucking AI model. You ask a generic question you get a generic looking good website.\n\nThis is before we even mention the fact most people don't even know the gap between the free models -> entry premium models -> high end models.",

The test usually gets the shape right but the details wrong, so I take the time to fix this up which saves me time on boilerplate.\n- I ask it to then fix the test. Half the time it spins for a few minutes and figures it out, and the other half the time it gets distracted by some detail so I need to give it my expert input to get it on the right track.\n- I asked it to do some profiling and optimization yesterday and it kept focusing on loading, which was not making any difference. After prodding it to look elsewhere it found a couple of other recursion optimizations which didn't do much for overall time but were technically better. Then it also found a serialization check that when turned off saved 25% of test time. So I guess I'm more confident now that there's no low hanging fruit for optimization.\n- Completely rewrote the documentation for the repo - taking a sloppy human mess and making it organized, and then adding 2x more info on top of that. However, I did need to comb through this because there's a ton of details that are more generic wording than correct in context.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the point of using skills or openspec, but in a few weeks in my spare time I've been able to fix a ton of stuff in this repo that has been neglected for years and years and was never going to get done. That being said, the difference between Claude Opus and Sonnet is stark.",

I personally have been a professional dev for twenty-five years. So we have a ton of learned experience from a career of mistakes and lessons learned, changing paradigms, other great devs to learn from, terrible devs to also learn from, etc. So we feel we have a clear idea of what good code smells like and can guide the AIs (mostly Claude) to good outcomes. I personally use it constantly all day now for almost every task. It’s still necessary to roll up our sleeves and hand code things sometimes, but that is getting less and less frequent. \n\nThe real concern is for new devs who don’t have the experience to know what is good and what is slop. What a good decision looks like vs “idk gpt said this”. How do you teach someone what that is, without going through years and years of making mistakes in the trenches, breaking prod, fixing it, etc? How do you teach the average person to guide the models through their iterations, course correct them etc? I don’t have a good answer. \n\nTLDR, I use Claude constantly now and get incredible results because I ~have fine tuned~ am constantly fine-tuning my instructions and know when it’s going off the rails. How do you teach someone how to do this without decades of experience?",

And I mean this roughly (think of it as a guide to follow in spirit) because 10 work-days does not divide into 6 at all.\n\nAnd you change the proportions depending on what the project is. If you are doing an early prototype, where you are iterating quickly and still learning and discovering fundamental things, you probably have no hard-commits at all. If the project is in chaos and there's a lot of firefighting, you may leave 1/3 open to handle firefights from the get-go (and this is also true on oncall weeks).",

Help us figure out what to deprioritize.\"\n\nIf your PO isn't doing this; if they aren't monitoring velocity, verifying total points achievable, and not balancing the total committed load when new items are added, you're just adding a bunch of unnecessary cruft and time wasting bullshit.",

Recently one guy asked me about that and I responded \"You cancelled last 5 occurrences, I just assume the meeting will not happen anyway\"\n\nI am currently in a situation where my product owner keeps making irrational plans. He is pressured to deliver at a certain date and rather than work to find reasonable solution he is pressuring everybody to accept his estimates. Those estimates obviously have nothing to do with reality and instead are made to prop up the idea we are on path to achieving success (success defined as meeting a self imposed deadline). Recently I stopped giving estimates and my official response is that \"every time I make an estimate it ends up with a long series of discussions about the merits of my estimate and my estimates end up replaced with the estimates of my PO. Frequently, the amount of effort on those discussions approaches the effort needed to perform the task. Therefore, I will no longer prepare any estimates, please, let PO fill in estimates by himself. At least this will free up my time to do other work.\"\n\nOf course, these estimates have nothing to do with reality and the only thing that is achieved is great amount of chaos, confusion and scope cutting when nearing development cutoff date.\n\nAnd the issue is that if I let in to the pressure I become responsible for the estimate because POs unrealistic wishes becomes my commitments.\n\n\\> Out of 20 sprints maybe 3 actually ended close to what we planned at the start. The rest just completely different by the end.\n\nHere is what you do.\n\nMake copious notes about \\*causes\\* of the sprint plans not being met. Try to find commonality. Try to find causes that are associated with majority of problems. Try to figure out some solutions to fix those.\n\nFor example, my current team has problem in that developers cannot reliably predict how much work a particular task needs to be done. I figured out significant cause of this is that most of the time the start of development is essentially a start of a research task to find out what are the requirements. This tends to require a huge amount of communication, meetings, frequently with senior people outside of our organization who are not available at moments notice.\n\nSo what I did is I created a checklist that lists what needs to be met before a task is accepted. Part of this checklist is a statement that a task needs to be defined in such a way that a developer can pick up and finish task without requiring to gather more requirements (and also other problems that require communication with others). All tasks are first assigned to me. What I do is I check if the task meets the criteria and is specified clearly and only if it is specified clearly I allow the task to be presented on sprint planning.\n\nIf the task does not meet the criteria I simply bounce it back and this way I try to protect the team at the cost of pressure on me (which I am fine with, I know how to deal with it).\n\nUnfortunately, the team can't do it because the developers frequently feel pressured to accept the task even if they don't really understand the task. That's another problem I am working on.",

The point is to learn to quickly iterate and improve the process.\n\nThe checklist is \\*outcome\\* of an ongoing improvement process. It has items that are only relevant to our team. It is being constantly updated as new problems are identified and old problems stop being problems so we remove process that support solving those.\n\nWhen I join a failing Agile team, I am doing almost exactly the opposite what others are doing. Others are coming with books, papers and ready made checklists that are supposed to improve the process. But this is anti-Agile. Agile is about improvement and what these people are doing they are trying to standardize process and take away the team's ability to shape it.\n\nWhen I join the team, I come with exactly zero process. Every process that is instituted is exactly in response to and directly related to the problems that team is having. Every member of the team is part of creating the process because I want to make the team feel responsible for the process and be part of the improvement. I also want them to understand why we are doing things.\n\nNow, if I shared the checklist with you, you would ask \"Is that it? Is this really the thing that is supposedly improved the team's performance by multiple orders of magnitude?\" And the answer is that the journey is more important than the end. If you helicopter yourself to the top of Mt Everest you will not feel the satisfaction of conquering it. And if you take a train instead of completing pilgrimage, you will not feel the spiritual effects you wanted. And if you take existing checklists and rules and process from external sources you will not achieve the goals of Agile.",

When that happens, mark it as \"Ready\" to be worked on.\n\n\\- The sprint planning/kickoff should be pulling in stories that are already well-known and \"Ready\".  By then there shouldn't be too many more questions as to what \"Done\" means and what the priorities are.  It shouldn't normally take more than an hour to sort out what you're pulling into the sprint based on priorities and cost estimates.\n\n\\- Priorities shouldn't change mid-sprint; obviously that moves the finish line back.  The point of a \"sprint\" is that it's already short enough to get that amount of work done; then, if priorities need to change, you change directions in the next sprint.   \n\n\\- If you have to throw away the sprint and start over with new priorities, that's supposed to be OK (although I've never been on a team that does that).",

Any Stories being pulled into a Sprint are known by the team and have been estimated, and prioritised (by e.g. Product with team in partnership, or with team and stakeholders by some kind of passive-aggressive negotiation; it is a bank after all) previously. 1 hour TOPS for team of up to 12 or so. 30 mins if 6 or less and your game is tight. Nothing should be a surprise in here. (You might need 30 mins of admin/close-down for previous Sprint if you're not getting finished/suffering distractions or your sprints are wanky/getting crashed. Keep it to a separate session though or _ideally_ have the devs/testers do all the close-down admin themselves, in advance of planning. That's what my best teams used to do and it's fucking amazing.\n  \n\n2. A prior session to prioritise (rank/discuss dependencies/weigh up what the next few weeks look like and make some decisions about what gets dev-time) e.g. \"go time now for that tech debt thing we talked about last Retro cause feature X is gonna need that sorted\". Called \"Prioritisation\". 30 to 45 mins tops. Every sprint to keep it short and relevant: i.e. soon/upcoming.\n\n  \n3. A session prior to that to break down Epics into Stories and/or Estimate the Stories. Called \"Refinement & Estimation\". I'd recommend sticking up a recent but Done \"5 pointer\" on the wall/on-screen somehow and using it as a benchmark to calibrate sizing of new work. Obvs pick a 5 point Story that mostly everyone agrees was a solid 5 points. \n\n\nAnything that is wildly unknown or unknowable should be given Spikes (time-boxed to X days) or turned into a KDD for research, or given a 20 or 40 and retyped as an Epic and broken down into Stories in a future session. 1 hour TOPS. Do it every Sprint to keep duration down.\n  \n  \nNever let the team neglect these ceremonies; teams tend to eat each other when they run out of work.\n  \n  \nNone of these good practices will prevent your sprints from being crashed by the way, by shit systems breaking and/or shit management grabbing your engineers and demanding output from them. That needs to be tackled separately.\n\n\nBut four fucking hours of \"sprint planning\" where you're trying to do all of the above in one session is ineffective and just a bit weak/immature agile-wise. People will be in various states of interested/disinterested/bored/fed up if you try to do all of the above in one meeting.",

Leadership hides behind the consultancy. If it fails, they can blame the execution not the decision. \"We hired the best consultants, did what they said, must be the team.\"\n\nYour breakdown is exactly how it should work.

Shout if something's on fire.\" That's it.\n\nThe 4-hour sprint planning isn't really about planning. It's about alignment. Problem is, you can get that in 30 minutes if people actually talk during the week. What helped me: stopped expecting the plan to survive. Now I just expect the \\*priorities\\* to be clear. Everything else is negotiable.\n\nYour instinct is right. Teams shipping well aren't following a better process. They're just comfortable with ambiguity.",

This also helps to satisfy folks who “want higher velocity”, as you can increase perceived velocity by breaking down tickets more and more.\n\nThis sort of pattern leads to being able to more accurately predict how quickly things will get done, given a known queue depth.

If the board is used to measure productivity and delivery of work, then it should absolutely be used to nip unrealistic work and scope creep, as well as track capacity. Unfortunately that rarely happens, most PMs/managers aren't willing to stand their ground and defend the board, they just care about optics of velocity and agile half-heartedly. Closing more features, steeper burndown charts, illusion of delivery to management. Eventually the board becomes theater, they tell a fairy tale plot, and you dance on stage, performing vanity projects on top of operational tasks.\n\nA lot of this is due to incentivization and lack of understanding what is actually required for delivering a technical solution, there is no architect to enforce reality. Performance is largely based on how many projects they had their hands in and how many people they manage, not quality or effectiveness of technical delivery. The org incentivizes bandwidth, not throughput.\n\nUnderstanding this concept was key for me. One mistake I made was trying to be the defender of the board. I thought by defending planned work, reducing congestion, and protecting throughput to deliver better products was the answer, but this only gets you seen as a naysayer and reducer of bandwidth. Some orgs don't have any mechanisms for recognizing or rewarding throughput as they don't measure effectiveness of technical solutions, congestion, latency, or quality of service, this requires an architect to measure. They only measure on bandwidth, velocity, and loudness.\n\nOnce you understand this, the agile framework only follows suit. The business actually wants waterfall but agile is there for formality. The goal is to sell bandwidth like you're an ISP, not throughput. The plan becomes less about being accurate or even detailed, it becomes an interpretive dance with loud features, flashy lights, selling your work (maybe some belly dancing?), and promising things that you can actually deliver quicker than expected and dealing with what actually needs to be done off the board.",

Suddenly, a lot of things could wait a sprint or two.\n\nAdditionally, in the sprint review with all the stakeholders, fastlanes were explicitly discussed, giving us the backing from different departments when denying them wherever possible.\n\nYou mentioned a VP suddenly standing in your office and demanding stuff. That is already an issue. A foreign VP shouldn't give tasks to a development team, they should give them to your manager/director/department lead/whatever. They then decide how to prioritize things and, if needed, they bomb your sprint. Then they can also discuss with you once they notice how every sprint dies.\n\nI had a similar issue once at a startup, where sales and marketing directly walked to the devs to ask for help with something. That resulted in the dev lead not knowing what the devs where working on and made him very sad, thus it got changed at some point.\n\nOverall, this has to be solved by management. Now, assuming your manager doesn't care, what can you do?\n\n1. Inform stakeholders. Whenever you get a fastlane, or no later than in the next sprint review, let the stakeholders of the stuff you planned to work on know that their things got pushed back as authorized by VP Bob. If they don't care then why should you, if they care let them talk to Bob, not your issue. Of course, make that more informative and less finger pointing; as always, office politics apply.\n\n2. Involve your manager/VP/whatever, let it be their decision.\n\n3. Plan the unplanned into your sprints. If you get interrupted regularly, plan with less tickets. If you don't get interrupted for once, have some low priority tickets in the backlog that you already wanted to do for months.\n\n4. Switch to Kanban, as already mentioned by others, and let other people fight about priorities. If necessary, implement a process letting stakeholders see why their ticket got pushed back, what ticket was put in front of it and who authorized it (see 1.).\n\n5. Figure out how there can be such major bugs in production systems regularly (because some issue on a test system doesn't justify a fastlane) and address that. Maybe you need better testing? Hire a QA guy?\n\n6. Stop caring so much, obviously no one else does. Figure out what you need to do to satisfy everyone and then simply work. Who cares about sprints anyway?\n\nIn the end, it's understandable. Someone is blocked and you can unblock them, and instead of blaming their poor planning they blame you and want it fixed asap. Their manager only hears \"I do no work because...\" and of course demands you fix that right away. If you neither have the right to push back nor a manager to handle that for you, then this strategy works for them. But again, that's not a problem you can solve. You need to convince management that it would be beneficial if you could actually do the work you planned, without buy-in from them you can't change much.",

But our manager also didn't push back so same result either way.\n\n\n\n\\#3 is probably what we should have done - just plan with way less tickets assuming we'll get interrupted.

If there's real clashing, you gotta get to the root of why there's so much friction. Maybe senior devs are trying to railroad junior devs?

That's exactly what it becomes when nobody actually believes in it but everyone has to pretend.\n\nThe testing point is real too. Testing incomplete features every sprint just creates rework. Wait till the whole thing is done or you're just wasting QA's time.\n\nHonestly your approach is probably the most rational given the system. Game it enough to survive yearly review, don't fight battles you can't win, focus on actual output. Not how it's supposed to work but definitely how it actually works in most places.",

All integrations tests were written by one guy on the team using a tool we (the rest of us) didn’t have a license too!  Can you say bottleneck? “Well if you coded to spec he could write the tests while you’re doing the coding”. All this from a manager who was a “rock star back when he was a dev”.",

There are tons of projects I was excited about at the time, and even ones that I thought were genuinely cool, but almost none of them survived the years and/or stand out in my mind as being valuable.\n\nA super old one that comes to mind is [https://www.dronetonetool.com](https://www.dronetonetool.com). My boss in like 2012 paid me $50 cash to make this little jQuery web app for his cousin, who is a music teacher. The functionality is silly, but I was really proud of the CSS. At some point somebody added a donate button and made mobile app wrappers for it, but other than that it's exactly as it was when I shipped it.\n\nAnother one that comes to mind is a script I wrote a few years ago that analyzes images produced by a Scanning Electron Microscope and calculates the thickness in microns of various features in the image. I was proud of it because it was a side project outside of my sprint work that I spent two evenings on, used zero dependencies, and it ended up being used by scientists in the lab for like two years after that to save them from manually measuring these things. I don't think they're still using it, but I was proud of it.\n\nFunny, I can't think of any actual business products I've worked on that I'm proud of.",

Over five years the company scaled from zero to $1B+ in revenue across four core products. I contributed to three and owned two end to end. Acquired for roughly $500M.\n\n- Founded a company that built a media platform for one of the largest sports leagues in the world.

Not cutting corners, but being explicit about tradeoffs. \n\nWe spent real time discussing design decisions, avoided premature complexity and resisted chasing new tools without a clear payoff. \n\nIt was less about being clever and more about making informed decisions.\n\nLastly, communication was open and broadly shared. \n\nThe environments were mostly remote, which acted as a forcing function. \n\nWe prioritized written communication over verbal, with most discussion happening in shared chats rather than meetings or formal docs. \n\nMost formal documentation lived in our tests, which were heavily commented for historical context. Maintaining this was enforced in code reviews. \n\nThat working style came largely from open source backgrounds, where async collaboration and visible context are the norm. \n\nIt’s opinionated and not for everyone, but it worked well for us and for the type of people we hired.",

I have this strain of corn, how well will it grow on this field? how about the next? They were trying to sell this as a very accurate way to tell farmers which land to rent or buy. I wasn't doing any of that work, but to sell the model well, they needed good visualizations.\n\nSo I am then asked to lead a project where we'd visualize the results of the model, on every field in the united states: You load a map, and can zoom in all the way to each individual plot. As you zoom out, it aggregated to median data. A fun, interesting little visualization project, right? Well, it was a complete success. It allowed us to see exactly what results the model was providing, and you could see exactly how reliable it was.... except of course, it wasn't reliable. The numbers were plausible on most normal fields in the corn belt, but as you zoomed out, you'd see... a map of US states. People would ask me why I added the staets.. .except I didn't. It just happens that the data was so broken, a key important factor was being decided at the state level in the model: So big you could see the states as you zoomed out. Cross the border between Iowa and Illinois? 20% difference in corn yield. And the model was equally broken on every crop. No matter what, the soil maps, weather maps and all of that were just not all that important.\n\nNeedless to say, while this was an accurate visualization of what the startup's technology did, it was also something that said its core technology was an unsellable disaster, because every farmer would laugh at the numbers, as in the real world, states don't matter. Not much later came major layoffs, as I had successfully shown execs most of their company's \"valuable\" IP was not in a sellable state.",

Can you tell TwoPhotons to work on something else?\" (It did eventually get fully integrated.)\n\nI think one of the reasons for its success was that it was relatively small in scope, which meant I was able to work on it on my own. No tickets, no JIRA, no standup, no scrum, no retro...just me typing away, and reaching out to my boss whenever I needed a clarification on requirements. I was also proud of a particular implementation detail I added which resulted in greatly improved performance over the company's existing solution, which meant that people immediately saw the value in it.\n\nIt's still chugging along, with the occasional bug fix here and there, but not much has changed since its initial implementation.",

Mostly projects that I had ownership of a rather big part and did them almost from scratch. The impact was non existent as nothing went to production. However I was proud because I did grow a lot and did a lot of things that I never thought I would do.\n2. Projects of big organizations where the end product is very impressive but work was meh. Bad tech, 0 ownership, vast (pointless I would say) processes, bureaucratic boomer attitude. Well I am not proud of that because it didnt feel like building the product. It felt like I was battling some Kafkaesque nightmare.\n3. A \"successful\" project that ended up in a product sold globally, where I was solely responsible for the software of half the system. The bad management, the bad client and the absurd deadlines made the whole process traumatic. I was so burnt out that I quit shortly after and never wanted to talk about that project. Today I see it used in my city's metro system but I largely don't care.\n4. A project that was 2 of the best years of my career. A very good senior colleague that taught me so many things made that special. Very nice processes that made sense. Good management that did not get in the way. I did have ownership in some critical features but I contributed to a lot of others as well. I even made an internal tool that was praised by everyone and ended up as a significant step in the process. Cool product, something I never thought it existed, yet we were writing the new version of it. Bad proprietary hardware that made software super interesting diving a lot to low level and compilers etc. Yet the project was killed because of politics... This was essentially the project that made me a much better engineer and it was a fancy product that I would be super proud if it succeeded. I am still very proud about the internal tool that we used it for 6 months.",

I pitched my VP that I could build a custom publishing system that would meet all our needs, quickly and cheaply. Just give me an equipment and personnel budget and I'll make it happen. I led that project, did a ton of coding, supervised the other programmers, acted as DBA, system administrator (we didn't have the word devops back then), wrote a whole system to process user submitted video (much trickier in the pre-smartphone era), etc. It was a smashing success. Editorial was thrilled. Ad sales was thrilled. I gave presentations to the rest of the company about it. It served millions of visitors for over 10 years.

I ended up working for *Benoit Mandelbrot* on his now famous Fractal Mathematics research. I also was a part of the creation of the first 3D modelers, and first 3D animation systems. \n\nMy first job out of college was for Philips, in their research group creating the CD-ROM and streaming media. I was the guy that originally wrote the streaming media support in multiple operating systems, including all the game consoles of the time. I was on the OS teams for the (failed) 3D0 and the original PlayStation, where I wrote their video subsystems. \n\nWhile it Philips I wrote an award winning documentary production system, and that was used to make over 100 documentaries, which I was the technical director. \n\nWhile at Electronic Arts I was on the OS team for the 3D0 and the teams for Road Rash 3D0, the original Tiger Woods Golf, NCAA Football, and several others.\n\nI worked briefly at a dotcom during the dotcom era, and there I wrote the world's first live video codec for streaming video over the Internet. \n\nThen I went into feature film VFX and worked on about a dozen high profile films as a digital artist, a programmer, and then a financial analysis (I was getting an MBA at the same time.) It was the 3D live action versions of the Scooby Doo movies, the Garfield films, and the Narnia films, I worked on those and several more. \n\nIt was making film VFX that I figured out and then patented what are now called Deep Fakes. I was trying to create personalized advertising, see yourself in advertising, but the world wanted personalized porn. I and my team of film VFX pros refused to make porn, and I went bankrupt. I put my life savings into that technology, people did not believe it was possible, and then they did they insisted it be used for moral crime.

It was just because reasons, a regular API gateway to abstract away the dumpster fires and mudballs would probably get the job done as well. \n\nEither way, we ended up as one of VERY few teams that had meaningful observability at all, so we ended up being those who love what is going on and those who handled all the sev1s and sev2s when things blew up elsewhere. We were also in security incidents partly because we captured things that went through SIEM unnoticed.\n\nWas I proud of delivering this? Hell yes.\n\nWas it worth it? Only in terms of paid overtime in war rooms and incident management. People mistook me for  SRE for a long time, even actual SRE mistook me for SRE. Security guys hated me because I wouldn't let them sweep the overlooked incidents under the carpet, my new manager was furious because I've been coming back with status updates about yet another incident I was in, and VP conducted a clandestine investigation to figure out if I was sabotaging the company. I didn't and I proved it, to the point I was oncall on my last day at that job lol. And I'm happy that I managed to land a new job and quit just weeks before I'd get fired.",

Before then, it was hit or miss. Almost by chance. Chance that we got the cost estimate right and didn't run over budget. Chance that we got the time estimate right and didn't have to sacrifice features, functionality, or spit & polish due to timelines. Chance that the client correctly communicated what they want and/or what they wanted didn't change before project end due to external forces; that the finished product met the overall desires and expectations of the client. When a project takes more than 3 months, it's simply unrealistic to expect nothing to change for the client. Budget, expectations, needs, and desires _will_ change and it should be ok for them to do so. \n\nWith scrum (_strict, to the letter_ scrum), we were able to roadmap work in iterations. We were able to to continually review the work with the client and ship it, continually reverifying and re-analyzing direction and goals. With each iteration, the client was able to not just see the resulting work, but use and play with it. If the client decided, \"hey, actually, i don't need those other things, this is meeting my needs as is!\" then great, client is super happy and spends less money and we're free to move on to the next project. If it ran over, it was because the client made an informed decision to add new items or priorities or was involved in the process enough that it didn't come as a surprise; that they had already been made well aware of delays as they occurred. \n\nWhen we found ourselves on the wrong path, the biweekly sprint review with stakeholders would put us back on the right path. When the client had required changes or emergencies, we could add new tickets, working with the client to remove or deprioritize others of equivalent point value to keep things on track re: time and budget. When the team found themselves not operating or producing as expected, the bi-weekly retrospective allowed us to self-analyze, call out issues, and make improvements. \n\nOn the whole, the transparency, the inspection, and the adaptation (as it so happens, the \"three pillars of scrum\") ensure that by project end the client can't be anything but pleased with the result. \n\nI'm sure I'll get some comments to the contrary. And they won't be wrong. I've seen first hand so many instances of Agile-Gone-Wrong. At my previous job leading the account/checkout division international e-commerce platform, we had great success running our own little team with Scrum. Once the company-at-large got wind of our success, they wanted to implement it site wide. We advocated Scrum Nexus, they went with the horrific monstrosity that was SAFe. It was a productivity black hole. All this is to say, there are so many variants of agile, so many ways to run it, that are fucking terrible. But in my experience, hardcore, strict-as-fuck scrum is a near guarantee for project success.",

The second was converting one of the business domains to use AMQP as part of a PoC for a major bid.  We won the bid and were able to production-ize the PoC. \n\nAs for the projects I've been on that have failed, well there's been a hell of a lot more.  The common threads are poor product/market fit, poor adoption, or inept strategy.  Without naming the projects here's my perspective on why they failed (one point per-project):\n\n* Leadership decided that the work could be done in 8 weeks by 4 independent contractors under the guidance of a Director setting the strategy, a Solution Architect devising the implementation, and an Engineering Manager guiding the day-to-day.  That's 4 devs, 3 \"leads\", and 2 months to try and deliver a complete rearchitecture of our data pipeline.  The Director was a kiss-up/kick-down idiot, the Solution Architect was inexperienced and created a solution involving 8 Lambdas for a system that would service 1500 users at peak load with a TAM of maybe 5x that, and the manager was me insisting almost daily that this wasn't going to work but being told that I had to \"make it work\" by said Director.  Unsurprisingly, it didn't work and was cancelled after 6 months. \n\n* The product itself was excellent, had great product/market fit, and was devised by one of our guys with 10+ years experience.  New leadership came in, didn't like the timeline, and insisted that we gut 70% of the feature set to deliver it faster.  Adoption was poor because it no longer solved the problem it set out to solve. \n\n* The integration we built was part of a partnership to cross-sell each others' product.  It worked fine but sales were poor and it was later deprecated. \n\n* We converted a crazy VBA-laden Excel file into a web-based tool for an internal team.  Nobody wanted to use the web-based tool and they kept using the Excel file with VBA.  \n\n* It was a startup bet to act as a lower cost of acquisition for new customers that we could upsell on other core features of the product.  What we built didn't work reliably and hemorrhaged money because we couldn't recollect from our customers.  It was shut down.",

          "text": "\"The C++ Programming Language\" by Bjarne Stroustrup.\n\nStructurally it's incredibly well thought-out. It's clear how much love Bjarne put into writing each page; the target audience is people who have programmed before (in C or Java, for example), but are \"ready\" for the next steps, and the beginning of the book says as much. It is not an introductory text and doesn't pretend to be. It's also not a theoretical computer science book, and is clearly meant for working programmers/practitioners who need to get things done.\n\nFinancially, it's a steal: the first 200 pages or so are the same as \"A Tour of C++\" - which on its own costs around half the price of the book - but you get roughly 1k more pages. Each section of the book could be a book of its own, and each chapter starts with a guide on the topic at hand, and helpfully numbering every section that you can easily revisit or jump around the book if necessary.\n\nOn a personal level, I haven't had as much fun reading a language book since \"The C Programming Language\" by K&R - or maybe \"Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World\" by Joe Armstrong - but Erlang and C are not nearly as \"general purpose\" (for lack of a better term) than C++, for better or worse, and are also a lot simpler by comparison.",

I'm primarily a Java / Spring Boot guy, but I’ve handled a variety of stuff like breaking monoliths, OAuth, developer productivity, and company-wide Java/Boot upgrades.\n\nI’ve been living in a bubble. I’m not part of the hiring process at my current company, and I haven’t interviewed anywhere in 15 years. While nervous, I'm not too worried about my abilities to do the job at another company; I just have no clue how to qualify in the interviews\n\nI wasn't a fan of the process 15 years ago, but I still prepared for things like graph algorithms out of necessity. I’ve never had to implement those in my day-to-day work. With open-source libraries and Claude Code, I don't see the point in relearning (*coding*) them, but I don’t know if companies still expect me to *code* things like Dijkstra’s, NP, etc. \n\nOutside of System Design, what else should I be looking into? Though I code every single day, I'm not a competitive or fast coder. I’ve never been one. I’m more the type to churn things in my head for days and finally get to coding, so I can barely code within a 45-minute window. ",

My place of work does not and I am heavily involved in hiring, we all are. I just ran one the other week, and the poor guy, I could tell, had melted his brain running LeetCode too much. We told him multiple times not to worry about over-optimizing, just get a working solution. But he didn't listen, floundered on relatively basic concepts, and then just started regurgitating LeetCode time complexities for a straightforward real-world scenario type interview question. He didn't make it forward.",

I'm not saying you need to brag at all, but you really need to be able to come with the expectation that \"Graph algorithms? Really?\" and understand that companies that do that to you aren't worth your time because they are looking for team leads, and not high ranking ICs that influence teams,  and don't pay attention to the job titles. Pay attention to the job description. Always. Focus on companies that are looking for their senior level ICs to influence teams and actively ask you questions on how you did it. Avoid companies that still insist on having you solve basic coding challenges long after the initial interview.\n\nNow with this being the new age of AIs, you're going to be up for a challenge because companies are going to want to know how you can leverage those tools to upskill teams, and they'll also want to know how you navigate tough situations and get buy in from the teams and prove yourself. A lot of the interview questions you'll get will be to test your soft skills. Once you get to Principal Engineer, it is lonely at the top, and the higher you go, the less direction you will get because you will be expected to set the direction. \n\nIt's a tough market right now, but with the right amount of persistence, you'll eventually land a better role.

I'm not talking about tech, I'm sure you do have that, but everything outside of tech.\n\nSitting in a new organization and trying to generate buy-ins from stakeholders and fellow devs is an absolutely grueling task. If you haven't needed to navigate the political landscape of a new organization in 15 years... you are going to fail a lot. You are (probably) used to ICs listening to you, but here you will meet senior/staff ICs who has been with the company for 6 years and they really wanted that principal promotion, but instead here comes you, telling them the direction. It's hard staff to pull off.\n\n\nI also firmly believe one cannot enter an organization at the Principal level. You need a couple of years with the org to understand their business, tech and build rapport and respect with key tech/business players, before you can start to execute Principal level initiatives. \n\nI'd suggest applying for Staff level jobs as well.",

I would recommend studying a few big ones, such as Bitly, a web crawler, ticketmaster, dropbox, whatsapp, and a few more.\n\nBehavioral can trip people up.

          "text": "I think it's mostly a mindset thing. One thing I've noticed trip up a lot of is this attitude of: \"I was X badass at Y company for Z years therefore blah-blah-blah\". The key to success is to humble yourself and understand that you're not too good for anything. Given that you're asking these questions here already puts you miles ahead of a lot of \"how dare they ask me to do leetcode\" people.\n\nBeyond that, just treat this as any other technical problem to be solved: identify the problem statement, prepare your tools, iterate until output is acceptable.\n\nMost large companies have glassdoor or other interview review sites where you can get an understanding of how their interview process looks like. Ask recruiters what kind of things to expect during technical interviews. Heck some companies will give you their grading rubrics. Figure out exactly how the company is ranking their candidates and optimize for that. Generally speaking most tech companies will try to imitate FAANG-shit, so by going through a current \"Cracking the Y interview\" book you can generally get a good read on a lot what to study for.\n\nFor system design you wanna make sure you study up on the latest relevant tech so that when you namedrop something you understand why and don't accidentally say something self-defeating.\n\nFor leetcode stuff you can practice those questions pre-emptively. Ideally in whatever language/domain you'll be applying for. The benefit of these sites existing for forever is that you can actually get down to pretty specific domain stuff (like there's leetcode primers for modern react). Doing those through the \"hard\" ones in my experience is usually good enough to be ready to get through most coding interviews. It's usually best to focus on getting any kind of working solution first (even a bad one) and then explain that if you would've had more time to iterate you would implement an XYZ solution (instructor might even prompt you to do so right away). While many companies won't care about leetcode for principal positions, you will be graded a lot more harshly on mistakes if they do. So beware.\n\nMost interviews aren't going to ask you to implement a specific algo, but they will ask you why you chose that one and what are the trade offs of that vs other options.\n\nHowever at the one of it, remember that this is a numbers game. Corpos get to pick through a bunch of candidates and you're just a number to them. However, they will need to keep on hiring people. Where as you only need one to say yes. So make it a habit of finding sites that have new positions opened frequently and only apply to ones posted in the last couple of days. Keep on doing that and eventually you'll find something that lands, if for no other reason than the fact that you've done so many interviews that you've gotten really good at it, for interviewing is trainable skill as any other.",

I have some really good Jr level salaries what did solid work. I know they can do that job well. And then, someone who gets paid better join my team who is performing less than my existing team members. It felt unfair to my team members.\n\n\nHow am I supposed to say, hey, this seniors dev is performing at expected level when my Jr dev is doing better? If my Jr dev promotion is overdue, why wouldn't I promote them?\n\n\nYou have to answer that question. Because once you get in, that's what the tech lead is thinking. Because they have to know your pay level to give you performance review. Other members may not know you got paid higher, but the people who manages you have to answer that question. Why hire you instead of promoting existing members?",

Coding exercises I've seen in the past few years have tended to be more of the \"solve a simple problem.  Just get it working, then discuss how to make it more performant as a stretch goal\" variety.  I think big companies are still doing leetcode etc and might get into that stuff, but I've only been interested in small to medium sized companies, and none of them have really played that game.\n\nEspecially for principal roles, you definitely need to be ready to handle system design questions though.  Those are still hot.  \n\nBehavioral interviews have traditionally been my weakness, but I did a lot better in my latest interview cycle by using ChatGPT to practice.  Basically I told it what kind of roles I was looking for, then asked it to help me build a story bank.  It gave me bullet points about the kinds of stories I needed (i.e. \"a time when you had to tackle a big production issue\", \"a time when you conflicted with management\" etc etc).  I told it stories and it kept a checklist of which stories matched which common questions, gave me advice on what areas to add more details in etc etc.  Worked out pretty well.  \n\nAlso asked it for resume feedback in a similar manner and it did a good job.  Don't let it write your resume for you, but do ask it about what changes you should make.",

If they ask about a time you broke production and what happened, you might have a better, more-rehearsed, story about a time somebody else broke production and you jumped in to fix it.

And prior to that I was on the other side of the table (and, weirdly, I'm asked to interview others while freelancing).\n\nThe idea of an interview--ideally, unless you're interviewing with a bunch of nitwits--is to see that you're intelligent, that you know *something* about the technologies people are using, and that you can think quickly on your feet. Beyond that, the point is to see that you're personable and sociable--that is, that you can fit in well with a team, and that you're easy to be around. \n\nSince you're a contemplative coder (I'm one too), the best way to handle any \"coding on the spot\" interviews where you're asked to crank out code is to talk through how you'd reason about the code with the people you're interviewing with. That is, instead of quietly just writing code for 45 minutes, ask them questions, and talk to them about what you're thinking as you turn the code over in your head. (\"Well, first, it seems to me that this is really a sorting problem, right? That I need something to sort against, but once I have that, I can use quick sort to get the final answer...\") In my experience this goes over very well with most interviewers. (And it would go over well with me, because when I ask coding questions **I am not interested in a correct answer. I am interested in understanding your process on how you get to a correct answer.**)\n\nOther questions, like Dijkstra, NP, and the rest--I don't see them asked very often, but when they are, they're looking to ask you breadth of knowledge. Me, when I interview others, I pick through their resume--and my technical questions are less about \"do you still remember your CS courses from college\" and more \"is this guy lying on his resume?\" That is, if you put down the fact that you worked on DSP programming for an audio system, I may ask you about Fourier transforms--and if you make a confused Pikachu face, I may suspect your DSP programming experience isn't as deep as your resume makes it out to be. \n\n(Of course other interviewers have different strategies. And in my experience being interviewed--and keep in mind I do this **all the damned time**--it is perfectly fine to say \"I don't know,\" or to venture a half-remembered guess after confessing the limits of your knowledge. Being honest is more important here than faking knowledge; after all, all answers are just a Google search away once you're on the job. Like, if you did DSP programming but you don't know Fourier transforms, it's okay to say \"I don't know; my job was to code the algorithms given to me by our software architect and optimize them for the blah blah blah processor.\")\n\nRemember too: your job during an interview is to *understand who you are interviewing with.* That is, to some extent, you are always interviewing the interviewers. If you get some asshole who keeps interrupting you and asking you increasingly difficult questions while trying to act like he's the smartest person on the block--and I've had a few interviews like this--is this an asshole you want to work with for the next 15 years of your career? If they act confused or try to gaslight you in the interview--do you think they'll improve *after* the interview? If they act like they're doing you a favor even talking to you in the first place--you know it's going to be a place where they'll act like you should be lucky to be working for them, when, in point of fact, **they should be lucky to have you on their team.**\n\nSo have that conversation, see if you're a fit for them, see if they're a fit for you--and don't worry if they decide to go another way. And **never be afraid to tell someone you're not interested.**",

And my manager always took their side. But they had been there 4-5 years before I got there and had a close relationship with my manager. \n\nThey've moved on and I'm for all intents and purposes the lead, since we were just a 2-person team. And now I'm squashing bugs left and right that were caused by this person's shitty code. Like, 1000-line method? Don't mind if I do. Duplicate the same code hundreds of times across the codebase (I counted) instead of writing a single method? Please do. That kind of stuff. \n\nSo now I've spent 2+ days tracking down a bug, and surprise surprise, it was caused by my former co-worker's carelessness.\n\nMy manager is going to ask me what the root cause is, and I'm very tempted to say it was X's shitty code, and there's a lot more where that came from. I don't want to criticize the golden child, but I also feel my manager should know that we have a significant amount of non-AI slop in our codebase that is the cause of many of our defects.\n\nOr should I just keep my mouth shut?",

When I'm honest with myself I'm a bit bored with software and not that motivated anymore, but my job is pretty chill and I need the money.\n\nI've always wondered what it would be like vying for a highly paid technical role making more money, but I've always assumed those in these roles are constantly under the gun to produce highly technical work under pressure, and are also constantly at risk of being laid off arbitrarily.\n\nSo when I add it all up, that I'm not that motivated and my current situation is pretty chill / secure, I've figured going for a higher paid role would be mostly a bad idea.\n\nAll that being said I'm curious if I'm on the right track here.

Then we had a reorg with a new SVP, who heavily reorged the entire PA (no joke, he's former McKinsey, so he literally decided to just redo the org chart into a Matrix Organization and shifted everyone around to rebalance headcount for all of the L8-L10s under him, without really considering how that affects how we did things at all). Old sponsors changed focus, new L9s had different priorities. The L6s and L7s were left scrambling for scope under the new charters. I spent 3 years under that chaos (no concrete vision for 3 years, and still none from what I hear) before quiting the industry altogether (the upside of G is that they pay you enough that you can choose to step away from the bullshit for good).\n\nAlso as any area leads or EMs in a no-HC PA (not an AI related org) will tell you, it's been rough since mid 2022. Not only is there a lack of clear upward trajectory anymore with negative headcounts for EMs, we also have to deal with balancing out our too senior-heavy teams, lack of sufficient scope, and a general tendency for our leads to start micromanaging their teams once the belt started to fasten. In my product org, I don't know a single L6+ who didn't find things significantly more stressful since 2023, and that's before the layoffs (which by and large targeted the old timer L6+ IC who had all of the institutional knowledge but didn't want really like what they saw in L7+). In fact, this is the first time in my whole career that I've seen a L6 SPM get pipped from my org. That was just unheard of in the past.\n\nThat said, I will agree, when times are good for your function, seniority generally leads to lower stress. When times are chaotic, that badge means you're the one who has to deal with the fallout, but I guess it's fair, it's why they get paid the big bucks.",

          "text": "Very - I have one of them. I choose to design my life around my career. I have no children and don’t currently have a partner. I don’t feel alone, I have plenty of time to make music (my real life force), and I routinely scuba dive too, so even though I work 7 days a week, I feel I have aspects of myself that aren’t engineering and I feel well-rounded.\n\nAs for constantly delivering, that’s where a career-long dedication to _practice_ and improvement makes it a given. When I’m tasked with hard, stressful projects, I have no doubt we’ll be somehow successful, simply because I’ve put and continue to put my hours in. I think Leetcode is dumb _and yet_ I do it anyway to learn things and make myself a good candidate, and more importantly, a strong engineer. \n\nThese behaviors and habits of practice and studying alleviate much of the self-doubt. It also makes me feel really good to grow my skills and take on harder and harder tasks. I look at it like a surgeon - you have GOT to keep up if you want to remain relevant. And if you decide you don’t want to anymore, then maybe it’s time to hang it up. It’s wrong to think of this as any kind of gig but one that’s in pursuit of continued improvement.\n\nHonestly, only you can decide if it’s worth it for yourself. If it were easy to make a lot of money, then nobody would be making a lot of money. If what you want is to code or design systems professionally, you don’t need to be a top tier Silicon Valley engineer for that to be your day job. You may, however, work at a really boring or not-technically-proficient company and deal with the nonsense of that. The best part is it’s all up to you. Some people grind and retire. Some people are lifers. \n\nPersonally, I love engineering. It makes it easy to be at the top of my game. But that’s not for everyone and that’s super cool man. I love feeling important, and being a respected technical leader, and seeing users enjoy the products I help build. I think it’s worth it, and I also know I can’t work 7 days a week for the next 20 years, so I have a plan to eventually slow down. \n\nIf you wanna break into the next tier, practice practice practice practice and practice. The good news is it’s simple and the bad news is it’s hard. If the idea of getting a lot better and being completely uncomfortable is in anyway enticing, I say go for it.",

Staff+ and Principal add completely different layers of stress that has deals more with organizational or leadership anxiety than the technical output. I don’t know about others, but at a certain level you dont have to do oncall rotations anymore, which is nice.

I know this is the opposite of what many people say - I suspect that overall, any correlation between stress and pay ends up being very weak. That said, even my most stressful job is not that big of a deal - my work hours have varied between maybe 25 and 45 per week, and I've always been able to not worry about it while I'm out of the office.\n\nThat said, I've spend a lot of time on one team (about 10 years) so I think I can make a slightly different comparison. Overall I would say that extrinsic stress has decreased as I've moved into higher-paying positions (my manager trusts me a lot more than when I was more junior/newer, and has less time to keep an eye on what I'm doing) but instrinsic stress has increased (I feel responsible for more and more peoples' careers, and put pressure on myself not to mess it up for them). For reference, all of my positions on this team are probably what you'd call high-paying - I started at about 300k and have seen that go up by about 10x in my time here.",

So don't work for departments that aren't that important... which is also laughable, because those departments don't have the budget for extremely senior ICs.\n\nMeanwhile, the \\*cadence\\* at which you have to produce something isn't daily, and the more senior people aren't robots, we are very much still human.\n\nThe trick here is to get more senior, you need to build the behaviors of more senior people.  Once you've built those behaviors, it's not 10x harder to do the job, it's just a job.  There's more stress, but not exponentially more stress.  The biggest stress for me is performance reviews, where I want to make sure my crew gets what they deserve, and I'm the only one of the 60ish people near me allowed into performance review meetings.\n\nThat said, I think stress comes from bad culture, not the job; if you work in a bad company, or have terrible management, stress isn't going to be sustainable.  My endpoints of this would be \"Amazon looks like a grind\" vs \"Duolingo looks how you'd want to build a company\".\n\n(And even Amazon has some good spots in there.)",

              "text": "Here's my own spicy take: PRs aren't about reviewing the code, they're about reviewing the change itself.\n\nOn the most superficial level, unless you are dealing with very junior engineers, or very bad engineers, you generally trust that the code works.^1 Instead we focus on two things: how the change fits with everything else. Is the code in the correct style? This isn't about correctness, but about style, the conventions and what not. The other area is about the minimum necessary (i.e. removing functionality that isn't strictly needed, or in the more extreme scenario splitting the PR), ensuring that the code has the explanations (i.e. \"why does this work like this? Or why do we do it this way\" which should be answered with a comment explaining that why in code, but it isn't a change in the code but clarification). Finally we ensure that the code has the necessary work to be resilient (i.e. *enough tests* which are the ones that actually validate that the code is correct).\n\nIn a deeper, more complex setting, PR reviews is an exercise in [building, sharing and spreading the theory that is the actual program](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf), it's not about the code itself, but rather what the code is just an encoded projection of, the theory behind it all. It ensures that things fit within this theoretical framework and move forward.\n\nAnd that theory is not just done by the coders, but everyone involved, QA, SREs, TPMs and even EMs and leadership.\n\nSo it actually makes a lot of sense to have QA review the PR. They may not have a lot to say on the code, but they have a lot to say on ensuring that the tests validate it sufficiently so that we can say it's safe, and they have a lot to say on seeing the code as outsiders, on trying to understand the concept and how the code fits. They'd question things on the theory and philosophy of a change (why, why, why) that a programmer would just assume and ignore, and this are the things we should test on a PR itself. Meanwhile this makes the dev have to take a moment to put on their QA hat and see the code from a point of view that attacks it and tries to deconstruct it, so it results on more resilient code.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be QA alone. If a PM has a clear goal and user-story with an API, having them review the PR that writes (but doesn't implement) the API and some docs might be useful. Doing changes on observability, error reporting, or logging? Bring an SRE to review and give their insight. Let everyone share their view of the theory behind the software beyond what is \"just the code\", but rather all the other things the code interacts with.\n\n^1 Yes there are exceptions where you'll go and critique the code itself, but many times this is about setting expectations and semantic conventions (i.e. it's better to use simpler objects or what not).",

      "text": "Scenario: A higher up, who is many levels above you and who you have no interaction with, wants a new project done. And they want your team to do it. This is a pivot from what you usually do, so your team is a bit perplexed. Your direct manager and skip level try to reassure you and sell this as an exciting opportunity.\n\nYou start the work, and your team is not happy. This new project is tedious and out of your wheelhouse in a bad way (think working on outdated or proprietary tech). Everything you were working on before is left to rot in maintenance mode. But boy those higher ups are excited!\n\nHowever despite their excitement, the VPs and C levels don’t actually know what they \\*want\\* beyond the buzzwords and biz-speak. It’s as if they wanted to build a house without the slightest idea of the location or size. \n\nIt’s hard to start building if you don’t know where to lay the foundation, so your team asks questions. A lot of them. The product team is just as confused as you are, and they say they’ll take the questions up the chain. It’s hard to get clear answers from anyone, and sometimes the answers contradict each other based on who you ask.\n\nYou’re going at a normal sprint cadence at this point. Until one day your manager announces that a higher up is actually expecting this done by the end of the quarter. Which is well before the current sprint ends. They apologize, and say that a VP has made a promise to their boss and some info was lost in, basically, a game of telephone.\n\nDozens of non tech folks and management sat around in meetings for months before this, trying to make decisions about this project. When they fail to make meaningful decisions, they pass that ambiguity down to the devs, with a side of time pressure. \n\nSo your team is left doing all the work (on tech that is brand new to you). AND you are chasing people around to get answers, which are all different depending on who you ask.",

For context, this is a 'rising-star' project across the entire department and as a result I've received excellent performance reviews. I have been working on this with a junior engineer and another senior engineer for \\~10 months without any issues.\n\nRecently I've had a problem with a new engineer assigned to my team who is 1 level senior to me. They keep doing odd things like:\n\n* Pasting vague one-liner error messages in the group chat, tagging me, and sitting idle until I step in to fix it, then acting like they \"managed\" my contributions (jumping the gun to update my boss, fake-updating comments on my tickets, asking me for updates, etc.)\n* Tagging me about errors emerging from other libraries I don't even own and acting like it's on me to fix them while adding absolutely nothing in terms of diagnostics or a resolution\n* Suggesting tasks on my own project in front of my boss, even though I've already shared my priorities with everyone and manage day to day tasks for the team\n* Refusing to complete any task I request for them to work on, claiming they're busy or that it's out of their scope\n* Publicly faulting me for \"breaking\" code and assigning someone to \"fix\" it for routine coding tasks (e.g. compatibility upgrades with other libraries)\n\nWhen they joined, my boss made it clear that they're only here to assist with additional engineering work as the scope of the project has grown. However I also feel that this is repeatedly being challenged in a way that's not assessed by the engineering merit of this other engineer - but rather their ability to constantly breathe down my neck while i'm elbow deep in real engineering work.\n\nTo clarify, while they contribute some code, none of their code has been significant enough to improve the baseline of the project (code quality, metrics, etc.).\n\nHowever, this engineers song and dance seems to work on my boss, whose concern for my work has genuinely increased since the engineer began their performative management charade. I feel like this senior is undermining the trust my boss has in my ability to perform.\n\nFor those who've been in this situation: how did you handle it? what should I do?",

You already see the signs, and what is happening, if you do nothing you already know what is going to happen.  At the end of the day it is all about who is the bosses favorite, not who did all the work.  Being the one that did all the work just leaves you as the person doing all the work if that is all you do.\n\nYou need to shift things back into your favor immediately.  \n- Steer things in the direction that benefits you and the project, you should be meeting with your boss very regularly.  When they see your face they should show very genuine happiness because seeing you equals money and problems getting pulled off their plate!\n- When you see this person make a post, you instantly say where is the required ticket for this, what have you done to fix this, why do we have to keep going over this, please schedule some time on my calendar for coaching and do that in public. It sets the appropriate stage that the person is not actually contributing and wasting time and needs help (yes, you too can play the game too).\n- Random tasks popping up after you have already set priorities and alignment, cut it out right there.  That will need to go into their backlog, and be sure to assign everything they blurt out directly to them with a prompt deadline and add a space on the calendar for review time.\n- You need to work on your dog and pony show skills, the shinny object is you, let's keep it that way.  Make sure you are scheduling regular, and I mean regular meetings and impromptu in-person hey hows it going let's go over such and such thing and let me show you what is coming.  \n- Every time you create and finish something you need to have a very obvious you did this work and make sure everyone knows about this to include your boss and their skip. As you want to be the one their manager talks about as the one getting that cashflow moving.\n- If you do not see the other person performing and staying active call it out, hey so and so you get that code commit in, we are waiting for your feature integration.  Send out the project management email showing their items as past due and red.  Put in your are coaching them, and keep your manager updated on their progress good and bad and add in all concerns you are seeing.\n\nDo the above and you can flip this boat back over, some of it is harsh but you have to play the game or you get screwed.  Don't believe me, come back in 3-6 months and tell us things are now being led by this guy and their new promotion. Never let a random take your drivers seat especially when you have built 80% of the product. They are actively sabotaging you and wanting to claim your work for their fame and use it to get bonuses, promotions, and other kudos irregardless of how sickening their behavior is.  You will need to intervene professionally as I have listed above or your project and work becomes their work.  Staying passive, and nice will only hurt you in the end. You need to be active and kind to win in your situation.\n\nIf you need further help with this mess ask away, control your narrative or someone else will.",

Then engage in mentoring existing large projects owners like this and do meaningful contributions that move the needle.  Then when you do this successfully those that you help, especially at the senior will normally return the favor to help you with you're even larger projects that will help both of you succeed.\n\nAlso note just because someone shows very passionate, and experienced thoughtful replies to real world issues based on actual experience doesn't mean it's coming from a bot, but an actual person that has experience in the subject matter.  It's always best to just take it all in and enjoy what you are reading and only add constructive and productive bits and bytes to be stored in the conversation so things flow instead of make people question your true intent due to the low quality of your post.",

Here is my high level summary and take on this paper.\n\nTLDR: Nothing surprising, learning through struggle without AI is best way to learn. Asking AI probing question the next best way. Copy pasting error message and asking AI to fix it is the worst and slowest way to learn new things.\n\nSample size - **52**  \nLanguage - Python - [**Trio**](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (async programming library)  \nNature of study - **Randomized Control Trial** \\- Treatment group and Control group  \nNature of task: Asynchronous programming, Error handling, Co-routines, asynchronous context managers, Sequential vs concurrent execution\n\nLow scoring groups:\n\n* **AI delegation** (*n*=4): Used AI for everything They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process. Faster group but performed the worst in quiz\n* **Progressive AI reliance** (*n*=4): Asked one or two questions but eventually used AI for everything. They scored poorly on the quiz.\n* **Iterative AI debugging** (*n*=4): Use AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly and were also slowest.\n\nHigh scoring groups:\n\n* **Generation-then-comprehension** (*n*=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. Then asked the AI follow-up questions to improve understanding. They were slow but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. **Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.**\n* **Hybrid code-explanation** (*n*=3): Asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.\n* **Conceptual inquiry** (*n*=7): Only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Encountered many errors, but resolved them independently. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.",

Directing AI implement some CRUD APIs or add some new pages to a react app is probably going to be quite a bit faster than just typing it all out.  I doubt you'd have to spend much time fighting the prompt either when you already know what you're trying to do anyways.\n\nBasically, if you don't know what you're doing, VIBE coding your way to a product is a bad idea because your competency will be low and productivity will suck because you spend a lot of time re-prompting to get the AI to do what you want.  \n\nThis has been my experience too having AI do some react and CSS work for me when I have to google every single CSS property because I have almost no idea what any of them mean.  I spent a lot of time copy/pasting the final result and telling it how it's wrong, having AI try again and then re-prompting.

But there is no subtitle for learning things the hard way by making mistakes.\n\nThere is two new risk this paper highlights that you may not have thought:\n\n1. Seniors who rely only on AI for debugging tend to loose that skill.  \n2. Juniors who rely only on AI can close tickets quickly but on long term they may learn nothing. This could be dangerous for long term career growth. Even worse they feel like they are being productive because they see all the text flowing in the screen and the task gets completed weather they understand what just happened or not.",

The products are designed to make reviewing and learning harder than they should and could be, even though the companies making them will admit these are the responsible ways of using their products. Somewhat similar to petroleum companies funding plastic recycling programs which don't work, but absolutely shift the responsibility to the public while earning them green-washing credits.\n\nSo we're left with semi-usable hyped-up products of a much more interesting underlying technology with good use-cases. Causing actual harm on many aspects of life. Changing the way we learn and know things by the corporate agenda of creating dependency over usefulness. With rising costs even before the big \"switch\" happens from the \"bait-and-switch\" these companies are basing their business model on. With us left to use said products with discipline which most humans do not possess, especially not over time. With the best case scenario being these products succeed in being integrated everywhere to be too big to fail while so we can create another social class of have-nots.\n\nTL;DR - the technology is very different from the products. The conflation of the two serves the corporations invested in it. While the technology is interesting and has use-cases, the products' use-cases are incidental and temporary while they are designed to achieve a different set of goals.",

From the syntax, to the libraries, I love every little thing about this language, that I tell my friends things like: \"Programmers want to write programs, I want to write Java programs\" and \"If it can't be written in Java, it's probably not worth writing\". My ears are deaf to all the debate about: \"oh you have to be flexible, and know x and y\".   \nBut then ever since I started reading, I've been hit with Oracle's reputation. \n\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong, but here's what I think Java's (slight) fall from grace, played out:\n\n1. Java reigned supreme in the browser, esp, after the dust of the dot com bubble settled.\n\n2. Someone found a vulnerability (or two?) in applets (around 2009?) that affected the ton of sites that ran Java.\n\n3. Google, which had been pushing hard to become from a search engine, a browser, disabled Java by default in Chrome...and you know, given the \"power of default\", programmers pivoted to Javascript, because it was disruptive to have average people download an updated Java + enable it. \n\n4. Oracle, being as litigious as ever, wanted to get back at Google, by removing some internal code Android required from Java, making support for Java 9 not possible (although Java 9+ can be used, with some features not being available).\n\n5. Oracle then sued Google claiming they should've paid them for using Java in Android. \n\n6. Google won the case, and pushed Kotlin and Flutter as the primary means of writing Android programs. \n\nNow, resources; books, tutorials, never use Java for Android programming, and other languages developed frameworks, servers, etc. that ate (a chunk of) Java's lunch. \n\nAfter most major/seminal books in the field used to use Java for example codes, newer books and editions of said books switched to different languages. (e.g. Martin Fowler's Refactoring comes to mind: Java -> Javascript). \n\nBetween 2000, and 2010, authors of major libraries:\n\n\\- Kent Beck, author of xUnit (originally in SmallTalk).  \n\\- Doug Cutting, author of Lucene, which gave birth to elastic search, and inspired other IR libraries...plus pretty much all of Apache Software, were automatically either written in or translated to Java.\n\nMeanwhile now, while efforts of developers of the JDK, and the countless major Java frameworks, can't be dismissed by any means, the community just sounds ...quiet. Even here, Java-related sub-reddits are pretty inactive compared to dotnet/python subreddits. \n\nSo, senior devs of the early 2000s, curious to know what your thoughts on Java's journey so far, and possibly its future?  \n",

They are shallowly unmodifiable data structures (should only model \"data\") and their \"most important feature\" is \"destructuring\" (according to java language architects) - in practice pattern matching.\n\nSome might just see the concise syntax but imo we see a design shift. For example, records do not allow inheritance and effectively promote immutabilty and \"transformation over mutation\". Other languages have \"Properties\" which implies mutation and setters and if suggest that isn't the direction Java is going [they aren't going to promote syntax sugar for setters].\n\nHopefully that is a reasonable summary.",

          "text": "I'm pretty confident Java never \"reigned supreme\" in the browser. There were several reasons why.\n\nThere were security vulnerabilities indeed, and they happened all the time. It's very similar to Flash, but Flash was actually used way more, so this alone doesn't explain the unpopularity.\n\nAt that time, Sun was suing Microsoft for shipping their JRE with Windows, so that might have made people averse to Java.\n\nBut the most important reason in my opinion, Java applets just didn't provide things that were needed for the front-end dev at the time: animations and video playback. Adobe Flash took all that market and ate it. IIRC applets also loaded slow and looked alien with their AWT/Swing form controls.\n\nBy the time browsers started disabling applet functionality, the technology was long dead in the water. They only kept it for so long because of pressure from the corporate world, where people deployed their corporate software in intranet via applets. Browser folk never wanted to support this thing at all, since they've got their hands busy with JavaScript, CSS and DOM, and Java applets were a constant source of security vulnerabilities to their final days.\n\nI don't know the full story of Java on Android, but I don't think Kotlin was a legal workaround. Android Java was not regular Java way before the Kotlin prime time.\n\nAs for your principal question, Java just doesn't have any kind of oomph nowadays. If you take console apps, which is relevant for beginners, there's nothing impressive. You don't see tutorials how to write a fancy TUI with colored text, for example. If you take desktop apps, they look weird and are a bit laggy. Then, the meat of Java, backend dev: if you want to just write a REST API server, Java might be not the fastest way to do that. Do you really have to learn about dependency injection frameworks if you just want to implement an HTTP server? I'm unconvinced. In Python or Node.js, you can have it in a single file if you want; not in Java. There is also gamedev, and people wrote Java games very successfully, but it was never a popular choice.\n\nJava does change over time BTW. They introduced really nice and helpful APIs. Unfortunately, interest in Java is rather low and tutorials etc don't get updated to use it. Not sure if it qualifies as a cause or symptom.",

Maybe that changed after I stopped doing applet stuff, but IIRC there was no support (or almost no support) for the applet to talk to the browser or the browser to talk to the applet.  Something like  being able to have links and web forms send input to the applet, and have the applet send output back out in terms of changing the DOM, etc.\n\nNote, the *original* vision of java in the browser (see \"hotjava\") was very intriguing.

          "text": "Hello :). \n\nI began my journey with Java in 1999. I wasn't a senior then. I was a kid too impatient for university who found a reckless startup to work for, but I have been around the JVM most of my career since then. \n\nI don't quite agree with your timeline. Applets never really took off in any major way. My first project tried to use them as a kind of \"web based distribution platform for fat client applications\", and it did not work in the slightest. Browsers back then were just not set up for this kind of thing. Duke doing a wave, maybe, but not full business applications. It was a good idea, and we were in some sense pioneers of the \"web app\", but it didn't work. \n\nYou saw a few applets here and there, but I think flash really just took over for the animated type of stuff, and people just found ways to make HTML (and of course JS) a business UI delivery platform. They definitely never \"reigned supreme\" and were entirely dead in any real sense long before 2009. \n\nJava took a leap quite early to the server-side as web application platform. This is funny in some ways because at least initially, all of the supposed advantage of Java was designed around the platform independence, so the same code could run on countless consumer devices. Then we put it on the server where the platform is static. \n\nHowever, turned out the technique that was applied to make Java platform independent is \\*even better\\* at solving another problem, and that is tuning and optimising code for the platform it is currently running on, as it runs. \n\nThe JVM is a \\*staggeringly good\\* piece of engineering. What started as a simply platform to allow for independence of deployment, has become big iron, application middleware taking care of an awful lot of business. A thousand things that we, as engineers, don't see anymore. \n\nI have to tell you that the Java \\*language\\* I have been away from for a few years now. Around 2013 I started developing in some other JVM languages. Clojure, which remains my favourite language to work with across all languages, and now Kotlin which I also think is very good. \n\nThe problem now is, if I want to develop for the JVM, I will almost certainly just pick one of those two. Clojure is an entirely different beast, but Kotlin struck me at least at one point as just being \"better Java\". I am getting noises from Java developers that Java now has many of those same features and perhaps even done in better ways, but I haven't really gone back to look. \n\nI saw an interview with the guy who stewards Java language design at Oracle and he was asked about Kotlin extension functions (deceptively simple but brilliantly useful feature), and whether Java would add them and the answer he gave took me back a little bit, because it was clear to me that he didn't even really understand what extension functions were. He seemed to perceive it as \"monkey patching\", which actually to be fair, many Java -> Kotlin devs do, but I expected a person who is in charge of language design of such a major platform to have a bit more insight than that. This was a bit disappointing, and didn't really fill me with a lot of confidence. \n\nJava's problem I think, in 2026, is it is a programming language that has all the problems of a global corporation. All the committee work, and slow movement, and dragging legacy stuff around... I don't really see that being shook off. \n\nI do hope that Oracle continues working on the JVM though. All kinds of languages (and growing) can compile to bytecode and make use of that ecosystem and it's a good one, that has been battle tested.",

It happened haha, but what I have found over the years, is that there is a lot of things going on with it all. \n\nI have had fancy job titles like, \"CTO\" and sat in meetings where I was the only person in the room that could explain what a while loop was, but all that programming stuff still kind of helps. I'm still scanning for edge cases, finding the gaps in the logic, breaking stuff down into manageable chunks. \n\nAI is a worry and anybody who spends their time minimising it because it created a bug or two is really missing the point. It's very good and it will just get better. It probably will be the case at some point in the future where writing Java by hand is like writing some kind of asm by hand. You just wont do it. \n\nHowever.... we programmers I think (and hope) have a trick up our sleaves. Writing syntax was the application of the skill, not the skill itself. All those ways of thinking, the ones that we just assume everybody else can do.... will come in handy. \n\nI am running a bit low on self-start motivation at the moment, but if somebody inspired me enough to pick up a project, I think I could probably code like a god with all this AI stuff, but I do think people like us need to be in the loop. It's a multiplier not a replacement, 1.1 tech skills multiplied by AI can now build useful things. 9.5 by the same multiplier though? \n\nI probably could \"vibe code a SaaS\", and it would have monitoring and tracability, a full suite of internal tools and reporting, structured logging, good security, a database design that allows for directions that I haven't yet explained to the prompt.... \n\nI don't think this story is over.",

Now over 20 years later, I have actually completely managed to avoid both Java and XML (besides manually editing XML files.) Even when I went back for a Master's for fun and I had a Java class, I asked the professor if I could use Kotlin instead, and he said sure. \n\nThe reason I really dislike both of them is that they are too verbose for no reason, but also because the ecosystem took that problem and made it even worse. The ecosystem encourages convoluted and enterprisey patterns instead of simplicity, and I value conciseness and simplicity. I know Java has improved a lot over the years, but it's too little, too late, and so many companies seem to be stuck on old versions where the nice new things aren't available. Other languages that started off like Java, like C#, have far surpassed Java now and are much more modern and pleasant to write code in.",

There are a few QOL features in typescript that I am sad I cannot use in java 8 (every project I get is java 8), like good template literals, good optional chaining and easy cloning of objects. I also dislike having to know every util library. Also, java is a bit too verbose for nothing imo.\n\nI also prefer the typescript's type system, that I simply find better, even though it doesn't actually enforce it, and you need to be more rigorous when using it.

Most people want just string interpolation, not making SQL queries impossible to mess up by forcing an entire new language syntax that existing libraries cant benefit from without adopting a new way of doing things.\n- Leyden? Fantastic.\n- Records? Eh, useful to some extent but I regularly see them being abused for regular models with dozens of attributes purely to avoid getters and setters. If OpenJDK made it easier to generate that code, then life would be so much nicer. Final on the JVM level is nice but I rarely write code where this actually manifests as any kind of real issue unless voodoo type shit is going on and if that is the case then I get what I deserve anyway.\n\nRemember Lombok exists as a tool that hacks the internals of the Java compiler just to grant language features most of us want anyway to some extent. That should be a clear indicator of the kinds of requirements the language should be focusing on to improve adoption and boost usage again in 2026 for new projects.\n\nThe JVM itself is awesome.\n\nJava as a language... mostly ok but it makes life difficult when it doesn't need to be.",

It went through a phase of very heavy reflection-based frameworks, overengineering and enterprise software approaches. From what I understand this was partly due to IBM wanting to invest in Java, bringing over their mainframe philosophies of developer \"lusers\". This created a burocracy-ridden culture of overcomplication, seeing code as something risky and bad. And to some degree, this culture still remains.\n\n\nThis makes me reluctant to use the language. I know that strides have been made away from things like JEE and Spring, but not far enough to offer ubiquitous alternatives.\n\n\nSo I think that Java is stuck transitioning back from the Enterprise fad.

The whole issue is that it tries to strike a balance between being a low level language like C/C++ to enable faster (ie easier) development while being more opinionated than the scripting languages like PHP, Python, JS et all for better safety. Necessary in a large code base (god save anyone working in a large Python base without heavy linting) with a lot hands in the pie but needs a very careful balance that Java historically made some odd choices about. For example it's wild to me that a language that will not let you write a utility function without putting it in a class will happily let you pass around nulls around with no complaints. And then there is boiler plate, so... much... boiler plate. There are ways around that with the likes of Lombok and co but then the fact that you need third party libraries to get around the language is itself indicative of a problem. \n\nThis is where I think Kotlin really wins out IMO, it's a better solution to the same problem (big Kotlin fanboy if you couldn't tell), prescriptive where it matters, but importantly loose where it doesnt.",

Early on, they were just single raw Java bytecode `*.class` files, but then Netscape went with JAR archives in Netscape Navigator, and Microsoft went with Cabinet archives in Internet Explorer. As I recall, the browsers were bad at caching Java applets, too. Corporate and government-agency intranets and extranets may have been another story for Java applets in the browser.\n\nBefore Oracle's lawsuit against Google over a copyrighted Java API in Android (Dalvik), Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft over Java, and if I recall correctly, this was over Microsoft's pushing APIs and frameworks that tied developers to Windows in Java over a \"Write once, run anywhere\" Java: Windows Foundation Classes (WFC) over the Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) or Swing and J/Direct over the Java Native Interface (JNI). The lawsuit locked Microsoft at an old version of the JDK, and Microsoft pivoted to what would become C♯ and the .Net.\n\nBetween Google Chrome with its faster V8 JavaScript and, more importantly, Apple's iPhone, Java applets, Flash applets, Microsoft Silverlight, and ActiveX controls (always platform specific native code and almost always Windows x86) all fell by the wayside.\n\nThat's all client side in Web browsers, though.\n\n----\n\nProfessionally, I've only ever used Java for server-side applications and supporting utilities, not for applets, desktop GUI applications, or Android apps. This is where the vast, vast majority of Java development has been happening since the early 2000s. The Java programming language itself has been playing catch-up with other JVM languages like Kotlin and Scala, and now, for a lot of developers, it occupies a good enough \"sweet spot.\" I still don't think even Java 25 compares to Scala 2.13 (let alone Scala 3.8), but Scala's mindshare has really dwindled in the last ten years or so, and Java's been a more steady, if boring, workhorse; Java is kind of the COBOL of our time.\n\n----\n\nEveryone's obsessed with generative AI these days, so it's no wonder there's less buzz around Java, even as the JDK gets features that would make it more useful in more niches beyond typical server-side business applications and middleware.

          "text": "For its time, Java was a quantum leap forward.\n\nThey made a few bad decisions in the early days that were big bets that didn't pan out, and I think that had a lot more to do with limiting Java's scope. For the browser, that was JavaBeans. They decided that they wanted to try to put the entire JVM in the browser which is heavyweight even now, much less back then, but back then everyone thought thick clients were the future. The getters and setters to this day are things Java developers do, but when asked to explain why it's a good idea, everyone just kind of looks around the room and shrugs.\n\nThen when things changed, they bet on heavy backend frameworks, namely Enterprise JavaBeans. The problem is that it's really hard to make a framework that can deploy general purpose components, and the swings they were taking at it were respectable, but it's a tough nut to crack. I've only worked with one framework that I would consider viable even up to now. So in many ways they were just trying to do too much.\n\nThere's also a bunch of legacy stuff they've been stuck supporting in the JDK, not much they can do about that if backwards compatibility is a concern, and of course it is. Much of the Collections API could be way better, and of course a lot of other weird, inconsistent behavior.\n\nThen there's the language stuff, some of which were performance compromises, and some of which were just head scratchers. Specifically, if you look at the whole idea of tagging interfaces like Serializable, that's a big oops. Then there's stuff like the Object API supporting Map dependency with hashCode() instead of pulling that out to a separate interface. Even at the time, OO people were looking at that like what were they thinking? These things have added so much unnecessary complexity down the line, I'm sure they would take all of that back if they could.\n\nBeyond this, Sun was way too slow to move on obvious things, and since Oracle's taken over, I feel like they're way too fast to move on non-obvious things.\n\nFor example, once dependency injectors became popular, it's absolutely obvious that this is in line with basic OO principles, so why didn't Sun support dependency inversion directly in the JDK, or even at the language level? It took **forever** to get even javax standard annotations for that. Bonkers. They could have done so much more than Dagger2 currently does with access to the JVM and the compiler. The kind of stuff Sun added were things like varargs, and absolutely insane choice that makes basic things like method dispatch hard to understand, all to save typing a few keywords? Then even after they added varargs, it took them forever to add printf to take advantage of it. Why?\n\nNow that Oracle has taken over, though, they are just adding all sorts of stuff to the language. I will say that there was a lot of pent up demand so I attribute some of the innovation to that, and they are doing some real cleanup stuff around enhancing correctness (I guess Valhalla falls into that category), but some of it is just tossing features in that add a ton of complexity and alternative ways of doing things that aren't necessarily better. So the language is becoming more like C++ now, just chuck the kitchen sink in there. One of the things I've always loved about Java is how simple it is, and how much complexity was deferred to the library layer if possible. I think Java has gone beyond a critical mass in terms of complexity now, and once later versions of Java are adopted across the industry, it's only a matter of time until you see codebases doing similar things in dramatically different ways, but without any particular advantage to either. Oh well.",

          "text": "When I was young (8?) I learned Basic from a book and coded in paper until my dad finally got a computer with DOS and GW-Basic. Then I somehow got my hands o a Pascal compiler and dabbled into some 2D graphics. I learned C++ after highschool, and during college, when this \"web\" thing started, I installed apache on a college Sun workstation and learned Perl, then used it for many web projects.\n\nOut of college in my first job my boss I dabbled in PHP and Python but left after only a year. My second job forced me to learn Java. I didn't want to, but the Jetbrains IDE's auto complete and refactoring features made it a breeze to learn. I stayed there for 9 years, and became rather good with and quite fond of Java and SQL. I left that job for a career in IT management, and I've never worked as a developer ever since.\n\nFor the last 13 years, when I've written code it's either to make my own job easier, or for personal projects.\n\nNow with AI I can do a lot more, and recently I wondered: which language would be best for me to learn next? Maybe the one that AI is best at coding with? should I finally learn Ruby, or Go, or TS?\n\nAfter a long, deep series of  conversations with Claude it, turns out Java does have a lot of advantages for agentic coding.\n\nAnd come to think of it: What matters more today for me (as a veteran ex-developer) is that since I know Java well, I'm much better off herding AI agents that are coding in Java, because I can better help them, correct them, answer their questions and understand their work. If I try to do the same in languages new to me, I'm either dead weight, or vibe coding.\n\nSo as a veteran in Java who no longer codes for a living but for my own benefit, I'm glad modern Java is healthy, because I'm going to keep riding it to the sunset.",

It's basically the anecdotes of my generation coding at the turn of the century, the dot com boom/bust.\n\nAs for myself, the big change for me was going from PHP/Perl/Python in the 90's for general web stuff to doing Java in the Telco industry in the oughts.\n\nBack then x86 servers had two cores at most, and even Sun servers were not that fast. Scaling (either vertically or horizontally) was nowhere near as easy as today (and was very expensive), and Telcos often demanded solutions that ran on their precious Sun Sparc or IBM Power hardware.\n\nTheir Oracle databases could take two weeks to process a hundred million call detail records in pure PL-SQL (billing processes) and with the new cellphone craze, call numbers / data / business were exploding. There was money to be made if you could offload work from those slow billing/OSS systems that ran on expensive SPARC/Power servers, to clusters of commodity x86.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Java was a godsend with it's portability between Solaris/AIX/Linux, it's ease of deploying as a distributed system (JNDI + RMI was easier than SOAP/XML hell), data locality through embedded databases (HSQL then H2), plus good useful and concurrent collections. All we needed was to be careful to intentionally avoid all things toxic (any JEE other than JNDI, any XML parsing library, any ORM, etc).\n\n I spent 10 years in the industry, had a nice carreer from assistant developer to Architect.\n\nI left just when smartphones started to happen, just before Big Data with Hadoop got traction, and just before \"being a software developer\" became a well paying job that would attract lots of people and pay in USD (I'm not in the U.S.).\n\nI left because, as the Net slaves book points out, developing software had been grueling hours, poor management, dehumanizing pressures and paranoia-inducing stresses. I was very lucky to land an IT management job in a fantastic company that changed my life.",

An object might be compatible with functions based on its fields, rather than by inheritance.\n\nAnother thing Java’s type system lacks is sum types, (except for enums, which technically are the weakest possible implementation of sum types, but that’s not super interesting).

Google was just the vendor who first declared the experiment a failure but Microsoft was also trying to kill it in favour of their own experiment Active-X. In fact Sun sued Microsoft for trying to kill it before Oracle got involved at all.\n\nThere has never been a time when there was more client side Java code in the world than client side JavaScript. JavaScript has always been the workhorse of the client. At first they served different markets but when JavaScript got a fast engine and a canvas, the motivation for having two runtimes in the browser was gone. Java on the client was doomed from the very start. We just didn’t know it.\n\nI haven’t programmed in Java for decades but it started out like Go as a very small language that ignored all recent advancements in programming language theory and also did not try to be ergonomic like a scripting language. I found it incredibly boring. It was like a new syntax for Simula which was a language 20 years older.\n\nI’m sure it’s fine now. Probably still boring but not as primitive.\n\nEdit: I forgot about Flash which also helped to bridge the gap until JavaScript was fast and rich enough.",

You didn't need to pay Microsoft for IIS to serve your web apps (C#), you could use multiple processors (not Python), you could thread it (not PHP), you could also \\*read\\* the code later (not Perl).  And unlike Python and Perl and PHP, debugging was much easier; you could \\*use\\* a debugger like a full-weight language, and that helps quite a bit.\n\nJava also did JIT compiling, so you got a lotta the speed of development, and development speed was more important than CPU cost for almost all apps. For something Google scale, CPU cost starts to dominate, but that used Java on the business logic regardless.\n\nI wish it had less boilerplate, and I wish the libraries had bloated a bit less - or had one more layer of modularity.

Every personal project I've ever written in Java was fine. I just like Go better. The problem I have is with the build tools and the likelihood that something written in Java is \"legacy code\" because of software development practices that are tablestakes today but weren't common when the software was written.\n\nI've got a multi-MLOC codebase at work that builds with maven. It's divided into modules that are about 500 kLOC each on average and incremental builds take like 30 minutes. This is a problem we solve today in language design: the compilation units are too large because Java allows circular dependencies within compilation units. Using Bazel, breaking it into independent chunks with one compilation unit per package followed by aggregation of minimal connected subgraphs reduced it to 2s for an incremental build. Tons of unit tests? No one is using tests in the hot loop of their programming workflow if it takes 30 minutes to run a build, so a lot of this software is either untested or has only integration tests.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot of stuff that can't or at least shouldn't be written in Java that has to exist so that people can write in Java. I'm also a devops guy (in the sense that I split my time between development and operations, and use the development time to fix the reliability or automatability problems I saw in operations; not in the sense that do operations full time but use YAML files and gitops instead of ssh and kubectl), and operating (and trying to configure for optimal performance) JVM is a nightmare when you start to run into performance problems that are spread out all over the several MLOC codebase.",

Only infra/ops does.\n\nThe problem is that when something breaks on stage, infra often asks devs to debug application behavior, but we don’t have access to the cluster (no kubectl, no logs from Istio/Envoy, only limited app logs in a separate log cluster).\n\nThis makes debugging slow and very inefficient — every small check or change requires back-and-forth with infra, and even simple issues can take days.\n\nIs it considered best practice for devs to have at least read-only access to staging (logs, describe, metrics), or should staging be strictly infra-owned?\n\nHow do you usually handle this in your teams?",

QA env (whatever they do, it's a mystery!)\n4. staging mirrored as closely as possible to prod, for testing non-code things as well (network/infra upgrades etc)\n5. prod A+B ideally with ability to upgrade one side, test it without making live, then flip to it\n6. If required a dedicated UAT, otherwise it just gets stuffed into other envs and causes friction\n\nIt's also beneficial to have other on-demand envs like stress testing, regression test testing, a process to anonymize prod data for replicating issues outside of prod.\n\nIn reality most shops I've been at just have dev and prod and it's a nightmare.",

I also think your point about Wellfound matches reality, startups seem more responsive there than LinkedIn spray and pray. Thanks for posting real numbers, it helps normalize how much volume and patience this takes even for experienced folks.",

This is a company that has doubled or tripled in size in the past year. Is that a red flag for my job stability if I join this company? Or is there a chance their process actually was too lenient before and they were just letting a lot of incompetent people in during a hyper growth phase.\n\nEdit: Updating to add more context. I don't know exactly how fast they fired, it might have been 3-6 months not 1-3 months, I was just guesstimating. The person did say that the managers would ask them all what's going on and try to work with them first. Also, this company didn't even have an engineering department at all a year ago, they went to like 100 engineers in like a year, and it sounds like they have since made their interview process tougher and more thorough and it's not as much of a problem as it used to be.",

          "text": "Honestly, even if they hired great people, going from no engineering department to 100 engineers in one year would have been chaos - and hard for them to accurately evaluate people’s individual performance. \n\nThink about it. They hired new ICs at various levels, tech leads, new managers, new head of engineering, plus probably new PMs, designers, etc. Building everything from the ground up, which means working out ways of working, company coding standards & practices, common tooling, technologies, patterns, building internal tooling and setting up infrastructure, CI/CD, project setup etc all without much of a roadmap - before they even get to identifying & breaking down priority features of what needs to be built by who.\n\nIn all that mess, how did they decide who was and wasn’t performing? Was it cutting a whole team that didn’t seem to be delivering (maybe they put more time into getting their foundations in place first; or maybe it was the tech lead or an individual that undermined performance) while keeping the team that smashed something out that impressed the founders (that may actually be crap AI generated code that is absolutely not production level quality, will be difficult to maintain, is not following any shared company technology or patterns); or did they trust a manager to make the decision even though that manager might be shit themselves and just playing politics, throwing others under the bus?\n\nMy last job I joined a team that was newly forming, they didn’t hire a tech lead or delivery PM until 2 months past my hiring (more like 6 months from first IC joining), and there was no clear direction until after that point. I did what I could as a mid level to improve team ways of working and identify work priorities, had to step up to act more like a senior in the absence of any seniors, however it was the worst way to start a new job and had absolutely the slowest ramp up speed - which was not determined by the quality of the people hired. Multiply that by 10-15 teams in a newly formed department!\n\nExpect that you are walking into a hot mess, that will have terrible morale, and you may be fired for “underperformance” even if you give it everything you’ve got.",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nWe've seen a lot of confusion (and some complaints) about Rules 3 and 9, specifically what counts as \"general career advice\" vs. stuff that belongs here, and what makes a post \"low effort.\"\n\nSo we updated the wiki with some actual explanations and examples. If you're wondering why a post got removed, check there first: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/wiki/index/)\n\nThe short version:\n\n**Rule 3:** If you remove yourself from the post and the question becomes meaningless, it's a personal advice request, not a discussion. We're not an advice desk. Also, if your question would work just as well on r/ExperiencedAccountants it's probably not dev-specific.\n\n**Rule 9:** \"Does anyone else...?\" posts, venting disguised as questions, single-line prompts, and stuff with no real discussion hook. Also: a post getting hundreds of comments doesn't mean it belongs here. Generic relatable content is exactly what we're trying to avoid.\n\nThe wiki has a table with good/bad post examples if you want specifics. These rules do have a moderator discretion disclaimer, so keep that in mind when you're posting.\n\nThe rules have not changed but we hope this provides a guide for posting and encouraging thoughtful discussion in this community. \n\nQuestions? Drop them here or PM the mod team. ",

Was a big joy when I got the concept working as I never expected the wild idea I had to actually work out the way it did! It works by slightly moving the camera and taking multiple images and blending the resulting images in such a way that the area that should be in focus, which is present in all images, is placed on top of each other. This solves the big problem screenspace depth of field effects/shaders have in that near plane blur (so something that's out of focus and in front of the subject that is in focus) in real life is transparent and basically shows what's behind the out of focus element around the edges, however in a rendered frame that data isn't available (as it's occluded by the near plane element). For instance: <https://cdn.myportfolio.com/babf9577def101884554d0d345fd30e2/65621a17-586e-47a8-93d5-dda8e700070f.PNG?h=57b216308fb69fa0aa24123ebcae395e> where you see the sword's edges are transparent and show what's behind it as that's in focus. that's not possible in screenspace depth of fields\n\nCode: https://github.com/FransBouma/IgcsConnector\nExample images and docs: https://opm.fransbouma.com/igcsdof.htm",

What I mean is that there’s multiple SRE teams, but I report to the director and push initiatives based on his need across a few teams. Some of these being POCing new projects, revamping processes, driving cultural improvements. I’m excited to have such an opportunity, but I’m realizing that in the industry this is typically expected of Staff level engineers with about double my YOE. I’m also hitting a bit of a wall, where the teams I’m working with look to me as an extra pair of hands, so I either don’t have enough time to work stories or work team/dept level improvements.\n\nSo similarly to the title, how did you guys grow into the IC role? How did you guys skill up for organizational needs, how do you ensure you’re performant when working many initiatives across teams? What were some of your core learnings when navigating this transition in responsibilities?",

Creating that leverage or multiplication rarely comes from actual work, but rather from architecture or cross organization process. Less “here’s a PR to fix this bug and implement this feature” and more “we have a serious misstep in logging across our app, leading to longer debug time and harder ticket resolutions, here’s a ADR/TDD that we need to implement across the org, starting with this project/area”. \n\nYou need to do more by doing less. You’re not implementing the changes or plugging holes (sometimes yes this might be the case), you’re valued for looking at it at a higher degree and getting your other counter parts (product, infra, data, etc) aligned without your skip. Your team is the one you entrust to actually get it done, and you oversee that to make sure it’s happening. THEN, if you see your team still needs a hand or there’s a skill gap, jump in to get the initiative done.\n\n\nI would also have a frank discussion with your skip about leveling because you will resent thinking you’re operating levels ahead and not actually progressing with the title/promotions.",
