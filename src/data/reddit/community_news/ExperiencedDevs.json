If the code being submitted actually *needs* frequent review and problems happen if it isn't, that a red flag. Not a code red flag, but either a process red flag or a personnel red flag. In this age of AI, it's an ideal tool to prevent AI slop from polluting your code.\n\nIt is possible, on occasion, to spot an actual bug via code review, and that's a nice benefit, but in general it is not the goal. Reviewers' brains are not compilers or IDEs. We cannot just read code and tell exactly what it does without testing it. We might have a good idea of what it does and whether it works correctly, but the final arbiter is always QA (or failing that, your users now turned into beta testers).\n\nIn my experience, code review has been relied on to make sure contractors and outsourced engineers don't infect your code with their slop. Those people will often find their code changes blocked or rejected outright, especially if they are still new to your team's coding standards. Contrariwise, people who have been working together for years will review code, but with an eye to asking \"Is this doing anything unreasonable?\" with respect to architecture, scalability, code style, and so on. If the org has a prohibition against inline SQL, for example, this is where to catch it. As long as there's nothing obviously wrong, the PR will pass and be merged, relying on automated tests and manual QA to find any issue. I have never had any issue with another dev making a comment to fix something up. It's either a reasonable ask or I can explain why in this case their suggestion would break assumptions of which they are unaware, and so on.",

Having worked on teams with different cultures, here are all the ways I’ve seen them used with each being appropriate for their environment\n\n1) A way more senior developers interact with a larger set of work and keep the team aligned and on the right track. People who review much more than they write\n2) A way to gently expose Juniors to more Senior work. Expectation they try to engage with it and ask questions. The reviews themselves serve as knowledge for new Juniors to read and grow from to understand historical context.\n3) A way to reduce the # of bugs by (% of bugs)^(# reviewers). Hard to say how closely it follows that equation (never seen it outright measured) but bugs getting caught is definitely common enough on a sprint basis that it is absolutely valid. In a similar fashion, ensuring test coverage is sufficient to prevent accidental bugs from being introduced later, because of unintended behavior changes that were not codified.\n4) A way to keep semi-formal standards that are not made easily automated held by the group. A way for the team to shape those standards by discussing. Can be seen as just nits often, but reveals what the team considers a nit and smoothens collaboration expectations by exposing them.\n5) (IMO, generally the most important) A way to ensure redundancy of understanding between changes and feature areas overtime. No change is understood by only 1 person allowing for the team to always be cross collaborating effectively over a longer period of time. \n\nIf you can’t point to how a PR review is adding value to your team, then generally voice that and aim for some type of fix. I’ve also seen teams that did not do PR reviews which allowed any of the above problems to creep in as a systematic culture problem that was difficult to reverse",

We noticed this gap with our post-2020 hires despite our best efforts, they weren't picking up the tacit knowledge that comes from sitting next to senior engineers.\nThe solution was surprisingly simple: Open Audio Rooms.\n\nWe shifted from private 1-on-1 calls to public voice channels. If I’m pairing on a feature, I hop into an open room instead of sending a private invite. If we need a third opinion, a teammate can see we’re talking and join us without the friction of calendar invites or missed DMs. Even if you’re working solo, sitting in an open channel recreates the office \"buzz.\" You can listen in on problem-solving in the background or just feel less isolated. The best part is that unlike a real office, you have the ability to cut the audio and leave when you need deep focus.\n\nOur new grad picked up a ton of knowledge this year and our ~2022 hire vastly improved their knowledge over the last year after we switched to working this way.",

As someone that's worked in-office and remote for quite a few years in both, I vastly prefer remote for all it's benefits over in-office for it's few benefits. In-office is just a constant barrage of interruptions from loud coworkers, chatty neighbors and people just \"stopping by with a quick question\". There are countless tools to assist in remote whiteboarding, it just seems like most companies don't feel like adopting them. When it comes to straight up collaboration on something like rubber ducking or over the shoulder debugging, remote largely feels the same minus someone staring over your shoulder. When it comes to roadmapping and planning, you tend to capture more in documents than on a whiteboard when doing it remote.\n\nAt the companies I've worked remotely, we've done in-person offsites and remote planning sessions. The entire benefit the in-person is the social aspect after the meetings. The actual meetings feel largely the same.\n\n> In 10 years I think we'll look back at how we do remote today...\n\nAssuming it's not gone because of all the RTO mandates. I agree tools SHOULD improve but I'd be curious how hard it is for a company to get funded with remote work tech as their basis in this wave of calls for RTO.",

Remote is phenomenal for collaboration at large group sizes, but it requires you to be a lot more intentional for collaboration in small groups.\n\nThe ceiling for remote collaboration in small groups might be technically lower, but I think the ceiling is still dramatically higher than most in-person groups actually achieve in practice.

Of course the new team using MSTeams is getting forced back to the office 'because collaboration' lol.\n\n\nHonestly, stop using private communication, no one cares that your question is silly, there are no silly questions. Just ask. And treat the group chat like the office, say hello, say goodbye, mention that it's beertime on Fridays, talk about the food you cooked.

There’s so much they pick up just by being in the room with seniors little habits, ways of approaching problems, even how to ask for help. When you’re remote you have to be intentional about creating those moments.\n\nOne thing that’s helped my team is pairing sessions with cameras on and a running slack channel where anyone can chime in. We also encourage juniors to check in with a couple of peers or a senior after they wrap a task: not just on the code, but on how they communicated and collaborated. It’s surprising how different those perspectives can be from how you see yourself. A few honest conversations can bridge the gap that physical proximity used to provide.",

People were submitting these massive AI-generated PRs and I’d spend an hour just trying to figure out what changed and why. Half the time the author couldn’t explain it either because they didn’t write it.\n\n> So I started a new rule. Any PR over 150 lines, we schedule 15 minutes and you walk me through it. Not async comments. Not a Loom video. You and me, screen share, explain what this code does and why you made these choices.\n\n> First week, guy shows up with a 600-line PR. Gets about 3 minutes in and realizes he can’t explain what half of it does. Closes the meeting, comes back two days later with a 90-line PR that actually makes sense.\n\n> Now most PRs are under 100 lines. People are breaking things up because they know they’ll have to defend it live. And when they can’t explain something, they go back and either figure it out or rewrite it before the meeting.\n\n> It’s not perfect. Some people hate it. But review time dropped and I’m not just rubber stamping AI slop anymore.\n\n> What'd u do?",

      "text": "Friends, do not make the same mistake as I did. I'm about five years into my professional software engineering career. I am nearly finished with a 12-month contract and expect to spend some time unemployed in what appears to be the worst job market ever, absolute lunacy riddled with bots, AI slop and 1,000+ applicants for every position. And my problem is that I have nothing to show. Allow me to explain.\n\n\nMy career had problems from the beginning. I graduated from a no-name college with a sub 3.0 GPA due to mental illness. I managed to cure my illness about three years ago, finally figuring it all out and entering into the most productive phase of my career. This was a great breakthrough, but I had too much to prove at this point and got fired from my Fortune 500 job after being put on a PIP.\n\n\nA while later, I got this 12 month contract at a mid-sized company. I was about 3 to 10 times more productive compared to when I started, sometimes clearing out multiple tickets in a single day. Problem is, the company initially put me on some difficult issues involving thorny bugs or small but tricky to implement features. I solved these just fine, but I often overestimated the time I'd need to spend on tasks. What I thought would take 3 or 4 days often took 1 or 2 weeks. It was fine though, I was learning their systems.\n\n\nEventually, management decided to plan sprints. So you had to estimate the time you'd spend on an issue, but also how many issues you could fit into a sprint. And my team started giving me easy, brain-dead issues like changing one property in one file. I'd sometimes spend more time managing merge requests than I'd spend developing for those tickets. This made the estimations much more accurate for management, but it was code monkey stuff. I let this go on for a month or two until I complained to my team lead, but the company had already declined to renew my contract.\n\n\nNow the team had serious, rigorous development work it needed to do. It needed to get rid of these C++/Lua bindings and replace the Lua with pure C++, it needed unit tests, and it needed to abolish serious data duplication anti-patterns which were all over the place. But most of these issues were either not ticketed or forever buried in the backlog. I was specifically hired to introduce unit tests and test-driven development to the codebase, but this was pushed far back to a distant release. I tried to work on it by myself in my spare time, but I just didn't have the energy after having dealt with all the menial tasks they assigned me.\n\n\nJust closing tickets does not make you a better developer. Often, this is what management thinks they want but it's a shit proxy for real development. You need to tackle difficult, risky, complex, hard-to-estimate issues that result in big, demonstrable improvements, and do this under proper refactoring methodologies so the rest of the team isn't disrupted. And then you need to convince your team they'll never find anybody else who can do this better than you. I didn't do this.\n\n\nAlso, I didn't really want to be a software engineer. I wanted to be a computer scientist, but judging from the above you can probably see how well that went. I naturally find most development work quite boring, and this makes it harder to go deeper and create better implementations for products and services I don't particularly care about. The tech industry constantly brags about being innovative, but the funny thing is, the amount of innovation in run-of-the-mill corporate work is close to zero.\n\n\nSo, my problems were:\n1. I didn't handle any complex implementations, just random bug fixes and features of small to moderate complexity.\n2. Near the end, management started giving me menial tasks and I didn't protest that hard enough.\n3. Because I didn't have any complex implementations to my name, I didn't have unique expertise in areas of the codebase that would have made it harder for me to be replaced.\n4. In my spare time I decided to teach myself impractical CS topics like theory of computation, when I really should have been working on the above.\n\n\nNow, I have a major problem going into the job market: I didn't create complex implementations for most of my past jobs. Of course, some of this is excusable because of mental illness, but you can't bring that up in a job interview. So I don't know how to answer the question \"what have you done\"? And I expect this job market to be the worst ever. Last year I applied to over 1000 jobs before I got my current contract.\n\n\nSo don't be like me. If you want to be a good software engineer, you have to take a little bit more responsibility. If you want to do outstanding work that will really stand out on your resume, you might have to take the initiative yourself as your team or your management might be averse to giving you important things to do. They might not think you're capable, even if you are.\n\n\nOf course, it wasn't all bad and my time wasn't all wasted. Some major wins for me were:\n1. Becoming vastly more productive in general.\n2. Improvements in communicating with teammates.\n3. Improvements in understanding and implementing product requirements.\n5. Implementing moderately complex features and solving some fairly difficult bugs.\n6. Getting better at pair programming, debugging, C++ and the UI framework we used.\n7. Getting familiar with new codebases. One of my co-workers said I learned the codebase in three months where it typically took new employees two years.\n\n\nThat is all. Goodbye.",

          "text": "Grok, please summarize.\n\nI kid, but I've been there too, been in the industry for over 6 years, coming up on 7.\n\nI learned the hard way too. What I ended up doing to help myself from getting overloaded with complex or untracked work was utilizing the agile method mgmt said they used. Ticket estimations are allowed to be increased, so once I've dived into the code for a ticket and seen that it's a bit more complex, I let them know the next stand up. If it's big enough, I tell them it needs to be broken into multiple tasks and the original ticket needs to be turned into a story.\n\nAvoidance, like learning theory of computation, when you should be doing tasks, for me with ADHD, is a classic sign of Overwhelm™️. It's something I've had to learn to overcome and I've had to recognize why it happens. For me, Overwhelm™️ happens when the ticket requirements and outcomes aren't clear enough and when I don't really know what to do, at a granular level. It's an easy trap to fall into when you \"get it\" at a high level but don't get what it means functionally.\n\nFor tasks like needing to add unit tests but not being documented as stories/tickets, you need to elevate that to the PM or whoever owns the backlog and **get them to do the work of prioritizing it or not**. Say, \"hey, this was asked of me by X, but this isn't captured in any tickets. How important is this? I don't want to risk my other tickets failing because I'm spending untracked time on untracked work. Where should this fit in our sprints?\"\n\nAnd failure is a crucial part of success, so you can absolutely use some of the lessons you learned as part of your interview answers. Just make sure they're oriented towards the improvement you learned.\n\nBeing someone who is good at working with others is really valuable, even if you didn't make big waves. Some examples I came up with, from your post:\n\n- by elevating issues/concerns, you helped get the project on track\n   - demonstrates ownership, communication, being concerned with project hygiene, focused on goals\n- being able to better estimate tickets and immediately communicating when your initial estimate wasn't accurate after research\n  - demonstrates humility/improvement for saying you weren't the best at estimation but got better, timely communication on issues encountered\n- learning a codebase faster than average and solving moderately complex features, completed on time\n  - demonstrates work ethic, eagerness to learn, team player\n\nHaving good communication and escalation skills, as I outlined above, is valued very highly and will get you far. You don't have to be a rockstar to land jobs. Just being someone who will make the gears turn smoother and quicker can be all you need to secure that position. Obviously, you have to know what you're doing, but it seems you also already have that covered.",

No SWE2s at the time (we did pick one up thankfully within a couple weeks).  That first week though I was chatting with the SWE1s and found out they were all industry hires and probably should be close to being promoted.  However when I asked them about career plans what I got back was \"I'm just happy to have a job right now.\"\n\nMorale is not great right now.  The team lost a significant number of people due to regional changes, then layoffs, and then finally PIPs.\n\nThe lower level ICs in general seem to work a bit shorter than a full day compared to most, and when WFH they don't always focus on work stuff (let's be honest I'm guilty of this myself after being off for so long) showing I guess a lack of motivation for the work itself and maybe wanting to get some of their time back on the commute (vs WFH never having a commute).\n\nThey also just seem to show a lack of motivation for learning.  Probably not helped with what feels like lots of rubber stamping of PRs and not truly diving into the underlying issues in code, and just asking AI \"how do I fix this?\".  That being said they do show passion for learning how to get AI to do stuff but to me that feels like the easy way out in a sort of way?\n\nLike, once you know how to do something yourself it's easy to tell if AI has done it correctly or incorrectly.  Asking AI to just do it for you and making sure it builds and the issue is fixed just taught you nothing, and may have introduced another bug that's even harder to find.  Maybe how to better prompt AI to do stuff but even then maybe not because there isn't necessarily a correlation between your prompt working once and it working every time.",

Could have just been the non-tech companies in non-tech cities that I have worked at in my career, but I found it rare to to find people that would actually sit down and teach rather than give you the answer and walk away.\n\nI make sure to always teach when I help people and give you context without them even having to ask.  Though saying that I have found a small set of SWEs that got annoyed with the context and just wanted answers.  Some even got annoyed you didn't let them know the context prior to that point.\n\nLike they just want you to tell them random information that you think they may need to know.  I actually tried that one time and told one of theses SWEs that I just got out a meeting with upper management and they are looking to do X long them.  This SWEs turned it back around on me and was like \"why are you telling me this?\". lol.\n\n> Someone would notice you were stuck and offer a perspective without you having to schedule a meeting.\n\nI find many SWEs don't want unsolicited help today.  It's like they think it makes them look bad or something.  I just look to understand the personalities involved and help the people that want help and shrug when others scoff at me for the unsolicited thoughts.\n\nThis is also harder when working in a remote environment.  You can't exactly tell when somebody is stuck like when everybody is in the office.  I'm not saying everybody needs to RTO, but it's a side effect of working remotely.  If you need help you need to be proactive about it and ask.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's different at tech companies as I have never worked at one.

The leader would read out the ticket, there'd be a little discussion and the floor would be open for anyone to question any aspect of the ticket.  Then we'd do a quick round of Planning Poker.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Planning Poker is a tool in which every \"player\" has a selection of cards marked with the first few Fibonacci numbers: 0,1,3,5,8,13,21.  And they select a card that represents the complexity of the task; changing a word, that's a zero.  Adding more fields to a form might be a three or five, fleshing out some API endpoints, thirteen.  When everyone has bid, they all show their cards - and the leader asks, in a spirit of curiosity not challenge, the lowest and the highest number to justify their bid.\n\nThis would usually result in something like unanimous agreement, and the ticket would be estimated and entered into the backlog for the forthcoming sprint.  But occasionally, there'd be a twinkle in the eye of the most senior coder and we'd find they'd bid extremely high or low and on asking why, they'd explain that they either did something heinous six years ago that would need rewriting or the form autobuilt and just needed an array extending or whatever, and the task would be harder or easier than expected.\n\nOr maybe a junior coder had come up with some new trinket they'd like to incorporate or whatever.\n\nAnd on the occasion the bidder just said \"I think I may have misunderstood\" or \"my attention went\" then everyone takes ten minutes to get coffee and wash their face or whatever brightened them up for the rest of the two hour meeting.\n\nOh, and if the consensus was 21, the leader would generally take the ticket away and chop it up smaller because the complexity was too great for one sprint to easily digest.",

Comparatively the rest of my week at home is quiet and I can get things done with more confidence that others aren’t as stuck or heading in the wrong direction. Besides that, in our small office, we spend lunch together, we ask each other about our weekends, we know and understand each other better which I think helps us work together better. Maybe we can achieve some of that fully remote but when we’ve tried to onboard fully remote people, the success and outcomes of that is not even close to having days working together in the office.\n\nFYI for all of the last ~20 years we’ve had some remote working, at least once there was confidence you could spend the majority of a day working independently, it has been expanded since covid and is unlikely to decrease. If anything we’re more likely to end up fully remote which would be a big negative for me and we would need to consider how we actually are working day to day and likely introduce more team meetings over the whole week as a minimum while still losing out on the chitchat that we have now.",

I did have one job where it was 4\\\\5 days in the office, but the offices I've worked at have always been a very short distance away. I fully understand the benefits of remote work if the office is way further away, and I worked overseas at one point, so had to be done. It's also good if the company can save money by moving to a smaller office space, not needing to have snacks etc. at the office so much, cleaning and utility costs go down. The push to 'get back in the office' is nothing but politics, from people who have invested in real-estate and now those spaces sit empty because most people work from home and don't rent those spaces. So let's push people back in.\n\nEven as a 100% remote worker, my days are often filled with meetings. Can't escape 'em, be it office or not. But I personally like to work with people face-to-face. Hopefully I will eventually land a job where I can again.

Hybrid works great for some situations.\n\nFor example in my government job, everyone had an office that they shared with someone else. WFH one or twice per week meant that you could deconflict the office about half the time, giving employees that “private office” experience.\n\nAlso the pace of work was pretty slow, so WFH days were in-effect a personal day. As long as your were (relatively) reachable via email or Skype For Business (🤮), you could mostly fuck around. People would literally say “don’t schedule meetings on my WFH days”.\n\nAt the fortune 100, I was both fully-in office and fully-remote at times. In-office was stupid: my team was spread out across the country. I was commuting in order to sit on zoom. Remote was an easy schedule, but it’s more disconnected. We would try to do a team retreat once or twice a year, and it was really nice to see everyone’s faces. I think pretty critical for being an actual “team”, and I wish we could have done it more often.\n\nWe also had a bunch of teams that were hybrid — I think it worked well for them. Many of our software teams developed embedded systems, or worked with our manufacturing plants. There was plenty of work that could *only* happen on-site, and it was nice to stay connected to the fundamentals of the company (welding metal, turning screws).\n\nAt my startup, we’re 5 days in office, and it’s the right call. Technical decisions happen too fast for the pace of async. People can stay in the loop just by overhearing conversations across the room. It’s a lot easier to trust other engineers when you spend more time with them, you get to know them as whole people. The team is only 9 right now, so who knows what happens if we grow to 30 or 100.

Similar benefits, lower cost. As for \"larger pool of talent\"; I haven't personally seen a struggle to find people of the right skill set, and even then, knowledge only takes you so far.\n\nAfter a certain point, for most teams, various soft skills (with the benefits of working together in person) become _significantly_ more important than having an extra framework on the CV. \n\n> For people working this way (in office 1, 2 days a week), do you see a benefit from the development side of things?

That just tells me they aren't affective in their comms tools imo (back in the old days, I'd be on IM and ignoring shoulder taps anyway ).\n- hiring manager has a different opinion to HR. I've been in this situation where my roles were hybrid but I never expected anyone to go to the office unless it was their choice. The only caveat was \"unless explicitly asked to for an event\"\n- it does make on boarding easier due to physical setup and debugging key IT before you're able to access the remote tools\n- insert office rent excuse here\n\n\nI think it always depends on the role. As a much more senior engineer /manager, you do kinda need to mix with other people and teams. I've found even tho I personally push good remote habits for my teams, others don't. Therefore I'm more encouraged to bridge their silo by being in person unfortunately. Even hybrid, this is problematic as teams usually have non overlapping days in to avoid busy offices.. Which defeats the purpose imo. ",

My default decision right now is using LLMs and lots and lots of googling, but LLMs seem to be poor at these higher level decisions and googling is the just the default solution. Obviously I think the correct decision for a start up like this is to hire a more experienced engineer at this critical time, but I definitely need a job and only just got this one after months of applying.",

It appeared that the correct approach would be event-driven: a file lands in a bucket, you set up an SQS queue to a Lambda that triggers a thing, that triggers another thing, etc.\n\nI asked everyone I knew what they thought about it, and they seemed to think it was pretty good. I implemented it, and it worked well enough.\n\nA more correct solution would have been to use Step Functions, but that had just come out and I wasn't aware of it yet. In retrospect, I think all of that architecture is terrible; there is a much simpler way to do it. Software engineers by nature tend to be pretty intelligent people and like to prove that to other smart software engineers. So they design elegant and clever things.\n\nThe main thing I would take from this: **just do the simplest thing that'll work, because you just don't know what you don't know yet**. And also, the requirements will change. That's how I approach all decisions. Be willing to throw away whatever you do. Know that you'll learn along the way. Just be quick to adapt. And keep grinding.\n\nYou're not hired to create something elegant and clever. You're hired to create something that works all the time without exceptions or excuses.

Try to keep things modular and flexible so you can expand later but don't spend time building super flexibilility or abstractions that you may not need in the short term.\n\nIf you have an existing code-base that makes things more complicated.  It may be worthwhile to try and reuse some of it but it could very well also be a time-sink and compromise your long-term architecture.  Someone on my team suggests using an AI to answer questions and provide an overview of existing code but I absolutely would not let an AI write anything for you - not at your level of experience and the general fragility of AI-developed software.\n\nOh, and did I mention you should write down on paper your requirements, architecture, schema, major flows, etc.?

If it doesn’t work put it on the backlog and you’ll get to it someday. Revolving door problem don’t lose sleep here. \n\nIf your architecture decision results in make a rather permanent fixture for the life of you startup then you should really take the time to Google and understand the proper trade offs. However for these the decisions it’s often aligned with the industry standard way of doing things. So make sure to do a lot of research and talk to people in industry to come to a good solution. Copy well known architecture in the wild (similar to the adage “no one got fired buying IBM”. (1 way door problems)\n\nA couple irreversible (highly contentious to change) decisions areas:\n\nCloud: AWS\nDNS: Route53, sometimes Cloudflare\nDomain Registrar: AWS \n\nDatabases: pick Postgres and jame everything into the database until it causes issues (years from now). Might be a hot take but at least it’ll be a business problem not a you made a bad decision problem. \n\nProgramming lang: industry dependent but in general Ruby on Rails, Python, Java will be good everywhere. \n\nWhen in doubt pick boring technology. DO NOT PICK SOMETHING EXCITING Kafka, or Mongdb\n\nOTHERS \n\nCI/CD: CircleCI, GitHub Actions. (Jenkins is a big NO. Buildkite meh)\n\nSecrets: AWS secrets manager. Maybe sops. Don’t use Vault as a solo maintainer. \n\n\nEnvironment variables IS BETTER than hardcoded urls in source code. This is where you’ll run into most of the business issues and your Devops backlog because the app was not built with flexibility in mind. Which means it make it much harder to run the app in isolation, ephemeral (mock service urls instead of fixed prod and staging)\n\nFINAL NOTE\n\ntraffic architecture: in general if you add a traffic routing shim just after the DNS layer and before the database layer (usually app EnvVars) you almost guarantee your architecture to be infinitely flexible because when you need to make changes (even big ones) you can just flip a switch to route traffic to a different location. \n\n instead of doing weird wacky stuff at the app layer and having to deploy a new version of the app in maintenance mode and then redeploying to go back. And it usually ensure you don’t have to mess with DNS and wait for the cache to bust. It’s instantaneous. \n\n\n—\nI’ve been the solo Devops person many times so I’m very familiar with your position. \n\nIt’s not hard to develop intuition if you just build a lot of little POCs and test the migration paths given different scenarios. But again if you can add a traffic shim after DNS you are golden. \n\nIf you ever need help you can reach out on LinkedIn. Shoot me a PM and we can connect.",

Past colleagues, friend of friends, I don't know, but a real person who's available and willing will be by far your biggest boost.\n- **Books** and other _reviewable_ media: The designing data driven applocations book, the github repo on system design interview questions, YouTube videos from reputable sources on the topic of architecture and design, etc. Books are very underrated nowadays but popular good books are worth their weight in gold.

Your position requires a person that is capable of great deal of autonomy and that you can think strategically, make compromises and prioritize things by yourself.\n\nThose skills are not easy to learn quickly, but there is a bunch of advice that can help a lot.\n\nHere is how I think about your particular problem:\n\n1. You are responsible for delivering a certain capability to your company. Talk to your bosses what that capability is. Let's assume for now that it is providing platform and tools for their quickly growing application and development and ops team. And yes, it is \"ops team\" because even if you are a single person today, if they are actually growing quickly, that is going to be a team in a year.\n2. Anticipate future needs. If the organization is growing quickly, focusing on \\*current\\* stuff means you are already late to the party and you will be a bottleneck. You need to be constantly in touch with your bosses to define what is the expected state in 3, 6, 12 months from now so that you can properly prepare and prioritize work.\n3. Run gap analysis. I do this personally -> I try to imagine the state we have to be in 3, 6, 12 months and then I try to think about anything that we do not have now that we need to have in future. For each identified item I write down what it is needed for exactly and then try to figure out if I can fulfill that need in some alternative way. Talk to your bosses -> they might be completely fine spending some cash to get you unblocked, for example. I also define it as a project and then I try to define returns and investments needed to get the project done -> this is important because I probably can't get all projects done so I need to prioritize them based on RoI. I also need to be able to talk to my bosses and what CEO wants to hear from you is to the point explanation of why we need it and what it is going to cost us.\n4. Think strategically. You want all your projects to be lego bricks that fit together to achieve a desired goal.\n5. Try to get 80% of outcome with 20% of effort. Or maybe 70% with 10% of effort. You have less resources and time than you need to get everything done. Rather than getting only some things done, try to get everything moving at some reasonable pace so that there are no things that suddenly become huge blockers.\n6. Do not be afraid to use unconventional methods (but maybe discuss with management?) For example, when I got hired and suddenly needed to do a lot of infrastructure work I had little experience with, I just hired a bunch of guys on Fiverr to do the job faster and better than I would. I just made sure they are working under supervision (on Zoom calls in my case) and that I understand what has happened so that I can properly document and continue the work in future.",

When taking high level architectural decisions you can no longer dig into details or you will simply get lost in a rabbit hole and entangled. \n\nWhen making architecture choices (or rather recommendations, I have very limited agency ATM) I spend some time on the problem statement, then analysis and ideation what could possibly solve the problem, then I drill down a little to play with the ideas and create some kind of a mind model to evaluate some what-if scenarios, both optimistic but also, and especially, pessimistic. I do not dig into implementation details of specific components but rather their capabilities, e.g. if I design for multi tenancy I will be interested in capabilities and various ways of implementing it in a distributed system but without looking at how exactly the code / IaC would be written. That's tomorrow me's problem. Today's problem would be \"how would this model affect security / scalability\" or \"how easy or difficult would it be to onboard a new tenant\".\n\nWhat I end up with is some sort of a pros and cos list for each option, cost and risk matrix, e.g. I may recognize that some multi tenancy implementations could be risky from time pressure perspective while others would risk noisy neighbours problem, and such. \n\nNow that I have several options on the table, I would be looking at each of them as a list of trade-offs, eliminate options that have obvious deal breakers, and then try to order them from most to least aligned with priorities and/or most to least promising if there's no clear priority. That leads to a decision (if you have authority) or recommendations (if your role is only advisory).\n\nLast, but not least: I didn't mention earlier that it's also important to pay attention to how the system would evolve, how much upfront investment is needed to see first tangible results, and whether the architecture would be easy or hard to change or evolve into something else later. Some decisions may be very difficult to undo later, while others may leave a few options open, like building from simpler solutions that can be used as building blocks to create something more robust later, without turning the entire architecture upside down and a major overhaul. It's generally a flaw I see as a grunt in many, many architects in their ivory towers. From their perspective, a system is often a static entity that should reflect exactly their designs. If the system is incomplete or flawed then blaming happens. But a system is dynamic and ever evolving, and design docs are north stars at best and outright fantasy at worst. Remember that when designing.",

The problem is that, when you move from low level implementation and design to high level architecture decisions, the amount of criteria you need to consider for every decision is maybe one order of magnitude higher. You need to think about security, availability, integrity of data, identity/access management, auditing, scalability, maintenance, operations, team dynamics and tech affinity, domain specific criteria, backwards compatibility, testability etc. etc. the list goes on and on. You need specific experience with each of those topics, even if very generic and shallow, in order to make good architectural decisions. I think it's very important not to set expectations for yourself that you will be able to \"quickly\" learn how to make these decisions. A lot of it is just experience, which involves a lot of bad decisions.\n\nI would also add that architectural decisions are a shared responsibility, not something that the architect does in their ivory tower. But that's a different topic.\n\nSo I would say, just do your best and try to embrace the process. Solve problems one at a time, try to think about the long term implications, and keep learning on the side. But it's a very long road, set your expectations (and your manager's) accordingly.",

Normally what I would do, is just spend a day or two learning about it myself.  Very rarely, especially when it comes to architecture are solutions really that 'hard' to grasp.  So first step is understanding the problem itself, specifically how it applies to your business and how this problem has been solved before.\n\n - Step 1: Start googling about the problem (or AI) and start writing down the name (whatever you can further google) of different solutions to the problem you find\n - Step 2: Start googling each solution and identify the pros/cons of each one.\n - Step 3: Identify which solutions would 'best fit' your current situation.  I would argue this is more about future proofing, so don't pick a solution that works now but you know won't later when your company continues on it's growth trajectory.  OR pick one that works now, wont in the future but is easily adaptable TO work in the future.  You're really trying to avoid fucking yourself by getting into a situation where the old solution needs to be completely replaced and can't just be extended.\n - Step 4:  Once you have a solution or two you think would work, try to spec out what high level tasks, or work on your end, you would need to do to integrate it.\n\nFrom there you can flesh out different details you think might be important.  I do this for things that I can't already see an easy implementation for in my head, just so I'm more confident the solution can be implemented.\n\nThen pick the one you like best and present that.

      "text": "Little over a year ago I interviewed for a generic SE position (hiring for multiple levels of experience) with a large, international tech company that had been on my radar for years. The interviews went well, and at offer I was surprised to see TC would roughly match what I was currently on (competitive, but not by big tech standards). Some of that would be RSUs, which vest front-heavy, so my TC risks becoming less competitive year-on-year.\n\nAt the time I tried negotiating and they pushed back. At the time, I was keen to leave my current gig so thought; “hey, this one is for the long haul, and I’m sure once I’m in it’ll all work out”. I was informed that my level could be reviewed after my 6 months probation. It’s important to note that, at this stage, I have no understanding of their internal levelling system. There’s no “juniors”, “mids” and “seniors”; it’s all just I-level “engineer”.\n\nFast forward 4 months, manager says he’s putting me forward for a level-bump. “Fantastic”, I thought, “everything is balancing out”. 6 months comes and goes and there’s no real reasoning why my level hasn’t been bumped, but I remained the level I was hired in as. I’m told “you’re doing everything right, and at the annual review cycle, you’ll be put forward”. I push the point, and for feedback, but ultimately leave it - I don’t want to rock this nice boat I’m in.\n\n10 months approaches, my responsibilities have grown significantly, as more people from my team leave and our domain grows - we also hire a new set of juniors which need onboarding, and our department is now world-wide, meaning more anti-social working hours. I push the point of promotion with my manager again, to be told that everything should be fine, but company policy is that someone at my role needs to be in the position for 1.5 years before being eligible for promotion. I say “this should be an exception”. He makes no guarantees. I feel this drifting away, and wonder what I can do.\n\nI make 2 applications total, with the idea that I’ll use them as leverage against my current position. “That’s how people do it, right?” I think to myself. One of the 2 positions is a long-shot; a staff-level position in a mid-size company. 4 rounds of interview later, they’re offering me a position at a 20% TC increase vs my current role, with promises of a better WLB. I weigh my options.\n\nAt the same time, I’m discovering more about the internal levelling system. I ask HR for some guidance, and they forward me to a page which outlines the I-levels used. I find that I’ve been hired at a level usually associated with someone who is 1-2 years into their career. It’s one level above “entry level”. Naturally salty, I hand my notice in the same week.\n\nThis year has moved fast; I’m still reflecting on this decision. I’ve no doubt that staying at the big tech company would have yielded good results, but I’m optimistic about the opportunity I’ll have in the second company. On a personal level, I feel jaded over my brief experience at this company. It’s the one point in my career where I’ve felt adversarial to my employer; as if I needed to actually fight for what was owed. I never really got an explanation for what happened; perhaps it’s either it’s genuinely some clerical error, or some of my previous experience was treated as insignificant.\n\nAnyways, that’s the story. There’s some life-lessons here about fully understanding the offers that are being made, and researching companies like this for internal levelling systems \\_before\\_ accepting the offer. I won’t forget that in a hurry. Has anyone had similar or contrasting experiences? Or has anyone with better insight into these processes got any theories as to how this happened?",

          "text": "Big companies move slowly with promotions, since the process of promotions is coupled to reviews and needs to be standardized across organizations. It's a \"political\" process if there ever was one: each org gets some many promotions, everyone wants more, and the company has to regulate the means in which people are paid more money to avoid blatant unfairness. Every manager wants to promote more, it's a win for them, but at scale that decision rests several levels above them.\n\nThat said, the higher up the SWE ladder you go, the smaller the promotion aperture. I'm trying to get a staff promotion, or be on the \"staff\" promo track as a senior in big tech, and it's daunting. There's a huge compression right now into \"Senior Engineer\", partly due to hiring practices (down-levels), partly due to what my company considers \"staff\", and partly due to the current job market conditions. The single best thing you can do is understand the the expectations per level, and calibrate your work to that, and accept that the system moves at a pace that reflects global scale, not local optima.\n\nIn terms of your situation: seems like a win to me? You took a job for a salary you liked, you were ambitious and operated above your level, but the promotion schedule didn't fit your needs. Not bad considering your leverage was rewarded with a better job. Preserving your trajectory despite any single company is a major win in my book.\n\nDon't feel bitter about the situation: your manager has every incentive to make sure you stay, and the company is trying to enforce a globally consistent and fair promotions using a cyclical process. IMO, the real understanding, is knowing the system operates like this because the alternatives at scale are so much worse (imagine a race to promote people, or promos themselves all going to one org), and your discomfort doesn't invalidate the company or the work you've done. Contradictions abound.",

I have been here for \\~5 years and started right after college so I have no baseline or experience at other companies for comparison.\n\nI feel like the bullshit work ratio at my company is extremely high. My tolerance for bullshit is reducing significantly. \n\nWe have top down constant reorgs every 6 months. At times, it truly felt like we are playing musical chairs. Decisions are made by non technical leaders and deadlines are enforced top down without input from engineers. It feels like most projects are doomed to fail from the start.\n\nAI coding mandates from senior management. There is a huge push by senior management to force engineers to use AI. AI usage is heavily tracked and reported in your year end review. It's not just AI usage is mandated but AI acceptance. As in, how many LLM response you accept without modifying. Supposedly the more LLM outputs you accept the more \"AI native\" you are. Those are the words of the management not mine lol.\n\nAs you can see, this is absurd. \n\nThe pay is good but honestly it is absolutely not worth the bullshit and stress. It has been insanely stressful lately with many 60 hour weeks. If you refuse the insane hours, you are immediately labelled as DNME. I know the market is bad but I'm wondering how common this is for other people? \n\nI'm trying to be more selective in my next job search. ",

We can straight up ask if they promote WLB, and ask how many hours people are working. Interviewers are actually pretty honest about this, but if its a hustle type company, the question will reflect poorly on you (not that I would care personally, because this is a dealbreaker for me).\n\nA more subtle approach is to ask them about the last time they had a deadline approaching that they realized they can't meet. How did they handle it? If \"John\" put in a lot of extra hours to get the team over the finishing line, and is celebrated for that, that's bad. If the team pushed back the deadline or reduced the scope of delivery, that's better.",

I was paid 110K  with 15 YOE to lead teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year projects.  Most people would call me way underpaid, but I couldn't get a better job so I just had to deal with being the \"best\" in a sea of mediocre SWEs.  This didn't mean I was an actual good SWE.\n\nAnyways, a large complaint I would read on sites like Glassdoor was how stressful the company was with constant deadlines.  I see where people were coming from, but I never felt any of this pressure as a SWE or a Lead. This was because I realized a while ago that management literally didn't care about their deadlines.\n\nDeadlines were just a vehicle to set goals for the team.  It didn't really matter if you met them or not.  In fact a team I was on missed a major release by over 1 year and we still got a company party for receiving FDA approval to start a clinical study.\n\nSo I guess my point is if you are easily swayed by management speak then I could see people felt the stress of getting things done at this company.  But if you can just ignore the noise from management and just work normally then nothing really happens with missing a deadline.\n\nThough one of the side effects from my personal tactic is that it doesn't show management the team needs to grow when it does.  I've definitely heard things from management about how they didn't think certain teams were working hard enough so requests to grow the team with the intention of meeting those management deadlines were rejected.\n\nI guess management wanted to see the team burning the candle from both ends for an extended period of type type of work.  Then they would use expanding the team as some kind of reward for all that hard work to help meet future deadlines. It's was some backwards weird logic from my perspective.",

The performance they have to give will involve the same effort. One could argue it may be easier the higher paid you are, because people may realise it is expensive to waste your time. An A lister may have a body double to do the lower value work, an assistant to make sure all their needs are met, and a voice coach to help them improve their performance, while a nobody actor will be expected to do everything with very little support.  And it’s easier to give a good performance when working with people who are also giving a good performance. If everyone around you is incompetent, how much harder is your job?\n\nHowever if you work somewhere where nobody (not your manager or colleagues) can’t tell the difference between good and bad work, and you yourself don’t care about doing good work, then you might be able to get away with just doing bare minimum work. You would need to spend more time and effort convincing people you are actually working when you’re not. This would be a very dysfunctional place to work, a shit job, and you would have to cultivate a lack of care for it. \n\nTo find a less stressful job, it is not about going to a lower paying job. It is about identifying what makes you stressed, and taking the job that has less of that & more of what you like and enjoy. If you want more work life balance, take a job that provides that. If you want to work from home, get a remote job. Preferred workplace culture, type of work, industry vertical, etc. A framework like ikigai might help you identify what it is for you.\n\nOnce you know what your ideal job would look like, when you find something that fits the bill, it may or may not involve less money.",

You're likely to have *less* autonomy, more arbitrary deadlines and restrictions, and management that is clueless about tech. It's not universal but, if there's a correlation between stress and compensation, I would not be surprised that it's *negative*.\n\nThe exception to this pattern are places that pay less for some other specific reason.

The bigger drivers tend to be maturity of processes, clarity of priorities, manager behavior, and how often teams are in reactive mode. I have watched lower paying companies burn people out because everything is urgent and nothing is owned, and I have seen high paying environments feel calm because expectations were clear and work was well scoped. The ego piece you mentioned is real though, stepping away from a prestige signal can feel uncomfortable even if day to day life improves. One reframe that sometimes helps is separating intellectual challenge from constant pressure, you can have interesting problems without everything being on fire. The grass is not automatically greener, but it can be different in ways that matter more than comp if you choose carefully.",

It absolutely baffles me how many times my coworkers completely disregard the god-like tooling at their hands.\n\nWe have a monolith setup that needs a few knobs and buttons to be turned and pressed to test things. \n\nMy coworkers, who range from 5-15yoe mostly dont use the debugger to test things (e.g why is this value -12? where is the source of this NPE? is this multithreaded solution working as expected?). \n\nThey will instead turn on massive amounts of logging, eyeball the code and try to sherlock their way through a codebase with 500k loc, 20 years of tech debt and more often than not frankly flail around. They don't seem to even know what a breakpoint is. We have licenses to professional IDEs that make this so, so easy.\n\nI sometimes cross work with them, and find that what took them a day took me 5 minutes of stepping through code.\n\nThey do the same thing with debugging networking. It's like they're afraid to learn how to use wireshark. Do you know how hard it is to debug networking issues with just logs?\n\nIs this a common occurence? I'm still new in my career. I studied non-computer engineering. Do people who get degrees in comp sci never learn where the debug button is?",

People also get hung up on debugger configs in IDEs.\n\nA lot comes down to company culture. If long term progress/solutions at the expense of some immediate resolution is encouraged, it will lead to overall longer term efficiency. But if some PM is running up and down the halls who wants to see people stressed out smashing their keyboard to find a fix now, that's no culture for learning/long term fixes",

              "text": "And that is: the time needed to make debugger \"just work\" without it being \"just bind it to the IDE\" (because that hasn't helped).\n\nSay the next, I am debugging a test that runs over a program that heavily uses DI, and it only fails when running on the cloud, it succeeds on my machine. I suspect that the problem is that it's loading a different module on the cloud that it does locally, and that it's causing certain effects to differ elsewhere. Say I have a way of creating a test that recreates the error, and am able to run it locally and on the cloud, and recreate the failure consistently.\n\nSo the answer here is simple: I run the test with debuggers on both environments. First I run it on the cloud to identify where the bug happens (if I already don't know) and record the pertinent state that lead to the bug. Then I run it locally and break at the point of the bug happening and see how the state differs, and identify what about the state changed that might have lead to the bug. Then I start crawling backwards. It's going to be a mess because there's a reflection gap that doesn't let me know which module is being ran where, but I identify potential modules that could be causing the problem locally, then set breakpoints and see on the cloud if they're the same module or something else is being called, then on the cloud I find out what modules are different from the local ones. Phew. Finally I can identify what modules to set breakpoints on, and go through them identifying which of the modules are creating the problematic state. Then it's a matter of debugging that module.\n\nAt this point I'd probably use also some code-archeology. I'd try to see if I can identify the commit where the bug starts to happen, and see what that commit did and try to connect it to my discovery above. This all would be a solid 4 hours of debugging if I don't get a lucky break.\n\nBut wait: how do I run a debugger on the cloud? If I can SSH into a container in there and run the test inside the container it's 'easy' just make sure that the container has access to `gdb`, hopefully there isn't any policy against putting such powerful software on the containers, I mean they have their own SSH host so who knows. But what if I work at a company that is a bit more reasonable and doesn't let me just SSH willy-nilly into most containers? I could do this on staging, but what if the error only happens in production? Ok I could attach my local GDB to the remote process, but this needs us to allow this to happen. Again there's some security concerns in allowing this.\n\nSo at this point the company needs to allow a debugger to run on their containers, and allow remote gdb attachment, and then they'd need a system to turn this on or off (since you don't want the ability on by default), and engineers need to know how to do this. All this on top of knowing how to use a debugger effectively.\n\nMeanwhile I already know how to run a process in the cloud, and how to recover logs from it. So it's a lot easier to just get it done.",

I think Pascal had some too in its IDE? (I didn't do much there). Java IDEs have had first class debuggers since the beginning. People who started their career there early on are used to using debuggers all the time.\n\nThen you have early 2000 stacks with the popularization of Rails (Ruby), Django (Python) and people doing system or embedded development in C/C++ that was hard to run locally. The debugging tools existed for this, but they were often not as powerful, and they definitely weren't slapped in your face. For the web, browser debuggers were very basic (IE6's was insanely hard to use, it integrated with Visual Studio too and it was buggy as hell). A lot of people who started in that era found that just doing console logging was faster and easier.\n\nSchools don't teach more advanced debugging features like how to inspect threads, how to use conditional breakpoints and watches, how to build custom debugging UIs (common in .NET or Java to inspect more complex data structures in the IDE), etc. Lots of people end up using IDEs like VS Code which work out of the box for simple projects, but require some setting up to work with non-standard environments, and its often not done.\n\nVery few people know how to use low level debuggers (GDB/WinDBG), especially with high level languages like Java or C#. If you know how to debug a memory dump from the command line you'll generally be seen like a wizard.\n\nSo you end up with a very divided community on what people are used to.\n\nI worked in developer platforms at several large tech companies, and we'd often survey our internal population on this, and it almost always landed at 50/50 between people who use debuggers vs not, and it almost always comes down to which development environment and programming languages they learnt on originally. The habit then follows them forever. There's almost no correlation with seniority (as in years of experience). At the senior level there isn't much correlation with career success, but when you get at the principal level, especially for full stack, backend or embedded/system developers, you will see correlation with how successful they are, because debugging insanely gnarly issues in production with console.log isn't happening.",

I hope to god this has changed, but every time I’ve tried to use the Python debugger, it wants to use stdin/stdout, and overriding the default is a PITA that requires writing a subclass to initialize it. Have you guys ever tried to debug a program where the debugger is not only stealing the program’s input and interpreting it as debug commands but also corrupting the output?!\n\nThen there’s the Ruby debugger, which also uses stdio, but is easier to override, but then the Ruby maintainers broke the debug API in some major way, so people were maintaining their own forks. I sent some patches to one of the more popular forks, and the new maintainer was doing some ‘optimizations’ to the REPL by removing the ‘print’ and ‘pp’ commands because he deemed them redundant. Of course, in Ruby those functions return the string they output, so when you’re going around inspecting expressions the output is always doubled. Like hey, have you guys ever used a debugger before?!?\n\nI’ve worked at several companies where the source maps for the frontend were either missing or corrupted in some way, nobody knew how to fix it, most people didn’t know what source maps were. I spent a long night trying to fix them but the build system was so perversely convoluted that I couldn’t figure it out. \n\nNeedless to say, now I’m very careful about who I work for, what I work on, and how much time they spend maintaining the ‘developer experience’.\n\nWhenever people mention the 10x developer, I always just think oh, the people who always run their code from the debugger in case it crashes or they want to set a breakpoint, the people who step through their code the first time they run it to make sure it does exactly what they expect. The people who are getting an automatic read back in their IDE of the return value of every function from an unfamiliar API instead of adding a printf statement on every other line like a fricken’ caveman!",

Probably microservices, this decouples your releases - except when it gets hairy\n\n  * make sure you have a communication channel that is just engineers. You don’t want to have a scrum master talk to another scrum master who talks to the head scrum master you flags you down with a burning impediment.

Sometimes that news will be “the beta env will be a little weird today”, sometime that news will be “ok, we’re adopting new logging standards, here’s what the team need to do”\n\n  * work to build architecture decisions that decouple critical paths. If you have a change that requires service A to change then service B to change because of that, don’t require two simultaneous releases (ie: service A versions their API until service B is updated or whatever).\n\n  * echo the part about a standardized pipeline: *hits hood* there’s so much room for governance in this baby\n\n  * onboarding checklist.

It makes it easier for people to switch teams and projects and get up to speed quickly if things look familiar everywhere. Otherwise, people get holed up in their teams and parts of the codebase.\n\nYou really need to push your team to document everything and get in that habit. At ~15 people you know everyone by name, know who knows what, it is easy to talk about things, you don't really need to document every weird thing.

But people aren't used to needing to document stuff so during the fast growth phases newcomers really feel the weight of the implicit unwritten knowledge.\n\nStandards of quality need to be set in stone, whatever they are. The people who owned and grew the codebases at ~15 will become a minority and the codebases will grow out of their hands. Without clear guidelines of how things should be made, the codebases will grow in disparate directions and your older staff will burn out.\n\nIf you manage to build teams that work well together and bond, keeping them together is a great investment.

Different database types - some using grpc, some protobuf, various different auth methodologies, some with versioned apis some without.  And that variance slows down development extensively as engineering scales up.  (Also infrastructure costs explode because noone is cleaning up after themselves during the hyper growth period).\n\nInstead imagine a terraform template anyone can use to spin up infra with the correct tags for costing, or a Spring Boot (or whatever your language of choice framework is) customized template that people can use to ensure all REST API services are doing things the same way, and a organization github repo with templated github actions that run the same checks and deployments on every project etc, etc.",

Your company might eventually make it to a better place but, unless you already have the right tools, habits and skills—which is probably not the case, if my experience is any guide—you'll need a lot of time and learning to get there.\n\nThat's what I would talk about in a 1:1. What can your team do to build new habits and learn faster? How can you manage expectations around the transition with upper management/product/etc? The better you can do both of these the better the experience will be both for you and for the rest of the company... but that's much easier said than done!\n\nThe other big thing to worry about is catching bugs caused by interactions across components owned by different teams.

The developers and product people are expected to ensure their work.. works at least to spec.\n\nHowever, we operate VERY lean, 3 engineers total and can push to production (and regularly do) on the flip of a dime if we detect something broken.\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of stuff just get's tested ultimately by our users (internal employees  using the software to work with customers of our business).\n\nIf one of our users has an issue, they have a slack channel they can post to and one of us devs will always respond and investigate right away.  we're incentivized to test our shit and make sure it works because otherwise, we can get derailed during the day fixing issues.\n\nThis is also the most stressful job i've had but not because of lack of QA, it's really just trying to build and maintain such a huge product over almost a decade with like 2-3 people.  I am over here just the other day taking over email correspondence with a random insurance provider, so I can get all the information into our system in time for a 2 day deadline, that some other person in the company dropped the ball on.  This is the sort of shit that stress me out.  It still operates in like week 3 startup mode and realizing how incredibly fucking tech retarded people are, or unable to follow rules for providing data, ect. ect.\n\nThe no QA i don't really mind too much.  Every other team I've worked on besides this one did have dedicated QA.  It's nice and arguable neccesary for larger teams with a lot more different groups or people all having input on single features.\n\nHowever, devs that depend on QA to verify the code they write does what they intended.. I really dislike.  If a dev can't at least ensure it does what it's supposed to do on the good path that shit pisses me off to no end.  Nothing like pushing code or a feature that literally doesn't even work (sir did you EVEN run your code once before pushing??) will piss me off and I think more devs need to live in a world where they are responsible for their shit working more to build better habits and learn to TEST themselves too. \n\nQA gets more and more neccesary IMO the longer lived and bigger your product becomes, to keep up with regression testing and ensuring older features aren't breaking. (We use Unit tests as basically replacements for regression testing) Or when having bugs is a really big deal, like low turn around time for fixes or publicly facing products.  If some employee thinks poorly of me because I broke some shit fine but as long as we aren't losing customers over it, the employee can deal for a few hours until a fix is out.\n\nSo it depends I would say, on your product and how lean and responsive your team is to fixing issues as they come up.\n\nIt's boring work, doing a testing day but it can also be a chill day.  Once you guys are all ready, then you just schedule out the work for that day to be testing the product, everyone goes and verifies that whatever they are responsible for is working.  Plays around with other peoples work, raise any issues and push fixes, then retest.   As a dev you can usually just force or fabricate test data easily to quickly access certain features to test which is nice.  It's also good to know how your product works, makes developing or pushing back on features later easier.\n\nGod push back is so important, nothing is more frustrating than having someone who doesn't really understand the product try to pitch features or ideas.  That's a different rant tho.",

                  "text": "> Do you think QA is something that can be automated?\n\nYes and no.  I would say QA like anything else has a lot of things that can be automated, but you'll still need a QA 'person' to guide, maintain and extend that process.  So you wouldn't have the whole department automated but you can automate parts of it, maybe enough to rid the entire department and have different engineers take on piloting what is automated for testing.\n\nI think QA engineer role should be more common.  I can kinda understand people not wanting to do it, especially with the stigma around being labeled QA (at least there was where I came from, not sure about other industries) however, I think you can totally take QA seriously as an engineer position.\n\nFor some simple examples of automating QA, regression tests on products is an obvious one.  Lets say you have a webapp, there are libraries like Selenium that I think, are stated to be basically built just for this, but you can script interactions on the webpage.    You could write unit tests that go through the motions of the feature on the product and just verify that resulting elements exist.  Something like this could be fairly laborious to write however, it might also be a very easy case for an AI to write.  (I've never tried having AI write a unit test to use something like Selenium to perform actions and validate UI state but it seems like something AI tools could do)\n\nAs far as reducing time to write unit tests, the first thing that comes to mind for me would having the unit test framework maintained by the QA team.  As people write tests, if you have a team of people extending it or making the API easier to use could help reduce engineering time if they are the ones writing the unit tests.\n\nProducts can also get complex, sometimes you need data and assets, there aren't usually many prebuilt systems for asset validation (for example, ensuring all files referenced by a data file actually exist, no circular references in data).  QA could lead the effort on these.\n\nAll of those examples leverage engineering with QA though.  Most of these I've personally seen done anyways, in some form already and it's usually different engineering teams taking on that role.\n\nTraditional QA to me was usually more process driven.  They are maintainers of feature specs and have their own test cases and procedures they create to ensure product is 'ready' at different stages of development.  They also use these to ensure older features are still working, even after people who've built them are long gone.   \n\nFor this.. one automation idea I've had would be to use a mouse and keyboard input tracker and have people create basically little macros of their actions when using the product.  Then having away to run these on a QA machine that just replays all the actions and confirms the final result, maybe through a fuzzy screenshot matching system.  Then you could even automate the human part of actually using the product.\n\nSo yea, I think there's plenty to automate in QA and really, just about any discipline.  I really think just about every team at every company that uses computers, could find value in some level of software engineering.",

We had to test for interactions with other people’s known bugs. We could barely even automate most of it, because to do that, you’d have had to be able to automate control over desk phones, and there just weren’t feasible ways to do it at the time.\n\n\nFor the other side of it, it’s sometimes possible to put together thorough enough automated testing on backend services that you can run with full CD. It’s rare though, IME. Most of the time testing overemphasizes things that are easy to unit test, and underemphasizes things like “what if someone fucks up BGP?” Which bites even the biggest tech companies every once in a while.\n\n\nThe main observation I have is that someone should be asking: how much does it cost to have a QA failure? Because that risk needs to be measured and controlled, or someone (CTO) is not doing their job.\n\nIt is entirely possible that it’s not that big of a risk, depending on the business.

There were 4 developers and 1 QA on the team.\n\nThe developers was still responsible for creating automated tests that was for unit, integrations, and E2E. Also deploys and log checking.",

          "text": "I'm surprised about people in the comments normalising no dedicated QA, I guess it's the same kind of people that normalise being on call for devs as an industry must.\n\nMy take on this is that QA was never meant to be a dev personal assistant so you don't have to test your code, instead as a dev you already should be testing your code thoroughly manually and via unit testing. When you think it's bug free and ready for production, you ship it to QA and then they come up with a giant list of all the things you've missed :)\n\nQA not only brings a fresh look at things but it's also there to plan the testing, define test cases that are often missed by the developer and the rest of the team, perform regressions, etc.\n\nAs other comments already said, make sure you mention that velocity will go down because now you have 2 roles. And also before even beginning to go no-QA, make sure your pipeline, coverage and automated tests are solid if they aren't already. You'll need to assign time and effort to improve them for sure. Also set time in the Sprint for regressions.\n\nOn your side of things, and you should already be doing this anyway, double up the time for Unit Testing, documentation and automation, pipeline maintenance, etc.\n\nBut most importantly, at least for me, you can only go so far with full QA automation, some sort of manual QA is needed anyway so expect software quality to go down too. Make sure you have a solid process for shipping hotfixes too.\n\nWhere to go next on a personal level? \"Test\" (no pun intended) if you feel comfortable with this new way of working, if the context switching is or isn't too much, if the upper management adapts to the new slower velocity or not, if they're taking active steps to improve pipeline automation and handling tech debt correctly etc. And if you don't, you can always start looking for a new place to work :)",

Leaving you with structured formatted files in your choice of a few formats. This creates a token efficient context file geared for use with AI on existing code bases. Even this alone was helpful for me to be able to grep and search across them as I was untangling what things were doing on my own with the structured data. \n\nIf you want to use AI, you would take those files from each, and based on your knowledge of related components, assuming there are a lot, group them, and one group at a time initially, feed those to an Agent with tool calling that has read-only file permission with a prompt to enrich the data further and let it stitch more data together. Since it will have the file names, line numbers and such it doesn’t need to read in every file in every project in the group, the Agent can use grep, and really increase your chances of keeping it aligned by preventing hallucinations you are familiar with when you hit the context window from token bloat.\n\nMethodically build out these enriched docs which have the token saving metadata and you’ll be able to have an agent build as close to end to end understanding of the whole show or at the very least be able to ask it questions and get relevant information. The key is to not let it treasure hunt for context, or have to make decisions for you, or ask about completely separate topics in the same chat, always think targeted context and targeted task. They really are quite effective when a good developer with knowledge of where models struggle, is at the helm avoiding those shortcomings.",

The tooling mainly consists of a python framework for writing custom ETL workloads, and a kubernetes cluster to run said workloads.\n\n\nMost of our users are not software engineers - and as you can imagine the quality of the code they produce varies wildly. There are a \\\\\\~20% minority who are quite good good and care about things like readability, testing, documentation etc. But the majority of them are straight up awful. They write functions 100s of lines long with multiple levels of nesting, meaningless one-letter variable names etc. They also often don't understand things like basic memory management (e.g. if you have a 100GB csv file you probably shouldn't try to read it all into memory at once).\n\n\nThe number of users we have has grown rapidly in the last 6-12 months - and as a small team we're struggling to keep up. Previously we would have reviewed every pull request, but that's no longer possible now that we're outnumbered by about 30 to 1. And as the code quality has decreased, we have seen an increase in outages/issues with platform stability - and are constantly having to step in and troubleshoot issues or debug their code, which is usually painful and time consuming.\n\n\n\nWhile many of you reading this are probably thinking this is an organizational problem rather than a technical one (which I would agree with), sadly I haven't had much success convincing management of this. Also, it's difficult to draw hard boundaries in terms of responsibility - since it's rarely obvious if the issue is stemming from a users code or from our framework/infra (and even if it is obviously their code, it might not be obvious to them).\n\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has experience in similar situations, and what tools you used to help prevent tech debt spirally out of control without needing to \"babysit\". Some things we've been discussing/done already:\n\n\n- Linting in CI: has helped somewhat, but a lot of people find ways around it (e.g. using inline \\`ignore\\` comments etc.). There are also many legacy files which added before we introduced the linter which  have had to be added to an \"allow list\" as there are so many errors to address (and no time to address them). \n\n- Enforcing test coverage not decreasing in CI: Ensures people are writing tests, but most are just writing fairly meaningless tests in order to get the CI to pass rather than actually testing intended behaviour.\n\n- AI code review tools: a teammate suggested this, I am a bit sceptical but also don't really have any experience with them.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This is a very common challenge for platform teams. Here's some clear suggestions:\n\n1. Either keep the framework and the code that uses the framework in separate repos (best), or set up path filters and treat it like a monorepo. Either way, user code and framework code should not be in the same place. \n\nThis is important because you need to stop caring about the code users write. Instead of thinking about how to get them to write better code, you need to start planning for the inevitable horrible, buggy, and memory-exhausting code. Your framework needs to worry about the 1% worst-case, not the average case. \n\n2. I don't see you mentioning better process separation, and you mention you already do k8s. But then you also mention platform instability. So to be clear - the first rule of an integration platform is that it should be **impossible** for user code to take down the entire system for other users. This usually means process isolation and resilient failure handling. Again, this goes back to your mindset as a platform owner - stop assuming your untrusted users can get better, start testing against infinite loops, 'malicious' code intended to try to crash your platform from the user's side, etc. Then fix those one-by-one until users are truly isolated.\n\n3.  Forget linting, test coverage, and code reviews. Again, the mindset is wrong. You cannot change your users. If they are non-technical, they will always write horrible code. Your job is to make it very clear to everyone when it is the user's fault and not the platform's fault. This means learning more about observability. Take a look at the OpenTelemetry standard if your team doesn't already have a monitoring solution. This will also likely involve some refactoring to make it very clear whose fault a failure is. \n\nOkay, that's my most important advice. But there's one catch.\n\n\\> As the code quality has decreased, we have seen an increase in outages/issues with platform stability - and are constantly having to step in and troubleshoot issues or debug their code, which is usually painful and time consuming.\n\nIs this because you don't know if it's the platform's fault or bad user code? If so, then great - doing #3 will also solve this problem. But, if you are being held accountable for them to achieve their *outcomes* even if its their own fault their code doesn't work, then you actually will need to worry about making their code better. \n\nThe two ways of doing that are:\n\n1. Provide an SDK that makes some of the harder coding parts simple.\n\nThis way, you can reclaim ownership of some of the things that they would otherwise need to write themselves, and you can do it the right way. The downside is that this comes with the need to educate them on how to use it, debug/answer questions when issues arise, etc. It may get them to a solution quicker, but it puts the burden back on you.\n\n2. AI Verification\n\nYou mentioned this, and while I don't think just plugging in a vendor like CodeRabbit would work in this case, you could build a custom coding assistant that can help them write better code. I do this for a living and I wouldn't recommend doing it if you can't invest either the budget to hire someone like me, or the time and iteration cycles to build it yourself. There's a lot of people promising magic right now with AI, and a lot of it is smoke and mirrors. You're talking about 6+ months of dedicated effort to get to something that is reliable, and you'll get what you pay for (both in terms of model quality and engineering quality). \n\nBut sounds like this isn't really the direction for you and you should focus your time on the first part of my post. Anyway, good luck! I was working on a Platform team for six years, happy to give more insights if you have more questions or can provide more context.",

Here’s what I would do \n* Create a non production environment that analysts can use as a playground. They should be able to query whatever data they need and run code in an ad hoc environment. Preferably both their laptop and a Jupyter notebook type environment. This should make it so you get out of their way for non prod workflows. \n* For prod workflows if it’s feasible control the onboarding process. Each new application (I’m guessing they’re mostly batch jobs), give a well defined onboarding and deploy process. Make it so each application has its own directory. Teams can’t share code between directories and they can only deploy to prod if they go through your onboarding process. After that the control what’s in the application and when to deploy changes, but at least you control the number of applications and should have some idea of what each one does. \n* From there standardize observability and alerting. Each batch process comes with some boilerplate metrics that you can use to keep track of failure/success rate, runtime, resources usage, etc. This way you can create a dashboard to keep track of problematic applications. \n* Last make sure every application has an alert pathway. This will be part of your onboarding process. If a team is going to deploy something to prod, they have to be on call for it. If the application fails they get paged. You can be flexible with business hours vs all hours alerts, but this should create some incentive for teams to deploy better code. \n\nStretch goal \n* Define business SLO for each critical application. This can be part of the onboarding and you can force teams to populate this data by providing a framework they need to use to run the application. The SLO should be tied to the business goal the application is optimizing. If it’s doing its job and not eating up resources you can probably ignore an application.",

I'd still recommend adding them if you can, but expect most people to ignore most AI recommendations.\n\nAim for some really really low goals. For instance, getting people to use at least 3 characters for variable names. This is easy to understand, check and explain why it improves the code. You will still struggle with a goal even this low, but it's achievable and most people will see the value eventually. If you continue with very low goals like this, it starts to snowball a bit and people start caring more. The ultimate goal is actually not to improve the codebase, but to get people to care about improving the codebase.",

          "text": "The answer is, first and foremost, put a kiddie fence. What I mean is start looking into the code they are generating, and see if you can give them a framework to take that in. Personally I think that, given the expertise level, a specialized DSL scripting language that translates into python might be a good solution, but the costs are high, and honestly python is not that inaccessible.\n\nSo the first goal is to build an isolation system. Can you put all non-technical code into separate modules that do not interact with each other, and have limited impact on your system? Start to re-architect so that things are like this. You won't have things get better. So once you can put each one in modules separately, upgrade these modules to be optional, things you can turn on or off. After that put it into systems where you only run the modules specified. Python actually is very friendly to this, but there's a lot of ways to make this module framework work, what is best for you depends on your context. I can't really solve that for you per se. Now you can isolate jobs depending on their situation.\n\nThe other nice advantage of isolating and modularization the code people are putting in, is that it's easier for the authors to declare tech bankruptcy and start again, and you yourself limit what you need to maintain.\n\nThis should help limit the blast-radius that bad code can have on the system. Once this is done the next step is to create systems that nudge people to do better code. We don't want to force people here, and we want carrots, not sticks, at this point. Otherwise it'll never stick. What we want is to help all the people who want to be good developers, but just don't know how. I can vouch for AI code-reviews: think of them like advanced linters or error detecting linters like [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) or (if you're not afraid to be a bit more bleeding edge, which I personally discourage) [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)). The AI is just another advanced linter that identifies common mistakes and recommends certain things that can be done. AI code-review assistants can also assist in helping you start a conversation, or at least have the code be happier. Note that, as you saw yourself, this doesn't help with people who don't really care about code quality and just want to get things done and move on.\n\nThe next step is to start to add a bit more of regulations, but we're going to add them as carrots rather than sticks (even though they basically become sticks). So what we do first is we start tracking metrics for each module: how long has it lasted without bugs, code coverage, if it passes the linter or which linter warnings it has, and how many times are linters flipped off (per line)). Basically you find a way to get a how \"reliable\" the code is. When a PR on a module is done, based on how large the PR is, and what are the metrics of the module with the PR merged in, you decide that if the reliability score is high enough for the PR it doesn't need a review from the team. If it does not pass the score, then it needs a PR from the team. You set this number at one that lets you review a reasonable amount of PRs, with the confidence that you are reviewing the ones that probably need it the most, in general. Don't make this system hidden or implicit, be very explicit and clear, if the reason my PR needs a review is because I have 20 lint-switches in my 200 LoC module, that gives me an incentive to remove those and make the linter happy by actually writing good code. As more of the non-technical developers start doing better quality code, the bar for what is needed to avoid review goes higher (as there aren't that many PRs that are \"that bad\" left).\n\nFinally this is where we get to the crazy part. Consider using LLMs that are trained on how to use your module framework, and the conventions, and guidance, and all that, so that it knows how to improve the code. Have the tool only run on modules that have at least some testing and a minimum code-coverage, but it can improve everything else. At first let people just use it as a way to fix the PR so it doesn't need review, but once it becomes reliable and trustworthy enough, consider just having it run throughout the tools.\n\nAt this point you should have data that modules that have a certain score, or certain things not be true, are really bad. Here is where we get the stick finally. We collect data on how many extra eng-hours a module consumes, as well as resources (including CPU time) and other effects (delays on releases, etc.) Once you have this price-tag you take this to leadership, and show that \"modules with 40% code coverage cost us $XXXX less per month, if we updated all our module to have at least 40% CC our estimated savings would be $XXXXX per month or $XXXXXXXXX per year. Once you explain that, you can convince leadership to create a policy requiring that modules have at least 40% CC, with a transition plan and phase. Then you can now prevent submitting code unless it at least has that amount of test code-coverage.",

It isn't a role that is essential or needed or one that can't be taken over by a developer.\n\n\nMy current place made the agile department redundant which a lot of us seen coming.\n\n\nThere is a running joke going around. \"Never ask a woman how old she is.

The fact that so many people have hitched onto the productive aspect of software development as part of a wider entourage is nutty. I'm not talking about marketing, sales, legal, design or whatever but rather POs / PMs / TPMs / \"Agile Coaches\" and the like who do not have any engineering background.\n\nIf there isn't sound technical knowledge, which doesn't have to be perfect but should be solid, that person should not be considered for these roles.

I believe teams will be worse and less effective for having low technical excellence and it's a gate you should keep if you want a lean and functional organisation.\n\nI see so much in my current role how team leads can be undermined and put into incredibly awkward situations because of people who don't know their fundamentals and who aren't a clear part of the same reporting line so common expectations can be set from above.

For example, just alternate who leads the various ceremonies to get things done. \n\nSaying all this most companies don't do scrum correctly.  This is because management misuses data or feels they need to deviate for their own reasons.  All bets are off when this happens.",

I’m looking for coaching tactics and boundary-setting that work when you’re a mentor/peer, not the TL.\n\nWhat scripts/expectations would you set? What would you do if the behavior doesn’t change, and how would you escalate gently without making it punitive?",

For example, I could ask them questions and drill down to what is exactly that they don't understand or hesitate about. Then maybe we go into the code and go through it in necessary amount of detail.\n\nWhile I do it, I try to assess what kind of problem am I facing. Is it just character trait?

No solution required. The output is a rough approach, a list of unknowns, and specific questions.\n\nEarly on, I’ll do one or two of these together to model the process. After that, I expect them to run the first pass on their own. Uncertainty is fine, but engagement is required.\n\nIf the behavior doesn’t change, I address it directly as an expectation issue, not a personal one.

I said no, Frontend Guy would do it much faster. In my mind I was being responsible and continued to refuse it despite the manager saying it was fine \n\nFast forward some months, another guy joined. He had even less experience in compilers at all, but he was wicked smart, phd and all, and relatively experienced in hardware. Something similar happened when we're discussing tasks but he immediately accepted, paired up with multiple people, including me, and eventually delivered the work just fine \n\nIn no time, despite joining after me, despite having less experience in our field, he was promoted twice ahead of me. Was I mad? On the contrary, thinking back on his attitude it was clear to me why: he took the job. He took any job and saw it to completion with excellency \n\nHe has been my engineer role model for many years since then. I started emulating such behavior and without a doubt that was one the biggest contributors to become a good engineer\n\nIn summary, maybe your junior thinks they are helping by not taking on risks",

I then quickly discovered that approach does not work all that well in spring boot, so I instead went and just did a plain java project and started trying the other idea: figure out what libraries this crazy thing is pulling in and make some stupid simple learning project out of it.  \n\nThen realized I was writing in java 21-23 and some of these libraries were java 17.  Why the heck am I trying to do reactive programming when I got threading?  Why is this template so out of date?  \n\nAnd then I just settled on the idea of \"use as few of these libraries as possible and write clean java code\".

          "text": "Honestly, I would love to have a senior who could guide me on this kind of thing.\n\nBut getting into the topic, this feels more like a personal issue and a lack of willingness to learn than anything else, simply because he doesn’t see the need or the reason to learn it.\n\nWhat would at least work for me in a situation like this where you want him to learn more, instead of it being something time-sensitive, is to make it explicit. Tell him something like:  \n“My goal with this is not for you to just complete the task, but to understand *why* it needs to be done this way, so you can become a better developer that I can rely on in the future.”\n\nThat gives him more motivation to actually want to learn, in addition to removing some of the real pressure around the task’s urgency.\n\n(Just to be clear, I’m not an “ExperiencedDev”. I have around 3–4 years of development experience, but most of my work was self-driven. I don’t really have someone guiding me, so there are many things I don’t fully know yet, I basically learn things as a project demands them.)\n\nNow, actually, a question: I’ve never really understood what a “pattern” is in the first place. I know I’ve implemented some before, because when I was an intern I had to keep the project structure similar to the rest of the team’s. But in practice, I was mostly “copying” the project structure rather than truly understanding what a pattern really is.\n\nI honestly have no idea what a pattern actually means. Is it the way the code is written? Is it the project’s folder structure? Is it how I should break down files to make them easier to read and understand?\n\nI know this is a question in the middle of everything, but for me it’s something I’ve seen other classmates ask in college, and to this day I’ve never had a concrete answer. Even after reading some books on the subject, I still can’t clearly say what it is. I don’t know if this is also a doubt your junior has, but if it is, being able to answer it might help improve communication with him.\n\n(I’m not sure if this comment breaks any rules, but if it does, I’ll delete it.)\n\n(I consider myself a “junior++”, since I’m the only developer at my company, developing its main software and dealing with everything from development to infrastructure.)",

I recommend anything that focuses more on systems thinking.\n- staff at THAT org is groomed differently than general staff engineer level stuff, i.e. you might want to pick the brain of someone who is actually currently a staff engineer at your place.\n- I have been given an L&D budget myself, and so far I'm planning to use it for \"conferences\" and high-visibility courses aligned with internal projects. Not books, just in person events that signal pedigree/visibility \n- you'll usually need management skills on par with an EM, and especially the influence it would entail\n\nBest use is probably on DDIA (there's even a new edition out IIRC), and something that talks about engineering-philosophy.

Some people have to be trained like this because otherwise there is no motivation to understand things. \n\nJust a different mindset I've come to accept. I can't stand not understanding so I spend a lot of effort to understand. Other people are ok not understanding. I do wish there were more motivated people I didn't have to train like this but it is what it is.",

Then again, if you think a problem will take you 10 hours to solve but someone else 1 hour, isn’t asking for help the best thing you can do for the business and team?\n\nI can see advantages to both approaches but I so strongly lean towards “figure it out yourself” that I have trouble understanding how anyone can do differently.",
