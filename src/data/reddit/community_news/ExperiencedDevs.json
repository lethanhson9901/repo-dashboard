Below it there was a GREAT discussion with \\~500 comments where other people shared their experience. I copypasted link to this post to two of my friends that are also programmers like me.

If that ain’t the point of Reddit idk what is. Yes that can apply to other careers but it’s dumb to take down a thread like that. Why? Because lawyers or other professionals can do this too? I don’t get it. Developers have different options and considerations than other careers. Where else can you get through to from other experienced developers?\n\nI like this sub and the thoughtful discussion even when the post at hand is the “same” as others in the past. But everyone and their situation is different so it’s really false to say these are repeated threads. All of this is to say I think the mods take down way too many posts that have interesting discussion \n",

In this sub the content that gets upvoted most are posts against AI. It would be awesome if we as technical people could adapt. \n\nFor example I’ll say the thing that will get me downvoted I’ve been partially vibe coding with an astonishing amount of success. I’m more than a decade and a half in too. I built out the bulk of a basic MVC, multitenant, subscription app with go just by carving out the bones and architecture of the app, documenting the coding standards of the app (two docs) and then giving a prompt for a CRUD action at a time and it’s been doing great. Things that took me a week now take an hour. The longest thing for me to do is code review. Truthfully it’s even fun again because I got in this to create. \n\nSome people absolutely hate that I said the above. They’ll chalk it up to either me being a shill, me being previously bad at my job, or all sorts of things. The reality is there’s a lot of jobs that took a lot of talent that could be moved to India. There’s a path for Western devs and it’s build more innovative stuff and extend what can be done. But it seems the limitation is insecurity leading to inaccurate criticism, being forced to use AI for everything, and a lack of capital to fund the new innovation.\n\nIt’s left the sub to be one of the worst technical subs on Reddit.",

Not for the photographs as most suck from a photography standpoint. But they're often starting discussions of some topic or location or news bit I missed and that makes it interesting.\n\nWant an example? To find what code a feature uses so you can more easily understand where to make a change for an adjustment to that feature, use a profiler to see what code is executed.

It's a fool's errand and the outcome is entirely predictable: user frustration across the board because the platform doesn't work as expected, the people who disagree with the moderation are going to be very well equipped to complain about it, and the people who agree with the moderation probably don't even know the moderation happened *and probably didn't need the moderation to happen in the first place*. So you're giving some users marginal to no benefit, some users a hugely visible negative experience, and *everybody* is getting treated like a child who can't be trusted to have nice things. There's barely any upside and very obvious much larger downsides.\n\nReddit is *literally* designed to be self policed, at least in terms of content direction. The core platform mechanisms of upvoting, downvoting, commenting, and time-based score decay are designed to algorithmically elevate the visibility of content people are *actually* engaged with, and to quickly bury content that people aren't engaged with. That is how Reddit as a platform intends to steer content directionality. Fighting against that as moderators can have no outcome other than annoying users. Yes, more than the annoyance users would see from observing an actual industry trend being repeated in their feed. \n\nHere's the simplest way I can put it: who should be in charge of determining what experienced devs talk about: experienced devs! It really is that simple. Let people talk about what they want to talk about. A moderator's job shouldn't be to gatekeep conversation topics. Trust me, commenters are more than willing to do that job for you and tell OP that their content sucks if it sucks. And sometimes there's good conversations to be had in the meta discussion about people agreeing or disagreeing about whether content sucks or not.\n\nModerator actions specifically in the dimension of content directionality should be exceedingly rare and the bar should be very high for such actions. It's not only a practical impossibility, but it's downright stupid to presume that you *should* stop developers, experienced or not, from talking about AI right now.\n\nI can not stress this enough: this is a pivotal moment for this subreddit. Continuing down this foolish path of trying to play conversation police via moderation will decimate this subreddit's engagement and stymie its future growth, especially once you get to the point of trying to enforce ridiculous policies like putting things in weekly threads. Again, Reddit is *literally designed not to work this way*. Over time, heavy moderation leads to fewer threads (whether strictly forced into weekly threads or not), which leads to the platform itself promoting the subreddit less often to existing members and less often to potential new members.",

Ironically, a post about passing responsibility without understanding the work gets removed by mods who didn't read the discussion it generated. The engagement showed it wasn't low effort. This happens across tech subs. Mods choose what they think should be valued, not what members find valuable. A post with 500 comments from experienced devs sharing war stories is perfect for ExperiencedDevs, but it was removed for not fitting someone's idea of \"high effort.' The AI/vibe coding topic often triggers removals because it's seen as controversial, already discussed, or low-effort. These topics resurface because they reflect real industry shifts. The frustrating part: those comments are gone. Genuine dev experiences are deleted because someone decided the post didn't meet an unstated standard. Subreddits decline from over-moderation, not spam or trolls, killing organic discussions. Members stop posting after many good threads vanish. What remains is sanitized and dull. Save valuable screenshots, as the good discussions are increasingly temporary.",

          "text": "I can't speak for what the moderators thought.\n\nHowever, regarding AI, what kind of money do you think is currently circulating in this field, and what threat does this pose to those who are responsible for it? They still have budgets for huge advertising campaigns, and right now, as we speak, there's a gradual understanding that AI can't replace humans in complex development tasks.\n\nBut it's very well suited for deception, because even an experienced developer can't discern how well everything is done in thousands of lines of beautifully formatted code?\n\nIncidentally, a historical aside: When a bubble inflates, it first begins to grow in secret meetings and discreet discussions. Then it reaches the masses and usually turns into widespread hysteria before bursting, because it's necessary to reach even wider audiences with the smallest amount of money that can still be obtained.\n\nHowever, we use AI ourselves and can say that it's very good for some non-critical tasks. But only for non-critical ones, where the cost of error is low. This doesn't apply to development. In development, it's good for searching for certain information and, for example, viewing logs.\n\nI believe that critical discussions of AI are currently harming those who still hope to gain something from this market, and they are making efforts to suppress these discussions. These are temporary attempts to slow down the understanding that is already brewing. So much for the conspiracy theory. True, I think they're solving this through an incredibly large amount of AI advertising of all kinds. They've literally clogged the entire information space with it.\n\np.s.\n\nA scam (from the English word \"scam\" meaning \"fraud\") is a type of fraud based on the abuse of trust to obtain money, valuables, or personal information. Unlike hacking, which exploits technical vulnerabilities, a scam relies on social engineering.\n\n\\- So, if you were promised that by paying for a subscription to some AI client you'd receive fully working code or a real solution as a product, and you received something that doesn't meet your expectations, something that just doesn't work as expected, that means you were deceived and cheated out of your money. Now imagine that almost every day people come to me offering me work for $5 an hour, about 10 times less than I usually ask. They do this, believing that the work of fixing the code that was generated for them is cheap. But no. They've already spent their budget on a product that is very difficult to fix. And it really is better to rebuild it from scratch, simply because it's cheaper. So I have reason to believe they were deceived.",

A bunch of out of touch devs who don't want to learn a new tool complaining about it in the saddest ways possible, blaming everything bad that has happened since 2023 on it, while everyone who tries to discuss it seriously or points out that times have changed gets blindly downvoted.\n\nThe problem with discussions like that is that they are pointless. They are full of the same people refusing to learn in every thread. The same arguments, the same biases, the same refusal to learn. It's really stupid to have the same \"WAAAH I have to use AI at my company woe is me\" thread at the top of the subreddit _every single day_.\n\nThe post you linked is honestly about as stupid as could possibly be. Of course using AIs shifts dev time away from writing and towards review. If people would just shut up about \"REEE AI\" for a second and actually consider what is going on they'd find it wildly obvious why AI creates more review for people to go over. _It's because there's being more code produced_ and produced code needs to be reviewed. Why do you need a different thread every single day to go over this?\n\nThe \"Waah they deleted my waah\" posts are getting old too",

It’s reviewed, refined, and tested, but it is still reducing intimacy and familiarity with the repos.\n\nPeople are mostly camera off. A lot of people are ignoring the in office mandates. I’ve noticed more gaps in slack response times which leads me to belief people are off doing things during work hours (and to be clear, I’m fully fine with this. In an ideal world that is the what AI is supposed to enable).\n\nRegardless, the work is getting done, the stock is doing well, the company is in good shape financially.

              "text": "Personally I'm working at about 50% of my actual ability these days.  Well...maybe 100% of what I think I can handle right now.\n\nI got burnt out during/after Covid.\n\nLaid off in Oct 2024.  Took some time to reflect, realized I was burnt out, decompressed, relaxed, thought about what I wanted to do next.  I had about 11 months off total but still felt like I stayed busy while also taking time to not work or think about work or anything like that.\n\nGot offered a job with a sibling team to the one I had worked with before being laid off and thought \"well it's a job and I know the area and I can provide value\".  It wasn't in the realm of \"what I had thought I wanted to do next\" but it was a job. Skip manager was someone I had worked with and felt they had the right outlook (slow but safe releases, use data to drive changes, etc.), and two of the people on the team I was joining were names I recognized and people I had worked with before.\n\nStarted Sept 2025.  Manager left the team Oct 2025.  Reported to skip manager immediately.  Talked with them about two possible people I knew who would be a great manager.  One wasn't senior enough, but the other interviewed for manager position Nov/Dec 2025 and was basically told they had the job but hiring was frozen.  As far as my work goes, was told I would have a semester (6 months) to work on improving my ownership area.  Ideally (and quite possibly), I thought we could 90% automate the area in that time.  Ownership was shared between me and one of the other people I had worked with before.  Total team size is 8 people, and on-call tasks are business hours only.\n\nEarly December 2025 everyone under my Director (M3) was reorged to another team.  Honestly probably makes sense in the long run for us to be in this org, but additional churn for the team.  This was part of the hiring freeze.\n\nJan 2025 my skip suddenly announced she was leaving (I suspect more of a \"there's no position for you here anymore, we will help you find something else\").  Bonus: the other two people I had worked with before were basically told the same thing.  My team of 8 now has 2 people finding new positions, and 6 people split between 2 other managers.  Myself (Senior), a SWE2, and a SWE1 are moved to one of these managers.  I take ownership of my area (which was also the main on-call focus of my old team) to the new team.\n\nNew team decides our back-up on-call person will handle what our old team's primary on-call handled (business hours only).  New team's primary on-call is 24-hours with a fair amount of tickets coming in each week, though we have 12 or 14 people or so now so it is less frequent.\n\nHowever.....now instead of 2 people working on my area, it's just me, and now the new manager wants us to automate it ASAP instead of over the next semester so there is less work for the back-up on-call person to do.\n\nSo....now I have to do the work of two people, as a single person, in less time, with more on-call work.  We lost the subject matter experts (I'm still ramping up / learning as much as I can, and I guess I'm the SME now), and the new team members don't always know how to do the back-up on-call work that was primary work for my previous team (even though we did a training session and recorded videos), so I'm essentially randomized with the same things every week.  My manager wants me to \"figure out how to solve that\" while also ramping up on the new team's on-call areas so when it's my turn to be primary I'll know what to do.\n\nToday I got pinged that one of my sprint story items was \"added to the list of accomplishments we're talking about tomorrow so make sure to finish it this sprint\" when I haven't even started it with all the other randomizations that have come up.  I think it will be doable before Friday but I guess I'm dropping the other stuff they said they wanted done by the end of the sprint.\n\nIt's frustrating because today when an incident came up and I got pulled into it (more of a \"is your ownership area the problem?\" kind of thing), I apparently was the only person who just dove into the code and started searching for the API name to see where the server code hosted and the client code called it to figure out how it all worked.  I was the only one to share my screen and say \"hey this is what I've uncovered\".... like more and more and see junior engineers (and honestly other senior engineer peers) unable or unwilling to just search and read code and understand?  So I know I'm providing value but also feel like due to the impossible deadlines that are being set, I won't be successful in this position.\n\nThis weekend was a long weekend and I was fine Sat and Sun, but on Mon I started to think about work and how I was going to accomplish everything with the recent org changes / layoffs, and I realized fuck it.  I'll put in my regular work day, and if it gets to a point where I'd rather leave than deal with it, I'll just leave.  Somehow I'm the SME of an area after ~5.5 months because of layoffs and still feel like I'm onboarding (I don't know what I don't know), so fuck them if they ask too much of me.",

As for juniors, unfortunately it will take about five more years for the industry to remember why juniors are needed.

Unless we suddenly have human level gen AI in five years, AI is not going to be taking anyones jobs in the long run.\n\n\nPlease stop doomscrolling.

Frankly, is if somehow (and it's a less than likely chance) that we actually go into a slop era of the economy. Where low quality is the new high quality. Where shit can catastrophically break but that's just \"normal\" (I'm talking airplanes falling from the sky being normalized). Where \"sure nothing works but it still somehow generates revenue so fine enough because we can put more duct-tape on it faster than before so fuck you\".\n\nAgain I don't think it is the most likely (because the cost of AI can't scale at this pace continuously without infinite money).

It doesn't make sense in most game development workflows right now.\n\nLooking through this thread, I see that the seasonal LLM FOMO is getting into too many people's heads once again. This hysteria got boring the last 4 times it spiked on Reddit. I have yet to see anything resembling a shift in this industry that isn't being unsustainably enforced by the more gullible types of managerial roles who have never solved software problems and think that they can reshape the hard and unscalable reality of development by screaming loud enough & firing enough people. A story as old as time.\n\nSpoiler, it hasn't and it won't. The pendulum will swing, the tech will reach an equillibrium, and agents will marginally supplement existing workflows in a minority of scenarios where they make sense, but most workflows will remain the same. There are too many matured, stable foundations in development workflows for something like this to come along and compete with the existing way software is created right now.\n\nI would hire a junior dev over artifically forcing agentic Claude Opus usage on my team any day of the week. We're ahead of competitors despite not shoehorning agents into our workflows, trying to force agents into our workflows would set us back in most cases.\n\nIt's not useless but it's also not an industry reshaping change.

I have a few remote contractors helping me. My prior roles range from lead eng - to - director/EM.\n\nMy mood: fluctuating daily/weekly between fear and excitement. \n\nFears my career now has a short shelf life, or that we as devs will be relegated to glorified QA testers, or that a sufficiently knowledge PM needs no devs or designers at all, potential downward pressure on comp, and less jobs with more people fighting for them. Fears of being left behind because AI dev tools and practices are moving faster than I can keep up. Fears for society at large.\n\nExcitement because I can learn this new, interesting tool and try to optimize it. I’m excited about it unlike any coding thing I’ve learned in a while. It writes code better than my Vietnam contractors, and the designs are automatically better looking, and I can iterate with it very tightly. It feels so fresh and new. I’m excited about optimizing it and my workflow. And I believe there is an opportunity to individually capitalize on.\n\nAbout remote: I work on site 5 days its just me and the CEO in office. I worked remote Monday though because the office was closed. Admittedly I was watching movies or even playing Minecraft while letting Claude work for me and that was pretty nice (yeah I admit I was a bit lazy that day). It was a really novel experience. I goofed around but still actually got a lot done and made real progress on my project because of Claude. I think this checked out approach may be realistic in some types of jobs with lower expectations. Especially those behind the times. Thinking Midwest or not tech-first companies. But if you work in a high-paying job, or at early stage startup or in the Bay Area the expectations for productivity are going to 5-10x.",

I still very much do a lot of coding until I understand a repo enough to where I feel confident just reviewing the code, but I still have Claude do a bunch of stuff to make user stories go faster. \n\nAnyone who is strictly AI only yeah they tend to forget how the repo is structured and is harder to get them up to speed if there an emergency fix needed. \n\nWe are expanding and well funded in paper, but because of my past anytime I see expansion its more of a when they will start to downsize and am I safe or not. \n\nMood is even. Like no one is like oh shit we are expanding time to pop champagne, but no one is like fuck im worried about getting laid off...except me.

They generate the code, push the PR, and let reviewers review “their” work.\n\nAs a reviewer, I'm honestly tired of pointing out bullshit 500+ lines super verbose Claude slop code filled with complicated logic and small mistakes that could've been avoided if the author wasn’t too lazy to review their own work properly.\n\nThink about it. These people are basically offloading their work onto the reviewers. All they did was write a prompt in basic English and pass the generated code along. Then reviewers do the hard work of actually reviewing and fixing what they were supposed to write in the first place. After it’s merged, they still get to claim the full credit. Reviewers get nothing.\n\nTo put it simply, they’re just middlemen between Claude and the reviewers. So why not just assign the task to me, let me prompt Claude directly, and let me claim the credit instead?\n\nMaybe it's just my incompetent team. I'm curious: are others seeing the same thing?

If devs are not doing their own thorough reviews for code generated by AI, they are just straight up not doing their jobs. It's like a worse version of copying and pasting directly from stackoverflow from loosely related problems.\n\n\nOP, depending on your role on the team, I would either create a policy or work with management and get buy in that you will auto reject code that is clearly just thrown over the wall/generated by AI. In the before-times, if there was an intern or someone junior who PRed something and clearly misunderstood or was way off down a rabbit hole or submitting broken code, you'd sit down with them and walk them through how to do it properly once or maybe twice.... If they continued to just not get it, they would not last on the team. \n\n\nWe should all be taking a similar approach, if a PR clearly hasn't been (thoroughly) human reviewed, reject it and talk to the dev directly about what they should be doing and why.... and if they continue to submit garbage code, handle it like it would have been handled previously. I haven't encountered laziness this extreme, but I'd start to escalate to upper management with references to wasted money on man hours and on the ai subscription, not to mention the massive risk of the company being a victim of, \"slopsquatting\".",

Therefore, as lead in our team, I'm asking our devs to split up our PRs to at least reasonable level. I also promise people that three PRs with 200 LOC will get merged quicker than one 600 line PR. \n\nThis also forces devs to consider how their code is structured. It doesn't need to work in the first merge, it just needs to not break anything else.",

He was filling all the hats, being mostly a solo team. I could tell too many stories about this project, but I will only left this one here:  \n  \nHe worked alone (except some hs. he paid to a freelance to help him with the front end and some basic backend and the time required for the devops) so nobody reviewed his code. As he was going to a take a leave I looked to some PR to gather a little context.  \n  \nOMFG  \n  \nHe was accessing directly other project DB. That project has an endpoint to expose that data. OK, never mind, it's read only, I will not ask for this change now. I skimmed over the prisma definitions (prisma is a js ORM) and all the types were wrong! not a little wrong, they were completely made up.\n\n>Q.1- Although, these are completely reasonable types for those fields, these are not what we have in the DB.

Is there a reason to do this?\n\n\n\n>Q.3- Is this repository cached for the following requests? Do we need to do something if the material DB changes? \n\n(I've been bitten by Q.3 in other project, where some things get cached at app lunch, and then others in redis but all that was undocumented... )\n\nHis answers:\n\n>A.1- they are AI generated. they work. do you think i should change them?\n\n\n\n>A.2- I am not sure. The front end guy in the past implemented some of code, including this stores. He did it correctly for sure. I am not sure if AI is now doing things in the same fashion or doing mistakes.\n\n\n\n>A.3- what do you mean? if a material is added to db, surely we need do nothing\n\n  \nI closed the threads (not that they mean anything in that project anyway). \n\nBut I let slip in the next meeting with the CTO that it was a little to much AI for me, and if that is that what he expected of me.

I don't really read most of that - I only look if there are any glaring issues that could cause problems outside of its scope. My bigger concern there is that AI might see some of those ugly patterns and repeat it in future changes in other pieces of the code, where it matters more.\n\nI am also less strict in demanding all of my comments be addressed at the time of the PR, because with CC it's easy to do that in a follow-up PR, and our devs are willing to do that. If you can merge in 5 PRs, 4 of which are cleaning/improving the original structure, you're probably better off quality wise than getting 1 PR up to perfection as you'll likely get to try the thing in some sort of staging environment and see what the \\*real\\* problems are, all the while you're simultaneously writing up the improvements to the original comments.\n\nWith business I've also made clear that we cannot guarantee a good level of quality & maintainability for much of the prototypes they're asking us to churn out. That's sorta OK as they get to try out a lot of ideas and we're free to completely restructure/rewrite the code later without worrying about producing the exact same results - which is usually quite a lot of work when you're having to refactor existing systems.",

I'll tell you this only once and then it's the bible as far as I'm concerned - it is THE process.\n\nI just built my own CI runner that supports skills like an agent would, and you can just like, run it, without being afraid a git checkout or rm will wipe something from your dev environment. Can't get the agents to run it is my biggest problem, the model tool calling reverts to what is appropriate for the language, rather than https://github.com/titpetric/atkins as clearly stated in prompts/agents/claude.md. lefthook + atkins is a little bit of of a guardrail, but it again gives LLMs ways to fuck up a process by just disabling the gate.\n\nExternal test suites have been called excessive in my line of work just two years ago.

They’re generally helpful with generating CLI commands for tools I’m not familiar with, small SQL queries, or code snippets for languages I’m less familiar with. I’ve even found them to be pretty helpful with generating simpler one file scripts (pulling data from S3, decoding, doing some basic filtering, etc) that have been pretty helpful and maybe saved 2-3 hours of time for a single use case. Even when generating basic web front ends, it’s pretty decent for handling inputs, adding some basic functionality, and doing some output formatting. Basic stuff that maybe saves me a day for generating a really small and basic internal tool that won’t be further worked on.\n\nBut agentic work for anything complicated? Unless it’s an incredibly small and well focused prompt, I don’t see it working that well. Even then, it’s normally faster to just make the change myself.\n\nFor design documents it’s helpful with catching grammatical issues. Writing the document itself is pretty fast but the document itself makes no sense. Reading an LLM-heavy document is unbearable. They’re generally very sloppy very quickly and it’s so much less clear what the author actually wants. I’d rather read your poorly written design document that was written by hand than an LLM document. \n\nWhenever I go on Twitter/X or social media I see the complete opposite. Companies that aren’t writing any code themselves but instead with Claude/Codex. People that are PMs who just create tickets and PRs get submitted and merged almost immediately. Everyone says SWE will just be code reviewers and make architectural decisions in 1-3 years until LLMs get to the point where they are pseudo deterministic to the point where they are significantly more accurate than humans. Claude Code is supposedly written entirely with the Claude Code itself.\n\nEven in big tech I see some Senior SWEs say that they are 2-3x more productive with Claude Code or other agentic IDEs. I’ve seen Principal Engineers probably pushing 5-700k+ in compensation pushing for prompt driven development to be applied at wide scale or we’ll be left behind and outdated soon. That in the last few months, these LLMs have gotten so much better than in the past and are incredibly capable. That we can deliver 2-3x more if we fully embrace AI-native. Product managers or software managers expecting faster timelines too. Where is this productivity coming from?\n\nI truly don’t understand it. Is it completely fraud and a marketing scheme? One of the principal engineers gave a presentation on agentic development with the primary example being that they entirely developed their own to do list application with prompts exclusively.\n\nI get so much anxiety reading social media and AI reports. It seems like software engineers will be largely extinct in a few years. But then I try to work with these tools and can’t understand what everyone is saying.",

The paper is referred to as “Codd’s Twelve Rules” or sometimes as “Codd’s Twelve Commandments”, despite the fact there were actually 13 of them because the numbering started with zero.

Even with a test/CI/linter harness feedback loop, it only converges on something reasonable when I give it very detailed instructions.\n\nIt does do refactoring amazingly fast but I have to refactor sooo much *because* I'm using it. That's why I'm kicking myself that I don't actually measure my productivity with it. I don't actually know what the effect is.

It's still an issue, but a manageable enough one now.\n\nI'm really not sure how much of a time saver it is or isn't yet, tbh. There's been a lot of \"encouragement\" to, ya know, leverage AI and all that, so I really just decided to give it another earnest shot only in the last week or so, so I've definitely spent more time exploring and setting up (modern, detailed agent instructions, setting up mcps, etc) than building stuff, but I've done a few bug fixes, and a couple \"greenfield-ish\"/bolt-on type feature pieces as I've gone along, and it's pretty effective. \n\nI work on a lot of across the stack feature dev on a large consumer mobile app. I've been putting together a kind of monorepo that has our React Native repo, our application server repo, the repo with our gRPC client and host, and the repo with use to deploy our DB schema/profs. Basically everything you need to build a new feature in the app. I told it I wanted to work on setting up agent instructions, then spent a bunch of just explaining how everything works, what is responsible for what, and a process for how it should work (for example, it can't connect to our QA database, so I told it \"when we make changes to the Database project, write a copy of the new table/proc\" to a TODO/ folder, so I can copy it and run it myself\").\n\nAnyway, we have \"message inbox\" screen in the app that doesn't get a lot of love, so I picked up an old ticket where we want to add a way for users to delete and also undelete messages (archive, really). Not huge, but it requires a new button in the app, new settings option, small screen listing archived messages, a net new endpoint in the server, new args and logic in 2 others, protobuf updates, new proc, DB index ups, new table field...it was a lot of little stuff, across a lot of layers, and our codebase is not a particularly hygienic one....and this little terminal clanker bitch talked to itself for about 10 minutes, read some shit, wrote a bunch of stuff, and ended up with something that was not quite fully working, but only a couple tweaks away from it, and pretty much production quality code..overall, not too different how I would have written it. It followed the instructions I laid out, and after a couple back and forth (maybe 5 messages, over 30 minutes), it was up and running in QA.\n\nI feel like that particular one was pretty in its wheelhouse, since it was pretty simple to convey the full set of requirements, but it was impressive. I know the perception study, and I know I'm not above my own biases, so I'm not going to conclude it's way fast or not for a while, but damn it kinda felt like (for the first time I've experience with an LLM)",

AIs do some interesting things but ultimately too many little details are too wrong for it to be useful.  For instance when generating a test suite there's always test cases without assertions, test cases with plain wrong test data, coverage gaps, etc.\n\nNow I can clean up after the AI but I find the time lost doing so is much larger than what it would cost to just do stuff myself. In particular I'm not finding that the amount of editing I have to do is going down as these \"better\" AIs come into play. Because yes I commit the AIs output and then commit my edits and I can compare the two.\n\nNow if any of these \"AI good\" posts treated the situation like an engineer I'd be less sceptical. Because even if I found the AI to be overall useful I'd basically write half a book about all the problems I've found and why overall the cost/benefit is still in favour of the AI. All these flat \"AI good\" with no context are just bots, no engineer talks that way. At the very least engineers tend to address responses pulling up all the obvious problems with the product today.\n\nThere's not a single good source out there talking about AI from an engineering perspective. It is either flat hype or some meaningless comparison to some other technology with the insistence that because somebody was wrong there that AI must be good too. For reference the top comment on this post talking about SQL.",

What it means to \"learn to use these tools\" is that you need to learn :\n\n\n- how big the size of the task the best models can do effectively today is which is totally different than two months ago. And will likely be different in another month. For coding use opus 4.5+ or codex 5.2+.\n\n\n- how to plan that work first and come up with a spec and then let it go implement. You need to tell it the end result vs just the next step with no sense of what it is trying to accomplish. \n\n\n- How to setup coding structure for the agents (type checking, precommits checks, linting, testing suites) \n\n\n- how to close the loop so the agents can see the results and iterate (local sandbox with good fast cli tooling),\n\n\n-  how to manage context when working with the agents (what it means to have fresh context vs hot context vs polluted memory)\n\n\n- you essentially have to tech lead the agents through the job vs writing the lines of code. \n\n\n- How to balance and temper it's relentlessness with good engineering practices. What it's good at vs bad at.  Today anyway. \n\n\n\n\nOn the positive side, I've always thought of engineering as a creative job but I'm usually too tired after work to enjoy it as a hobby.

In a pet project vs work, so you can move as fast as you like and change tooling, direction, feature scope as you learn what works better without having to run it by anyone.  \n\n\nOn the practical side, this is your job security. ",

Matching your requirements against the logic, and making sure that your code really meets what you *should* be doing in a way that's going to also meet future requirements is whats hard, and kills projects. When you're dealing with large application's, that's very tricky\n\nI suspect that initially people get very hyped because you've suddenly got a tool that can generate code, which can and will solve problems. But its not helping with the stuff that's actually *hard* about software engineering, because it inherently can't design a custom system for something with how these tools work. It can't get you to understand what's actually happening, and the more you vibe code - the more you distance yourself from understanding the code - which is directly counterproductive in the long term. The nightmare situation for any software project is when you've completely lost track of the architecture, and its all spaghetti\n\nWe've gone through several cycles of people being incredibly excited for these tools, and then pulling back again when they realise that writing any old code that works in an isolated context is not the challenging part. I could crack out a basic app in a short space of time that solves a problem (and I have done many times, especially if you permit plagiarism), but making something that can be built on and last is what's hard\n\nEdit:\n\nMost people in this sub are also extremely junior despite the name",

                  "text": "Anthropic's own [documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) is a great starting point for context engineering.\n\nHonestly, my own workflow at the moment looks more like the sort of pair programming / interactive approach you describe rather than massively parallel and automated. But even that has allowed me to get so much more done so quickly. It's really a matter of giving myself the time to get comfortable with the workflows and developing a good intuition for what works and what doesn't. Steve Yegge's [stages](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) are a pretty good mental model for thinking about this. I'd say I'm squarely in stage 5 myself.\n\nThere are easy things you should always do, like creating a CLAUDE.md file and/or an AGENTS.md file, agent skills in the form SKILL.md, and being very liberal about having the agent create new skills for itself whenever it manages to nail down a workflow, [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for roles and context management. I've also found that having it create a scratchpad for itself where it will write down any important findings or insights that it discovers in the course of trying to solve a problem helps a lot with agent handoff and context compaction.\n\nOn the harness side of things, the fact that it's running in an agentic loop rather than a chat interface already gives you a really good starting point, and the way you extend that is going to depend on the nature of what you work on. To give an example: I had some JSON files that followed a schema that I needed to migrate over to a newer version. Rather than have the agent try to do the conversion itself, I just had it look at the two schemas and write me a schema migration script. And then it just calls the script. Or I might need it to make some API calls and figure out some kind of workflow. I don't want it to have figure out the workflow and make the API calls itself every time, so I have it write me a deterministic script that makes the API calls, and then it just runs the script. Or I might need to do a bunch of math or graph processing. I don't trust it to do math, so what do I do? You guessed it: write me a script that uses a specialized math or graph theory library, and have it run that every time. And it can adapt the script in response to edge cases that it might encounter or evolving requirements. And it just gets better and better at working in the environment you've built for it because it can encode the domain knowledge it's learned in the artifacts that it's produced for itself (the scripts, the scratchpad, etc.), so a new agent doesn't have to rebuild all of that context from scratch.\n\nThere's at least three modes of agentic loops that I've seen people experiment with: there's the script/CLI-driven loop (what I've been talking about thus far); the functional/service contract loop (using something like [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to encapsulate the functionality you want to give it in tightly-scoped functions with typing and validation), and there's the MCP approach.\n\nThe latter two are conceptually elegant because they look a lot like how you do good software development. But then you try the script/CLI approach and you realize it's much more powerful because it can just write software to better enable it to do things that it couldn't do, and it almost starts to look like recursive self-improvement (at the agent level, not the model level, of course).",

The bigger training corpus from industry completely pollutes the output. \n\nTo your point though, I think this is why a lot of their math heavy code output is junk.

Most of the actual humans I've talked to about LLMs for coding are not on board with the hype.\n\nAlso, while I'm not trying to say that anyone that's excited about these things is a shit coder, my anecdotal experience is that the people that are the most excited for these things are somewhere between actively-bad to mediocre; it seems like it's making up a skill gap for them. The people that kind of shrug at them mostly seem to be people that were doing fine in the first place.\n\n  \nOne last thing. I bought Steve Yegge's book on Vibe Coding because, well, I previously respected Yegge and I wanted to see if maybe I've just been doing it wrong (turns out I was already following best practices before reading it, apparently). All I can say is ugh. It feels like it's written for toddlers. He's constantly mentioning the horrible challenge of.. understanding syntax.

          "text": "Hey, I’m a SWE in a FAANG and an AI power user, I’ve been coding without AI for years before ChatGPT came out.\n\nI’ll be very honest, I get that all this can feel like hype, it’s very hard to find the right tool/model if you don’t spend some time knowing what’s the best, and everything keeps changing. But if you don’t feel a huge productivity gain with AI yet, you are doing something wrong. It’s not anymore a matter of knowing if AI is good for your use case, it’s a matter of knowing how it can be.\n\nFirst of, if you are not using it already, use Claude Code with Opus 4.6. Sonnet 4.6 is also good but I suggest trying what’s best first, to have an idea of what’s possible, then do bother with cost saving.\n\nThen, by experience, 99% of the tasks that this setup cannot achieve is because of a lack of context, or lack of capabilities, it’s almost never intelligence. So if you work in a big codebase, ask Claude Code (CC) to update the CLAUDE.md with a high level overview of the repo and its architecture, and keep some up to date lower level CLAUDE.md in each main submodules.\n\nFor context issues, ask yourself « what would I tell a newcomer that has to work on the project? ». If you’d give him a link to the internal docs, do so with Claude too. Use the plan mode (Shift + Tab) when asking for a big feature so that the agent asks questions back. Leverage the Skills feature to store information about internal tools that he can open anytime and not fill the conversation every time. If you are using a library that has been updated recently, ask the agent to read the whole documentation online and build a tree of all the relevant URLs so that he can find up to date knowledge by himself.\n\nAs for capabilities, ask yourself « what do I DO when I’m working, to debug, to deploy, etc ». If your app runs in docker, give the agent docker access, specify the names of the containers and ask to run and debug himself. Don’t add any friction where you would need to copy paste anything, run a command, you should just validate commands (make sure they are safe), and whitelist all commands that will always be safe. If there is something you do that the agent can’t do (needs physical intervention, needs to browse the website visually to test it, click some buttons…), it’s better to spend some time trying to find an alternative/a solution than do it manually every time, it will have a huge impact on long term. If you are searching for answers on Slack, add the Slack MCP. If you use Chrome to navigate the frontend and trigger some workflows, look into Computer Use feature, or web automation frameworks. If you need to go to a VM and do whatever, setup an SSH connection for the agent do that he can do that.\n\n\nAnyway, my conclusion would be that these tools require new skills for the users. You need to understand the limitations of LLMs and how these tools work around them. It will not work perfectly out of the box, and I think the main issue is that the models don’t have much initiative. For example, they assume you know exactly what you want and if there is a better alternative they will not mention it and will just follow your instructions. You need to explicitly ask them to be more critical, to be more autonomous. This will probably change in the future, and there is definitely a progress in this with the 4.6 series.",

Because the majority of training data is JavaScript already and because the tasks in that domain are text-in text-out. Contrast that to game development where you are using C++ and Lua. Not as much training data and not everything is text, all assets are binary. Some games in Unreal Engine are entirely created with Blueprints. It's bad enough it's a binary file, but it's even created via an editor, not text (unlike a database, which is text-in binary-out).\n\nBut yes, I can't wait for the hype to die out and everyone is on the same page as to how and when to use LLMs.",

Also, the reality is you don't need 4 months to build a simple internal tool that does reporting and a few automation workflows used by 3 people. There is no business ROI to have a team of 4 developers and a budget of $600,000 in man hours to build something that is used by 3 people in a department.\n\nLets all just agree there is no ROI there for costly engineering. But that is what we are competing with. Go up one level to an app that services 3,000 employees, the Base 44 slop done by some department manager still has value. They have domain knowledge that we don't. They know how their co-workers and siloes work and their workflow.\n\nSo we are basically competing with that. And  we know it. I recently worked on one od those 4 developer $600k projects scoped for 4 months of engineering. And we are just replicating the POC/MVP that was built.\n\nIn fact, it is better than any Figma I've used. We know what they want and those sloppy MVC teaches us the business domain and illustrate way better than any Jira story write up. One day, some day, those POCs will be it. Right now, they are 80-90% good enough. We just have the last mile , last 10% advantage. I am honeslty fine with it. My whole team knows that. \"We are competing against people using AI\"\n\nI am glad this is happening as it exposes the wasteful projects done in the past that costed millions and millions to develop and maintain when we could of either bought it off the shelf. Or minimized resources just to build \"Just enough\" without the traditional over-complexity. If someone cost $150 an hour and spends 4 weeks to do some front end responsive scaling and sprinkle some random layout, is that effort worth $24,000 for that user story? When it is used by two people maybe twice every 2 years? When a now-code automation does it with 2 clicks? Then it is thrown out 6 months later because design fancies something else, a different layout. Do that three times a year, the org is wasting close to 100K on what? A button click that is hardly ever used by no one?\n\nI rather focus on the last mile, the last 10% value type projects. As those work will always be harder to replace by LLMs. Some devs have blinders. But when I dissect user stories and ask, is that worth worth $60,000? Wouldn't the company be better served with buying a license for a COTs system that cost $200? So this is a shakedown to expose these ROI value propositions. I hope more engineers see that.",

But if I have to do this myself completely from scratch, between testing, etc all the way to deployment I'll give myself 1.5-2 weeks of work.

It got to 80% in a day, code complete in 2 days (after reviewing, code fixing and testing), pipeline tested on 3rd days and finally deployed on day 4th.

They get sloppy because the spec is underspecified and the feedback loop is weak.\n\nThe big productivity gains people report usually come from two places. One is decomposition. You keep the plan in your head and use the model to execute tight, well-scoped chunks. The other is iteration speed. You let it draft, you review, you correct, you regenerate, and you keep the loop short. That turns it into a high-throughput assistant rather than a replacement engineer.\n\nDesign docs are a perfect example. If you ask for a design doc from scratch, you often get generic mush because the model has no ground truth about your constraints, tradeoffs, and decisions. If you instead feed it the actual decisions and ask it to write specific sections, add edge cases, or tighten language, it becomes useful.\n\nSame with code. The “2 to 3x” stories are usually people using it for boilerplate, tests, refactors, glue code, migration scripts, API clients, UI scaffolding, and repetitive internal tooling. They are not letting it drive architecture. They are compressing the parts of engineering that are time expensive but conceptually straightforward.\n\nOn the “PRs merged immediately” point, that’s a process choice. If a team stops reviewing, they will ship faster until the quality bill comes due. That’s not evidence the models are flawless. It’s evidence the org changed its risk tolerance.\n\nSo you’re not crazy. Your experience matches reality. The hype is conflating two different things. The tools can materially speed up execution when the human supplies tight scope and judgment. They are still unreliable when you ask for autonomy over ambiguous problems.",

Please allow me to go against the grain and say \"Yes, I think you are wrong, but it's okay it doesn't matter or won't soon\".  The thing is, getting really great results out of AI \\*right now\\* takes a really specific kind of person.  It's less a dev mindset and more a dev manager mindset.    \n  \nThing is, it doesn't matter.  I've been in the trenches with this stuff since pre-release beta.  It has gotten progressively better at a pretty measurable rate and that rate is not linear.  Within a year or two here, it won't matter whether you're \"good\" with AI or not right now because it'll just be good enough to compensate for the relative lack of clarity that drives most people to think AI is crap.  I'd say, don't sweat it.  There is a really tight window here, where if you're \"good\" with AI, you can do some real damage ahead of the curve.  But pretty soon the models will be good enough that everyone will be able to get those kinds of results.  \"Software Engineer\" will be replaced with something more along the lines of an architect that puts systems together - a sort of combined dev/pm/bsa/manager.  The killer tool hasn't come out yet that does it all well, but it's probably right around the corner.  OpenClaw is a mess but the seed of something great is there, and there are some of us who've automated things like candidate issue branches for more than a year now to great success.  ",

If anything, it makes mediocre programmers be able to write, okay stuff, effectively making the SWE distribution go from a balanced one, to a positively skewed one, at least code wise. Some of the shit I saw during the beginning of my career would never exist with today's LLMs, simply because they would pump out OK code, no matter how mediocre the dev. \n\nNow, will they CHANGE the world? I'm not sure. The way I see it, it all hinges on whether or not AI can review its own code. From a programming point of view, it can use tests as a guidelines for \"fixing\" things, so it could be a helpful tool to fix bugs, but I believe it still can't understand intent that well, as in the intent behind a feature, or if a PR is good or not.\n\nSo Unless you're at a startup where pumping out code is more important than it working, or it bringing value, I don't see humans being taken away from the equation, and I would go out on a limb and say that any perceived gain of productivity is squashed by the gigantic amounts of code LLMs can pump out. Now, you can't ask a software engineer to squeeze out more brain juice, so my only logical conclusion is, now we spend whatever gained time reading code and correcting/iterating on generated code. Are we more productive? It's not really important. The bottleneck is still mental energy, and LLMs aren't giving us any.\n\nIt's a weird state of things right now. LLMs as of now are just a way to squeeze us out more. Give a little bit of convenience when generating code and in return being asked to take 10X the mental load just because. Non technical people don't understand. They think writing the code is the hard part, and touting LLMs to be such a revolutionary technology is political suicide for any SWE. Is giving in to the new expectations, new expectations where you're supposed to deliver a lot more at the same salary. \n\nOn my end, I embrace AI. It's okay, for the most part. It makes a lot of tedious shit easier, and reduces friction in a lot of places!!! But it isn't taking my job away. And it's important that people temper their expectations of it. Touting llms to be all this and that is political suicide for all SWEs.",

Utilizing custom sub agents, skills, rules, will all greatly improve the output and enforce certain guardrails.\n\nI spend a lot of time creating scripts that the agent can run to validate its work, but I still act as the architect.

Honestly I read so many comments and it just make me angry how damn dull and short sighted people are. \n\nI don't know how this industry goes but I know the people that don't start using the chainsaw are the ones that won't be around as long as the ones that do. \n\nI'm not the one making the rules I just feel 90% confident that is how it will go. \n\nI've been making apps and projects that would have easily taken me 5-10x the time and some just not possible. I've just seen a team that's almost the exact same people for 6 years do things in the last 2 weeks that's would have taken them probably 2 months.\n\nYou read and hear from so many credible engineers not just saying a confident statement like \"crypto is big trust me bro\" but actually showing proof of the thing that was built. Read through OPs post for so many examples.\n\nPeople are commenting about the emperor having no clothes to try and sound clever, when the irony is many saying it's a fad are the ones that have the incentive to not believe the truth. \n\nI'm more excited and terrified than I've ever been about tech and I've been in software for 15 years. I've worked on everything from large scale web apps, data engineering, embedded/hardware, supply chain security, and data science. With some really good engineers and in one case an elite nerd that was a top ten in the world in his complicated niche domain. \n\n\nWe have reached somewhere into the realm of oscalating between \"pretty good\" to \"really good\" engineer but it gets there 50x faster when given the task with guidance still needed especially around the architecture and high level vision. \n\n\nWe are still a ways away from it cracking into the level of the elite nerd especially on the innovation front... but damnit I don't see a reason why it can't get to sparks of that.\n\n\nAnd so many are yelling about AI hype and coming up with the most copium petty comments when just zooming back 5 years and how far the space has come since the Will Smith eating spaghetti days... just kidding that was JUST three years ago. \n\n\n\n There is no \"incentive\" for me to push this. \n\nCall me whatever or think whatever, but it doesn't really matter. You'll look back and see how many signs there were that this is the start of the new era. \n\nI don't really need to argue the same way i don't need to argue that exercise helps increase strength, gives you longer life, or helps mood.\n\n\nI don't need to hear from Twitter how great it is or watch some YouTube bro. I'm just actively living out seeing it in action. \n\nI'm going to continue to build my side projects and iterate on the workflow and other implications (it's not just about code). I'm going to continue to see my team be able to build in whole new ways and have so much more autonomy to just go solve problems.\n\n See us do the hundred tasks that are \"easy\" but have sat for years. Do all the huge complex bits that needed so many iterations now have 3 learning loops in 3 days and be 50% of the way for a 3 month refactor. \n\n\nSeeing the absolutely soul sucking work of sorting through hundreds of jira tickets and thousands of slack channels and threads for all the shit of conversations and Google docs and confluence pages and scattered documentation reduced by 80-90% so I can focus on work during my deep work time.\n\n\"But it made this one stupid thing happen and wrote bad code\". Do you work with people?!? I guess you've never started at a company and had a look at their 10 year old codebase.\n\n\nNo one gives a shit about the code. Do you ever admire a bridge? Is an elevator art? What about the sewer? The scissors your barber uses? Pick whichever of that list you really don't give a shit about and imagine less shits. So probably not the sewer. \n\n\nPeople want things that work. And lots of what they make work. Some doesn't. Just like all of our stuff.\n\nThe tooling to fix those things and smoother out the rough bits has the best talent in the world plus 1000x people at companies working through that. Do you not think those things will be consequentially better still in 5 months? What about 5 years?\n\n\nIf you've reached the end of my rant then congratulations. I award you no points. And may God have mercy on your soul. \n\n\nI don't know what the end game is. I don't know what the future of work looks like. I don't know if it's an actual Utopia or something of what we fear.\n\n\nAll I know is that I didn't start the fire, but there are clear flames everywhere and people want to dismiss the heavy smoke as simply bad weather. Ignoring the evacuation warning until they the heat gets to their doorstep. \n\n\n\n",

I've answered hard questions properly and still didn't pass interviews, I felt that I bombed interviews and yet still I passed them.\n\nI was a team lead for a few years and I got to interview people quite a bit, and let me tell you, the interviewer is as much of a factor in this as you are.\n\nIt takes effort and time to set up an interview pipeline, what are the right questions to ask? How do I gauge your skill? Do I have alternative questions in case I land on something you're not very good at, but perhaps you have something else that is better? How do I sprinkle you the right hints and how do I test whether you're good at communicating? It's an insanely fucking hard job, and like any job, the skill of the interviewer and the effort put in the pipeline is a huge factor.\n\nYou could be a genius engineer, but if a shitty interview pipeline only asks leetcode hards, and only measures you whether you pass all tests in 60 minutes, is that really a good filter? Does that even say anything about you other than you know how to code leetcode?\n\nDon't take it personally, a lot of companies are shit at interviewing, and revel the fact that you might just work for their competitor instead and drive them out of business. If you're good at what you do, then you will game their systems or stumble on a company with a better engineering culture.\n\nAnd even if the pipeline is good and the interviewer is skilled, there are other factors, such as not needing someone exactly of your profile/skillset at the moment, or not really having chemistry with the interviewer, or they simply not liking the look of your eyelashes. You can't control any of these things, except the eyelash part, but since we're developers, we are doomed to a life of somewhat un-attractiveness anyway.\n\nTake the L, give them the finger for being too stupid to see the brilliance of [TheTopG\\_\\_\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTopG___/), and move on to the next one.",

Seemed like it might be a chill place to work so I figured I’d chat with them.\n\nHR call went really well but then at the end I found out the rest of the process would entail a proctored assessment (~60min) plus a live coding interview (~90min). I thought about it for a couple days then declined to proceed. Not only because I really don’t have the time or sanity to go through that bullshit right now, but even moreso because if that’s how they’re hiring senior devs then they’re focusing on the wrong things and I don’t have high confidence that the team I’d be joining would be a good fit.",

Anyways they didn't ask me any coding questions for a Senior SWE role.  It was behavioral type questions learning about how I operate day to day along with technical type conversations.\n\nI guess they assumed my 15 YOE was good enough to verify my coding skills.  Anyways I grew suspect of the company since the 4 interviews were basically just conversations.  The people that interviewed me were all from big tech companies like Waymo, Apple, and Google looking at their LinkedIn page.\n\nMany employees graduated from Stanford and other big named schools.  Yet here I was graduated from some no-name state school working at private no-name non-tech companies in non-tech cities on the east coast.  The recruiter randomly found me on LinkedIn and that was how I heard about this company.\n\nThe quoted salary range from the in house recruiter was something like 175K - 210K.  I guess they liked me so much that their initial offer was for 225K.  The problem is I couldn't shake the nagging feeling the lack of technical coding questions was a red flag.\n\nAnyways I turned down the offer.  Since then this company has had a series A in 2024 and a series B in 2025 for 100 million.  It grew from about 30 employees in 2023 to, according to LinkedIn, over 100 employees today.\n\nAnyways I didn't have a strong point to this story.  It was just an anecdote I thought of as you said you don't do Leetcode interviews and I thought that was a red flag for some company I interviewed at years ago. Obviously I was wrong, lol.",

Most people working at the company spend their time on pointless meetings, even with LLM which they have access produce very poor contributions. They spend 3 or 4 weeks to provide pull review feedback and when they do is basically they false assumptions or ignorance to say the least. They are often at the dentist or had to go pick the daughter. Their definition of work is booking meetings and literally have someone start some podcast nonsense; sometimes you catch them not able to answer questions because they are not listening during their pointless meetings. These are the people interviewing! I started creating technical videos to showcase work for solutions provide to things the never had or imagine having, then suddenly everyone has an opinion and start throwing jargon which they seem to understand at surface level but not deep enough, as in practice what the claim have done doesn’t work as they think. I show them data, graphics, performance, benchmark examples wasting my time, they don’t even check. Eventually the manager complain the are taking too long to approve PR and there’s no actionable feedback and these losers approve. Zero chances since weeks! Then complain there are too may PR to review that depend on each other. Or, that the experimental library release is way ahead to the actual “latest” version. Without realising that they are the gatekeepers. Absolute garbage people!",

Whenever I give interview advice I always tell candidates that interviewers aren't there hoping you'd fail, so hearing about them being cold is just.. disappointing. Especially cutting the time short and the abrupt ending, that's just bad interviewing. So I hope you don't beat yourself up too much! This is just one of those cases where you know you have the skills and can do it in real life but the environment was just not conducive for you. I really do hope you have a better experience for your next interviews.",

Tech (including AI) should _empower_ people not rob them of their dignity. My two cents :)",

          "text": "There's a few aspects to it.\n\nOne is the simple notion that AI productivity gains gives companies a free license to conduct layoffs without fear of public backlash or running afoul of other laws. At least that's how their risk assessment frames things. So it matters not whether these productivity gains are real or imagined; what matters is that they effectively let the company pin the layoffs on something that's hard to push back on as a practical matter. Meanwhile, please don't look at the number of H-1B Visa applicants that same large company is applying to sponsor and please don't note how that number is suspiciously similar to the number of layoffs they just announced because they're now so much more productive.\n\nAnother is the notion that \"increased productivity\" from AI comes with tradeoffs that companies simply don't like to acknowledge: the AI output is lower quality than the previous human outputs, but it's way cheaper and faster so they simply don't care. There's nothing *inherently* wrong with trading risk and quality for speed and cost, but the perverse incentive here is that companies have every reason in the world to not acknowledge the full magnitude and consequences of the tradeoff being made here. They only want to see the \"faster and cheaper\" part, not the \"worse\" part and they certainly don't want to think through the negative externalities that might result from their outputs being lower quality. Depending on what domain this is being applied to, the consequences range from annoying to lethal. Customer support bots being shit is annoying, but a medical device company slapping AI into their products might literally kill people. Do you think that medical device company is going to explicitly acknowledge that their most profitable quarter came knowingly and predictably at the expense of X number of excess deaths and they made that tradeoff deliberately? No way.\n\nFinally, I think some people are simply not skilled enough in the domain to which they're applying AI (or imagining how AI will be applied) that they genuinely don't realize how bad it is. Whenever somebody not skilled in a domain talks about AI replacing people in another domain (or their own domain that they're junior in), I always ask them some version of this: \"Imagine the difference between me using Chat GPT to do your job, versus you using Chat GPT to do your job. If you're imagining an immense difference in output quality and the way the interactions work because of your domain expertise and my lack of it, that's exactly why AI isn't going to take anybody's job any time soon, at least not without a large drop in quality. It's just a tool for people already skilled to use.\"\n\nI'm not sure if this applies outside software development, but there's also the idea that productivity gains only come if you're willing to not invest the time to fully understand the LLM generated code. Yes, LLMs write very plausible code quickly, but if you're not actually taking time to *fully* understand the system and the implications of the code changes from the LLM, when you're actually trading off (besides quality) is simply *knowledge* of how your system works. This is one of those things that doesn't cause any acute damage, but it slowly chips away at quality and scalability and cost and it just generates so much code that nobody actually understands that it sets things up for a massive cascading system failure mode that will absolutely kill you when it triggers.",

I sort of feel like you’re asking a loaded question and don’t really want me to explain how AI tools help me.\n\nApologies in advance for any typos. I did spend a while on this comment, but I’m writing on mobile. \n\nI agree that 10x productivity numbers are suspect. But some observations:\n\n- The tools have continued to improve. Even in the last quarter and the last month. If you’re company isn’t paying for access to frontier models, we aren’t really having the same conversation here.\n\n- The “omg your company pays $500-$1000 per dev per month for AI token” posts are super disconnected. That’s a pretty normal productivity tooling budget for most companies even before AI. If you think that number is shocking, then you are either an outlying working at cost-center companies like banking, or you’re disconnected from how much tools normally cost. I guarantee that your company pays overheads like this on its profit centers. So if this number sounds crazy for a dev tool to you, I’m sorry that this is the first time you’re finding out that you are viewed as a cost center. \n\n- With that said, vibe coding still doesn’t work. Debugging, architecting, code structure, test practices, etc have become more important, not less. Now that AI can generate the easy stuff, the hard stuff becomes more of my job. \n\n- Additionally, a lot of my job has been about scaling out AI tools across multiple engineers and dev teams. Really no different than my previous responsibilities as staff engineers. 50 devs using AI tools effectively still generates more productivity than me generating code myself. \n\n- With that said, I *do* generate about 95% of code that I check in. No, it’s not slop. Clear design vision, technical specs, and written down business context really help out. You should’ve had this anyways, right? This was a good practice even before AI. \n\n- I’m not 10x more productive. But maybe 2-3x more productive. Obviously this doesn’t always show up in any metrics that can be measured. If I spend an afternoon fixing 3 user facing bugs instead of 1, obviously that’s not going to show up in any sort of metric that matters. I know all the devs here would flip out of their managers asked them to quantify their productivity, since we all know that measuring the effectiveness of developers is incredibly difficult. So why are my claims about AI tooling being held to that standard? Can you pull numbers which show that your favorite IDE or programming languages makes you x more productive. I will recognize that this is an problem for AI labs: they are investing real money but it’s possible the benefits won’t show up in monetary returns or GDP growth. Obviously those things only *sort of* measure human well being. It’s possible to build genuinely better software that benefits humanity without it reflecting in GDP growth. \n\nAnother important point is that I was an AI skeptic until a few months ago. I predicted we would hit a wall, but frankly we didn’t, so I admitted I was wrong.\n\nI also am not a bot and I don’t financially benefit from AI in any way. I’m skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims about the benefits of AI. But I do believe that the current tools make me 2-3x more productive.",

I don't want to add to the noise but I what I actually don't \"get\" is the unrestrained excitement people have over this. There is, I have to say, from this community, a little bit too much dismissal as well.\n\nI am a very experienced engineer now (nearly 3 decades) and I have helped build an \"AI company\" in the early doors times. This stuff is different, it is very good and it is improving. I think a few of you out there will already be learning that it is as good as it's steering, but as you evolve that, you can get it to stay on track for more and more cycles and the redirections it needs become increasingly minimal.\n\nIt is \\*incredible\\* tech, and I do think we are in trouble. Nobody should be happy, because even if you feel you can wield it like prometheus, many can't (across industries and fields) and could well be swallowed, and they will not sit back and die without an awful lot of turmoil.\n\nFrankly, there are pretty significant fields and professions that are \\*already\\* redundant and just haven't woken up to it.\n\nI also have to say that as the industry has grown in my tenure, the average quality of an engineer has dropped significantly. Sorry to say that, but too many bootcamps and people just looking for a comfortable office job. Those people are dead fucked. When your colleagues are sharing their experiences with this tech, pay careful attention to who is finding success with it (even if they complain). I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid national average wage and I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid minimum wage... and those people do very well with this tech as a partner and assistant and eventually get it doing their bidding largely with nudges and pushes. They know how to architect a codebase, and to avoid confusion in the context and they can iterate and build increasing complexity.\n\nThe people who haven't paid attention, don't care, and it works on their machine.... are the ones saying, \"this shit doesn't work at all, it keeps falling over, introducing stupid bugs, getting caught in a loop....\", etc.\n\nThe reason I have not replaced all the shit code that barely works that has been written by this people... has been a lack of time.\n\nAgain, I suppose I am adding to the noise here, but I hear \"wrongness\" from both sides (imo).\n\nI think it is simple and scary. This stuff is not perfect, but it is very good. We should be very alert to the fact that had somebody told you 10 years ago that your computer would happily work for hours on a coding problem and you would be a little bit excited when it finally got confused... you would call the men in white coats. Yet here we are...\n\nWorry is legitimate.",

Jackpot tbh.\n\n\nBut yeah using Opus 4.5, you can see its come along in leaps and bounds. I'm not convinced its actually faster to have AI written code fully, unless you don't care about quality, but it saves a tonne of time to know what you want, and work it out, or have the agent help work it out with you.

Throw away the influencers, the machines and everything.  \n\nTake a minute to think about AI conceptually.  What problem is it trying to solve?  What TRILLION DOLLAR problem is it trying to solve - because that's how much money they are pouring into it.  \n\nThe answer to that question, my distinguished colleagues, is the single most expensive line item in nearly every single company in history - wages.  They are trying to solve for having to pay employees wages.  \n\nNow, given what you know about the average CEO, assume I am right about the above for just a moment - that they are basically trying to solve for paying wages.  Can you think of a single thing that would stop all of these margin-obsessed people from pursuing the ability to stop paying employees?  In a rational market, is there any way the market itself wouldn't punish a company for not trying to incorporate technologies that mean they don't have to pay their biggest line item?  \n\nThe doomsayers, as you call them, are trying to sound the alarm, I would imagine.  It's too late, but they are at least trying.  The tools have gotten better at a predictably geometric rate and are accelerating.  The tools this year are orders of magnitude better than the tools this time last year.  And those tools are being used to further accelerate the pace of development.  The better the tools get, the faster and better the NEXT generation of tools, which produces the faster and better NEXT generation of tools.  It's not going to stop improving.  It's not going to be legislatively slowed.  Better smarter AI is always going to be around the corner for the next little while unless we run up against some theoretical wall of which we are not currently aware.  \n\nI'm not even wading into the defense angle, which is a whole other ball of wax.  It's OBVIOUS most of the world powers think that the next wars will be fought in part by AI and are gearing up accordingly.  \n\nThis IS a transformative technology, and it WILL continue to get better.  The business world smells blood and can't see beyond the next quarter's results so they will continue to barrel towards a world where they don't have to pay knowledge workers anymore.  It's not there yet, but each generation of model is bringing us closer, to the point that it's scary close right now.  \n\nOh yeah, and before you go out and get a job as a welder, check out all the latest innovations in robotics!  You really think they're not gonna slap AI in those things the second they can and hire them out as robo-plumbers?\n\nThe writing is basically on the wall.  We're in for major disruption one way or the other from this technology.  People who don't see it - I'd just point you to the comparative benchmarking of the different generations of models.  It is a verifiable fact that they are getting better, and matching or exceeding human capabilities in a large class of general tasks.  And they're not likely gonna get much worse moving forward.  ",

I genuinely believe thr benefits will end up outweighing the negatives even if the ride is bumpy getting there.

Obviously the \"Everyone will be replaced\" rhetoric is the most dumb conclusion one can get.\n\nHumans are here to stay. Unless our planet becomes so unbearable to human life that we all die and robots will outlive us, nobody is going to be replaced by anything. We will be served by AI and bots and our lives will be exponentially better. Companies need costumers. To have customers, companies need to employ. That's basic economics and companies know that. If they fire everybody, they are just creating infinite amount of competition, since 1 engineer can now produce alone the equivalent of 10, and those laid off engineers have industry knowledge. To survive they will need to create their own business. Big tech also know that and CEOs will need to be reasonable about how much risk they want to take by firing highly skilled people.\n\nPhilosophically speaking, I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where everything is trusted to AI. We all want a reassurance that there is a human in the loop in case things go south. If money disappears from your bank app, do you seriously want to talk to an AI engineer? No! You want someone who you can put in prison for violating the law. AI can't go to prison right now... its kind of a problem, isn't it?\n\nFinally, coding will become an increasingly scarce skill as younger generations have no incentive to code without AI assistance.  Experienced devs will retire. Just like Cobol engineers are still needed and rare to find, so will be experienced engineers that actually know how to code, instead of prompting.\n\nKeep on coding, and everything will be fine.",

The mood shifted very abruptly this year because the tooling went from \"it helps I guess\" to \"holy shit this thing just completed all my sprint work in an afternoon\".\n\n\nI think whats really going on is the dev world is splitting into two camps:\n\n\n1. Devs who work at companies that rapidly adopt new tech and have the resources to go balls to the walls in implementing it. These devs are seeing what this tech is capable of when given extensive documentation, tooling, and a very large repository of high quality code.\n\n\n2. Devs who work at smaller companies or non-tech companies that are slow to adopt new tech, have shoddy development practices, poor documentation, and basically just use AI out of the box. They might also be using obsolete AI products like Copilot and old models, or their company may not allow LLM usage at all and the devs cant be bothered to experiment with it outside of work.\n\n\nGroup 2 hasn't seen what Group 1 has. Group 2 thinks AI still churns out error ridden spaghetti code with no understanding of domain or business rules, while Group 1 is in the process of adapting to a new engineering paradigm.\n\n\n> I can't help but think we are being bombarded by a concentrated marketing effort by AI companies employing bots to disseminate their narratives.\n\n\nThe neat thing about this mindset is it makes it impossible for you to consider you could be wrong. Any evidence or experiences to the contrary that get presented to you can and will be brushed off as more evidence of a conspiracy.",

It's the talent to phrase a problem in words, then convert that problem into math and analyze it in math terms, and then convert that math result back into words so that a normal person can understand the answer. \n\nWe should all be familiar with our school experiences where very few students were good at math word problems, and that was a huge differentiator. Personally, I've run into students who can get a 100% A+ result on a calculus test (back in the 1980s, so not a grade-inflated A+), yet give them a simple physics problem (block on a frictionless inclined plane) but move \"theta\" from the horizontal angle to the vertical angle. I could give hint after hint after hint (that it's a different formula) but they'd still answer \"m\\*g\\*sin(theta)\" and not \"m\\*g\\*cos(theta)\". So you can have a lot of very smart people, but they're smart because their memory is good, not because they can look at a problem and figure it out from scratch.\n\nSo employers are necessarily trying to acquire the top 5% or so of all possible candidates. The competition is so steep that most employers can't afford that level of talent, so they end up with very bright people who can talk the talk because they can remember everything, but they are much slower at actual problem-solving.",

It also skews younger than the general population so that should be controlled for as well.\n\nIs there some other more comprehensive test that would mitigate the inherent gender and age differences relative to the general population?",

Mostly because I sense that software engineering skills (in isolation) are becoming less valuable, and I'd have to adopt new skills (product management, data science, etc) in order to keep up. Kind of like combining multiple roles into this \"new, specialized software engineer\" role.

Is it on some metric of \"they produce in X interval Y lines of efficient clean code to accomplish some defined outcome in a given common language\"? well that's who can ingest a well written ticket. Is it \"as a partner to stakeholders, they insightfully guide the refinement of the business statement and build the code and automation to suit the goal in a clean and meaningful way?\" then how do you measure that? If it's by the speed and financial success of the project, a personable developer who may not have as much familiarity with data structures as someone who doesn't engage with the ask but memorized a dozen DSA books would be more successful in that metric that no doubt matters more to the business, but we wouldn't call the former a stronger developer in a CS-class vacuum. \n\nIf we were to look at total outcome of career, again define that. Total earnings? The outliers are significantly based on luck, a weak developer who skated in as engineer 150 at Meta would be better than someone strong who chose a series of startups that failed to exit well. Plus, for some money isn't the goal. \n\nIn addition, people lie and talk big game on the internet, I'm sure plenty here have been on panels where someone's HN/LinkedIn presence is full of big talk about creating outcomes but then you put them in a whiteboard session and they can't do a tenth of what they post about. \n\nAll this to say, don't worry much about the internet presence unless you want to leverage that for your career (then back up big talk with skills, please). Focus on what matters for you and grow a little every day to reach that metric of \"better\" for yourself.",

In fact, it’s pretty normal. Not everyone wants or desires to be incredible at their job. Most just want to pay the bills, so you get good enough to do just that. So, most devs are going to be mid.\n\nI also think, and this might just be my own issue, that because tech is constantly shifting and expectations for what you as a dev should know is always changing, it makes it hard to keep your skills sharp. By the time you get good at one thing, the industry has changed and you need to start picking up a new skill. Or the definition of what your job entails expands meaning that you always need to be learning more. I think this can cause a kind of burnout or a decrease in interest to try and be at your best. It becomes tiring to try and keep up, so, again, you just settle into being good enough to keep your job.\n\nIt’s really just the nature of work itself, or at least how we currently do work, that causes a settling of mediocrity in almost every field.

          "text": "> These sites automatically filter for developers who are passionate (or at least interested) in the field, so when we read through HN we're getting a veritable who's who of some of the best developers in the world.\n\nWe kind of are. The devs with the most public presence often *are* exceptionally passionate. You occasionally see underskilled devs who bubble up, but often either not for good reasons or not for very long as their voices don't tend to add value to the broader dialogue in which they're participating.\n\nYou see this in other industries as well. Academia has its own version of this. Arts and entertainment have their own version of this. The medical field has its own version of this, and so on.\n\n> there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nDespite my remarks above, I'd still hesitate to make this extrapolation - it's akin to mistaking the mean for the median. I've worked and liaised with various orgs in various verticals. My observation has been that the talent distribution across an org typically seems to be at least approximately normal/bell-curved, with the majority of that org's devs in their own mid-level range (regardless of title or designation), but the bounds of that curve can vary significantly between orgs. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels could be senior or even principal engineers if they just went elsewhere. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels were essentially budding juniors who picked up enough to teach even newer juniors (but budding nonetheless, no slight intended).\n\nCommunication skill tends to vary along the same axis, but \"poor\" communication skill can mean different things when dealing with software engineers. Do they have a generally poor grasp of language itself (i.e., do they write with poor punctuation, spelling, broken SMS-style syntax)? If not, do they have the insight to translate literal code decisions to technical requirements? If so, do they have the insight to translate technical requirements to business requirements? If so, can they articulate those requirements in precision language that enables genuinely compelling dialogue with stakeholders?\n\nMy point being, tailor your expectations not to the market at large, but to the context into which you're sunk. Most of the engineers in that context are going to reflect its average, which may or may not be an objectively low bar to meet.",

The hardest problems are still beyond them and they are only sometimes capable of innovating new ideas and thinking through them thoroughly. \n\nAbout 10% are capable. They can move into any field and figure out how to be productive. They actively read and educate themselves, so they know lots about things even if they've never directly experienced them. They can solve just about any problem, but not always optimally. The only exception might be highly scientific problems that require deep training with specific knowledge. They can lead, they can mentor, they can guard dog code bases, projects, business problems. These are your team leads. \n\nAbout 5% are savants. They dream up solutions others cannot. They are truly stimulated by hard problems. They have very high standards. They are constantly educating themselves even as a hobby. They have side projects to play with new tech they've discovered. Their friends and them mostly talk about tech and science. They can do things like imagine a new container orchestration mechanism with a custom kernel designed to achieve specific guarantees. They talk about designing hardware systems with variable baud rates for some arcane reason. They know what the downstream effects of storing principals in a token vs a database and what the trade offs are. They know how to distribute processing across 15000 different compute resources and calculate exactly when it will be done processing. \n\nThese are your principal engineers. You won't get to work with them much. Companies usually identify them early and put them on high priority, critical problems. They are usually highly paid\n\n\nRule of thumb, if you don't have a reading list, you're one of the first two categories.",

It was reframing what \"watching me code\" means. In a real pair programming session, the other person is a collaborator. In an interview, they're an evaluator. Your brain knows the difference even if you tell it otherwise, and the evaluator context triggers the exact same fight-or-flight as public speaking. So I started treating every interview coding session like I'm explaining my thought process to a junior dev. Narrate everything out loud. \"Ok, I need to iterate through this, and I'm thinking about edge cases like empty input...\" It sounds awkward but it actually slows down the panic spiral because you're engaging the verbal part of your brain which competes with the anxiety loop.\n\n\n\nAlso, fwiw, the interviewers who are good at their job know this happens. The ones who judge you for freezing on a switch statement after seeing your system design are just bad interviewers. Can't fix that part.",

It was literally the missing piece and it’s one of the most basic operations in any language.\n\nAs soon as the timer was up my brain came back and I sort of laughed and said it sucks when I freeze up, but I genuinely wasn’t worried because all the rest of my solution was fine and it was so obvious I can code so he surely can’t hold is against me? Yeah nope, completely rejected at getting incredible feedback from all the other stages.",

The high level of cortisol is to blame (as a matter of fact it could be measured to confirm).\n\nHow to mitigate? There are plenty advices when searching \"how to reduce fight-or-flight response\" and \"how to mitigate imposter syndrome\", but hard to say which is most suitable for a specific person. Food and drink might affect the hormones, as well as the other sources of stress. Some people advise to tell about it to the interviewer, some companies could give the offline homework instead of the live coding.\n\nInterview practice matters, of course. But sometimes, people don't have the right focus. Certain things needs to be repeated many times to be automated, cached, because stress hormones worsens the recall. It is typical, that people use the approach when something is done, it can be forgotten. With the leetcode and similar this approach is terrible. People solve hundreds of problems, but they forget most of them soon, or it resides in a place in memory they cannot reach during the interview.

I can code in front of others people, no problem, but I am a humble person, I know how to say \"I don't remember, I need to check the docs\". I actually think this is an important quality (not pretending you know and remember everything, nobody does). But I also know most of the times, in interviews, this is interpreted as a sign of weakness. So, I just accepted failures as part of the process. And I allow myself to let the reasonable companies value what is actually important in me. I will not pretend to be someone I am not, or spend months preparing for a non-sense itw, just to loose this momentary skill few months later when I am no longer interviewing.  \n  \nSo, your feeling is totally normal and justified, for several reasons:  \n  \n1 - Flight or fight mode exists for a reason. It probably helps you more than you imagine.  \n2 - I know of no other profession where we need to prove ourselves over and over again when changing to a new company, in a completely unrealistic setting/test. Now imagine doing the same with medical doctors, lawyers, sales people. SWE go through a stress during recruitment that is almost unmatched in other careers.  \n3 - Coding interviews are mostly dumb. I have failed few times for the most ridiculous reasons. For instance, the last time the interviewer asked me to code on Figma (yes, Figma, you read it right). I am not used to not having code completion (nobody is). So I went to check on the documentation - which I was told that I had the right to do - just to be sure a method really works as I remembered. When I got a rejection email, HR gave me the feedback that I googled too much. I never used google in an interview, just opened official documentation, but yeah, fine, they don't even communicate well what I did. So be it.  \n4 - Most talented engineers I know hates code interviews, when they are the ones being tested.\n\nI think you just need to accept that failure might be part of the process. Nobody wins all the time. Most world class SWE talent failed multiple interviews. Don't be too hard on yourself.",

      "text": "I've been writing about the Agile certification industry and what actually ships software, and the most common response I get isn't disagreement. It's some version of \"I agree with all of this but I can't say any of it at work. I need this job.\"\n\nFigured I'd write about that part because it's actually the hardest part. Seeing the dysfunction is easy. Changing it without torching your career is the real skill.\n\nI once nearly got put on a performance plan for suggesting we cut a meeting that everyone on the team privately agreed was useless. The problem wasn't that I was wrong. The problem was I said it in a retro with the person who created the meeting sitting right there. That was a lesson I only needed to learn once.\n\nThe thing that actually works is boring. You measure before you say anything. I spent two sprints tracking every meeting. Duration, number of attendees, decisions made. Put it in a spreadsheet. No opinions, no editorializing, just hours and outcomes. Then I showed it to my manager. Same guy who shut me down three months earlier when I told him sprint planning was theater. He looked at the spreadsheet and said \"huh, we should probably fix this.\" Same message. The spreadsheet didn't threaten his authority. My opinion did.\n\nThe other thing is you never bring it up cold in a group setting. You find one person who agrees with you first. Everyone knows who that person is. It's whoever checks slack during sprint review. You show them the data privately. Now it's two people with a spreadsheet instead of one person with a complaint. At one company I spent three weeks having quiet conversations with senior engineers before I raised anything formally. By the time I brought it up in a team lead meeting, four people in the room already agreed. The conversation wasn't \"Greg thinks standups are broken.\" It was \"several of us have been looking at the data.\" Completely different dynamic.\n\nThe framing matters too. \"Let's eliminate daily standups\" triggers every immune response the org has. \"What if we tried async updates for two sprints and measured deployment frequency before and after\" triggers almost nothing. It's temporary. It's measurable. Nobody has to admit they were wrong. I've used this exact approach to kill sprint planning at one shop, cut standups to twice a week at another, and replace retros with monthly health surveys at a third. The experiment always \"worked\" well enough that nobody wanted to go back. But the entry point was never \"this is broken.\" It was always \"let's try something for two weeks.\"\n\nAnd you have to translate. Engineers talk about efficiency. Your manager cares about delivery risk. The VP cares about cost. \"We spend 22 hours per sprint in meetings\" works on your peers. \"Deploy frequency dropped 30% since we added the third weekly sync\" works on your manager. \"Roughly $280,000 in annual salary going to ceremonies\" works on the executive. Same problem. Three different languages. Most engineers speak engineer to everyone and then wonder why nothing changes.\n\nOne more thing that took me years to learn. If you've tried everything, the data, the allies, the experiments, the right language, and the answer is still no, that's information about the company, not about you. At that point you either accept it or start looking. Both are fine. What isn't fine is staying and resenting it for three years while your work suffers. I've been that person too and it's not worth it.\n\nCurious if others have navigated this. Especially interested in what worked at larger companies where the process has more institutional momentum behind it.",

There are some utterly broken processes and yet it took me years to figure out why everyone hates me for trying my best to fix them! \n\nA few things I've also learned:\n\n1. NEVER bring anything up cold. Everyone's first instinct is to always resist change. You have to bring up the issue with people 1:1 first, or spend a few standups circling the problem (but not addressing it yet). You need to plant the seed first and give it some time to grow.\n\n2. One of the most effective ways to make people realize a problem isn't by pointing it out to them, but by raising it as a question to them. Instead of telling someone that their solution won't work because of X, ask them instead \"how do we handle it if we encounter X scenario?\"\n\n3. Never frame anything as anyone's fault (even if it is) if you need their buy-in to change things. Find something, anything else to absorb the blame from them. Blame the process. Say it was a team decision. Claim that it wasn't possible to predict such a thing in advance. You will get less resistance from them when they don't feel they have to defend their decisions.\n\n4. Make you teammates feel supported and/or respected. You'll be able to suggest and implement changes much faster if they trust you.",

Company leadership on the other hand doesn't care about it. They need to solve business problems and deliver features/revenue. A manager/lead job is to quite literally be a bridge in between. You have to figure out how to motivate some of the smartest people you know to solve the problem the company cares about.\n\n\nWhat you're describing is pretty much a byproduct of this friction. It shows up differently in different companies. Some have strong processes, others have strong engineering culture. Sometimes your leadership can let some red tape slide, other times they won't. Sometimes the team you lead cares about the processes other times they're least bothered. Your job is the coach the team and manage up so these two sides of the coin gel together to produce results.",

If you close one as \"I'm not doing this,\" at most places, at least some of the time, someone will come to you and tell you to open it back up and pretend you're going to do it. If you explain that you're not going to do it, they're fine with this, they just want the appearance that it's \"being worked on.\" So soon you accumulate a bunch of tickets that don't reflect reality. Or else you try to reassign work that doesn't belong to you, and it comes back along with someone telling you that it's politically sensitive and you just need to keep it in your queue for now.\n\nNow multiply this across every tool in the org that a SWE deals with on a daily basis. You end up with a bunch of noise, and since you can't rely on the tools to tell you what actually needs doing vs. what merely needs to be maintained as the appearance of work that will be done, you start to ignore updating the real work because it's too much effort to separate it from the fake work.\n\nThe place I worked where this was not allowed, it was very transparent what everyone was doing at all times. You could just look at the issue tracker and see someone's actual work queue with the prioritizations. We didn't bother making predictions more than a week or two out because the org had found that the error bars were so large on those plans that it wasn't worth wasting time on, so we just put things in order instead.\n\nAlso, everything was tracked in the issue tracker. If you're working on something, then it's documented in a ticket, even if it's not code-related. Status reports pretty much went away because your status was always available for anyone that wanted to look. Doing a weekly sync was simply pulling up everyone's queue to see what their next couple of weeks looked like, and no one had to do any prep for it except scan their tickets to make sure everything was up to date.",

Bad managers don't really understand this at all, I feel. They believe they are just getting people to be accountable to their commitments, but in reality, they are the link between individual contributors and the decision makers.

Everyone posts blockers and progress in a channel by 10am. If someone does not post, the team notices before I do. Peer accountability is way more effective than manager reminders.\n\n2. PRs got a 24-hour SLA. Not enforced by me, enforced by the team agreement. If a PR sat for more than a day without review, it became the top priority for the next available person. We tracked it for two weeks and review times dropped by 60%.\n\n3. I stopped being the router for information. If two engineers needed to coordinate, I would connect them directly instead of relaying messages. Took about a month for people to default to talking to each other first.\n\nThe underlying issue is usually that the team treats coordination as the manager's job instead of everyone's job.

So I started doing brief teardowns of strong updates and quality PRs during team syncs. Not calling anyone out, just normalizing the standard. The gap between 'bad performer' and 'unclear expectations' closed faster than I expected.",

Because of that, I let my manager know that if she noticed any hint of a drop in my performance, I would like to know so there was absolutely no chance of me getting fired.\n\nA bit of background for my manager and myself. She gave me a bad performance review last time round(it was totally fair, I wasn't performing due to health reasons and being very down mentally) and then she gave me goals to complete. I crushed all the goals, she said that I was doing a great job and that it was a night and day difference in how I was performing. \n\nTwo weeks ago we had a 1:1 and I asked her about her expectations for a promotion and she was guiding me on how to frame my performance review to be more likely to get it.\n\nToday, I was let go. As it happens I was about to hand in my notice and it worked out perfectly. \n\nThe reason I received was that I didn't have as many PRs as the next person, I'm the lowest in that regard and in points completed. We have a minimum rate of 1 point per ticket so people can just spam 1 pointer tickets that take no time so their points are inflated while mine are mostly bigger tickets where 3 points require work. I also got let go for behavior reasons yet she didn't provide a single concrete example.\n\nThe HR guy was sympathetic and he said that my manager dropped the ball and that I should have had chances to catch this. They're at least paying the full notice period and as it happens, my pay ends one day before I start the new job, so I have a few months of paid holiday!\n\nIf I didn't have the next job lined up I would be completely screwed. Word around the office is that the company is cutting headcount and I think this was a case of \"if you beat the data hard enough, it'll tell you what you want to hear\". \n\nThoughts? \n\nThis isn't in the US btw.",

They are often repetitive, superficial, exaggerated, baseless etc. We combat it by removing such posts under Rule #9, which is fine\n\nHowever, it's still very easy to find multiple threads repeating the exact same discussion. One common suggestion is to limit LLM related posts to a megathread. In my opinion megathreads rarely work outside of big events. Doing so would practically mean no more LLM discussion allowed\n\nI do believe LLM discussion is, at the very least, a reality. It's not wise to be a luddite about it. There's real engineering in this field, there are real challenges to experienceddevs and therefore completely banning it isn't an option \n\nTLDR: What you would think if LLM related posts were only allowed on some days? Let's say Tuesday and Thursday. This simultaneously helps with the spam, but also doesn't completely kill the discussion like a megathread",

This tends to be fairly technology agnostic, and a lot of that advice would have been applicable 20 years ago, and will hopefully still be 20 years from now.\n\nCertainly LLMs disrupt how we interact with other colleagues and process changes so it can't just be ignored, but I'd really love to keep it in the super abstract.\n\nWith that said, there are a lot of the same conversations being had on repeat. I for one wouldn't mind limiting the number of posts (if it's easiest to have days of the week, then sure). I do think there is a difference between \"This is how I use it, and wow!\" vs \"I have a junior that relies on AI and I'm concerned in their ability to grow as a developer\".",

So I'd argue that banning LLM discussion would make sense, not because \"LLM is bad for developers/society/this sub/the environment\" but because \"what LLM discussions *devolve into* is bad for this sub\"\n\nFrom a pure moderation point of view, this sub is better off without LLM discussions than with them.\n\nFailing that, having a designated LLM-day would make sense (and I would say it should just be one, for the sake of simplicity). Let's have LLM Thursdays then. (Or as others have suggested, LLMondays)",

And just like now, these posts will inevitably garner lots of attention and discussion, not because the tech is cool or whatever, but because just the topic of ai is incredibly polarizing - topics that are naturally polarizing will always drive huge discussions regardless of the productivity of the discussion. But now because of the new rule you're allowed to close the post freely, pissing off more people because of whatever bias they perceive you for having: \"mods killed the discussion because they're ai lovers/haters\" post will show up more and more. \n\nI hate to give you this feedback without offering suggestions, but like everyone else, I am unsure the best path forward. You could consider the new LLM day rule, while also turning on mod approval on new posts - that way you can snuff them out early. This would require a lot more mod support though (I'm happy to help if I can), but the quality of the content would skyrocket. \n\nRegardless, good luck with whatever decision you make.",

I’ve been thinking about something for a while and I’d like your opinion on it.\n\nI had a leader a few years back that used to say that he liked the lazy developers, because they’re the ones that come up with simpler solutions, and I completely agree, I’ve always felt like I was a lazy dev.\n\nHowever, with the ai usage increasing, complex code is easier to write. I know that everybody has talked about this already and that’s not my point.\n\nMy point is, since we’re not the ones actually doing the dirty work, it gets much easier to create more microservices than you have users, or adding 10 layers of abstraction to anything.\n\nI think that, for me, at least, I have to be careful not to become that astronaut architect, designing that “perfect” white marble tower",

          "text": "The problem with complexity, as I see it, is that we focus it on the code alone in a vacuum.\n\nLet's start first with what I claim is true: \n\n* Developers will solve problems as complex as they can and no more. If a problem seems too complex/hard to solve developers will make software that over simplifies or scopes to a simpler subset of the problem. \n* Developers will create solutions as complicated as they can handle. If a problem is easy they'll take on extra tech debt, over engineer it, or use ridiculous platform tools (e.g. electron) to make it.\n   * Note that most of these solutions make it easier to develop, or at least the developer will think that's the case. Such as using a myriad of npm deps for every trivial thing. \n* We can decrease apparent complexity with tools/frameworks/tests/etc which handle and solve that complexity for us (it converts the complex problem to a simpler one, even if it is harder!). We should note this isn't guaranteed to decrease dev time, and may even increase it, but the perception is generally of it making things faster. LLMs are a tool that reduce a lot of the complexity in making ambiguous specs into code, though it needs the other to be clear and has other limitations. \n* We can increase complexity by accruing tech debt, making dogmatic decisions (e.g. I want to make a very fast grep tool using only pure functional code, or I'll rewrite my blog host entirely in Rust), increasing the scope of the task, tackling more ambiguity directly (ie started l software that can do everything), it reframing the problem. \n* Complexity compounds. If I take modules foo and bar and use them together, the solution is going to be far more complex that either module alone. \n \nFrom this we can reach some interesting conclusions. Fire example: as we add more modules/features to our software, all the previous code needs to become simpler so that our software stays at the right limit of complexity. You can't do this preventively because we need the same level of complexity, so you'll end up with an el over-engineered solution that doesn't solve the problem that comes up. Similarly if you can't reduce the complexity of existing software it'll be impossible to add new features/modules as the complexity will grow to large and old features will have to be dropped. \n\nSimilarly it's easy for complexity to get out of hand. Because the complexity LLMs are hiding is the complexity of managing complexity. You still have to do it, but it's easy to be blindsided if you don't understand how to best use the tool. LLMs are this tool that seems like it could do anything, but many times there's a better tool already.\n\nNow this seems to keep us doomed, because any progress we do to improve our software will simply result in us becoming lazier (the wrong way) until the problem gets as hard, it even harder than before.\n\nSo what to do? Do we just force ourselves to code with old limitations? (Keep RAM usage to 10MB max, and binary system under 2MB?) I mean in some contexts that can totally work, but what about when we want to explore and be creative? Those limitations are against, but once we're done we can't just rewrite. I guess that's another solution, restart again, lose all progress and hope you get somewhere interesting, but even with hindsight it almost never works. Another solution is to go as fast as possible and manage tech debt with speed as the target, and that works well enough (though paradoxically it generally ends up being but the fastest possible, but it is consistently fast). But this is an issue with LLMs because it becomes really hard to manage and track tech debt if you misuse LLMs, and not only so we but know a lot about how to best use them, but it's very easy to misuse them and many times they push you towards the misuse, instead of solving and fixing things effectively. Thing is that the focus on speed misguides us on how to use LLMs and it easily leads to excessive complexity which means the program will start to crash and have issues until we drop features, abilities or slow down, none of what we want to do. \n\nSo this leads me to my final alternative. I reframe the problem as one of having to consider the many contexts in which the code exists. And this includes other developers. So when I write code I think of all the different reasons a programmer would interact with it, also ask the different things they may choose to do, and not only that I think of the different ways a programmer can think: what if they're more junior? What if they're not as familiar with the paradigm I use? What if their area of expertise is different (and once in but even familiar with), what if the strategy I used to approach the problem is one that they don't like? What if they're neurodivergent? What if they're an SRE, or a UX engineer who has to deal with my code? What if they're someone who knows the language conventions from 10 years in the future but not the ones now (that would be seen as bad habits by then)? And then I do the same for the clients.\n\nThe complexity of dealing with different human minds very quickly becomes overwhelming and it forces me to make the simplest, most straightforward code possible, because that's the limit of complexity at that point. It gets messy, because other coders will not use that strategy and will not understand the reason for the simplicity, making the code complex again either way, but the beauty of this is that I force myself to account for that too.\n\nAnd that has been leading more on how I use LLMs. I find that they are really good at parroting how other people would look at my code. I just need the stimulation of another viewpoint to help me see what I normally don't think like. And it works, a few passes on documentation, tests that consider edge cases I haven't, guidance on how to make the code guide the reader towards understanding better. I get to be lazier on the chores that take time, which lets me move faster, but still keeping my code simple enough.",

The arguments talk past each other because we don’t have precise language for why each position makes sense in different situations. The software contexts differ in ways we rarely interrogate deeply.\n\nWhat we actually need is a clearer distinction between:\na messy, one-off solution (yesterday’s Excel sheet), and\na core, durable business capability.\n\nHistorically, we handled this vaguely by saying:\n“Just use Excel”\n“Write a macro”\n“Throw together a one-off script”\nNow that role is increasingly filled by AI-generated, semi-disposable code. The definition of disposable has expanded. \n\nAnd just like one off scripts and proof of concept code that shouldn't, that code will inevitably leak into systems that were meant to be clean, stable, and engineered.\n\nSo the real question isn’t whether vibe code belongs—it’s when it’s acceptable to plan for it, and how to with the trade-offs. \n\nWhen is it reasonable for the business to intentionally rely on an Excel-level (or vibe-coded) solution? What differentiates:\n“Use Excel, then import the data” from “This no longer fits in Excel”?\n\nThose boundaries used to be fuzzy even with spreadsheets and macros.

In the past, the friction of writing a new microservice or adding yet another abstraction layer provided a natural 'laziness filter' -- if it was too much work, you'd find a simpler way. Now that the work of 'writing' is subsidized, we have to develop a much stronger internal 'simplicity muscle.'\n\n  \nI find that the best way to combat this is to strictly enforce a 'value-first' architecture. If a new service or abstraction doesn't directly solve a known scalability wall or a massive developer experience friction, it doesn't get built. We should be 'lazy' about maintenance, not just 'lazy' about typing. A simpler system with fewer moving parts is the ultimate gift to your future self who has to debug it at 3 AM.",

Nothing outrageously beyond the pale, mind you. But there is so much bait to make horrible decisions during this AI adoption cycle which is basically blasting marketing into their heads that they should have rando employees vibe code apps for production. The outcome will be mostly no measurable benefit, while incurring massive security and privacy risks and diverting engineering resources.\n\nI'm planning to leave soon, so I'm rolling with it, plus it does present some interesting/fun engineering problems to solve, but it's really making me realize how rare it is for senior leadership to not be idiots, and to realize how so much of the recent former status quo was niceties, lip service, and obsequious pseudo respect for engineering, all of which evaporates when they see a vibe coded mvp and basically admit they only pretended to understand the importance of maintainability, simplicity, and security because the experts wouldn't stfu about it.\n\nI'm planning my move to an org in a domain I'm genuinely interested in run by an engineer, and I hope that will provide more sanity in these times, but it really seems like leadership handling this paradigm shift gracefully is going to be an absolute rarity.\n\nEdit: does this sub have mods anymore?

I let it run for 48 hours and the results reveal a shit show. \n\nmain find is a ghost transaction, the app thought it was updating ledger balances but thanks to a nested try/catch it was swallowing a specific pdo exception. transaction started but zero commits. the app was clueless and kept it pushing like there was no issue and logs showed success. my little shim called it's bluff and exposed 5 figures of loss vanishing into the void. \n\nI'm not selling anything or looking for a gig, just wanted to start some discussion and see how you guys are verifying data integrity in monolithic systems from before observability was such a big deal. I've been thinking about cleaning this shim up and making it a standard audit tool to maybe help some of my brethren get a little extra sleep if there's a need. \n\nif you have a legacy stack that's full of crap like this or you've caught similar ghost transactions I'd love to hear about it (and how you catch/mitigate them in legacy systems), especially if there's a better way I'm missing!",

When you’re operating against a continuous backlog, this can become tricky without the right lightweight processes that can catch issues and set direction without delaying continuous feature delivery, but it’s doable, and can have dramatic results.",

Looking at it another way - if someone introduced a high availability architecture with scalability from the get go and it scales incorrectly with the problems of today then not only is the program bad and costly when load isn’t there, it may actively make fixing things worse.\n\nIn the end, we’re all making decisions without full context - no one has a crystal ball that tells them if a project will succeed and hindsight is easy because it means we’re able to make decisions with more context.\n\nThe question may be “what is the role of the senior+ engineer outside of immediate firefighting?”\n\nI think the answers are:\n\n* Put tools in place (tests, CI, observability, reviews, etc.) to ensure that the fix is applied consistently and has the same effects over time.\n* Convince the culture to build things with more reliability - get things hooked up to observability and get the right notifications firing\n\nBasically - now that the fire has been put out or at least put into a manageable state, how do we implement processes technical or otherwise to stop firefighting?\n\nNot every manager or culture will be receptive to approaching things like this but in those cases it’s best to vote with your feet. There are good engineering cultures in the world and it’s possible the one you’re in won’t let you make the necessary changes to get out of firefighting due to any number of reasons - The software isn’t perceived to be critical to the success of the business, leadership doesn’t value engineering, the rate of business to keep the company alive requires a pace of development that requires more/better people and the investment budget isn’t there, etc.",

The team is refusing to be a team by making one person the backstop for every architectural shortcut.\n\nThe real question isn't \"how do I say no,\" it's \"what am I getting for saying yes.\" Because right now the answer is: more yes. If the fixing led somewhere—a principal title, an architecture role, a mandate to actually prevent this stuff—that's a different calculation. If it's just an infinite loop of fires, you're not building a career, you're maintaining someone else's.\n\nStart making the cost visible.

The way out isn't saying no. It's changing the system. Push for architecture reviews before code gets written, not after it breaks. Make it a process, not a personal favor. Document every fire you put out with the root cause and estimated cost of the shortcut that caused it. When leadership sees 'this rushed decision cost us 3 weeks of senior dev time,' the conversation shifts from 'can you fix this' to 'how do we stop causing this.' And honestly, if you've been the safety net for 10 years and nothing has changed structurally, that's the org telling you who they are. Sometimes the answer isn't pushing back harder, it's finding a team that designs things properly the first time.",

You (probably) need to implement \"undo\" for that action, support multiple file formats for input and output, program checks for something every 2 weeks? oh, add an option that customizes that at settings/preferences...and omg settings are strangely elusive to implement. Dark theme, admin-privileges, draggable UI panes, auto-updates, localization, imperial vs metric system presentation options. There seems to be no end to how thorough a piece of software can get. \n\nI'm my own boss, btw, so, I don't have any of that middle management breathing down my neck problem, for better and for worse. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to voice my appreciation for this craft.

I have noticed increased number of very unprofessional behaviour from recruiter or hiring managers from well known companies. Here are the examples:\n\n* A recruiter reaches out to me through LinkedIn. We schedule a call. She never shows up. I message her. No response\n* A recruiter reached out to me. We chat and all is well. We schedule a call with HM. He never shows up. I wait for 10 minutes and message a recruiter. Recruiter comes back to me the next day saying that \"something came up for <HM>\". No clear explanation, nothing.\n* First chat with the recruiter. All is well. They sent a Calendly link to pick up time for interviews. Never gotten back to me with confirmation. Follow up emails have been ignored.\n* Recruiter send a Zoom link that has Meeting Password (I think this is how it's called). I cannot get into the call. I email them 5 minutes before the meeting. No response. 15 minutes later I get an email from the recruiter as a separate email with the subject: \"Thank you for your interest\" and body that pretty much says: \"Thanks but no thanks\".\n\nI am genuinely puzzled. Is this just my experience or due to mass layoffs, recruiters lost any sense of professionalism?\n\n  \nEDIT: All of those recruiters have been in-house ones. AKA, they don't represent staffing agencies.",

While a blanket statement I know, some recruiters don't treat this job like a career...just the next stop along their way to finding something they actually want to do as a career.\n\nAs for the zoom call + 15 minutes later thanks but no thanks, stuff like that is a by product of working at the whims of a client. Could they have handled it better? sure. I wouldn't take it personal. My guess, the company had an offer out to a candidate...candidate didn't take it yet so they kept the door open to keep looking, candidate comes back and accepts and then they tell the recruiter to cancel all appointments and it was just handled crappily.\n\nEither way, its the nature of the current market, I know plenty of developers who ghosted recruiters mid interview cycle because they got the dream offer while keeping 3 other recruiters on the hook.

I believe this will get worse before it gets better. \n\nGiven the option saving themselves time and hassle without any real consequence for it, many people will opt to do that rather than close the loop and protect a relationship for future reference.  The aforementioned digitally connected world gives them endless other options.

A regional newspaper, a cable company that only services some states, or a boot strapped B2B company should probably not spend any money investing in Africa. It just doesn't have a good ROI.

          "text": "This, to me, is one of the most frustrating parts of interviewing at modern tech companies.  The questions you're asking are the real life correct questions to ask.  They are also the types of questions most engineers don't think to ask until they hit staff level or higher, but -havent- gone up the management ladder yet (which atrophies this a bit, i speak from experience).\n\nWhat this all means, is delending on your interviewer, these questions are very likely correct, but -above- the interviewing person's skill level to see the value of.\n\nIf I'm being asked this interview question by a senior dev, theres a huge chance they would assume a response like \"how is this 700ms being calculated\" as a delay tactic because you don't know a good answer.  Because if they were the type of person to realize that africa is too big of a place to fix with \"add more cdns\" and that a single 700ms latency doesn't make sense for an entire continent, then they wouldn't still be a senior engineer.  \n\nThat said, part of being a staff eng is knowing how to talk to people with kess experience than you.  So you could, and probably should say, something like \"well there are a lot of ways to fix a latency issue like this.  We would probably investigate geocaching and regional cdns for example.  I could list some strategies like these if you're talking about fixing geographic katency im the general sense.  But if you're asking specifically about the example you've given, then I'd want to dive in a but deeper, because a 700ms latency fir the entire continent of africa seems a little suspect.  Do you know what the geographical distribution that elad to that number is?\"\n\nI would think in most situations that would impress the senior and be the right answer.  If the senior is open minded to it it would work.\n\nBut if you do this to every question, then they are never going to get to the point of testing your technical chops either.\n\nWhere this gets really bad, though, is when you get senior engineers asking leetcode style questions, which is what a lot of them do nowadays.  The hardest part i have with leetcode is how, if you actually think about the question for a few minutes, many (most?) of the questions completely fall apart with the type of analysis you're talking about.\n\nThe last time i opened a leetcode study book, which was admittedly a decade ago, I couldn't get passed the first question.  Because while it was obvious the question was looking for some sort of fancy breadth first search algorithm, i knew the actual domain the question was supposed to be about, and realized that 95% of the traffic was going to come from one point, meaning that any generic search algorithm would be irl wrong.  But good luck explaining that to someone reciting from a leetcode question sheet.\n\nSo i guess the answer is, know your audience, i suppose.  And chalk this up as yet another reason why modern tech interviewing is broken.  You need to show your ability to ask these questions because this is what separates you from younger devs, but chances are, you are soeaking to a younger dev and have to speak their language as well.",

A senior level position means dealing with nuance and IMO showing product-level thinking.\n\nIf you are setting up a CDN for a JAM stack app and it still has to make 700ms round trips to the backend, or even worse, use a more local backend that requires multiple 700ms round trips to the existing database for every single query, you haven't fixed anything and in certain cases, actually made it worse.",

Good interviewers are looking for people who challenge assumptions and ask clarifying questions before throwing solutions at poorly defined problems. The \"outside the box\" answers you listed aren't outside the box at all - they're the fundamentals of engineering leadership. Anyone can regurgitate CDN and regional servers, but understanding business context, validating the problem scope, and questioning data quality shows you've been burned by jumping to solutions too quickly in the past. That said, you do need to eventually provide technical solutions after establishing context, so the sweet spot is asking 2-3 clarifying questions that expose your thought process, then walking through potential solutions based on different scenarios.\n\nThe catch is that not all interviewers are good at their jobs, and some will mark you down for not immediately diving into technical details because they're reading from a rubric. You can usually gauge this in the first few minutes - if they seem annoyed by your questions or try to rush you past them, pivot faster to the technical stuff. If they engage with your questions and seem interested in the discussion, you've found someone who gets it. I'm on the team that built [AI copilot for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and from what job seekers tell me, practicing this balance of strategic questioning before technical deep-dives is what helped them land senior roles.",

With every year that passed in my career I was excited to be learning something new. FrontEnd, BackEndnd, to FullStack. Every year I felt like I leveled up a developer. It was like a game: each promotion provided me with new year, every job change was a new level to learn.  Now, almost 8 years later I feel like I've plateaued at the senior engineering level. I don't even know if i love coding anymore, but the money's good and as things are getting more expensive I want to position myself for a promotion.\n\nWith the advent of AI, I feel like i've become more of a prompt engineer than anything. I feel like I can't even take the time out to learn new languages or frameworks because the demand for pumping out work has become so high. Even architecture diagrams are design nowadays with AI. Now, it's just a job like any other. \n\nFor those of you who've been developing for some time, what did it take for you to make the move from senior to staff? And for those of you who've done it more recently did that look any different than your older peers? Should I just grind Leetcode and pray I end up at a MANGA that doesn't lay me off,  just learn a sub-domain really well instead, or just suck it up and be thankful I have a job? ",

There’s several archetypes for staff level (re: staffeng site was helpful for me too) and it depends on what your company/org/team needs or expects. \n\nFor me, it meant working more cross functionally across several engineering teams and working on more strategic engineering goals, building rapport with people, writing design/strategy docs, meeting and aligning with stakeholders, building longer term roadmaps. More org politics to deal with and seemed harder to progress any higher.\n\nDuring my first few months after promotion I had ongoing syncs with a close senior staff eng who told me that as you go up in level you end up doing less of the thing (coding) you had spent years becoming good at, a shift in expected skill set. \n\nThat said, it’s ok not continue past senior. At this point, senior roles are my sweet spot for balancing engineering impact without much politics. Although may think about EM in a few years, if I feel done with being an IC lol",

It’s not an engineering book, it’s a negotiation book written by a former FBI hostage negotiator turned consultant. In it, he talks about incentives and understanding what people want from a conversation and using that to create non-zero sum outcomes, and even when you deal with someone who might be getting a rawer deal, explaining to them respectfully why their desired outcome lost out. It’s the biggest tool in my arsenal every day.",

Can you own a technical decision that affects multiple teams? Can you identify the right problem to solve before anyone asks? Thats the real gap.\n\nAlso fwiw the feeling of not loving coding anymore might just be growth.

          "text": "Grinding leetcode won't help, unless you mean just for the sake of getting into a bigger company and (re-) starting the progression to Staff there. Getting to staff is mostly about understanding how to overcome organizational challenges (convincing engineers to do the right thing (spoiler: it is not always going to be the best technical thing), and convincing leadership to agree to let engineers spend time doing the right thing (which is not usually going to be the fastest or easiest thing)), and then using that ability to actually get useful things done. That is a two way street since you need to understand what matters both to fellow (particularly less experienced) engineers, and what matters to management, figure out a solution that actually satisfies both, and then actually convince everyone to do that. IMO it is much easier to do that in a company and space you are very familiar with than in a new one.\n\nAI is nice because the above is usually so time consuming that you are not going to find time to actually code anything significant yourself, unless there are other Staff you can split responsibilities with. If you get familiar with AI tooling, you can still get quite a bit of actual code out the door by giving it quick instructions between meetings and reviewing its work. IMO this is a lot less satisfying than coding yourself, but it's like having you own personal intern that you don't have to feel bad about not responding to immediately.\n\nedit: there is a tendency in engineering forums to call all of this \"politics\", but it isn't. While there definitely is more politics at higher levels, the vast majority of the above is just paying attention to who you're talking to and trying to speak to them in a way they will understand and be reassured by. I have had to step into so many escalations where two teams have been disagreeing over something for days/weeks and I can't understand why - then I listen in on a call and there isn't actually an disagreement on technical grounds. One of them is just saying describing the solution in one way highlighting what is important to them, and not understanding what the other one wants from it, and my contribution ends up being just repeating what the first one said, but explaining how it will satisfy the second party too. It is stupid, I don't know how these otherwise intelligent and rational people can have spent a week on this issue without figuring it out, but here we are.",
