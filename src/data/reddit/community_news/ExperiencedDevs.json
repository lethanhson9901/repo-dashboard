      "text": "I’m a senior full-stack engineer with about 8+ years of experience, currently employed, but interviewing after a long stretch at one company.\n\nWhat’s been getting to me isn’t coding itself, it’s the interview process. The breadth feels endless. One interview focuses on frontend performance trivia, another on SQL optimizers, another on system design depth, another on algorithms I may never touch day to day. Even with prep, it feels impossible to predict what angle I’ll be evaluated on.\n\nAfter enough of these, it starts to feel like a numbers game plus interviewer fit rather than a signal of real-world competence, and that’s honestly pretty demoralizing.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through this at the senior level, how do you mentally frame interviews so they don’t erode your confidence? Do you narrow company types, take breaks, or just accept the randomness? Have any of you seriously questioned staying in software during these phases, and what helped?\n\nI’m not looking to rant. I’m genuinely trying to learn how others cope with this without burning out.",

The best advice I can give you is try and take those interviews as learning experiences for other interviews until you start getting offers. You will soon be able to know exactly what to answer to specific questions and be able to say it as natural as possible",

You never really know what the director is looking for. They may have someone in mind already and the whole audition is a courtesy / box-check on some grant program they're operating the theater under. You do your best, you take rejection, you suit up and do it again. She does some additional work: she researches the theaters, keeps her ear to the ground, talks to other actors in the area about their experience (that's easier with actors, where the gigs are one-offs; software engineers aren't moving as fast through industry so you have to build a larger contact web to get a richer picture of who's hiring in your area).\n\nBut the *biggest* thing that controls whether you get a role is if you keep showing up. The role finds you; your control over getting the role (unless you're a big enough name that people recognize it) is minimal.\n\nI know it's not the most comforting feedback, but: interviewing in software is similar. The spectrum of what is asked is so broad because companies *barely* know what they want and *barely* know how to find it in the talent pool. And companies are also dealing with people who just straight-up lie about their capabilities and use every tool they can get their hands on to ace the interview, whether or not those tools would translate into being able to do good day-to-day work. So it's a mess out there.\n\nYou can research the companies to get a sense of what they're looking for, talk to other engineers, and try to tune your approach to who you're talking to... But the biggest control you have over finding a gig is *still* to keep showing up to the interviews.",

          "text": "I'm going through this right now. My theory is hiring managers are telling interviewers to \"be tougher\", but the interviewers don't know how to do this in a way that actually produces more signal.\n\nYes, a senior fullstack developer should have familiarity with most parts of the stack. However, I don't think they should be required to have *an equal level of depth* in all parts of the stack. And this is the biggest change I've seen. Previously, in a system design interview, it was enough to just say, \"I would use a queue for this.\" Maybe they'd ask you, \"What queue technology would you use?\" and that would be the end of it. Now if you say, \"I would use lambdas\" they want to drill down and ask you extremely specific implementation questions about lambdas. And they do that with everything! And if there's one single area where you don't have that level of depth, you fail the interview. You're literally expected to be perfect at everything. I was in an interview recently where I felt like I was being treated like the suspect in a murder case. The adversarial nature of these interviews has gotten out of hand.\n\nPersonally, I don't think this is fair. I think it's natural to have varying levels of strength in different areas. If someone's a whiz at databases but hasn't touched lambdas in a few years, should that person be a no-hire? Not in my opinion. Because if you've got advanced database knowledge, what is the likelihood you coudn't come up to speed with lambdas in the space of a day? Especially now that we have the best learning tools known to man at our disposal. But sadly, this is where we are.\n\nMy answer was to work on a side project that involved the technologies I wanted to get stronger on. In a couple cases, I even picked up some old projects and grafted on some new technologies because I wanted to learn them. Can you do this with everything? Probably not. But you can probably pick out the technologies you're most likely to be asked about and study up on them. And then you can walk into the interview room more confident, and as long as they ask you *reasonable* questions, you'll have decent responses.",

But, you start to see trends. Like for you, you have seen multiple pitches thrown by companies. Start to use AI to drill those. I legit have AI rapid fire 25 questions that a hiring team would ask me for every language and framework I know as I am prepping. I will also use AI to give me badly written code to refactor.

For personal reasons he had to move to Canada, got interviewed and was asked idiotic questions. Instead of asking him to show what he's built, they gave him brainteasers and algorithm questions. But the guy was self taught and absolutely uninterested and unaware of all that.\n\nSo I'd say, there's little to do to avoid these types of questions, the only thing you can do is try to study them like you'd study for a driving exam, i.e. don't worry about how useful it is, or how relevant these questions are, just try to get familiar with the types of questions asked just to be able to get to the next round.\n\nAlso, during interviews, try bringing the interview to a higher playing field, by relating their questions (even the most academic ones) to real life experiences (however relevant) just to show you've solved actual problems, not just algorithms.",

The type of company (tech startups) allows me to exercise the breadth I like to work with as well as product skills. If I'm able, I take breaks on the process.

You don't even have to set up the API or DB (but you should practice that separately)  - you can just emulate that with Promises\n\nthis might be a hot take and i guess its hard to explain but its all about being comfortable and thorough with what you already know how to. With senior level interviews, mostly what they're looking for is \"does this candidate know what they're doing\" aka, can you look at the problem, and come up with a possible solution, and code that fr start to finish. \n\nI've gotten technical assessments where i didn't hit all the requirements, or  messed up with syntax, or got the answer wrong, but the way I work through the problem - but despite that I'm the one who's driving the convo. It's like, you just have to convince them you've done this a million times before, and you do that throw\n\nOne time i had 90 min to build a small app - when i saw the requirements i just thought in my head \"yeah no one can build this in 90 min\" and so that helped me relax - that one i hit less than half the requirements, and after I had another 90 min session to discuss my solution. So despite not hitting the requirements, i could have sold that app to you in an elevator. I had the solution in my head, and so when we discussed what I had coded I could explain it thoroughly how I would have coded this or that given appropriate amount of time. I got the job",

But being able to communicate a thorough technical understanding, through narration and what you actually type - it's just a positive signal. The opposite is someone fumbling with the language and logic that they claim to have X yrs of exp with.\n\ne.g. I had a recent assessment where the interviewer provided a web app coding env, basically it ran React and I was to code out some solution, i forget the question. But as I'm working through it and running it there's random errors; but totally valid code. In this case I've kinda shown that I understand the task and can get my ideas out into the editor, and so he kinda brushes it off and just moves me onto the final round. At a high level he could see that I knew what I was doing, I am what my resume says I am, and he'd rather not waste time just debugging env issues. \n\nI got that job, I currently work there.",

In many places they will tell you. And that might help with the nerves at least. At my company, for a backend position we do the same system design exercise for everyone. The solution is even spelled out in our company's white paper. In practice, statistically it doesn't really matter whether the candidates know the problem or even one potential solution in advance. \n\nI've done technical interviews for years now and coached many other engineers for it. The bottom line is that interviewing is highly subjective and making it less subjective doesn't really result in better hires overall.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nGood luck!",

If you can't do UI performance tuning then why are you applying for front end jobs?  A senior dev job isn't a learn on the job role.  A company is about to shell out a considerable amount of money for a senior dev and they're going through 1000s of generic AI resumes, dealing with people interviewing with a single ear bud in their ear looking off screen repeatedly, other people who just can't hold a conversation, and even more people who saw 1 thing they were good at on the job description and thought they could BS their way through the interview.  \n\nYou're burnt out?  Consider what the interviewer is going though and respect their time.  They probably have a deadline due that week, a bug to get back to, and code review to perform, or a stand up to attend.  They're giving you this time to prove to them that you're \"the person\".  If they're asking you a question then they believe the answer to that question helps them evaluate you.   The person interviewing you isn't some rando, it's someone the company trusts, probably one of their better devs, and they're not likely to fall for the BS route.  \n  \nPut the job description into an LLM and ask it to drill you on interview questions.  Research other people's interview experience on glass door or indeed and prepare accordingly.\n\nA senior dev should walk into a company and produce on day one and the interviewers job is to find out if you are the person who can do that.  Nobody wants to hire a senior dev and then hold their hand for 6 months while they figure out that they have no idea that 'select \\*' is a performance killer (i have hired just such a dev early in my hiring manager duties).    \n  \nSenior dev isn't an amount of time, it's an amount of experience gained by pushing bugs, owning mistakes, and helping others solve problems so many times that the solutions to easy issues that stump junior devs come to your mind in minutes.  \n\nSource: I've interviewed for 3 jobs in 25 years and got an offer on each one.

Often we will have a tester that can't test so I will travel a 3-5 hour round trip in a car to our test-field to go test things as well when needed. There isn't a single job I do not do (this is not a startup).\n\nI am finding that trying to find a new job with all this responsibility is extremely difficult.\n\nI had an interview the other day and I basically had to spend two days doing nothing at work so I could try and cram for a system design interview covering things I've never done in my professional career. I don't think the interview went well needless to say and nothing on my team got done as a result of me not being \"on\".\n\nBeyond just not enough time to study (beyond weekends and after work), scheduling interviews is very hard. Even when I think I have free time on my schedule, I will be in an interview and my phone will start ringing with calls to my personal number from team members.\n\nThe amount of noise that I have to filter through on any given day is extraneous and I actually sometimes feel like I might snap but I haven't yet.\n\nAnyone else that has been through this, how did you manage your time and how did you get out?",

Don't try to cram everything, just nail the fundamentals\n\n  \nThe key realization for me was that I was never gonna have perfect conditions to interview, so I had to just accept that some days would be messy and push through it.

Your job is to make them understand if they want X then Y will slip. You need a list of what you do, the time it takes, and let them prioritize.

As much as you can don’t answer calls, insist on using your companies chat program for all communication.  Drag your boss into any testing failure or p0, p1 channels for “visibility”.  Use the status to set yourself as “away” with interesting titles like “driving to test area to test vx.y”. FORCE the testers to go to the testing location with you and be there “for the duration”.  Cancel the test if they cannot/will not attend, etc, etc.\n\nAs far as getting a new job use the interviews to figure out what you need to bone up on.  If you don’t know say so. I have hired people who did not know things but who could explain a logical path to getting to the answer. If the company is being “hr lazy” and only depending on automated test suites then consider it as dodging a bullet. \n\nLast time I interviewed I got one of those and when I tried to run it on my home machine with 6 monitors it complained because it only allowed 1 monitor. I ended up with a “manual” person to person interview when I pinged them that their testing suite did not work with my home system.  Now I ended up not pursuing that because their JD said AWS/Google Cloud and what they really meant was Google Cloud and are you aware AWS has something similar? (I was looking for AWS where I could start doing some google cloud or oracle cloud or dreamhost cloud or….)\n\nAs others have said block out time “for heads down work”.  But really use the other things I mentioned to start putting pressure on the system.",

Be strategic around juggling your # limit of loops you can handle at a time, and schedule breaks in before you're forced to take one.\n\nI would suggest not to cram everything in all at once: dedicate 10-15 hours of study a week, 5 hours of interviewing/job searching a week, stop most if not all your hobbies, ensure you get 8 hours of sleep a night and buckle in for maybe 5-7 months.\n\nSince interview formats are shifting a lot these days, you're probably going to get your studying in by failing interviews and learning from them. Get lots of rest and keep getting back up!",

And it's not like they're telling me the work isn't good enough or anything like that, in fact the past two years they secured me $35k in additional bonuses (on top of the 10%/yr we are mostly guaranteed).\n\n\nBut with the pandemic and oh boy the current administration even the fortune 400 company I work for is pretty afraid to increase costs. So now even fewer promotions are given. And the scope of my responsibilities has increased of course, I'm effectively working 2 levels above my pay grade. But I did at least leverage that to offload some responsibility to the more personable developers so I can focus less on hunting people down for meetings and more on the technicals. \n\n\nThe job is too good to give up though. This is the only \"unlimited vacation\" place I've seen that actually honors that, I've been able to take ~6 weeks per year plus the odd day here and there. Permanent work from home, too, since they sold the office space in the state I live in. I've continued to make it clear that it feels pointless to deliver more than I'm expected if I'm never going to either see a real push from my manager to promote me or at least tell me why he isn't. ",

I'm exhausted. The reality is the enterprise world of software is all bureaucratic bullshit. I now \"act dumb\" in interviews and while on the job so that when the time comes I can \"appear\" like I'm smart and constantly growing on the job. This way I can also grossly oversize my stories and not work as hard to collect my paycheck. Lol my type of social engineering, I guess. Fuck em. I keep up with new technologies by putting all my effort into my personal projects instead and it pays off while keeping me much happier.\n\nI'm not joking when I say this, but real software development died a long time ago in the corporate world..if it was ever there at all.. all that's left of it that world is those doing so in solitude, without pay and on open source projects.\n\nSorry that was kind of dark.

Had a house built in the rurals on a budget, went fully remote, and living comfortably. I’m in my early 40s and on track to have my house paid off in the next year or two (by year 5 or 6 on a 30 year mortgage) and will probably be on track to retire by or before 55 barring any unforeseen incidents. I save around 40% of my income or more every month. This is from feeling like I might never be able to retire prior to 2020.\n\nI wouldn’t say I’ve “made it,” but I’m on track and doing better than I ever thought possible, especially given the state of the economy over the course of my career the last 20 years.",

I like to make products successful. I love to make software solutions work. I love to harvest the fruits of year-long efforts that I am able to bring from start to finish. From a small idea to the big thing that changes the lives of many people. It makes me smile on the inside when I'm sitting on the train and see the person next to me use stuff that I've been responsible for. Because I like to make a difference.\n\nThe same goes for leadership. In the early parts of my career, I had terrible bosses (like most people have). Some of them were tyrants. Others were people pleasers. I regard both as wrong. So I went more and more into leadership to give engineers a place that is great to work at. Where people don't burn out but at the same time, it's not about the work itself but about results. Where people who love to learn feel most welcome, while people who want to be stars get continously pushed to the sidelines. Building such an environment and seeing it all work out is again something that motivates me - because like above, it makes a difference to quite some people.\n\nSo what makes me enjoy my job? Mainly that I have the autonomy to do these things as well as the trust from the owners. That I get appreciation for what I do and that it's not taken for granted. And that the products are something that actually matter and are not something immoral or borderline criminal.\n\nIt's all I could have ever asked for.",

Especially with hard problems, my brain wouldn't shut down at night and kept solving the issue. It was exhausting.\n\nDo I enjoy talking? Hell no. I just got more and more accustomed to it up to a point in which I just do what needs to be done and don't think about it anymore\n\nSame goes with leading - I never felt that I should do it, but it became harder to overlook that people were listening to me and following me. That I was able to inspire people\n\nI never was like this stereotypical leader that gives these huge rally speeches where everyone cheers. But more like a translator that is able to give people a sense of purpose, a clarity, an understanding of the world around them. Why sales is doing stuff that they hated. Why nobody ever appeared to listen to their suggestions. Why certain decisions were made.\n\nSo, it just kind of clicked together and even when I tried to stay in engineering roles, within a few months I'd always end up in some kind of leadership position again, either with or without a title. And with time and maturity I accepted it that this was apparently where I would bring more value to an organisation than I ever could as an individual contributor.\n\nSo, as for the 200 people - I'm lucky that I have a good memory - one of the perks of being neuro diverse. And I care about each and every one of them. Think about it: if you are a football fan, how many footballers do you know by name? If you care, would you be able to know at what club they're at? What successes they've had? What they're good and bad at? It's like that. I'm the biggest fan of each and every of our employees. I genuinely believe that most people in management give a rat's arse about people.\n\nOne final thing that just came to mind, where I have the feeling you may have a wrong picture: it's not su much about your own talking. It's about the listening. Everyone can and does talk, but it's harder to just actively listen without thinking of what to reply.",

Still, I worked for several years in my local country. On 2018 I started reading about remote work, it wasn't a thing in my country. I even got a remote offer from an argentinian outsourcing company which at that time I just used to get a salary increase of like $300 extra per month :D . On 2020 I made the decision and accepted an offer from the same company. COVID hit, I got unemployed 4 months later, after being in my local job for more than 4 years and good salary (for my country).\n\nI started studying more other techs (worked with Java at that time), and learned about NodeJS, got certified, got another remote job with a startup as a contractor. Since then I have been hopping a bit between jobs, staying like 2 years in average on each job. Also I have been overemployed a couple of times. That helped me maximize my income a lot. First time I took a second job, I paid off a very small house we were living ($100K of debt off) with my family.\n\nAfter that I became more ambitious and wanted to have a nice home for my kids, with a garden (our \"garden\" in our previous house was a 2mt2 concrete square), a garage where something more than a compact car would fit, bedroom for visitors, etc. So I found a house for a quarter of million USD which here is kind of a luxury, nice neighborhood, etc. That was 3 years ago. Currently I have been overemployed for more than2 years, and I'm striving for getting that second mortage paid off by EOY.\n\nAt the same time I just bought an apartment for investment of $200K which I will start renting, as well as my first house. My goal is to buy another property in a couple of years and strive for paying those mortgages quick by using their rental income plus money I'm generating right now, that would give me around $1M in properties.\n\nI'm not smart engineer, I struggle having kids and family and 2 jobs, juggling everything, but I'm pushing to pull the plug of a second job by EOY, and then relax and enjoy life while building our future. So I can say we have made a lot, thanks to making an extra effort these las 6 years.",

I tried the startup world as well and even though I got lucky there, I don't miss the endless death marches. It did teach me a lot about actually shipping software and seeing everything that happens behind the scenes when a company goes from ~10 employees pre-launch to being a multi-billion $ company.\n\nI also enjoy writing software regardless of whether I'm being paid for it, but my hope with my most recent project was to see if I could do it while also having it provide a source of income. In 2024 my friend and I started our own company and figured we'd just start building things that we personally needed and eventually build up a portfolio of these sorts of projects.\n\nI'd say we've been pretty successful so far, given that our first product has a somewhat niche client base (can look through my comment history for info), but we have enough paying users to continue working on it full time so we're just running with it. We've also had other startups reach out to us for consulting/contract work to help them build systems similar to what we're currently building.\n\nMy hope is to eventually make enough where we can start hiring other like-minded people since our biggest bottleneck right now is that there's just two of us.",

Very smart guy, but when stressed he gets angry and often lashes out by being overly critical, nitpicking, and bitching about coworkers.  He expects others to \"just know\" things they could not possibly have known and to remember everything they've ever been told.\n\nMost mornings I come in to 5-10 Slack messages on a variety of topics.  Some are actually important.  Others are pointing out some super minor thing which could've been done better.  It's as if he has no ability to decide *not* to point out some minor flaw or sub-optimal code when it doesn't matter.  I then get more of these messages throughout the day.\n\nFor example, he recently chatted me complaining that a coworker had refactored something to `if (x > y || x === y)`, complaining that they could've just done `if (x >= y)`.  This is of course true, but in my opinion it warrants zero attention.  If it bothers you that much, just clean it up later.\n\nHe just can't help but get in jabs and snark at every opportunity.  It's much worse when he's stressed, and that is often.  I think he has a need to prove how smart he is despite being like fifty years old.  He is important to the company.  If he weren't, I think he might've been let go a long time ago.\n\n**How do you guys deal with someone like this?**  I don't want to make waves, but this guy is negatively affecting my quality of life and enjoyment of the job.  I realize this isn't strictly related to software engineering, but I imagine this isn't exactly uncommon in our field.  Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n**EDIT:** Many thanks to those of you who gave thoughtful replies.  To the rest of you, please decide amongst yourselves what color to paint the new bike shed.",

Only reply to things you want to engage with and conveniently fail to notice the other parts. If you care about this coworker and want to help them, then I recommend trying to have a direct conversation about it.\n\nI was doing it because I cared about the job and wanted things to be better and found it frustrating that the things I wanted to prioritize weren't important to management. I thought other people felt the same way and sought validation. Some people responded with validation and their own remarks. Others did initially while others did not at all. I kept sending those things to the people who did engage and stopped sending them to the ones who didn't.\n\nYears later I finally noticed the pattern of people getting weirdly not responsive and bosses criticizing my demeanor and made the connection, but too late for my reputation and relationships.\n\nWhat would have helped me is someone pulling me aside and explaining that no matter how I felt about it or what I meant by it, the way people perceive it is as you describe. It's unwelcome negativity that they don't want to engage with. Finding ways to channel those thoughts and turn them into something people want to hear is the best way forward from an office politics perspective. If they can't be reached on that or say they don't care then they aren't ready to learn (and may never be).",

When I started he was my boss, and though that's no longer the case he is still pretty senior to me at the company in terms of years.  I regret feeding into the grumbles now.

What he's complaining about doesn't seem integral to the company or anyone's job function or anything actually getting done, he's using you as a vent-box. Worse, a vent-box for inconsequential nitpicking. \n\nYou don't have to tolerate that and it is entirely your place to put your foot down and say (in nicer words, probably) that this is negatively affecting you and you need space. \n\nAnd if that doesn't work... then it is very much your boss's problem if you are leaving this job due to the negative nancy. Maybe the company will learn (or maybe not) if it loses several engineers in a row and holds onto the important-but-tough-to-tolerate human. Personally I have seen at least one instance where someone who completely tanked team morale with lack of empathy coupled with negative charisma was let go, it's a possibility.\n\nYou have infinite patience, seems.

I doubt anyone is going to manage it for you, and the first step in resolving that work relationship is being direct. I personally wouldn’t hope to wait for someone to fight my battles for me so to speak. \n\nIt’s possible he responds to it negatively. But to be honest the idea of him responding to it negatively is probably worse than it would be in reality. If you are simply direct, there is no ambiguity about how you’re interpreting his intent, and to be frank it simplifies how you interact with him in the future. Once you’ve tried a genuine attempt to address it, if his outlook is negative it becomes quite literally your boss’s job. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries for communication around your job. If it’s negatively impacting you, it’s bad for the company. There’s nothing wrong with expressing that sentiment. And if you cannot get support from your boss after expressing that respectfully, then the company is failing you at that point. \n\nI don’t want to be reductive but it really is as simple as “hey man, I’ve gotta be honest - sometimes you ask my opinions on details that I’m super not invested in. I get you are passionate and care about the details, but sometimes it comes off as a little negative. I have a lot on my plate and it can be a little overwhelming. If you could, give me a little space if it’s not critical to the sprint or easily resolved without my input. Thanks for trying to be open with me on how you feel, though”.",

Let's address these issues at a later time\" then immediately disengage.\n\nI have people like this in my family: the emotion, the fear and feeling of losing control, then the lashing out at whoever around them they think will take it. It's toxic, but you can't fight back like most bullying: you need to stay calm, not get give them the reaction they are looking, and disengage when you risk elevating. When you engage emotionally, or fire back that brilliant zinger you could only have thought of 5 mins later, it gives them the justification that rewards the behavior: \"see? this is a problem\" and continues the loop.\n\nYou never, ever, want to let an idiot drag you into the mud. They beat you with experience and then you're covered in mud. For instance, if you get 5 slack message when you turn on slack, only respond to the ones you actually need to respond to. Let the unimportant ones go without a response.\n\nFinally, and this is the trickiest/hardest thing, you need to consider bringing in a manager to curtail the worst of the behavior. Document instances where your co-worker is making people uncomfortable, where they are acting in a way that goes against team interests, when they are degrading teammates to multiple people, et cetera. Then, bring it up softly with a manager in a 1v1, \"the project is going well, but I'm having difficulties dealing with X, I was wondering if you could help me navigate the situation\". If/when they bite, hit 'em with the receipts, but frame it as \"I'm having difficulty dealing with this, here's what I did, what do you think?\".\n\nBringing problems to management works best not as a complaint, but when it's a problem that threatens the productivity or good management of the team only they can solve.\n\nFinally, if you have the instinct to \"fix this guy\", my experience with that is very, very poor. This is an issue of emotional processing, regulation, and impulse. That's a therapy \"examine your life\" and \"learn coping strategies\", but it's also way outside the corporate bounds for a teammate. **Treat them like they'll never change, contain the blast radius, and build the case for management to solve.**",

I think software development culture can be a bit emotionally mute at times, or attracts those sorts of personalities (you can see it in this comment section even), but someone being a snarky asshole, even if they're a correct asshole, is just pain miserable to deal with. It's not necessarily to create the change they want, and it has serious morale cost.\n\nI can tell you how I usually handle this OP. This assumes the individual is very snarky, talking bad about other devs to me regularly, **they have real power while I am disposable**, and most importantly **I absolutely do not trust them with a direct adult conversation on it**. Oh, and also I feel like I've built up some rapport/good will with this person. These are the types of things I'd say to them, usually using humor/suggestion to indirectly say something to them:  \n  \n**1)** If I think I can sort of \"solve their problem\" and thus get them to shut up about it, I will half suggest it innocently, while validating their frustrations. Ex:\n\n*\"You ever thought about using a linter? We had one at another job, it'd often flag stuff like this, could save us the headache\".* Maybe something else like *\"I know we use contractors so it feels like we can't trust their code either... seriously, this is what linters are made for, haha.\"*\n\nBonus points if you act unsure about it, they'll convince themselves it was their idea to actually lock it in, which will make them more likely to go for it.\n\n**2)** If I don't like the disrespectful way they're talking about our mutual coworkers, especially behind their back:\n\n*\"What's this? Another roasting of \\[coworker\\]'s code for breakfast?* 👀*sometimes I wonder who you go to about my mistakes\"*  (Gameplan: Imply that I see him fundamentally as someone who talks crap about people behind their backs)\n\n*\"Lol I feel like the editor to your pull request feedback\"* (a) You should be putting these in a PR, not to me. b) You do this a lot and I'm calling out the pattern.)\n\n*\"Maybe we should be calling this stuff out in the dev channel? It could be useful feedback for the other devs to see\"* (Gameplan: trick him into openly showing his hostility to where upper management can see it and turn others against him. Or get him to basically admit he's not willing to say things like this in front of others because he knows he's being a jerk)\n\n**3)** I find it annoying/tiring:  \nVery limited responses/disengage.

      "text": "I’m a relatively new tech lead (2 years). I’ve been programming \\~14 years, professionally \\~9. On past projects I’ve led small teams successfully and had good relationships with clients and stakeholders.\n\nI’m now leading a new project for a large client. Team is 5 devs (including me). I’m running into a pattern with two developers that is making delivery and team coordination difficult:\n\n* Dev A (\\~10 YOE) is very strict about process and refuses to pick up work unless the task is documented to a certain standard, even for small changes. He debates most requests and decisions, and frequently escalates disagreements to our CDO instead of discussing with me first.\n* Dev B (\\~4 YOE) initially collaborated well, but over the last \\~5 months has started mirroring Dev A’s behavior: pushing back on many decisions and also escalating to the CDO/PM without raising concerns with me first.\n\nA few concrete examples:\n\n1. **CI quality push / fixing backlog** I added additional automated checks to CI and it surfaced \\~100 minor issues on main (small style/typing/lint-level problems). I asked the team to spend \\~1 hour at the start of the day to clear them so we can keep main clean.\n\n* Dev A refused.\n* Dev B said “ok” but didn’t participate, then complained to PM/CDO that it was wasted time. The rest of us cleared it in \\~1 hour.\n\n1. **TypeScript organization convention** Coming from C++ I suggested we keep types/interfaces in dedicated files separate from runtime logic (types-only file + logic file). I thought it was a small convention preference. Dev B escalated to the CDO saying this approach is “bad” and makes the codebase hard for others to understand. He didn’t raise it with me first.\n2. **Delivery crunch / visibility** During a sensitive delivery period, Dev A and Dev B didn’t push WIP or give end-of-day status updates. I needed to assemble a demo/status for the PM and asked for EOD updates + more frequent progress updates given the timeline. This also got escalated, and turned into a larger meeting with the CDO.\n3. **Constant debate slows delegation** With Dev A, nearly every task or PR comment becomes a debate, to the point where I’ve started avoiding delegating to him and end up fixing issues myself to keep momentum (not sustainable). This pattern was discussed in a recent team + CDO conversation, but I’m not confident it will change.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand / get advice on:\n\n* Is this level of skip-level escalation and refusal to execute reasonable lead direction “normal,” or is it a clear team/process problem?\n* What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n* What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n* In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n* Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nContext: Dev A has \\~10 YOE, Dev B has \\~4. We’re under delivery pressure, and the repeated escalation is creating thrash and eroding trust.\n\nHow would you handle this, both short-term (deliver) and long-term (team norms)?",

He might change his own opinion based on the feedback from others and consistently makes excellent, collaborative and well-informed decisions.

Strategic silence is when your top contributors realize that their opinions are never heard or considered, their ideas are discarded.  Rather than being rewarded for their independent genius and experience, they will come to understand that they will be rewarded and succeed at the company by just doing whatever they are told. You will end up with a team of code monkeys who will never go out of their way to do anything proactive, and the top people who are actual geniuses will leave.\n\nEdit: my entire professional leadership life has been guided by WWPD: What would Picard do?",

You absolutely have to bring your team along. Especially your senior devs. It is NOT your mission to have all your engineers act as personal minion extensions of you doing things exactly how you would have done them if you were the IC. You explicitly have to let go that mentality, which is a common mistake new managers make. Your job is to make the team deliver as a whole. And sometimes (a lot of times really) that will mean allowing the people actually doing the work to do it their way, even if it’s not how you would have done it, as long as the the outcome ends up the same. (And the outcome is the team delivery, not the specific code written). You need to learn when you need to step in and pull tank and when to just step back and let people do it their way. It’s fine line to walk but that’s basically the entire job as a lead. \n\n(Eg your whole let’s reorganize the TS files because that’s how you were used to it in C++ land.

You’re applying a pattern from a radically different language to a codebase that had already existed for a while without even discussing whether that pattern should apply to THIS language in the first place based on common usage, involving the people who built in the first place in the decision, and evaluating exactly whether it’s worth the time in the first place against all the work that has to be done.

Instead of forcing your team to manually fix these issues, you should have gotten team buy-in on an automatic, in-editor linter.\n\nFor the other issues, it's harder to tell who's the one being difficult. If you're just going in and changing someone's PRs because you don't agree with coding style or something, that's asshole behavior. But constantly debating your PR comments is also not good behavior.  You should have, early on, when this behavior first started, opened up a conversation about Code Review conventions that you could all agree to follow. There's lots of good writing about this online. Solicit your team's input about code review processes. Make them part of the decision making. Share some reading. Consider your own tone in the comments - are you telling people they're wrong, or starting a conversation about the best approach?  Etc. \n\nShort summary, you're leading a team, not driving a fleet of computers.  Treat it like a team. Don't force top down decisions unless you absolutely have to, and if you do have to, find ways to soften the impact (like introducing an automated linter instead of making them clean things up manually)",

But you need a way for them to speak out their concerns. That happens in retrospectives and 1on1s. Without a safe space to do so, minor annoyances can build up to resentments. What starts out as professional differences can end up very personal\n\n> * In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n\nAll of those you mentioned works. But for this case, i feel 1on1s are the best move for you because i dont think you know where they are coming from. What are their goals and motivations? What do they not like and avoid? Can you work with those and align them to the company goals? Or do you need to manage them out?\n\n> * Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nThey sound reasonable. But given enough context, they may not be. \n\nBut i think the issue is more than that. If i’d have to guess given the limited info, i’d say you’re a boss not a leader. \n\n> How would you handle this, both short-term (deliver) and long-term (team norms)?\n\nKnow your people.

Great that you got a bunch of developers to focus on busy work for your little win - but that’s not a win for your team, it’s a win for you. \n\n_Pick your battles._ it reads a lot like you are trying to establish yourself and not recognize you are (potentially) pissing people off instead of listening to them (we are forced to make assumptions here, in regards to your attitude/presentation, to your coworkers, so it’s absolutely possible I am off-base!)\n\n•\t⁠What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n\nIf my lead is an asshole - I would have zero concern escalating. Especially if they argue minor technical fixes being a big enough priority of other work during a technical time crunch. Again - fix what you can on your current task (running a linter), or add it to the backlog for when your team has a slow period in the year to hit some maintenance (usually around the holidays, at most places I have worked, YMMV)\n\n•\t⁠What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n\nThis goes back into not knowing you/your team. We have one-side of this. I’d take this to your CDO and ask them how you can improve yourself and your relationship, and seek some critical feedback, and NOT take it personal. Listen, reflect, plan with your CDO and/or team until you all are on the same page. \n\n\n•\t⁠In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n\nI’m torn on this, because it feels like “I’m trying to build my fiefdom” and less “trying to make business impact.” Again, the problem _may be you_ so throwing more meetings on a calendar will not make your devs more likely to understand you or not be irritated. \n\n•\t⁠Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nA lot of these are _nice to haves_ and also can be incredibly productive. BUT there is a time and a place, and you’re coming in late. You said “we knocked it off in an hour” without those two devs. That’s still a win, so instead of “I wanted EVERYONE to focus on this” you could’ve presented “I would like to hammer this out soon, if anyone had a moment” and get a group that is interested in doing the work. \n\nThen those devs that want to focus on their work? They can focus on it. Devs that want to focus on linting/maybe learning something? They can volunteer for it. \n\nMaybe you knock it out in an hour, maybe a couple days of one hour morning lint sessions. But this way, it’s less abrasive. \n\nI feel like you WANT to be a leader, but you’re still figuring out how to lead _the team you have._ You want them to be a certain way, instead of playing the hand you are dealt. Welcome to leadership - you need to work on compromise, communication, and recognizing that if people have a problem with you, it’s a learning moment for you to either “be more firm” or recognize “time and a place, focus on battles you can.”\n\nJust my two cents.",

Doing nothing is not an option.\n\nThat's your job to communicate. If you don't have devs willing to take on things as they come up, then you need a way of delegating fairly amongst the group. I usually establish a rotation for that kind of stuff. Your stand-up is a good opportunity to see who's got capacity and that's when new, ad-hoc sprint tasks need to be discussed and assigned.\n\nI am all for pushback on unfinished, unscoped, or work lacking designs where appropriate, but not every task needs to be perfectly fleshed out before it's started. The developer should be tasking on the ticket anyways otherwise it's just bashing their head against a wall. The development process should involve clarification and discussion with design/product where necessary.\n\nSometimes I'm given a task and I believe there is a better approach, if you work for a team that isn't receptive to feedback or responsive to suggestions, I would find a better team.

Also, you randomly time-boxed the exercise ? It sounds like you got in the way there more than you helped. You could have done this far better by saying \"Hey folks, I've managed to strap together a little CI improvement so next week I want us all to carve out the morning on Thursday to address some of the issues. Some of them you will think are non-issues, which is fine, I just want to adjust our linter to follow some more idiomatic practices. I'll of course be helping and I've already fixed some of the issues. It lives in this branch which I've made a draft PR of here if you want to see it before Thursday.\"  In my example, I don't assign work to anyone that I am not willing to do myself.

If someone asked how long I would have said \"well, I'm willing to spend an hour or two on it, do what you are comfortable with\".    \n     \n - The organising types into files thing is small potatoes and from the sounds of it you did not pick up on the team resenting you for putting crap on their plate, so they just saw that as yet another fuck you / my way or the highway from the team lead. The fact that he didn't raise it with you in my head, it's probably your fault. You should be going out of your way to make yourself approachable and it doesn't sound like you have done much to win over the hearts and minds of your team members.\n     \n - Regarding the delivery crunch, you should have pushed back against that. EOD updates is unreasonable if there is already a standup. It can help but again, judging by the communication style you have put across here I would not be surprised if you messed that up.\n     \n - The constant debate from Dev A is just him rejecting you based on demonstrably poor leadership skills.

Find items that are provably upgrades from the status quo and do those first. Thank your team for their efforts, shower them with praise. Doing so will build up capital that you can expend when you find a hill worth dying on.    \n - If you are supposed to be managing these people, you should be having one to one meetings regularly, you should try to understand them as people first and from there you try to insert yourself as a mentor.    \n - Honestly none of the things you want to do are bad. You have just wrapped them in an attitude that does not jive with your team. You should have spent your first few months figuring out who those fiery personalities are, setting expectations with your manager, and then after you have some wins under your belt, you start influencing the direction.

Doesn't scale, can't maintain, doesn't do xyz, etc.\n\n3. rather than fix the issue (if there even is one), a proposal is made to create a new in-house version. Sprinkle in buzzwords like \"design for xyz from the ground up\" or whatever\n\n4. create a silly MVP in record time\n\n5. realize you over-promised and under-delivered when \"everything else\" is not going in the same velocity as the silly MVP. Hire more goons. The goon in step 2 gets promoted\n\n6a. after throwing more money / devs at the problem, we reach \"maturity\" where we have the same useability as before and we get back to step 2.\n\n6b: project gets transferred to a different manager, also interested in empire building by increasing ops. This manager protects this pos project because it guarantees headcount.\n\nEveryone knows this and everyone follows along. Is it like this for other folks in larger tech companies?",

However, I realize I’m new here and no one really knows me yet. Also I want the senior engineers to drive and own this. \n\nThe current implementation of one of these apps uses a rather niche set of tech. One of the desired goals is to get off that and onto something more widely supported. Another is to address a bunch of shortcomings in logic and observability, consolidate logic spread across several applications. \n\nIn some initial talks with the most knowledgeable senior engineer, they wanted to keep using that stack so that development could go faster, by ostensibly being able to reuse already developed code. This team has been under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things fast, so I get that, but those shortcomings got in there by not being thoughtful about adding features.\n\n  \nSo all this is set up to get some advice on how to convince the team to move to a more supported platform. It will take longer, but if there is an opportunity to improve things, why stick with an already subpar experience?",

Chesterton, emphasizing that hasty reform without understanding the why behind existing structures can lead to worse outcomes, urging reformers to first discover the original logic before suggesting removal.\n\nDespite the hit or miss mature, this is why I follow this sub.

This team has been under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things fast, so I get that, but those shortcomings got in there by not being thoughtful about adding features.\n\nThat sounds like a good starting point to convince them if switching stacks is really the correct move. Show, don't tell, that the new tech stack would allow them to keep doing that. Maybe see if there's a way to slowly convert it (with language bindings, IPC, whatever it's hard to say from the lack of details) and demonstrate why and how it's better.

It is something that many people moving beyond the senior engineer don't fully appreciate. \"But, but, I'm even more senior now?\" - \"Sure, but you have no power.\"\n\nYour impact is achieved through influencing. There are broadly two ways you can achieve this:\n\nThe first one is to gain respect. You actually deliver substantial value, contribute impactful ideas and change, make things better, tackle low hanging fruits, roll up your sleeves and ship some code together with a team, etc. You need to build credibility, before people will accept you as a leader. \n\nOr, you can go complain to the VP or CTO, play the political game, convince them that your idea is the right one. They may (or may not) accept it and then mandate it and tell everyone to effin do it what you are saying. \n\nBut landing a new role in a new company and just assuming that people will do what you tell them because you says so (and who says that you are not the one that is wrong?), that is going to burn you out. \n\nAs a side note: many people have died on the hill of tech stack changes and rewrites.

Worst thing you can do as a new senior joiner, is spending 9 months rewriting a tech stack, and the team has no business value to show for (i.e. shipping a new revenue generating thing), to (from the business point of view) end up in the same place as you were before.

It took about two years, and extended beyond my time there (I was one of the drafted-in engineers to expand capacity).  Fortunately the business was privately owned, understanding and had a high revenue burst to support this as well as a market glut of developers - it was basically a perfect storm.\n\nIf your team's already being pushed to get things done \"fast\" (IE, not necessarily with code quality as top priority) and it's resulting in bad code, then adding renovation to the workload is *not* going to improve things.  It's not going to make you popular either.  You might say you aren't there for a popularity contest but that's bravado - unless you have illicit photography or a firearm, \"popularity\" goes with \"political capital\".\n\nYou can probably get it done if it's really important, but you *have* to have to resource to get it done, at the time it's getting done.

How it plays out depends heavily on the culture at the company and the actual expectations of your role.\n\nFor example, maybe they said \"try to get people to modernize\" but if it doesn't happen that's okay. In that environment you should focus on helping teams with whatever they're doing and building credibility with them. That's how you gain influence. Not technical arguments.\n\nYou can do some proofs of concept yourself that show how the new stack can provide value. Get people excited about the new capabilities. Then after all of that setup, work directly with whoever sets priorities and schedules to make room for modernization projects. Have them erase any perception that doing this work is in conflict with the team's priorities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's in your quarterly goals to see progress on modernizing the stack. And your performance is going to be evaluated based on that. In that environment, you need to learn to make your goals visible and telegraph to people that you're going to make these things happen. You don't ask. You just give them lots of room to get used to the idea and lots of help to prepare for it.\n\nYou still need to do all of the work of gaining credibility by helping with whatever the team is doing. That's a given in any scenario. But in this case it helps to counteract the bad taste that comes with telling them that you have authority to put things on their priority list.\n\nLearning how to navigate this isn't easy. Sometimes it will result in rising tensions. It helps if your manager backs you up. It really helps to make sure you are surfacing any wins from making the necessary changes. Maybe systems are easier to maintain. A certain project took way less time because the team was able to use the modern stack. Some incidents were quickly resolved due to the improved observability. Try not to be obnoxious, but be very loud with your wins so people don't just question whether any of it matters.",

When things are not clearly standardized, then it can come across as a subjective and potentially \"unfair\" decision where politics and ass-kissing might appear to have more influence than objective merit.\n\nIt's also important that leadership gives each developer fair opportunities to practice and demonstrate whatever requirements are required for promotion. This can give objective evidence to say \"yes, you achieved this expectation\" or \"no, you didn't quite meet this one so let's work on it before you can be promoted\".\n\nBasically, if you and the organization have been doing your part fairly then it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone about who is being promoted and who is not.",

          "text": "There are three aspects to a promotion in a healthy organization.\n\n1. Does the employee demonstrate sustained performance against the job ladder at the next level? The purpose of this is to make sure that we don't promote someone on the basis of a unusually strong performance and then discover that they cannot sustain that. Common organizational failures around this include the lack of a published and consistently used job ladder, and turning the sustained performance into a \"time in grade\" requirement, rather than \"do we think we'll have to manage someone out for not performing at the promoted level\".\n\n2. Is there a business need for someone at that level on this team? Often, this is handled with the first question (after all, how were they performing at L+1 if there wasn't a need for it), but sometimes the project that demonstrated their actual performance level was a one off and there won't be a sustained need. Common organizational failures here revolve around not planning to help the employee move to a team where their skills are needed. Common management failure here involves not telling someone that their growth is capped on this team, even if that means they need to leave the company.\n\n3. Promotion budgets. There is after all, a limited pool of money, so sometimes the question turns into \"who cleared the bar by the largest margin\". The biggest organizational failure I've seen involves trying to hide this fact and blaming the employee, and the second biggest is going by \"time in grade\" rather than by performance.\n\nNote that none of these involve how many years of experience someone has. If they did, we could avoid all sorts of work by just going by that number. If people have that expectation, it needs to be something they are taught isn't real. If by some chance it is real in the organization, you should be interviewing around to get out.\n\nThe best time to have had these conversations was at last year's performance review cycle. The next best time is now. And again, it isn't \"Do this and get promoted\", because that isn't in your power. It is \"you need to clearly demonstrate these ladder attributes for L+1, let's sit down and see which ones we can show that you have met, and which ones we still need to show you can do\".",

They also have a R&D team which includes one person who has been writing Python code, including some tools that have made it into production. Please understand that I have nothing against this person when I say that it is impressive how bad their code is considering they have access to ChatGPT. The first tool of theirs that I refactored had whole chunks of code that were never actually executed (unbeknownst to them) and I would place it at a level below a junior dev, more someone who has just started learning Python.\n\nRefactoring their code has been super time consuming, because it involves a full re-write. To try and minimise how painful this is, I have tried to implement some standards that I have asked them to stick to for new projects. Originally these were\n\n1. Use GitLab for version control.  \n\n2. Use our repository templates which enforce ruff chucks (we’re using uv) and a minimum pytest coverage of 70%.\n\nFor context, they have some GitHub experience but only pushing to a repository, not anything to do with branches and code reviews. I have created documents with the exact commands and explanations for concepts such as branching plus taken them through it on multiple calls. \n\nAnyway, to cut a long story short, they continue to develop code locally to extremely poor standards. I have escalated this up to the CTO who is completely on my side, and he has spoken to this R&D person’s manager. Unfortunately, their manager wasn’t happy we were brought in as he feels like we’re stepping on his toes, so he does not enforce the new standards at all. \n\nMy question is, has anyone got any advice at all about how I can win these people over? I am very willing to put in the time to up-skill people, but it is just flat out resistance at every turn. The worst bit is in a call they agree with me, but then they don’t do anything. \n\nApologies slight rant but really would love suggestions. ",

Software engineers do software engineering things. Writing, deploying, maintaining, and being responsible for production systems is a software engineering thing, not an R&D thing.\n\nWhen marking out boundaries, it's very tempting to focus only on the harm others are doing, but you cannot do this. You need to start this conversation by sitting with your manager and possibly the CTO and developing a full understanding of the value of R&D to the org, and in particular the value that this individual brings. Because there's already been friction, you need to lay this on pretty thick. (I mean, in all likelihood, this person actually is invaluable to the business, otherwise they wouldn't be paying him and giving him this kind of leeway in the first place.)\n\nThe goal here is not to limit what any individual or department can do, it's to maximize what the org as a whole can do, and that begins by understanding what everyone's bringing to the table and how best to leverage it. Frankly, this is work your manager and CTO should be doing, but since they seem unable to manage it, you can get the ball rolling.\n\nIn this conversation, you need to explain your own team's value as well, and how you need ownership of your area of responsibility just as R&D requires ownership of the realm they play in. That means you need to control production quality if you're responsible for it. If you can't do that, then you cannot own it either, and you're unwilling to carry the pager for any part of the system R&D is pushing code to. Again, this isn't territorial pissings, you're justifying this by pointing out that it's literally your job description and expertise to maintain these systems, and the org shouldn't *want* R&D doing this work.\n\nAgain, you can't focus the discussion entirely on what's wrong, but you need to also create a happy path. Explain how things should ideally work. Maybe you create a playground env where R&D can do whatever they want and once they've proven out a concept, they can push requirements into your dev process where you'll write code, make sure it's fully tested, deployed in a standard way, etc.\n\nClearly, R&D is hearing your objection as unreasonable, which means they think you are trying to limit what they can do, or you are trying to do their job yourself. You have to really listen to these objections and take them seriously so you can figure out where the disconnect is and assuage those fears. You need to work with them to understand how your teams can work together so you're both able to do your jobs within your own areas and everyone is clear on what the boundaries are and happy with it.",

Also versioned data is important and often ignored (though versioning on s3 buckets can sometimes be enough rather than stuff like dvc).\n\nIt really depends on what the stuff they're working on is and how it's structured. \n\n\"R&D\" can cover a lot, and the assumption a lot of comments here have of ivory tower data science teams that only ever touch notebooks are at the far end of the scale. \n\nWhen you get people who're used to yoloing that stuff (to quote a former colleague \"we don't need to know if it works, we're still doing the science\") but what they're working on takes them outside of that bubble you get stuff like this, but it's also possible for people who fall into it to make some utterly garbage utilities, libraries, etc. that are just \"new ideas\" but really just normal software that should be up to regular standards before any kind of handover.\n\nIf it's something else that isn't data science and notebooks, then your suggestions are more reasonable. I think the code coverage percentage might be way too high for an opening move, convincing people to test their shit requires more carrots than sticks. You'd probably have more luck setting that as a really crappy low level, and focus on trying to get people to make it part of their workflow by going down the education, arm around the shoulder route, though it's a challenge because of the automatic defensiveness people like that get.",

They eventually started using git.

I moved all our internal tooling from manually compiled GUIs apps to web services where possible. Same functionality but deployment is quite a lot easier to control and lock down. \n\nIts a bit harsh, but if you simply cannot deploy your work without your methods, people have to comply. Of course you can do this in phases. i.e. allow for deployments without passing the test coverage. Atleast for us this was a major point, since the test coverage of our team was 0% when I started.",

Our afchitecture and hard skill topics are being alternatief with more and more softer topics.\n\nOne of which I would appreciate some perspectives from others in Staff+ roles. The discussion is about how do we coach your Senior engineers be ready, possibly even joyful about the years to come. In our group we agree that management/company expectations will be to vastly increase productivity/efficiency by X times. At the same time they'd ideally do that without an X time growth in headcount. We all know the typical magic bullets that will solve this.\n\nAnd it is not just efficiency. In general we feel change is changing exponentially. And we wonder what our Staff+ role is this storm of change. Change, which for some translates to excitement, for others it translates to a bit of anxiety. Both seem healthy options.\n\nAs Staff+ we want to make sure that \"our\" engineers will stay the great people they are under the stress of all this change. And coach them, provide psychological safety. Which is a bit daunting as Staff engineers are not necessarily in the chain of management, sometimes don't have any real authority at all.\n\nMy question to this group of peers is how you are approaching this topics. Do you have meetings with your seniors about the softer side of work? Do you do it in groups or one-on-one only with your mentees? What are the traits you aim to empower? How do you leverage your influence to make sure your engineers are ready for what's to come? Are there key discussions I should be having with leadership sooner rather than later?\n\nThanks for seeing this somewhat messy post through. I hope this resonates with some of you.",

My understanding is that efficiency gains are going to be more difficult to get and that implementing AI without a strategy can easily lead to productivity decrease, not gains.\n\nAt the same time I recognize the same cycles have been happening in the past. Management probably thought microservices, cloud, Agile each separately will also improve development performance by X times and yet the result are usually much more modest or even a detriment to total productivity. The biggest factor in whether the there are positive results seem to not be what kind of change is being introduced but whether people have a coherent strategy around it.\n\nMy solution is to just keep level head. I try to understand what niche, as an engineer, I am trying to occupy and what kind of skills I need to be effective in my niche. My niche is dealing with failing projects (I join projects that have huge trouble with delivering, application reliability or performance or all of above). Therefore, I decided to avoid using AI tools altogether (to confusion of my bosses) and keep my development skills sharp. At the same time I am observing how others are dealing with AI and also trying to find good, productive ways to deal with increasing use of AI within my immediate team.\n\n\\> As Staff+ we want to make sure that \"our\" engineers will stay the great people they are under the stress of all this change. And coach them, provide psychological safety. (...) My question to this group of peers is how you are approaching this topics. Do you have meetings with your seniors about the softer side of work?\n\nI think there are different sides to \"safety\".\n\nOn the most basic level, people want to know they are not in trouble and will not be jobless tomorrow. The most important tool to assure them of it is to provide them with continuous, honest feedback and to figure out a way to make sure people understand the feedback is honest. I also make sure they understand if there were problems to show up, there is various layers of help and escalation so it is not possible for them to get into too much trouble quickly or without being aware of it. We also do a lot of training so that people understand what kind of things are truly firing offenses so that they know how to steer clear of really dangerous things.\n\nSome things are outside of my control. My company could technically close our department at any time. Here, my company tries to make sure they don't do such stuff without giving plenty of heads up. For now it seems to work.\n\nSo now that you have people who are safe knowing they will have the job tomorrow, there are further levels of safety. I think what I do with my bosses is to identify those and try to figure out our strategy at each level.",

Not only this has been documented to saturation, but this is similar to what has been happening in other fields for years (automation of jobs), and even in this field (nocode or similar techs).

That's the nature of automation.\n\nThe best thing you can do as a staff is stop propagating doom honestly. Even if you don't see it, your post is full of it (for the reasons commented on the first paragraph). If you fear it that much, how could you help others with it? For everything else, it's a company-per-company thing. Your seniors will feel safe if your company doesn't make weird choices around AI.

We had a day long offsite to communicate and go through exercises on some of these changes since it sounds like our orgs are/have moved in the same direction.  In the past getting to staff was more about seniority and \"ticket punching\" and now it's based more on how you improve your team(s).  I think most people got it but some of those that had been in the org for a while were still looking for the proverbial checklist.\n\nWe have a coaching practice within our org that helped me build out these kinds of skills amazingly well.  I spent 2 years in a coaching roll that forced me to learn how to wield \"soft power\" as I put it or being able to convince teams to do what I needed without being in their chain of command.  I wasn't even under the same sr. director as them so it was even more challenging than if I was under the same director as the teams I was trying to help improve at something.\n\nIf you want people to learn this type of skill my feeling is that you have to do way more than meeting with them.  They need opportunities to learn and practice the skill.  It's such a different skill than building things.  There has to be real leadership buy-in as well where they get feedback about it and they can see it's tied to their review/compensation.  If the latter isn't the case they'll never do it.  And if it's not tied to their compensation is it really a priority?\n\nOh, and assume this will take 1-2 years to see this change happen.  Big changes like this never happen quickly.",

I tend to think Staff level engineers do about 50% coding, more testing/discovery coding of \"up and coming\" or \"alternative\" solutions and 50% meetings/etc. Though.. my experience as staff was more coding all the time being in a startup, so I tend to think my title at the time was more \"you been in the field for 20+ years.. guess we should make you the highest level \"dev\" we can before management\". Only had a few seniors and juniors in the org so we tended to rely on the seniors for about 90% coding of the hard stuff with overseeing juniors doing lower level work like CRUD, tests, etc.\n\nI would say, regarding the question.. in all honesty, assuming we figure out the stupidly fast rising needs of energy to run more and more AI.. and AI doesnt bubble \"badly\" and is here to stay (which I do firmly believe).. that there are two avenues for seniors. Either embrace AI more and more to essentially gear up to replace the need of junior/mid engineers or.. frankly.. and this wont sit well with someone in a company.. but prepare to figure out how to do your own project (ideally startup) with AI/tooling. \n\nThis is FAR from a great answer for OPs question. I think it could go several ways.. will your company keep all of the senior+ devs as AI gets better and better? You sure they are loyal to you all as well? That is partly why I gear towards learning how to try to build something for yourself so as not to help others be rich and then get shit canned cause we're all just numbers to them. Expensive ones they want to replace more and more with \"AI\".",

The staff scope is probably to float above 10 engineering teams in a part of the org. There are principals who do the same but then on a full org scale. Together they form Staff+.\n\nThank you for your level answer. i think that AI is here to stay as well. At the same time its just one of the many moving parts.

If you're wondering why a post got removed, check there first: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/wiki/index/)\n\nThe short version:\n\n**Rule 3:** If you remove yourself from the post and the question becomes meaningless, it's a personal advice request, not a discussion. We're not an advice desk. Also, if your question would work just as well on r/ExperiencedAccountants it's probably not dev-specific.\n\n**Rule 9:** \"Does anyone else...?\" posts, venting disguised as questions, single-line prompts, and stuff with no real discussion hook. Also: a post getting hundreds of comments doesn't mean it belongs here. Generic relatable content is exactly what we're trying to avoid.\n\nThe wiki has a table with good/bad post examples if you want specifics. These rules do have a moderator discretion disclaimer, so keep that in mind when you're posting.\n\nThe rules have not changed but we hope this provides a guide for posting and encouraging thoughtful discussion in this community. \n\nQuestions?

QA env (whatever they do, it's a mystery!)\n4. staging mirrored as closely as possible to prod, for testing non-code things as well (network/infra upgrades etc)\n5. prod A+B ideally with ability to upgrade one side, test it without making live, then flip to it\n6. If required a dedicated UAT, otherwise it just gets stuffed into other envs and causes friction\n\nIt's also beneficial to have other on-demand envs like stress testing, regression test testing, a process to anonymize prod data for replicating issues outside of prod.\n\nIn reality most shops I've been at just have dev and prod and it's a nightmare.",

Was a big joy when I got the concept working as I never expected the wild idea I had to actually work out the way it did! It works by slightly moving the camera and taking multiple images and blending the resulting images in such a way that the area that should be in focus, which is present in all images, is placed on top of each other. This solves the big problem screenspace depth of field effects/shaders have in that near plane blur (so something that's out of focus and in front of the subject that is in focus) in real life is transparent and basically shows what's behind the out of focus element around the edges, however in a rendered frame that data isn't available (as it's occluded by the near plane element). For instance: <https://cdn.myportfolio.com/babf9577def101884554d0d345fd30e2/65621a17-586e-47a8-93d5-dda8e700070f.PNG?h=57b216308fb69fa0aa24123ebcae395e> where you see the sword's edges are transparent and show what's behind it as that's in focus. that's not possible in screenspace depth of fields\n\nCode: https://github.com/FransBouma/IgcsConnector\nExample images and docs: https://opm.fransbouma.com/igcsdof.htm",

There's usually something getting stuck in cache and whatnot, meaning it can take between 30 to 60 minutes to switch a branch and work on something else.\n\nHow do you or would you handle this, knowing it can happen 2-3 times per day (depending on the day)?\n\n  \nP.S. for those that read: I'm not interested in speeding up the building process.

On Windows usually the load path is relative first. But if there are system paths it is using then most apps shouldnt be using them anymore and there are approaches to make it less \"system\" bound (e.g. use registration free COM).\n\nBut again, not knowing the nature of the app, it is easier said than done.",

Updating the tooling so you can customise the directory, allowing you to have separate checkouts for separate branches\n2. Digging into the caching solution to either:\n2a. Solve why things get stuck in the cache so you can switch branches more easily\n2b.

Regardless of succeeding or failing I’ve always further developed my skills to my own benefit.\n\nMy biggest thought on this whole thing, but likely too large to tackle to start with;\n - it sounds like the build server always builds all 700 projects\n - it sounds like the caching solution is not reliable\n - reducing the number of projects building significantly improves build time\n - with any change you’re likely not impacting all 700 projects\n - make the caching solution fully reliable\n - write a script which calculates the dependency graph based on a given change set\n - write a script that uses cached builds for projects that are not changing and not dependent on a project which is changing\n\nFrom learnings taken improving things locally or falling to improve things (but learning), I’d draft up my ideas for improvements (like above) and present them to management to either get the DevEx team to experiment with or get the OK to try myself (since this is not a small job).\n\nMy second advice, if you really don’t want to, is there must be other frustrating things than the build process.

On a previous project, we had a dev and build team plus a platform team that was 20+ people. It used an in house build system with custom everything. I believed the same thing until I started profiling the builds. I spent about a week on minor improvements here and there, and I brought our single file incremental build changes down from 1 minute to sub 5 seconds for the area my team worked on, and by doing the same thing in more places I brought the wall clock build time of the project down by 25%\n\nThe existing engineers are used to it.

The responsibilities change, but generally speaking, it means that I tend to be assigned to a specific team, but the expectation is that I’m doing IC work that’s broader than the scope of that team. I help with team projects… but I also step out and take a few weeks (or months) to do something to improve things for all engineers at my company. This type of role is usually something that appears at larger companies, because smaller companies don’t need random engineers who wander around making things better.\n\nThere’s a great “4 archetypes of staff Eng” article floating around, and the four are: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand. I’ve done all four, but typically, I tend to be most comfortable as a Solver/Architect — someone who sees arbitrarily large problems that no one else is/can work on, that fall in the gaps between teams. I find them, document them, make the case for why we should solve them, and then get other ICs or even teams moving as I need so that I can solve them.\n\nThere’s “senior” staff engineers, and I have generally realized that I’m not interested in that promotion. The companies I’ve worked at, that step tends to be a much bigger jump into leadership and soft touch, and away from being an IC. I pursued it pretty hard for a few years, but spending time working as a Right Hand / Lead Eng for an org with 50 engineers showed me that I _can_ do it, but don’t really find it very satisfying. I like to stay where the expectation is that I’m coding, but also that I’m doing my own thing.",

It is true that if you want to progress beyond that, you have a narrower selection of companies to work at. \n\nAs a reminder “Senior” means different levels at different companies so let me clarify - I mean someone who is a google L5 equivalent (or comparable). \n\nThis is someone capable and in charge of scoping a project, choosing tech stack, delegating to mid levels and juniors as needed (if they are even available) and ensuring timely completion of a project to reasonable technical standards taking the timeline into account.\n\nTo go beyond this, smaller companies transition immediately into executive roles because that’s just how the business functions. Some get into Director roles, VP of engineering etc. \n\nCompanies that are larger and are primarily product focused often do have IC ladders that aren’t the management track of manager, senior manager, director, VP etc. \n\nYou as an individual have to be proactively thinking and planning your career if you want to progress beyond Senior dev. and what you want that to look like. For many places, that level is terminal and you never need to promote beyond that again and won’t be expected to. You can just perform at level and won’t get laid off for that.",

Or is the biggest benefit that you're expected to meet a lot of other people in tech, so eventually you'll learn about better opportunities just because of the people you've met?\n\n\n\nI read another comment which said $150K CAD in Toronto would be similar to $200K-$250K USD to San Francisco (online calculators aren't that lopsided, but still give San Francisco a 70% premium over Toronto in terms of CoL). If that's the case, are people below the $200K threshold just not saving a significant amount of money?",

And there are a lot of people hiring. \n\nI don’t think the people are actually any smarter. I’ve worked with a lot of people from all over the country and there are some pockets. Like a lot of Seattle has worked at Amazon but they aren’t smarter. \n\nThe people who are smarter are the people who on their free time go talk more about software engineering. And they aren’t like fundamentally smarter they are just very interested so they know more. I think precovid a lot of that existed as in person meetups. And that was easier in sf, nyc, Seattle etc. but a lot of that is also available remote now. \n\nIf you intend to like actively go out, network, meet people. That will be easier in a tech hub. \n\nIf you are asking if your coworkers will be smarter. That has not been my experience. They are basically the same as anyone who is able to get that job and honestly post Covid a lot of companies make RTO exceptions for higher levels so a lot of them didn’t ever move back. At my company of our 20ish staff engineers I can’t think of a single one that works out of sf. Although we do have a lot of l3 and l4 there.",

Those companies have a smaller talent pool to pick from, and it's expensive to live in these big cities, so they'll pay a premium for the talent. You have less competition, so it's simple supply and demand.\n\nI'm currently working at a remote company anyway, but I could get a higher paying job at a big-name company by Monday if I wanted to go work in an office, and my commute would be within walking distance (SF usually has longer commute, but the logic is similar).\n\nAs some other folks mentioned, there's also the community/networking. Tech jobs often operate in bubbles. Everyone within a certain space has worked with each other at 3 different companies and are poaching/recruiting each other every time they move. Location proximity is one of the factors that help with that.\n\nThere's a difference between SF and other big cities. But just \"tech hub\" vs \"non-tech hub\" can be pretty massive difference too.",

If you're not at that level yet, I think you can still find roles that lesser known smaller startups where you will probably level up more and faster than you will elsewhere, largely because of the people you're working with. Personally I think the knowledge and experience that you absorb from your colleagues matters far more for career growth than general networking opportunities. I would say that moving to SF very likely significantly boosted my career trajectory, and I do not ever go out of my way to meet other people in tech for \"networking\".",

When I was looking for just a normal SWE opportunity she could put me in direct contact with the Engineer Mgr and we just did an in-person chat/interview. I wasn't a fit, but I just circumvented the normal application process.\n\nOne time an old coworker called me out of the blue, when i was ready to start working full time again, and she needed an engineer for a big project/team that she was now the engineering manager of. I had 0 exp (I was FE, this was a BE role) but at our previous job we had a solid working relationship. This was at a big tech company, recognizable. Instead of going through the loop, I did 1 easy algo problem with her on the phone and she hired me on the spot. She hooked me up when I really needed it and it was a great learning exp for 3 yrs, made a big impact. \n\nPeople will give you a chance, degree or not, if the person referring you is trusted/well-liked by the HM, or you just take advantage of the good relationships you've built.",

We are using Spring Boot for backend development.\n\nThe main problem is that most of my teammates, including the founder, do not have strong backend or frontend fundamentals. Almost all the code is written by heavily relying on AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. It is not AI assisted coding, but more like “vibe coding”.\n\nThe team lead uses Copilot to review PR, but even when there are serious issues he merges the code.\n\nOut of the entire team, only 2-3 people actually know how to code properly. The rest depend almost completely on AI. Because of this, the codebase has become messy. Whenever I write clean and structured code, it later gets modified by others and ends up worse than before.\n\nWith juniors, I can directly ask them not to blindly copy from AI and to understand the code they write. But I obviously cannot say the same thing directly to the founder.\n\nI am actively trying to switch jobs, but I am staying here mainly to avoid a career gap. Until I manage to switch, how can I indirectly encourage the founder to rely less on AI and think more carefully about code quality and design?",

Understand that first.\n\nCan you tie your concerns to business impact, how issues affect the founder's time, how the founder and company's goals will be impacted?  What's the actual issue here? The codebase being messy isn't really an issue, especially if an AI Agent can work around that.  Why is the codebase being messy bad?\n\nFinally, come with solutions.  Come with solutions that meet them where they are. Can you improve the way they work with LLMs?\n\n* Cursor has a \"Plan\" mode that will cause it to think more about how to implement something before doing any work.  It will ask clarifying questions and generate a plan that can be edited or iterated upon by the model itself.  This tends to yield much better results than Agent mode, which prioritizes writing code with less thinking.  If that's something that's available, encourage using that.\n\n* You can include files in the root of your repo, like [CLAUDE.MD](http://CLAUDE.MD) for Claude, that can act as a \"senior engineer in the room\" and give the Agent guardrails to produce better code.  You could actually ask your LLM to help you draft one that addresses your concerns.\n\n* Set up some kind of agent workflow that they can use to critique the solutions the other agent generates.\n\nThere are a lot of things you could do that allow them to vibe code better without slowing them down, and everyone can be happy.\n\nI would start by having a conversation with the founder, coming strictly from a place of wanting to understand their perspective on the way things are and dump a bunch of problems/complaints on them.  After you gain that perspective, instead of laying out all of the issues, you can frame stuff like \"I want to make sure we are able to continue to go to market quickly with features, but I'm noticing that we are having to stop and deal with bugs, or spend a lot of time troubleshooting why code our agents generate doesn't immediately work.  I think we could <do the things I mentioned above> to make sure we can scale up quickly.\"",

      "text": "Hello reddit experienced devs.  I am by my own admission, a pedantic ~~dev~~ person.  \"Particular\", \"fussy\", you choose the word.  \"Anal\" if you want to be a bit more blunt ;)  And, in the areas I think this is a fault and to my detriment, I would like to do better.\n\nTLDR:  I have a few years on me, and in ways I am the tech lead, but not the *team* lead.  I have a colleague who is less experienced and wired differently (surprise, surprise; we're different people).  I've observed certain behaviours and ways of approaching things from this person that both concerns and frustrates me.  I'm quite fussy, but I *have* been trying to pull that back in favour of harmony, and accept delivering at a level that is \"good enough\".  I've attempted to set up processes and standards to try and encourage certain thought processes and behaviours, and quality.  But, it's becoming harder to suppress the stress and frustration levels I feel from the kind of work I see.  Can anyone offer strategies I can try, or ways to approach this - before I damage my health and job standing?\n\n\\--\n\nI've been in dev for about 10 years total, in data engineering for the last 7.  I'm the most senior in my 2-person team of engineers, and fulfil a tech lead role.  Colleague has 3-4 YoE.  A bit over a year ago we got a new manager, who is more business-y than tech-y.  That balance has been alright, it's enabled me to step up.  For a few years now we've been extending the team with external contractors/consultants for projects.\n\nAbout two years ago, I started putting more processes in place and encouraging standardisation, such as DevOps and git, data object metadata, how we even go about developing our stuff.  Just generally trying to tighten the range of differences in implementations, documentation/context, and even quality between one product and another.\n\nBut even with writing up standard processes, calling out naming conventions, discussions during PR reviews; I still see stuff that I consider \"sloppy\".  Untidy code and files; ad hoc/inconsistent titles for PRs; context-lite commit messages and PR descriptions; annotations (descriptions) on data objects (tables, views) that are potentially business-facing with typos and are just a bit \"off\".  I think I have enough self-awareness to know some of this comes from a place of \"it's not how I would do it\", and I accept that.  But, some of this stuff could have actual impacts on quality, if not just future maintenance for someone else.  And *to me*, some of it seems implicit with being a professional developer - giving a crap about the quality of the work you do, and doing a bit to make it easier for someone else to pick it up.\n\nI've raised aspects of what bothers me with my manager; and they're on board, to a point.  But I think some of the scale is lost on them as they don't \"live\" so much in the technical design phase, and certainly not the code or the PRs.  I also find it hard to separate what matters, over what simply pisses me off.\n\nTo those who share in being pedantic, particular, or picky, to whatever extent - or to those who have successfully worked with someone with these kinds of traits - how do you make it work?\n\n\\---\n\nEDIT: A few adjustments above.  Using \"objects\" and \"annotations\" was perhaps a bad choice.  With \"objects\" I meant *data objects* like tables and views, and with \"annotations\" I meant descriptions.  And these descriptions aren't just for engineers, they're for business analysts as well.\n\nI don't expect PR titles, descriptions, and commit messages to form documentation.  I do have some measure of expectation that they make it easy to follow, at a glance, what changed, hopefully why, and from what branch to what branch changes were going.  This is one area where I think I'm nitpicking or trying to impose some dogma, and can probably be tackled a different way.\n\n\\----\n\n  \nEDIT again:  It's been a couple of days and a lot of people have already commented, so it's a late edit.  It's also a lengthy one.  I'm not a long-time redditor so I might be committing a reddit sin.  I'll make it anyway for anyone who comes by afterwards.  **Thank you for all the responses and I appreciate the perspectives.**  My mindset has shifted some in the last couple of days from my own reflection, reading through this, and some good discussion with my manager.\n\n\n\nI'm trying to let go of what is personal preference when it comes to pushing back or mandating things - pick your battles - unless it aligns with the business and team, of course.  I kinda knew this was one of the only ways to deal with the part of this that is *personal*, but it's validating that it is a common piece of advice.  For other things, I'll think about what can be automated or templated.  For the processes, standards, and conventions - it's time to review anyway, and I will push to collaborate more.\n\n\n\nThere have been a lot of comments about my mention of PRs and commit messages, and that it's generally ridiculous to think you can mandate that, or perhaps expect a certain level of quality - because people are people.  I get that.  I want to add now that these were just items on my laundry list of peeves, and not in of themselves, the biggest items.\n\n\n\nI brought up PR titles because I consider them as having value in tracking and forming history.  I write them in a certain way that makes it easier (IMO) to gather information at a glance in the Azure DevOps Repo UI.  I *encourage* (that's the word I've used) following \"my way\" for those reasons.  I don't mandate it, and I don't reject PRs for it.  If it's a PR to merge dev to main where I'm reviewer not author, when I'm in there for review, I'll tend to update the title myself if it \"needs\" it.  I'll leave an *informational* comment that I did so, with my reasons.  In that way maybe the idea spreads.\n\n\n\nI brought up commit messages because, like PR metadata I've seen from my colleague, I don't rate the messages highly for supporting history and context (by which I mean the *why* not just the *what* or *how*).  It has been commented here that PRs and commit messages aren't necessarily for holding a lot of context, because of tickets.  *Fair enough*.  However, the lower context I perceive is *not* augmented by more context in our IT ticketing system or ADO work items.\n\n\n\nOur stakeholders/internal customers raise projects/tickets with us and give us the *business* context.  From what I am across of this colleague's work, capturing *technical* context of design and development *beyond code* is generally missing.  They don't seem to be creating any or meaningful tickets breaking down a feature, which can provide context to changes.  Or if they do, they don't confidently speak to it, and it's not in a shared team space.  It makes me question a number of things.  And then, I probably start being picker about practices and PR reviews.",

We never really saw eye to eye on much of anything. But I think others on the team probably saw similarities in how fussy we were. I didn’t enjoy working with him, so I try not to be like him.\n\nThe other thing is looking back on my career, many things I’ve worked on have been failures (in my eyes, anyway). But they failed because of external factors, not code quality. Clients brought in new management who canceled projects, customers didn’t find value in a product, or worse, neither customers nor I found value in the product. Projects that sounded interesting turned out to be marketing stunts or vanity projects for some manager. Or your company gets acquired and your project gets shelved.\n\nHaving immaculate code just feels less and less important. I have colleagues (some off-shore, some not) who churn out messy code, open PRs with no description, don’t enable strict type checking, don’t foresee how things will break, and it still makes me wince.

I called out commit messages in my first post, it's one part of the laundry list yes, but it's only a part.  It seems to be being focused on in comments here.  I honestly don't expect a novel about every bit of why this commit exists, what it's doing and everything.  But, there's a whole space between \"more than necessary\" and \"nothing\" (or close to it).\n\nAnd, if there's no ticket, or whatever ticket there is does not serve much of a purpose for context?  That's another part of this, yeah.  On this I have done my bit to *encourage* using the work items in ADO.  Some months ago I asked - from a place of collaboration and mentorship, not \"wtf are you doing?\" - how do you break down this work?  \"I don't know\" was the response.  So, I started a discussion and gave examples of how I approach it.  Lack of tickets or other such things, I really can't take on myself, and I won't.  Like I said in my first post, I'm the most senior in the team, not the manager (actual team lead).  I *might* have some influence on such things, but in our team makeup, I think that's more our manager's remit, less mine.  We had a good talk about this particular topic today.",

The other day, I was coaching one of my teams new hires how I like to go through a PR and there were points where I said “I don’t like this cause it’s sloppy architecturally and it’s going become harder to maintain in the end” and there were points where I would “I don’t like this. It’s hard to read, but cleaning it up has little architectural impact and I’ve already left a bunch of other comments on this PR. You’ll learn in this job you need to pick your battles so you don’t become an insufferable asshole to your team.”\n\nMy team has a spectrum of really good developers whose code I end up praising and developers who don’t read their Claude output. Those ones frustrate me internally, but I don’t work at a tech company so I don’t feel I can hold them to such high standards.\n\nMore broadly, when the team is having a discussion and we aren’t making progress, I think back to this article that a friend of mine shared with me.

That.  You don't know what matters because you haven't been around long enough to see what matters.  You have theories right now, but haven't really seen it all play out.  \n\nI would suggest that, for most of the things you're worrying about, team consensus/agreement/alignment, is more important than \"being right\".  So, maybe ask more questions about how others think of these things and strive for alignment rather than enforcement of your principles.  Play the game as \"let's try things\" as opposed to \"this is the way\", and be the one trying things some of the times yourself.\n\nIMO, all this makes you mid-level rather than senior (which isn't a slam, it's how everyone progresses for the most part).\n\nAnd that's all I really have to say.

My role and where I'm at in my career seems weird, sometimes.  Not sure how else to state it.  Yes, in this thread I've referred to myself as \"the senior\" and \"tech lead\".  I didn't intent to misrepresent, but I probably have.  Globally, those terms will imply certain things or a certain level, which I am not quite at.\n\nAt my (non-tech) company, I've been in a position where I've progressed in time, knowledge, and responsibility.  I joined as a junior and worked alongside a senior.  He moved on a few months later.  A couple of years later, we employed a Data Architect.  He moved on after a year.  I learned a shit-ton from both of them, especially the architect.  (Edit: Thinking back he was quite prescriptive - which I probably leaned into - I'm thinking now, not necessarily the best influence if I want to avoid being \"that guy\").  The senior was not replaced with another senior, and the architect was just not replaced.  It was almost organic that I stepped up as best I could, into the gaps they left.\n\nNow, having read posts around here that discuss the kinds of things leads and seniors do, and the kinds of spaces they occupy, imposter syndrome hits.  I'd actually never come across the term \"mid\" until frequenting this and the data engineering reddit, but there ya go - I had been considering myself as some sort of \"junior senior\".\n\nAgain, thanks.

          "text": "There are two different categories of pedantry when it comes to software engineering. It's important to avoid a category error of placing a particular pedantry in the wrong bucket.\n\nThe first type is when there's an inconsequential disagreement. This boils down to a choice between different styles of doing things. You like to put open braces on the next line, I like to put them on the same line. You think your way is better because, well, I don't actually know, but my way is better because it allows more vertical density so you can fit more code on the screen and keep more things in front of you.\n\nFor things like this, it's important to have the fight, everyone says their piece, you record it in a thread or a doc linked to the style guide, and then settle it and everyone moves on. If someone has some new compelling thing to add to one of those discussions at some point in the future, you add the new bit, relitigate the decision, make it, and move on.\n\nThe main point of having these discussions is not to justify one view or the other, but rather to quickly reach a decision once new information stops being introduced. The first time you go around the room and everyone just repeats what they said the last time, you have a decision maker choose the best option as they see it, and everyone commits to that and moves forward. It's important to record because you will have some young upstart come along at some point, and it's important to be able to point them to the discussion and the decision, and make sure they know that if they don't have something new to add, the current decision stands. The rubric under which such decisions are made is: It is much more important to move forward with consistency than to make the optimal choice. (Or, the corollary option in some cases, which is to move forward while consciously not making the choice. Consistency not required, everyone can do what they think is right. Or every project can choose, but each project should remain consistent. Whatever. Move forward is the point.)\n\nThe other category is where it actually is important to make the right choice. For example, let's say that you architect a design that avoids bad and cyclic dependencies. Because dependencies transit, it's important that no module in the entire system is allowed to create a bad dependency because that is also forcing that choice onto all dependencies of that module.\n\nIf some new person joins the team and says, \"What's the big deal? I only want to form this one little dependency on this one little thing,\" that one little dependency has the potential to cause big problems, and if it becomes an example to others, things can quickly spiral. This is a different animal.\n\nFor this second category, I picked an example that's a very big deal, but in most cases of such decisions, the stakes are lower, but there is a right and a wrong answer. In these cases, it's important to group these kinds of issues by their overall impact on the system. For example, you might see certain bad choices around testing and some other bad decisions when it comes to adopting a consistent naming pattern. Fixing either one of these things might have some marginal effect on the system, but individually they are no big deal. Fixing both of them together, however, allows a deployment phase to be automated.\n\nThe wrong thing to do in this case is to argue the virtue of these things independently, *even if* you have arguments that should carry the day. The better thing to do is focus on *solving a problem*, which in this case is automating that deployment phase.\n\nThe way I think about most of these low stakes bad decisions is that they are speed bumps and potholes. If you're trying to build the autobahn and you're starting with a road that's littered with speed bumps and potholes, the impact of any one of these things is not that big. You can make a correct argument that each speed bump and each pothole should, in principle, not exist. This will move no one, especially if they come back to management and say, \"Okay, I'm going to spend all this time and effort filling this particular pothole, and we end up with a slightly better stretch of road for five feet. What's the point?\"\n\nIf you want to get traction, it's much better to discuss what the completely finished autobahn will do for the org. In this vision of things, even one speed bump is catastrophic.",

They will, out of principle, refuse to do things a certain way, irrespective of the context. For instance, when I write code, I like to write unit tests, and name things in a clear way, separate concerns, write code in a modular way. But sometimes I am working on a prototype, or a one off utility script, and therefore, spending the extra time making everything bulletproof simply isn't worth it.\n\nThe key skill to learn is to be able to both write stuff in a quick and dirty way when needed, while keeping an eye on technical debt, and cleaning up code to better standards when the cost is outweighed by the benefits.",
