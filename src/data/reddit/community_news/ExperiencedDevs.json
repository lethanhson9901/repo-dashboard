I was that guy pushing to rewrite stuff in Rust because it was trending then, wanted to use some experimental database I found on Github with 200 stars because the readme said it was web scale. Got into legitimate arguments about framework choices that in hindsight did not matter even a little bit.\n\nThen I became the person who had to fix things when they broke. Oh you wanted to try that new message queue? Cool, hope you enjoy debugging why it randomly loses messages at 2am. That distributed database you read about on Hacker News? Awesome, except now deploys take 6 hours and nobody knows why.\n\nAt some point I just got tired. Tired of explaining to product why we're three sprints behind because we're fighting our own infrastructure. Tired of being the only person who understands how some piece of critical infrastructure works because we picked something obscure.\n\nNow I'm boring as hell and I love it. Postgres? Yeah sure. Proven message systems? Absolutely. Things that have documentation written by humans who actually use the product? Sign me up.\n\nYou can still build cool shit with boring technology. Actually you can build way cooler shit because you're not spending half your time debugging your infrastructure instead of writing features.\n\nAnyway yeah, I'm officially old and boring now. My infrastructure should be so reliable I literally forget it exists. Save the excitement for the product.",

The reasons are exactly the same as why OP suggests embracing proven mature tech: reliability and predictable behavior are king.  \n\nApache, MySQL, and PHP peaked before we learned many painful but valuable lessons about webserver, DB, and framework/language design. Often their mistakes were *how* we learned -- or drove the industry moving in different directions.  Some of those problems cannot truly be fixed retroactively.\n\nIn this day and age, Postgres is better than MySQL in almost every way... and I say this as someone who has gone DEEP in MySQL and DBs in general.  Similarly the alternatives to Apache are generally stronger -- whether it's different webservers (Nginx etc) or alternative architectures such as static CDN-hosted assets + API servers or lambdas.  PHP hasn't aged quite so badly, but other mature languages are stronger on readability and encouraging maintainable practices.",

You guys realize that you're just writing random spammy SQL that will confound your database team for years to come, right? And that now you have to maintain the database schema in TWO places (in the database, and in the ORM you implement), right? And when the queries break, instead of being able to foist that job onto the database team while you work on something else, you'll have to debug both your code and the database schema just to figure out what's going on? The problem was never that SQL is difficult to deal with, the problem was that *databases* of any substantial complexity are difficult to deal with.\n\nAnd then there's AI, which I don't totally object to, but my prompts keep it very tightly controlled. Even when I do so, I find later on that it did something stupid, like create the exact same method in two different files, which I didn't notice because I only saw that the code was correct, not that it was in the wrong file.\n\nAnd then there's the infinite JavaScript frameworks, where I remember being interviewed as to whether I knew Angular.js (the original version) at the height of its popularity in 2016, and then watch its popularity decline rapidly as it was deprecated for the new version.

Another aspect is that in this situation, the only place to edit schema is in the ORM, not in any of these databases. Contrariwise, when you have several applications talking to a central database or databases, where they all need to share a common set of data, stored procedures are to be preferred, as they act as an API that enforces all consumers to be limited to valid database actions. An ORM in the later case would imply that any change to the database schema to also be implemented in the dozens of applications using the database via ORM.\n\n",

      "text": "I’m a senior software engineer at a large company with a structured promotion and calibration process. I’ve been at the company since May 2021, so I’m approaching 5 years, and I’ve never been promoted, despite my scope, responsibilities, and level of impact changing significantly over time.\n\nRecently, I was denied a promotion again. My manager said he took my case to the calibration committee, but the final decision was not to promote me now, with the justification being “lack of consistency.” What makes this harder to reconcile is that another engineer at the same level, within the same BU but on a different team, was promoted with around 6 months on the team, while I’ve been on my current team for over a year and at the company for almost five years.\n\nDuring our conversation, my manager used an analogy: someone digging with a pickaxe, very close to finding a treasure, and being encouraged not to give up now. I understand the intention behind it, but I’m struggling to trust that framing. Given my history here, it increasingly feels less like “almost reaching the treasure” and more like the classic donkey-and-the-carrot situation — where the reward is always just a bit further away, keeping you moving without real certainty that it will ever arrive.\n\nAfter that, I started considering a lateral transfer. I communicated this transparently to my manager. He said he understands, but speaking as a mentor, he believes my best chance of promotion would be to wait another 6 months and try again. He was clear that he can’t promise anything, only that he “intends to bring the case again.”\n\nI also spoke with the manager of a potential lateral transfer role and heard something similar: that if my primary goal is promotion, waiting a few more months in my current context might be my best chance.\n\nThe core issue is that I no longer trust the process. Not because I think anyone is lying or acting in bad faith, but because it feels like if there were enough real interest in promoting me now, a criterion like this wouldn’t have been the blocker. The rules seem flexible and dependent on context and people.\n\nThis has started to affect me outside of work: difficulty sleeping, constant rumination, and the feeling that I’m betting my emotional health on a vague promise.\n\nRight now, I’m torn between:\n\n\t•\tstaying where I am and “waiting” for something I no longer believe in;\n\n\t•\tpushing for a lateral transfer to change context;\n\n\t•\tor starting to plan an exit from the company altogether.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\n\nDoes it ever make sense to wait when you no longer believe in the process?\n\nHow would you approach this decision?",

Eventually she told me our CTO wouldn't be offering any promotions for the foreseeable future. A month later the biggest lay off in company history occured.\n\nEven then, there still wasn't room in the budget for a promotion, even though they cut $200k in payroll expenses from my team.\n\nI ended up earning +40% promo by jumping off that sinking ship and finding a new job April of 2025.\n\nDon't let that 6 months turn into a year like I did. Find a new job today.\n\nEdit: got my years wrong, forgot it was 2026 lol",

Or things to improve? \n\nIf they can’t, yeah that sounds like a bait and switch. \n\nIf they can give you examples and a solid plan, then it sounds like unfortunately you just aren’t at the level you need to be at in this company for a promotion yet. \n\nPromotions shouldn’t be time based. The fact you’ve been there 5 years and another guy 6 months is immaterial in a good promotion process - it’s about results, not how long you’ve been there. \n\nAssuming it’s legitimate, you have a few options: try to improve and make the improvements management gives you and see if you can get the promotion. Or try to interview your way into the position. \n\nBut if you truly aren’t ready for the position, I’d caution against trying to interview in in this environment. The market is tough. If you get the position and can’t hack it, it’s a very real possibility that you get fired and are left now without any job at all in a bad market.",

When I started ny career at some software company, I wanted to be in development, not \"implementation.\"   They asked me to give them two years, and then put in for a transfer, which I did.   In the 4.5 years I worked at this company, I got a small raise every year, but seriously the money and the title both sucked.\n\nAfter 2 years, by that time a new manager had come in, and my old manager had transfered away.   I was stuck in the same position in Implementation instead of Development.   I also saw people of less ability easily transfer to Development while my manager sat on me and gave me excuse after excuse on why I couldn't transfer.  I was made promises that were later broken.   I saw this same manager do this to other people on my team.\n\nThis is absolutely a fucking horrible situation, and is a clear indication that although your manager may like you, often times their hands are tied by upper management who ... do NOY ... give a shit .. about YOU!!!!!\n\nI'm all with giving a new company a fair shot, but when a promise is broken the first time, then I'm done ... it's too late.   When I get shafted, it's time to move on ... transferring to a new part of the company doesn't work when the company is rotten at it's core.\n\nMy advice is update your resume, and move on.   For years, and years, and years this was often seen as the BEST way to get a better title, a better job, and certainly more money.   I understand the market sucks right now, and it's an EMPLOYERS market.   You have a job, and that's great, use this as an opportunity to find a new job.  Someone who can see your worth, when the company can't see it, or doesn't want to acknowledge it, then it is time to move on.\n\nTime to move on .........",

It's not an injury people can see, but it's a harm that degrades your ability to operate with high degrees of trust and faith in the process.\n\nYou gotta start the process of a lateral transfer, at a minimum. Once you get passed over twice with no actionable reason, it's impossible to tell if waiting 6 months (again) will ever help, or you're not the guy they'll ever promote past senior. You could simply be out of the trust zone, and the longer you stay the higher the risk of burnout or stalling out your personal growth.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for lateral transfer, and I'm in the process of that now. You can't thrive in an environment you're not aligned with. You can dig in and soldier through, but the moral injury only accumulates when reality and expectations constantly conflict. It's okay to both believe in the process and company, and accept your local position is sub-optimal, and the other path is just to accept it and lower expectations (also valid).\n\nWhen it comes to senior promotions, what you are experiencing is very close to what I'm going through: 2 years a team lead, lead a project with big numerical impact and clear cross team influence, but instead of getting the nod after I pushed to cancel a losing project early, I'm shuffled into a high visibility role on a stacked team and used to de-risk execution. I've done everything I can for a Staff level promotion, and that leadership does not feel rewarded.\n\nIn the corporate game, we must make our own luck. You've executed well, but you can't control if management will recognize it or ever pick you for the next level.

What would happen then?\n\nWill you seek another promotion? Can you reasonably expect that you won’t face a moving goalpost again? \n\nOtherwise, will you stay for compensation? It takes a few years to get to the next level’s full compensation after a promo.\n\nDo you enjoy the environment and your work so much that you would overlook the others aspects? Then why are you so concerned about the promo in the first place?\n\nThen, I’d lean on the “lacks consistency” motivation. What does that mean, it’s vague and non actionable? Did your manager elaborate? Did he give you actionable feedback to overcome this perception? Do you find this feedback justified?\n\nIf not, how would this perception change over 6 months if it is not being addressed?\n\nThese questions may help you understand your situation better.\n\nMy opinion is that you’re being led on and credible retention risk will likely be the only reason that will change the management’s perception around your promo. Even if you get it after the next 6 months, you already have bad feelings about it and likely won’t enjoy your time then. However, you have the reputation of someone who “lacks consistency”, it will linger and be used against you whenever it is convenient. \n\nThe analogy they made about mining betrays your manager’s gaslighting. I’ll give you a better analogy for your situation: 99% of gamblers quit gambling before winning the great jackpot. If they cared about retaining you long term, they would have promo’d you.\n\nMoving laterally may help you ease the mental cost of doing the full transition. I’d recommend it before leaving the company as interviewing while stressed and desperate is not ideal and may give the interviewers some bad vibes that they will avoid. You will also have it better personal life without all the stress in the current position which is more rewarding than any work reward.\n\nNow, my personal experience is that people who management wants promoted get promoted with weak correlation to gow outstanding they are in their job. I was in the same situation, telling management about my departure plans was the biggest mistake. The narrative around my performance restrospectively turned from positive key-person to “lacks consistency and bad networking”. I moved laterally but the old (adjusted) feedback still haunted me afterwards. Yet I made new friends, contributed to very cool projects and my new management was a lor more considerate and grateful for my efforts.\n\nMy advice is to get out of this bad situation, either by fortifying mentally to endure the current environment without it slipping into your personal life or by leaving to another team or company. Secondly, never expect promotions, you signed a contact to be paid X for work at a given Y level that outlines expectations and responsibilities. The company may need more work and they need to offer you the rewards for doing more, not otherwise. If you think you can perform at a higher level, go interview and take what’s yours.\n\nI hope we’ll hear from you in the next few months and that you’ll be in a better emotional and material position.",

They can't always control or predict what the circumstances will be 3/6/12 months down the road.\n\nI've definitely had employers/bosses make a verbal commitment to plans with every intention to actually follow through with them  that ultimately didn't pan out due to circumstances beyond  anyone's control.\n\nIt's not obvious to me that they are necessarily committed to promoting you the next time around here anyway, but even if they were you shouldn't really bank on it.\n\nSince they don't seem to be _actively_ committed to your career advancement it couldn't hurt to quietly look around to see what other opportunities are available. That way you'll have a clearer sense of your options even if you ultimately decide to stay in your current position. There's certainly nothing untoward or unethical about doing that, and all it will cost you is a little effort and time.",

They are willing to take no from the promo committee as an answer, or they _want_ to take no to keep you on their team, and your career is suffering for it.\n\nNever, ever take “we’ll get it next time” as a serious answer. Getting promoted from L5 to L6 is complete luck of the draw and how hard your manager is willing to argue for you, and how respected the opinion of your manager and the other people who know your work and like you are. Without those things, you will _never_ be promoted to L6, while others around you will continue to be despite doing less consistently impactful but possibly more visible to the people who matter work. Part of the problem has to be there needs to be a business case *on your team* for an L6. If your org doesn’t have a business justification to have two L6s, it doesn’t matter how well you perform, you will *never* be promoted. This also is up to your manager or your manager’s manager: they have to both argue that there should be an L6 at all, and that you should be that L6. If they can’t effectively make that argument, your career stalls. \n\nMove laterally in the company if you like working for the company and want to stay there, but accept it may mean essentially starting over on your promotion journey, meaning a minimum of another year.\n\nOtherwise, it’s time to start job hunting. It’s much easier to get a promotion via hiring than it is to get promoted internally.",

It's a constant pain managing upwards because I'm doing 2x-3x the work for 0.5x the pay. \n\nAll of this along with doing days and days of unpaid overtime to deliver on goals has left a bad taste in my mouth for some time. On top of this my 2nd line manager decided to obliterate any remaining good will by calling me insubordinate, because I dared questioned his almighty power because because due to backlogs of work he doesn't seem to understand we have to do, I hadn't managed to deal with his frankly ridiculous demand by email that I do yet more of his job for him for the nth time. \n\nDo what I've done, the time is now to use your zeal and frustration with the situation and put it to good use. Don't waste it on the useless management you have in front of you blocking the way, use it to impress new managers and get the job and position you deserve.\n\nI've just accepted a new position at a new company being paid more money and with a defined fixed pay scale of what I'll earn in future years (just the nature of the business I'm applying to but it's a nice perk to know where I'll stand for the time I'm there). I'll be better off, with clearer defined responsibilities, management above me who from speaking to their staff have nothing but good things to say about the leadership and importantly a business with a direction I agree with is the right way forwards. \n\nAs others have said, keep it to yourself, plan your exit and when the change comes it will hurt them more than you. It's going to cost a lot of time and money to get someone to replace you and do what you're doing as it's not just the costs of recruitment, but they need to get that new person upskilled on whatever you've been working on. \n\nFor where I am currently, we have a huge back catalogue of things that just work and require little by way of attention. When they do require attention, I'm the only person on the team who has the knowledge of how to maintain them. All I've got are brand new juniors (see point about poor managers) that for good reason the decision is that they don't want them tinkering with old code without them being up to speed yet and it's a slow process as they are all very green.\n\nUnfortunately for the management team, they have never bothered to acknowledge and protect the business against this current bus factor problem (it's just me) after repeatedly being told they should have a formal plan for how they want things documented should anything happen. Case in point I was off sick for a couple of days recently and incidents came in, but no one dealt with them until I did when I returned from my sick leave. \n\nCurrently they don't know I'm about to hand my notice in, and when I do, there's some leave to be taken as well. So my tenure with them will be shorter than their first expect and I cannot wait to watch them scrabbling to get what they can out of me before it's too late.\n\nIt's a bed of their own making, and it's the same for you OP. If you feel you're ready for it and your manager is being serious they believe you deserve it too, then it's time to quietly plan your exit for new pastures and know leaving is the right choice. Do it on your terms (I took 6 months to get to this point) so put those feelers out to see if it's worth it for you too!",

If it has differing responsibilities, than it's not relevant if someone else got promoted into it in 6 months. I was once promoted into a VP role in 6 months, doesn't mean everyone with that same title with longer tenure should have been.\n\n  \nThat being said, if your manager is willing to go to the calibration committee again, then ask them how you can help them make the best case ever. Suggest a monthly check-in where you can look ahead together at the types of projects, behaviors, or other elements that you can take on to help exhibit what they're looking for. Keep a doc where you write down what you've visibly done in the past month during that conversation, capture it in the moment with their collaboration. Approach it from a \"I'm arming you to make the best case possible, I appreciate you continuing to take this back to them\". And then if you also want to start looking, you can do that too, but now you're covered both ways.",

If the company is not financially stable or, they have a strange blocker higher up at vp level I would say do not expect any positive change. Most of my peers and i was applying for internal promotions/jobs, this often helped me to get a decent raise. In the last few years I decided fuk it, I’ll just do my best, and lets see what they’ll react… Well they often could not care or just ignored my efforts BUT! this gave me courage and confidence in my skills, so after a while i had to pull the trigger and look for another job. But the important part, that i was ready for the workload and reponsabilities at my current job. Now I have full ownership and I take the fame/blame if I done something right/wrong, but something for something right? \n\nTLDR: If you tryed and tested these people just do your best and look for the next gig in the meanwhile.\n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: spelling",

          "text": "I had a similar situation last year. Year after year of stellar reviews, a verbal promise of the promotion from my direct manager, and a pretty good vote of confidence from my skip level. Everything looked good. And then the calibration committee shot it down. The reason I got was that I wasn’t impacting the org as a whole — only my team. This was only half true. On the one hand, I’d never been told that was an expectation. On the other, I’d done several things that impacted the entire org. \n\nSo I did what you did. Tried to push for a lateral move (into architecture) only to be told basically the same thing. However, that manger was in the calibration meetings, whereas my manager and my skip level were not. And he told me flat out that the reason I wasn’t promoted was because not enough of the people in that room knew who I was. \n\nI work remote, but we have options for both hybrid and remote depending on location. The fact of the matter is that I’d need to go into the office and run shoulders and play politics with the right people if I wanted the title. I won’t do that. I made the mistake of getting a little too emotional about it with my boss and my skip level both. Fortunately we’re all close, so they kept it to themselves, commiserated with me and accepted I was going to have to leave to get the title and raise. I haven’t left yet, but that’s mostly out of a lack of urgency. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can be great at your job, but it’s a popularity contest at the higher levels. It sucks, but that’s the corporate world. I was already pulling sixty-plus hour weeks trying to get promoted. I wasn’t going to work any harder for no reward. I decided to tone it down and focus more on my work-life balance. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made. Yeah, I didn’t get a “stellar” review this year, but I did fine, and I got to keep my sanity and dignity while I was at it. And when I find a gig worth jumping for, I’m gone.",

      "text": "The company I work for hired a junior a few months back. He is fresh out of university, cannot express himself very well,and during his time in college he made some consulting, and write some shallow tutorials in medium. Unsurprisingly, he has this mindset in which the more code he wrote and merge, the better employee he is, regardless the code nor the impact. It's ok, I was there once too.  \nMy manager wanted me to pair with him to slowly introduce him into the code base, starting with the easiest service. Im a senior but he doesn't report to me, so my work with him is meant to be collaborative where I lead and he follows.\n\nThe situation is the following:\n\nWhen I onboarded him and tried to give him permissions, he dismissed my questions and instructions quite abruptly and immediately sent me a PR to review. I chose to ignore that.\n\nLater, he spent weeks reviewing PRs he was assigned to, consistently approving everything without real review — including large PRs in a language he openly said he had never used, for a project he hadn’t been introduced to. On top of that, he started rushing others to merge, saying he had “already reviewed it.”\n\nWhen we started working together on a project, I assigned him a few tasks meant to help him get familiar with the service. He delivered quickly, but while the code looked polished, it lacked proper functionality: tests were missing or superficial, patterns weren’t followed, and he hadn’t tested the code. I gave clear feedback, explaining that testing and understanding the service was the whole point of the exercise. He ignored this, added reviewers outside the project to get approvals, and merged as soon as he could. The code was, unsurprisingly, broken. I told him I was happy to help if testing was difficult, as it’s part of the learning process.\n\nDuring a meeting to plan future work, he proposed a new way of working that would require appointing a tech lead, hinting himself for that role. The rest of the team reacted with visible awkwardness.\n\nAt some point he also started to review my work (definition, design, analysis and decomposition of tasks) to which he didn't have no background. Since he couldn't understand what I was talking about there, and with other people, he said that my work was incomplete and I had to add information that was lacking and pay attention because \"was very complex and not common\".  \n\\[...\\]\n\nI ended up talking with my manager and his manager (who seemed to have seen those signals and agree with me). Explained what I observed, what I tried how he responded and the aftermath was his manager talking to him, and him pairing with somebody else. I can see my other colleague is not super happy about the collaboration but things seem smoother.\n\nI can't help feeling that the result for my manager was \"I couldn't manage the situation\", so it's just better to change. Im trying to grow in my role and influence is a big part of this, so:\n\n\\- How would you solve this situation more autonomously? I would like to avoid go to my manager for help but rather saying \"I have this ~~problem~~ blocker, I propose to do this, do you agree\" without losing the project Im working with, or how solid I can be perceived.  \n  \n\\- Would you have talked before? Or only talked with his manager?\n\n\\- Other advice?\n\nThanks in advance!",

That’s their money, let them decide how they want to spend it. The rest depends on the answer. \n\nIf that junior is more important that the company business, users and stakeholders - it all gets into the management space, not technical space. The management is the whole process on its own, so I wouldn’t limit myself by obvious advices like “uh-oh you should listen them“ but apply something useful. These day I would suggest two good sources on management: Crucial Accountability for the companies more focused on a slow pace of correction and who can affords months to fix behavior or Radical Candor for the organization that needs to move fast. \n\nOtherwise what I see is lack of kind of “coaching contract“ established upfront in this relationships. Seems like there are a lot of unspoken assumptions on the both sides and these assumptions aren’t appear to be compatible. It is still good point to have open conversation on assumptions, even very evident, like “functional requirements must be fulfilled and internal coding standards must be obeyed” or “the information about how we work shared not to discuss, but to learn and apply”.

          "text": "I think you did pretty well, but here are a couple of things that stood out to me, besides what has already been said:\n\n* At the start, when he ignored your questions and then submitted the PR, ignoring what happened is conflict avoidance, which makes it hard to escalate issues and lets them fester. Instead, you need to tell him \"I cannot review your PR, because I need you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first\" or even review his PR and explain that it isn't tied to any real issue or need - or that it's low quality or whatever. Honestly, I'm not even sure what the problem is from reading this. I trust that his PR wasn't high quality, based on everything else you said, but there's nothing here to go by. Having this documented makes it easier to escalate if there is a problem and it gives him a chance to correct the issue.\n* When he approved the PRs without reviewing them - this one is hard to document. You could have a meeting with him to go over the PRs with you together and then document what happened. If it's clear he didn't actually review the PRs tell him not to approve them blindly, and follow up in an email with the contents of what was discussed and agreed upon in the discussion. If he refuses to talk to you, document and escalate that, too. If he isn't the one to review those PRs, that could also be a process/culture issue in the company that needs to be addressed, instead.\n* When he criticized your work, get him to specify which areas need clarification and what the common approach would have been to those issues. Force him to clarify his position. Tell him we all want the system to be easier to understand and modify, but we can't do that if he pushes back on designs without sharing his experience or tangible criticisms. That instead of shutting down discussion, he needs ask clarifying questions so we can move forward together as a team.\n\nThat said, I relate to your story. I've had a few juniors try to worm their way out of their responsibilities like this, and it took a few times for me to learn how to handle it. The best way to hold people and escalate is to be clear about your expectations, especially when they screw up. Leave a clear paper trail of the expectations you establish and their response to those. Then escalate when they refuse to comply.\n\nYou've got to take the emotion and subjectivity out of it and make it objective so that someone can say: \"This employee was fired because they were unwilling or unable to follow the process / guidelines which were clearly documented for them.\"",

Unfortunately there are some who have this attitude that will take conversations like this as a personal attack or a way to belittle them, so having a paper trail to cover yourself if this comes up is always a good idea.\n\nIf this continues, then I would arrange a meeting with their manager, yourself and them. This is basically you still being in control of the situation but bringing the manager in as the next step is for the manager to deal with, this also gives you another person in the room and this discussion should be along the lines of \"what you are doing now is not how we do things, you need to pull your head out of your ass.\"\n\nBeyond this point it is out of your hands and the manager needs to take over and deal with the situation.\n\nIn terms of your concern about \"I couldn't manage the situation\", I would say that a big part of managing the situation is knowing when to escalate a situation. If in your position you are purely a mentor who can coach and guide, but that is the extent of your \"hard authority\" then trying to reach them via these tools is all you can really do. I'd say so long as you can demonstrate you've leveraged all the tools available to you to solve the problem you should be ok.",

If your intention is to learn how to influence without authority and make sure your boss isn't blaming you for a situation you couldn't fix, you need to let go of the idea that you shouldn't go to your boss for help. It's counterintuitive, but asking for help and showing that you are changing based on that help will build your credibility with your boss, not ruin it. However, you are right in that you need to go in with talking points that show you're actively trying to improve.\n\nSo make a list of the issues you ran into with this guy and ask your boss for coaching and feedback.  \n  \nStart with: \"he approved PRs for languages he himself admits he doesn't know.\" Use the STAR method (or at least find a regular format to describe WTF happened) and make sure you're being intellectually honest about what you could have done better. Ask your boss for feedback and advice on how you can improve for next time and how they would have handled the situation. Make sure they answer the question about how they would have handled the situation. If they can't or won't, red flag - they may not be able or willing to coach you properly.\n\nDepending on how anxious you are, writing up a script in advance and reading it out loud a few times to make sure it sounds natural and professional can help a lot.\n\nAlso, please know that what you experienced is pretty common. Your company made a bad hiring decision and now you're worried your boss is going to scapegoat you instead of fix the hiring process. Sometimes the universe is telling you to move on from a bad situation, so be open to seeing this a sign you need a new work environment.",

          "text": "First of all, I agree it’s a personality problem, and many of what others said (review process seems broken if you can’t request changes) you did a fine job yourself given it’s technically not your responsibility, but since you asked for an approach to be more proactive like an engineer, here’s my honest thoughts. \n\nWhat you were assigned for is mentorship. It takes a significant amount of your time, because it’s another big problem to solve. How you dealt with it was already acceptable, but it’s not to craft level. Just like you’d submit code that’s ok, but not craft. It’s true that human problems like this are a two-way street, but you have way more lever than you think. \n\nPersonally, when I’m assigned to mentor someone, just like studying codebase and all, I prepare a directory and markdown about them. I study them, document them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, proactively meet with them other than pair programming, document their personality and the boundary of failures. You’ve noticed problems, but they’re scattered and presented more like a rant. As you said, you need a plan of attack. \n\nThe same way that there’s documentation about the personality and technical capabilities of the junior, I’d create a roadmap of growth. Your roadmap could include every PR that he submits has to go through you. You would lay out why you’d like a thorough review on every one of these, at least when it’s a system you own, things include prevent code breakages and to facilitate better review process, and help him learn better on PR culture. You could also include things like more targeted PRs that he needs to test, even prepare some review templates to start with. I’d get buy-ins because my plan usually looks like I notice the human problems, I’m not emotional about it, objectively these are the things that need to get done, or need to be enforced by his manager, to help him grow. My first meet with the junior would’ve also included these discussions with them; while it’s collaborative, I would ask how they think of the codebase, what’s their career goal, what are the areas of interests and things they are learning about. I’d ask what they think they’re good at etc (as opposed to my own observation, good to see how delulu some are in documentation). \n\nAll of these take up significant of my time, but it’s part of mentorship. It’s also helpful to communicate/negotiate with the managers that, because of the plan of attack and all, this is where I’m spending my time and how. This way, it really can be communicated in a way that is basically the same as “do you want me to work on this feature/system more or that”. \n\nI haven’t gotten tons of mentorship opportunities, but the two I had were manageable as a result. One of them very arrogant, and really took a lot of my time, but it’s something I communicated and negotiated, and before I left the company, the junior expressed he really learnt a lot and wished there were more time. \n\nAh, I will say, since I’m Asian from Asia, I’ve been learning to balance the humbleness mindset and required amount of assertiveness. \n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "How are y'all dealing with Chesterton's Fence when reading code?\n\nPre-AI, there used to be some signal from code being there that it had some value. By that I mean that if there's an easy way and a hard way to do something, and you see the hard way being done, it's because someone thought they needed to put in the effort to do the hard way. And there was some insight to be gained in thinking about why that was the case. Sure occasionally it was because the author didn't have the simple thing cross their mind, but with knowledge of the author's past code I could anticipate that too.\n\nWith AI generated code that feels less true. An AI has no laziness keeping it from doing the fancy thing. That means that sometimes the fancy thing isn't there for any particular reason. It works so it's there.\n\nThis naturally poses a problem with Chesterton's Fence: If I spend a bunch of time looking for the reason that a particular piece of complexity is there but 75% of the time it's never there, I feel like I'm just wasting time. What do you do to avoid this time/energy sink?",

This was true before AI, and it's still true now.\n\nHowever, let's assume the mess has already been made and snuck into the repo, despite not having a reason to be there.  Assuming the original (human) author is still around, treat it the same way you would have prior to AI --- go to them and ask them what motivated the complexity.  Honestly, if I suspect the code was made with AI, I push the \"why\" questions even if it becomes a little uncomfortable for the person I'm asking, since people *must* be responsible for the code they commit, even if an AI generated it.\n\nIf the author *isn't* present, the next step is your test suites.  If you can rip out the complex code and it fails a test case, then that identifies why it's there.  If you rip out the complex code and it still passes... that could just mean your tests are inadequate.  Time to look at tickets, commit history, and/or chat threads. If there's still no reason for why it's there, my inclination is to leave things be unless it's actually causing problems.",

If theres a clear commit message explaining why something complex was done that way I trust it more. But if its just \"implement feature X\" with no context and the code has that AI smell then I assume its probably safe to simplify. I also started putting more detailed comments in my own code now specifically because of this - future me needs to know weather something complex was intentional or just the result of an AI going overboard with implementation details.\n\n  \nIts definitely changed how I approach legacy code review and I dont think we're going back to the old way anytime soon unfortunately",

Yes tests are amazing and good and catch so much, but if someone adds needlessly complex code with the only saving grace being passing tests, that’s getting rejected by me.

Most devs unfortunately like to comment about what instead of about why, but a good dev will consider the various approaches and leave a comment about why they chose to do it a certain way, preferably pointing out specific alternatives and their flaws.  And this should happen anywhere in the code they make a decision, even small ones.  \n\nIf some code doesn't have good comments like that, it's not really 'valuable', and the default assumption should be that any added complexity is a mistake\n\nAI very much does not do this well.  It adds a lot of comments, but they're always what, not why, and they occur randomly instead of in places where a significant decision was made\n\nOf course, even among devs that actually comment correctly, most of them make very few decisions and just copy/paste existing code that already made those decisions.  And devs don't get to decide business requirements, so the why of those is never in comments.  And if grooming is done correctly, devs should be making very few decisions at the time of writing code, and they're probably not going to copy notes from the story into the code's comments\n\nSo basically, uncommented code is human-written, but they didn't make any real decisions and probably didn't really think through their approach (or are an inexperienced dev), so it can probably be improved.  Badly commented code is always considered bad code, even if they happened to use a good approach, and usually written by AI.  Well commented code is always good code, and almost always written by a human",

Complex code meant someone intentionally chose the hard path, and that was a signal worth investigating. You'd look at git blame, find the original author, maybe ask them. The \"why\" was recoverable even if it wasn't written down.\n\n  \nPost-AI, that signal is completely gone. Complex code might be a deliberate design choice, or it might be a hallucination that happened to pass tests. You can't tell by reading it and you can't ask the AI why it did it that way.\n\n  \nThe fix isn't banning AI from codebases - that ship has sailed. It's making intent-documentation a first-class engineering practice:\n\n  \n1. Commit messages that explain the reasoning, not just \"fix bug\" or \"add feature\"\n\n2. ADRs for anything non-obvious. Even a 3-sentence \"we chose X because Y, we considered Z but rejected it because W\" saves future engineers hours\n\n3. Code review culture that asks \"why this approach\" not just \"does this work\"\n\n  \nThe code itself is no longer a reliable signal of intent. Teams that adapt to this will be fine. Teams that keep treating code as self-documenting are going to accumulate a codebase nobody understands within a year.",

But I can definitely see what you mean. It is hard to tell in what's already generated if there was any rhyme or reason for it being so complex or verbose or rather that AI just decided that it liked that solution better for some hallucinated benefits.\n\nMy opinion is that further advancements in models will resolve this issue more as AIs logical reasoning abilities become better. Honestly AI can also be a great tool for this problem because it allows you to assert a lot of questions you might have against code you are not very familiar with and get answers quickly as to why that code might exist (or why it might not need to). Very often AI is good at checking work done by other agents and giving critical analysis of it. \n\nOther than that I'd say you'd handle it the same way you always would. Figure out if anyone on the team understands why something is done a certain way and, if not, and you see a potentially better solution than make a proposal or PR to fix it. Sometimes you might be wrong with your judgment and waste time but to my point above I believe AI can speed this process up in many cases as well.",

I dont have a silver bullet -- especially since solving the issue would probably equate to 'how to get AI to write good code' -- but in my experience there are a few ways to at least mitigate:\n\n1. **Lean heavier on testing than ever**, if the complexity is there for some functionality it should be documented partly in test, else it should be removable until a test has been introduced. \n\n2. **Prevent it before AI generation**, have code base specific onboarding documentation about coding standards and abstractions, explicitly steer the agent away from creating new ones without user signoff -- and hopefully the author would include it in a comment. \n\n3. **Prevent it after AI generation**, include complexity detection in a AI code review phase and mark any code in the repo as overly complex and require human signoff. \n\n4. **Process Improvement / The Git Blame Game**, if your team still has humans reviewing PRs (I darn hope you do), it's the creator's responsibility to READ THE DAMN PR and note any new complexities and why they exit. Looking through the original PR request might help with that. \n\nHope that helps, I really think this is going to be more of an issue as AI litter our codebase with potential landmines.",

It's been genuinely good for about 20 years, and even though quality degraded lately (AI influence I would assume) it's still decent.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there's nothing like that in the English-speaking internet segment nor had there been in the last 10-20 years. Closest competitors are Dev/Medium with dumpster quality content and Hacker News which is exceptional however not a blogging platform on its own.\n\nI know that lately people tend to get content on Youtube etc, and maybe reading is not preferred by the younger generation of devs, but what about earlier times?\n\nWhy hasn't anyone built a platform with a quality threshold, proper technical formatting, and an engaged community of senior engineers?

In English speaking dev spaces, the people with deep experience often write internally, speak at conferences, or just do not bother publishing at all because there is little upside. The public platforms reward frequency, hot takes, or beginner friendly content way more than slow, dense writing.\n\nThere were attempts years ago with personal blogs and blogrolls, but they never centralized because senior devs tend to value independence and low noise. Once a platform grows, moderation either gets expensive or quality slips. Hacker News works partly because discussion beats authorship, and the bar is social rather than formal.\n\nIt might also be cultural. The Russian tradition of long technical writeups and peer critique is stronger. In English speaking spaces, critique often gets read as negativity, so quality gatekeeping becomes controversial fast.",

Do you still read technical articles? You aren't the only one, and if you're a compelling writer, have something interesting to say, or did something interesting, people will want to read what you, the human, wrote. This isn't what people use LLMs for - instead they're used (especially for technical things) to get broad overviews of concepts, do research tasks (in which case they do link back to their sources), or ask specific questions that are usually covered in documentation.\n\nSo to make your work worth reading, you have to think about how people are using LLMs and fulfill the niches they can't. This may mean higher effort work, more unique content, or something else, but overall it raises the bar for what you write.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to think about why you're writing. To me, it doesn't really matter whether bots are scraping my content for AI or anything else. I write first for me, then for my audience, whatever it is. Some writers even make versions of their work more accessible for AI so that their ideas get out there or users can better query the work directly.",

      "text": "I’m a Senior BE with 7 YOE and joined a new team about a month ago. The people are ok, but I’ve run into some architectural patterns that feel like anti-patterns.\n\nCurrently, a lot of the business logic and orchestration lives directly in the route handlers. There is a strict rule against service-to-service calls; instead, the team uses a pattern where logic from one service is injected into another via lambdas passed down from the route level. This \"callback hell\" approach is apparently meant to keep services decoupled, but it results in lambdas being passed many layers deep, making the execution flow incredibly difficult to trace.\n\nThe friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles, especially since i'm still new to the team so there is not much established trust. However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nHow do you go about shifting an established engineering culture without coming across as the arrogant new hire? I want to advocate for better DX and maintainability, but I'm looking for a way to do it that feels collaborative rather than confrontational.",

You get established norms and no real options to challenge the status quo individually or even in a systemic way. Usually those decisions are driven top down anyway. \n\nAnd like you said, you really need a lot of trust from stakeholders to approach big structural changes. And it's almost never the hill to die on.\n\nAt least, that's my experience in corporate culture and even startup culture to a degree.\n\nI had an interview at eBay last year, and every round, the interviewers were absolutely pumped about migrating all their REST APIs to GraphQL and the \"big direction\" the company was taking towards their backend. I think they've been investing in external companies focused on GraphQL, too. Felt like the decision was being driven top down.\n\nI don't know much about GraphQL and I don't think GraphQL is that great tbh or even gamechanging. And they're kind of 10 years late to the party. But everyone was so excited about what it would enable them to do at the company . So it felt like viewing into a weird localized corporate culture.",

          "text": "> The friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI am confused why this is an either-or thing. Perhaps this is a language specific problem (you didn’t specify the language), but a lambda is just a closure box around some function invocation. Sure you can write logic inline in the lambda, but there’s no reason you _have_ to do things this way, the lambda can equally just call a free function (in languages with such a thing) or capture some function object that implements the logic. Why can you not have the logic you want to directly unit test separated into a testable unit, test it, then simply pass that as the lambda? The lambda now only serves to “wire together” the injection point to the logic being injected.\n\nThis kind of design keeps the decoupling between transport and business logic that you’re looking for, while simultaneously not rocking the boat on their design patterns?\n\nAs for needing integration tests: I mean, yeah, ultimately you are going to need those, because at the end of the day you have to validate the system as a whole behaves as expected. Put differently, if the actual requirements on the system are “when API X is invoked with arguments Y, effect Z happens,” then you need to actually test _that_, the rest is implementation details. The point of separating out smaller units for testing is to isolate the point of failure. If the top level test fails but the unit test passes, you know the issue lies in the integration between the unit and the larger system. If both fail, you know at minimum there is a defect in the unit which likely is causing a defect in the system the unit is integrated into.\n\nI can’t comment on the overall architecture because your description of it isn’t very detailed. It sounds a lot like pretty standard inversion of control principles, which are usually considered *good* for testing and maintainability. Perhaps the problems you’re feeling there are tied to either poorly specified contracts (I.E. the contracts of those lambdas aren’t well specified), or due to implementation specifics (people writing massive, deeply nested lambdas inline instead of breaking out directly testable helpers with the logic and having the lambdas in the transport layer just wire them together). Once you’ve really understood the *why* of the design, perhaps you can push to close the gap on documentation or best practices that can help you and the next you understand the system better, as well as help shift left some of the testing practices from being purely massive top level integration tests to a healthy blend of system level and unit level testing.",

As long as you’re ok with that, pick your battles. Focus on cheap, high-yield pilot projects that have clear feedback when they work out. Performance issues are good for this, because numbers clearly go down/up. Things like “this makes the code easier to work with/easier to extend” are harder to prove, and therefore not great for gaining trust early on. \n\nYour challenge is a political one here - not technical. Maybe you had a lot of trust where you came from, so it’s hard to have your ideas viewed with skepticism, but an antidote to that is showing them you can do it their way, at least for a little while. It’s also an opportunity to check your own bias. If you’re surrounded by people who implicitly trust you, that can dull your awareness of weaknesses in ideas you have. And if you’re actually right, you’ll help others check their bias, but keep in mind how uncomfortable that can be for some people to have dictated to them. \n\nPS - I know how that can feel like you’re just going along with everyone’s complacency and it’s really frustrating.

Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\n\nYou could advocate for tests using the Test host or equivalent in your environment (you don't mention which it is). The one that I use is for for outside-in, and all in-memory testing. You can and should swap out real database for mocks here, to keep it all in-memory and fast. You can call these \"component tests\" or regard them as decoupled unit tests. I find this a very useful pattern by either name. As it sidesteps the implementation details, use of  route handlers / DI or not. So you're free to refactor under test.\n\nNo, they're not the _only_ kind of tests that we have - there are \"methods & mocks\" unit tests, and also tests that run after deploy to dev and use real databases and external services. But they are the bulk of tests, and it works well.\n\n> I’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles . However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nThis is a real dilemma, because both are correct. The only thing worse than code that uses an odd pattern and style that doesn't work that well, is code that uses it 50% of the time at random so you never know what you're getting today.\n\nHowever, I too would be thinking \"WTF is this and why?\"  A \"strict rule against service-to-service calls\" is bizarre and useless, and an interface with 1 method on it is exactly equivalent to a lambda / delegate / func, except in that it has a named type, which makes it easier for humans and DI containers to deal with.\n\nIt's _possible_ that they have some odd requirement that makes this pattern necessary, but I'd bet money that they don't, it's just just habit, misunderstanding and ignorance of common good practice.\n\nOr maybe you're working in a Functional Programming language such as F# where passing functions to functions is the \"Right way\". Or with an ex-Haskell dev? ;)",

Over time we moved to RPM packages, then Docker and Kubernetes. I learned the importance of immutable artifacts, configuration management, and overall the importance of making systems easy to reason about, and the value of homogeneity, immutability and predictability. \n\nI learned about trade-offs in software engineering. Now if I am interviewing an L4 or L5 candidate, I always focus on whether they understand tradeoffs in their designs.  There is never 1 “best” way to do things, you always need to understand what goals you are trying to optimize, and what needs to be given up in order to satisfy them. \n\nUsing fair queuing is important to prevent hot users from crowding out smaller users. \n\nThe value (and drawbacks) of asynchronous systems.  If your entire system is synchronous, it's easier to understand, but eventually you will hit a scaling limit. Synchronicity is slow, and coordination always reduces the speed of a system.\n\nBackpressure and providing congestion signals to upstream callers.  Learning about congestion control algorithms that do not require coordination like AIMD or CoDel which can help congested flows perform optimally.  Being explicit about providing back-pressure, otherwise things will fail in a way that is unpredictable or out of your control.\n\nLearning how overloaded systems in general do not operate efficiently, you want to keep utilization well below 100%. \n\nCAP theorem is real, many times we were forced to make that trade whether we liked it or not.\n\nAt-least-once vs at-most-once delivery, and being cognizant of the choice you are making there.\n\nCellular system design, and being able to route traffic volume between cells for failover or load testing purposes. \n\nThat's a lot of what I could write down off the top of my head in a few minutes.  None of these are specific to any technologies.  Over the course of a 20 year career you just learn to go with the flow technology-wise. Many times the technology choices are made above your pay grade without your input.  If you are lucky, you get to choose.",

What has worked for us is keep things lean, design with lateral scalability in mind and make concessions where they can be made. Our system allows us to batch events, it also allows us to drop events in the worst case. So, we write thousands of events at the same time. We keep them in memory and consume millions as one batch is being written.",

Our product at this point is in the 1,000+ microservices, which helps at scale because most services are tasked with doing this small chunk of work really fast.\n\n1) No, while ideally the producer does a best effort on maintaining order per partition (not per topic). Our data can be visualized as time series data, we care about some device working (being online basically) and when was the last time we saw it. If an event arrives and we have seen the device more recently, then at persist time the event is dropped. \n\n2) Fortunately no, again we are lucky here and can keep things simple. If a batch of events is dropped, we can tolerate it. It’s not ideal, specially for devices with low activity, but at the end of the day it’s a device health system and the data itself is not critical. \n\nWe keep events in memory after consumption from the Kafka topic, our biggest problems would be OOM Kills or pod restarts. Good monitoring prevents the first one, or at least catches it while happening and alerts us to scale the application limits while we debug the root cause and the second one is mitigated by taints on the pods that schedule them as critical backend pods which means they don’t restart unless absolutely needed. In that case the application shuts down cleanly and we can persist whatever is in mem before terminating.",

So you’re insulated only prioritizing code output with no real care about how what you’re writing is interacting with a broader system.\n\nYou can only get this as a lived experience.  This isn’t some exercise or something you cram for.  You have to feel it in your nervous system. You must design from fear not confidence. You must design as if you are going to be woken up at 3 am to fix it.\n\nThis is hard to imagine when it has never happened to you.  So you seek it only as an abstract risk.  \n\nSo my recommendation is to think in failure modes.  Not only what a system can do, but how can it fail? And if it does fail, how do we recover?

Part of it is everyone's busy so review gets deprioritized, part of it is codebase complexity meaning understanding the impact of changes requires significant context that takes time to load. Assigning dedicated reviewers just creates bottlenecks when those people are unavailable, and the async nature makes it worse where someone leaves feedback, the author addresses it 8 hours later, then the reviewer doesn't see updates until the next day which stretches everything out. The other thing is review feedback being subjective style stuff rather than actual bugs, so there's multiple rounds of back-and-forth over variable naming or formatting which seems like a waste of time but people have opinions about it. Some prs apparently sit for a week before merging which is pretty absurd for any company trying to move fast, and pair programming helps for critical stuff but it's exhausting and doesn't scale…. what approaches actually work for keeping review quick without it becoming rubber-stamping where people just approve without really looking?",

          "text": "Your org needs a style guide.\n\nYou mention in your post more than once that there are a bunch of back'n'forths on subjective issues. The style guide should specify enough detail that it should resolve pretty much all of these subject issues by taking a stance, not because it's a better or worse way of doing it, but because consistency across the entire codebase is better than inconsistency, even if the style guide chooses the worse option. Or, in cases where inconsistency has little to no cost (or even benefit), then it should clearly state that coders should either defer to local style (meaning that style should conform to whatever is the prevailing way in that file, module, or team), or that it really doesn't matter and reviewers that raise it should be redirected to take it up with the style guide instead of the code author.\n\nThe second thing is that your org needs an SLA around code reviews. For changes that total less than 100 lines touched, < 4h, for changes greater than 100 lines, 8h per 500 lines of code added/changed/deleted. Whatever the SLA is, set up a dashboard and display everyone's last 30d of code review activity.\n\nThe problem your org likely has is that PRs are too big. Changes should be split into the smallest cohesive set of changes possible, and the above SLA will encourage everyone to keep their PRs under 100 lines if at all possible. At the very least, people will be encouraged to collect bigger changes that are conceptually weighty into PRs that require more review attention instead of clubbing together a ton of little, independent things into the same PR.\n\nYour issue tracker should also allow issues to be tagged with specific PRs. The way to keep all of this organized is to create a tracking issue for each task (preferably that belongs to a parent issue for each project an individual owns). Then individual issues can track conceptual sub-tasks and accumulate tags for the set of little PRs that contribute to changes. This seems like a lot of bookkeeping, but if your tooling is good enough to handle this, it has tons of benefits. It becomes easy to track down issues when a CL needs to be rolled back, it creates a fine-grained view of where things are for task tracking, and it makes it very easy to substantiate your contributions in your self-eval at perf time.\n\nI actually keep a running self-eval doc. I book fifteen minutes after lunch every Friday which I allocate to updating that doc with detailed links to what I'm working on and notes to myself. When self-eval time comes it's pretty much a cut'n'paste for me because I've been keeping it all year long, so it's easy to adapt into whatever format is requested.",

Larger PRs have the potential to generate more comments, and for it to take you longer to address those comments.\n\nRe variable naming and other subjective things - this is an indication that other people aren't finding your code as easy to read as it could be.

      "text": "I am not saying this to be self-deprecating either…I genuinely am too dumb to do this. Basically I am a 2018 grad, and I’ve been working since then. I have a Computer Engineering degree (which I regret because I hate hardware; I really want a true “software job” and I’ve been applying all over and have been doing all sorts of prep, but I fear I’ve been pigeon-holed atp). I coasted by in my first job out of college because it was for a defense company and I had great rapport with my teammates in general and I was well-liked overall. So even if I messed up (which I did a lot), it was forgiven because I was young/cute and “new” and friends with everyone.\n\nI quit in 2024 and started my current job, and yeah…I have felt like I’m way in over my far way too many times. I feel like I literally fooled my manager into hiring me, and I can tell I annoy him a lot with my incompetence. My current role has me working as a mid-level Embedded Engineer, and while I am good at/enjoy debugging and fixing issues in our firmware (this is literally the ONLY technical thing I am good at), I struggle with everything else. I have been given a bunch of hardware-related tasks during my time here, and I’ve already literally fried/blown up so many different pieces of hardware. I’ve also shocked myself a few times while handling hardware because I didn’t know that electricity would be flowing through a certain part or something. For reference, the last time I took a circuits class or did anything related to circuits was in 2015. I did some reading on my own on circuits and electricity, but yeah…anything hardware-related is just not intuitive to me.\n\nMy manager had also asked me to implement certain functionalities in our code at different times, but I literally cannot complete these tasks without getting significant help. And I’ve been reprimanded for “taking too long” to finish things plenty of times, so now I’m afraid to ask for help too (I know it’s super counterintuitive, but my mindset is that if I ask for help now, he’ll start grilling me over what I’ve been doing the past day/hours, which obviously makes it worse). Even now, I’ve been working on figuring out this one issue with a product, but all day and yesterday I’ve been having hardware issues (ie shaky connections so I couldn’t always get the console to appear, which I don’t know how to fix,  etc.), so I couldn’t make actual progress on the issue itself. When my manager called me at the end of the day today to ask for status, I said that I’m “still working on it”, which he clearly wasn’t happy about. He set up a meeting between us for the first thing tomorrow morning to get more status on this issue, and now I’m freaking out because I literally have nothing to update him with. I just don’t know what I will say and I’m certain I’ll get reprimanded.\n\nSomehow I’ve gotten “Meets Expectations” at every performance review I’ve ever had throughout my career, but even at my most recent one, my manger told me that I’m on the “lower end of that” (I suspect he feels that I am “Below Expectations”, but didn’t want that on paper) because I’m too slow and that I don’t know how to optimize my time well enough. I also feel shame because I’m a woman as well and I’m proving the “stereotypes” that women can’t do tech.\n\nHow can I be a better engineer? Is it even possible at this point? I’m at year 8 in this field and I’m miserable. Also what can I say during this “status meeting” tomorrow? I just feel a lot of fear and shame and anxiety with my situation overall.",

In tech, I would say the single biggest thing that correlates with success is the willingness to expose ignorance. In my experience, it is also the single biggest thing that underrepresented people—especially women—are terrified of doing. The reason that women don't want to expose their ignorance in situations men would is that they have accumulated a lot of experience over a long period of time that [it is unsafe to do so](https://xkcd.com/385/).\n\nMake an appointment with your manager and say that you feel you are underperforming by your own standard, and you want to turn things around. Explain that you often feel like you lack context on certain things and you're afraid to ask for fear of how it will make you look, and this builds up and up on itself until you're in a hole. Explain that you feel with a little of the right kind of support, you can level up.\n\nYou should look for a mentor, and then ask your manager to officially recognize this mentor relationship. Your mentor should be the person you level with when you don't know something or don't know how to proceed, and they should be senior enough to have those answers and be willing and able to coach you. The emphasis here should be sometimes just giving you the information you need, and other times helping you get the information you need for yourself. Your mentor should be able to judge when sending you out to ask a certain question actually will make you look bad vs. when it's totally appropriate for you to not know something and be seeking information, and they can protect you in the former case and push you in the latter until you develop that sense for yourself. To make this work, obviously, the highest priority is to find someone to mentor you that will be able to do so without judgment. The point of looping your manager in is that the upside for your mentor is they will be building experience toward a management role someday themselves, and they should feel good about this extra responsibility.\n\nThis should also be a limited engagement. Ideally, you get a mentor for one or two perf cycles, and after that it degrades into an informal relationship where you can go and ask for advice from your former mentor just as you would anyone else (and you should be branching out at that point too).",

People that accumulate knowledge gaps instead of filling them inevitably fail to have successful engineering careers. If you're afraid to ask a dumb question then ask it to Chatgpt (or Gemini / Claude) first. Then confirm with your mentor that the understanding you got is correct (yes, it's wrong sometimes and your mentor can also often provide additional context / perspective).\n\nAt 6 and 12 months do a self evaluation and compare this with your mentors evaluation of you. See if they have any advice on anything you should be doing differently. If after a year you still feel you're not enjoying embedded, that's ok it happens, you can then start applying for different jobs. But in your current situation it's too early to give up imo.",

You learn and the other time around you ask something new. That's how you show respect for others' time and progress in your own journey.\n\nIt \"seems\" you're in an environment that will be receptive to that kind of behavior, take advantage of it.\n\nIn similar situations it's helped me to think\n\" I may be right and be pretty much useless. Then I have nothing to lose really. I can give it an honest go and see where I land\"\n\nGoing software-only is an option, but to me it sounds like you're you're tapping out before the fight. Do your best here, then weigh your options.\n\nBtw, the troubleshooting that you mention you're good at... is the hardest skill ever and the start for any good engineer.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nPs. Saw it somewhere and found it insightful. \" Imposter syndrome is not lack of skill. It's that your skill set grows before your confidence has time to catch up\" 😉",

As an engineer you should be able to resolve the problems in front of you - or know where to look for guidance and help. If I can solve/fix something in 5 minutes, its because I have experienced it before and learned the approach of attack; which before probably would've taken me hours, days on my own. I have been using AI chat as a teacher/mentor instead of just having it replace my job. Prompts I ask are things like \"why\" or \"best practice\" versus \"give me\" or \"solve for me.\" My company even has a internal chat so I don't have to worry about exposing sensitive information to the WWW.\n\nI'd describe the role as an entirely different way of thinking, you are a painter and your 'understanding of whatever platform or environment' is the color palette which is the key to successfully painting (interacting) and resolving the issues at hand. A natural river should be blue, not red. Its just cause and effect problem solving, some having more steps then others to find the solution.\n\nThe key thing to my success is that I take excellent notes and can communicate/articulate it well. This worked for the first couple of months. Now moving from a help-desk sort of role to an actual engineer/production support role, or I guess people call it dev-ops, I have to now explore the platform and document the unknown on my own, which means when I have a problem I have never come across - I have to figure it out on my own, or in the least if I know what questions to ask to get me to the solution - someone else might know the answers.   \n  \nCall it the leash has come off. And my notes? They're being ingested by a AI agent to support people who are coming after me, people who don't have any experience using my company's platform and are able to get up to speed. The notes existing help troubleshoot future problems by being proof of previously completed work.\n\nTo be successful you have to want to be successful, and I totally get it - until you feel like you want to succeed you probably won't and will keep down spiraling. I recommend therapy to unpackage those feelings, and also channeling your free time to production/positivity for yourself, instead of doom scrolling, enlist in some free classes that can make you feel more confident, work on small hobby projects to break the anxiety you may have and become more confident with software programming instead of hardware management.",

There's a ton of more general life things you can do to boost your confidence and that will carry over to work in my experience. Exercise is number one. Doesn't matter what really but ideally get your heart rate up high regularly and do some sort of strengthening stuff. Eating decent, staying hydrated, avoiding drinking/drugs. Do fun/social stuff in your free time. Go outside, get some fresh air and sun. Practice mindfulness, I don't mean becoming a meditation master, just try to learn to take a few breaths and ground yourself in the present moment and the physical experience of life. \n\nThis all seems like a lot but really just making some sort of consistent effort at hitting some of those points regularly makes a massive difference in my confidence and general well-being, which absolutely reflects in my work performance.",

          "text": "Based on what you wrote I have a few thoughts.\n\nI have met a lot of \"dumb\" and difficult Engineers over the years. Most of your issues seem to steam from a bad workplace situation rather than you not being smart enough to be an engineer. Just your post is a sign that you are smart enough to be an engineer.\n\nIdeas to improve in your current situation:\n\n1) Focus on giving clear communication on the issues. Don't wait for someone to ask you about status. At the end of the day if you didn't make any progress post about it in the team chat. If an engineer working for me only responded with \"still working on it\" on a task that should of been done I would have to go out of my way to figure out where they are stuck and why. It saves both of us a lot of time to post a short status once or twice everyday (the timing depends on the cadence of the team) of just \"What you are working on, what you tried today, what you've fixed, and what problems you are having\". Make it a predictable update. If you get good at it you can actually space out some days and not actually work (not that I would ever do that ;) ). The important thing is the appearance of progress and work is often enough to give you enough space to work things out.\n\n2) Learn how to keep and manage a personal development notebook. I have one that's just a folder of organized markdown files mixed with diagrams, code snippets etc I've made. A lot of low performing engineers I've encountered struggle because they have a hard retaining and recalling information. Especially at a new job where there is just a lot of new terminology and things to keep track of. Just having a notebook and keeping regular notes helps. It also tells managers you are taking things seriously.\n\n3) Find something at work you actually like and learn it inside and out. Not something general like \"debugging\" and \"fixing bugs\". Take a piece of the system and actually dig into it. Write your findings down in your notebook.\n\n4) Read the work of \"high performing\" colleagues when you have downtime time. Read through their commits and pull requests, can you understand it? Can you follow it? If not, write it in your notebook. The things you don't know at flag in your notebook and bring questions with you at the next opportunity.\n\nIdeas to leave:\nIf you just don't enjoy the domain or work, consider looking for adjacent work in the company. Application Engineer, Product and Marketing.. etc. There's other positions that are looking for technically knowledgeable people that do not require slinging code or slapping together hardware.",

Eventually it will click and the things that were hard will be easy, and they'll be replaced with a new batch of things to feel insecure about.\n\nI'd say the most difficult (and important) skill in writing software is to learn how to decompose a project down into small enough intermediate steps, that are each debuggable and move you in the direction of your eventual goal. Basically taking a difficult problem and turning it into a series (or a DAG) of small easy tasks.\n\nI am still learning how to do this, but it's the difference between being able to shit out a 100 line project that does the thing you want it to do and a 10k line project without really planning or architecting anything. If you do this, you'll find your code naturally gravitates towards some architectures depending on the problem, and you also start to get a feel for the \"friction\" when your code doesn't match the problem,\n\nThis is *not* an easy skill to learn. It is *not* taught or focused on. It is *absolutely necessary* if you wish to be a truly competent and independent engineer. That skill is the silent gatekeeper. If you're having this much trouble, it's because you're bouncing off against this hard wall. Which means you are absolutely capable of learning it, because you're cognizant of it, and can appreciate the enormity of it just upon observation.\n\nKeep at it, don't give up.

Usually mgmt/seniors get most frustrated with more junior folks who spend a lot of time going down rabbit holes instead of just asking earlier in the process. If they do get mad for asking too many questions, it's been because they're not showing enough initiative, and the senior feels like they have to hand hold the entire time.\n\n>Even now, I’ve been working on figuring out this one issue with a product, but all day and yesterday I’ve been having hardware issues (ie shaky connections so I couldn’t always get the console to appear, which I don’t know how to fix, etc.), so I couldn’t make actual progress on the issue itself.

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nAbout 17 years total experience, started off as a self-taught goofball writing scripts to make my job easier to working at big tech and startups, picking up my masters along the way.\n\nWhat really got me into tech/software was that I could solve a lot of business problems writing code and gain efficiencies. My love for it increased as I went back to school and worked with C and all its thorniness. I remember writing my own (shitty) web server for a class and load tested it on a potato computer, watching it serve tens of thousands of requests per second without fail. Or writing and managing my own (shitty) message broker.\n\nThen over time, a lot of things changed. You no longer write and host your own web servers; you have AWS for that. Okay, fine, I thought. There's still a lot of value in managing your provisioned resources, trying to figure out what your tech stack looks like, etc.\n\nA few years later, everything now is either server-less or otherwise managed. Why spin up your own Kafka running on ECS when you can just use MSK? Do you really want to manage your own message broker while AWS offers ManagedMQ now? Any time I need some sort of service to set up, my infrastructure guys would just be like, \"Yeah, let's just use this managed service instead.\"\n\n(On one hand, I get it. If managing a service ourselves takes up 10% of an engineer's time, then it might make sense to go with a managed service as your startup scales. On the other, it's a lot less fun and I have fewer opportunities to bolster my CV.)\n\nAt that point, my life was basically coming up with the architecture to manage distributed systems, but a lot of my day-to-day was relegated to writing CRUD APIs. And that was fine, too. You want me to pay me how much money to just write code that essentially delivers your request to a database and returns you some data? Sure!\n\nBut now with AI around, even writing CRUD is being supplanted (as much as people on this sub think otherwise, I've personally used it and it gets 80% there most of the time). And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that this has increased my anxiety and existential crisis. So my question to you all is, what now?\n\nI was thinking maybe moving into technical product management or maybe looking into the various \"forward deployed engineer\" roles where I can leverage my technical skills while doing work that is unlikely to be replaced by AI. But I think back to what made me so interested in software engineering in the first place and I want to see what else is out there. So far, I've played around with running my own LLMs, writing my own agents, etc. But even that essentially is CRUD with a wrapper around it. Not to mention that space moves so quickly that with a job and a child, it's very difficult to keep up.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts and ideas. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the thoughtful responses. I did read through all of them, but didn't reply to most. I appreciate the insights and thoughts here. Been a member for a bit of time and there's always something interesting going on.",

For these, yes, it is CRUD all the way down, and the extra layers put varying degrees of facade on top of the database and/or intermediate layers.\n\nThat accounts for most software jobs out there, because there is always a need to manage inventory, employees, billing and so on. There are other kinds of software that aren't just a fancy spreadsheet that talks to a database, which do things like control robots, drive video cards, edit movies, or play games. These still have a lot of CRUD, but their non-business focus allows for more variety. \n\nAbout the fanciest coding I've found in a business application is the algorithm to convert a pair of latitude/longitude points into a distance (by approximating Earth as a sphere). The fanciest I've ever had to create from scratch was a means to calculate \"overtime\" *before* the time is worked. So it isn't good enough to check whether there *is* overtime, but to check whether *this next shift* would go into overtime. Maybe that sounds simple to you, but overtime rules differ by business and by state. California goes into overtime after 8 hours in a day, and double time after 12, while most states just go into overtime after 40 hours in a week. And this particular application allowed for customized overtime rules. AND this check had to happen on the database side in a query, because reasons, so the algorithm had to go into SQLCLR (C#/SqlServer architecture). ",

      "text": "I've an issue that's been gnawing at me for a couple of months. We were (somewhere in-between) a startup/scaleup that was acquired by a much larger business, with the promise of new devs, investment, all the good stuff. They have followed through with much of this, but we have found that the developers who have moved over really just seem to dislike the way that we work and it is effecting everyone's job satisfaction.\n\nI like to think that we have been doing Agile 'properly', with genuine dev ownership of the features that they're working on, proper refinement, estimates based on real world velocity, all that stuff. Pretty high quality code and skilled devs too. When we saw how the new guys were used to working, being given long, detailed requirements and churning out code without any input, we assumed that they would be desperate to join in and get really involved in the product....but they straight up hate it. \n\nThey want to sit in a quiet room, and convert prewritten requirements into code, no questions asked. They weren't writing a lot of tests, and reviews were done begrudgingly with minimal effort. Very little discussion between devs about their work. Seems a hellish way to work to me, but each to their own. \n\nShould we even care? It feels like they are poisoning the well somewhat, it's pissing off the original developers, who feel like these new people are only doing half the job, but they do turn up and complete features. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice about cultural mismatches? Is this simply something that we're going to have to accept as we grow as a company?",

One group has to adjust to the other, and anyone who can’t will be driven out.\n\n2. Two separate cultures. One group can work one way, the other group works the other way, and you kind of black box each other and compromise at the edges.\n\n3. Collaboratively come together and reconstruct the team culture to accommodate both. Both groups will need to adjust somewhat.\n\nOption 1 is atrocious for morale and productivity. Option 3 is the ideal but is easily the most difficult to pull off. Option 2 is often the most practical in my experience.\n\nOption 2 you do run the risk of the teams getting too disconnected, so it helps to have a senior who can work cross-culture and keep the groups aligned. I kind of live in that role in my current work. It can be a little frustrating - one side pushes for more defined requirements, the other side pushes for better quality and design, and each group is slightly puzzled by why the other does that. Often I just honestly fill the gap by making fairly arbitrary requirements to add quality or clarity as required by one or the other.

For example, for every release we were expected to fill out a form with 45 fields (I counted) and get it approved by 7 different managers, 2 business days in advance of the release. Even for hotfixes.\n\nThe company that acquired us was actually a vendor that we integrated with first. On their end, it took several teams about 3 weeks to complete the integration. The CEO had dinner with us shortly after the acquisition, and I remember pulling up the changelogs to prove to him that it took me 28 minutes from documentation in my inbox to code deployed in production.\n\nEven with that kind of proof, we couldn't resist their culture being forced onto our team.

          "text": "I was part of a company that was bought and of one that bought other companies...it never really worked out and I honestly don't see any solution how it could, especially from a mere worker.\n\nIn my current situation, I was coming from a startup and we were conditioned to get features out as fast as possible, testing and clean code be damned. This allowed us to match impossible timelines and make a lot of customers happy, but made it increasingly harder to onboard new people and the tech debt accumulated.\n\nTeams on the other end were on the opposite spectrum: Once some new version or technology is available, it's included and projects re-structured for it, everything was religiously kept up-to-date, lots of time spent in linter settings and whatnot. On the flip-side, features came out very slowly and often don't quite fulfill what the product needs.\n\nThere were attempts to somehow merge the solutions together and it always failed sooner or later. One side sees the other as snobs in an ivory tower who are so detached from the customers they don't see what creates actual business value. The opposite side sees them as inexperienced college students with no professionalism who need to be taught how to work properly.\n\nAt least in my team, coming from the \"gogogogo startup\", I definitely saw a need to change as way more people are now working in the code base and we have more protection from customers demanding everything yesterday. Also nudged things slowly into that direction to enforce tests and whatnot. But even when doing that, I could never quite shake the constant thought that ultimately, we need to deliver something to customers in a at least somewhat timely manner, and think about how to improve their experience instead of ours. So even when adjusting, it still clashed with the other culture, and they would start discussions about specific linter settings, how to name folders etc.. All things that I still view as a waste of time and will probably always. This will simply never work out unless one side gives in.\n\nSo imho: Either they exist in parallel or the people from the bought up company quit one after another. Haven't experienced it working out yet.",

Most of these people are fixated on 1-3-5 year visions where those drops in productivity are mere blips on a graph. Someone might still get canned during that time for the lack of productivity.\n\nHuman capital management is a disgusting term but I encourage people in software to understand this subject because what is happening in our industry is pretty much all to reduce the cost of our work.",

          "text": "Cultural mismatches after a buyout are rough, especially when dev expectations are wildly different. The challenge is that you can’t really force people to value collaboration if they’re used to waterfall and heads-down coding. Trying to push them into the old startup culture too hard usually just creates more friction.\n\nA few things that can help: Start by surfacing and openly discussing the differences, why did your team value ownership? Why do the new folks value work in isolation? Sometimes there are legit reasons, like burnout from endless meetings or just being more introverted or neurodivergent. You might want to agree on some non-negotiables (like test standards and code reviews) but be flexible on things like how much product input is expected from everyone.  \n\nTry running mixed retros where both groups can share what’s working and what isn’t. This helps people feel heard and can surface compromises. Assigning pairings or small-group quests (not just for code, but for cross-team bonding) can break down some barriers, tools like QuestWorks in Slack do this without forcing video calls, which helps for camera-shy or introverted devs.\n\nFinally, measure outcomes, not just process. If people are delivering quality code on time but not engaging much, maybe that’s okay. But if quality drops or the team fractures, that’s when you tweak the approach. Basically, you probably won’t convert everyone, but you can try for some gradual blending, and make sure the original culture doesn’t get drowned out in the process.",

Good places are getting to grips with this explicitly. Bad places will just get to the same bad destination they were always headed for, only quicker.\n\nThe default starting point: people should own every line of agentic code they’re submitting for review, in the same way that they would if they had written every line by hand.\n\nThe question is then when it’s OK to deviate from that. My take is that a major factor is how much the code and its embedding in the wider world is likely to change in the future, whether in itself or in what’s depending on it.\n\nSo if it’s a one shot prototype, or some closed end single purpose utility of limited scope, limited human scrutiny is way more justifiable than it is for code that’s going into, say, a continuously-developing library with dozens of continuously-developing applications using it.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that you can get a lot of value out of automated agentic review. Not just for bugs and documentation inconsistencies, but spotting duplication and high level conceptual mismatches. I think some degree of that should be applied even to the most one-shot, single-purpose, almost-certainly-non-evolving code, since the cost of doing it is so low.\n\nGood places will apply these kinds of principles and get a massive multiplier in throughout with no drop in average quality - possibly even an improvement in quality overall. Bad places will not, and will end up in a mess even more quickly than they did before.\n\nEither way, agentic coding and review is a multiplier, not some magic bullet that can substitute entirely for human judgement.",

      "text": "TL;DR: My company wants me to deliver what was scoped as a 3person backend project in the same timeframe, but alone using AI tools and I’m struggling.\n\nI work as a backend developer at a software company that builds turnkey applications for clients. Recently we signed a deal with a client for a finance app. The backend effort was originally planned as 3 devs over 3 months. The budget is agreed with the client, so that part is fine.\n\nBut my company is now insisting that I deliver the same work in the same time, completely on my own, with using ai. They’re very serious about it. I pushed back a lot at first, but given the market, I realized pushing too hard probably won’t help me, so I reluctantly accepted.\n\nI’m not new to ai tools I try to use them a lot which is probably why they picked me. But building a project from scratch like this with AI feels almost impossible. The app is a finance product that includes money transfers, and there are a lot of security and idempotency concerns I have to handle.\n\nI’m trying to keep the AI’s output in very small chunks and review everything, but I’m under huge time pressure. If I keep working like this, I’m sure it won’t be finished on time. When I try to go faster, I’m afraid I’ll end up with parts of the system where I don’t really understand what the AI produced and in a finance app, that feels risky.\n\nThis also made me wonder if this is what working as a developer is going to look like in the near futureconstantly being expected to do “3 people’s work” solo with AI. Maybe I’m just struggling, maybe others are doing it fine. If anyone here works like this, I’d really like to hear your advice.\n\nDo you think this is a temporary phase, or is this the new normal?",

So far I've felt deeply inadequate compared to my teammates. We are all completely new on this team but they've been able to turn out some functionality while I've been spinning water mostly because I've been working on cross-cutting concerns that are global across the application and it has been much harder to do with AI. But I still go home everyday at quitting time. But part of me thinks if I leave the team, they'll still be just fine turning it out. The code is not great but it's not absolutely terrible either. Because we'll hit this date, I think leadership will get good feedback that this actually works to rapidly turn out MVPs and then all new applications will start this way. I'm not going to be here long-term. It's just a matter of whether they cut me or I cut me.",

I can't commit to any particular time up front\"\n\nAfter scoping, or at any time during the project, if the dates start to look unrealistic: \"We're very unlikely to hit the requested scope by the target date. Let's talk about what scope to cut for an MVP\"\n\nThe key IMO is not to accept the premise that a given scope can always be delivered in a given time just because someone's asked for it. More \"my professional advice is that this isn't workable\" than \"I personally won't do it\". Don't get sucked into mind games.\n\nI am personally stubborn enough to lose a job over this (this hasn't actually happened yet though, I've chosen most employers wisely i guess), but I suspect this advice might apply even if you're not. After all, the alternative is overpromising followed by failure, right? Or the small chance of producing something good enough by crunching 60h+ weeks, but have you actually seen that bear fruit on death marches (as opposed to those rare inspired passion projects)? Will it be worth it compared to standing your ground a bit while polishing your CV?\n\nFWIW I don't think this behaviour from certain organisations and managers is new, nor is it AI-specific.

They have structured definitions, if you have samples, user manual you should expect very good implementations one shot, stripe is its own story but our friends in r/vibecoding have some tips around that. If you have indempotency and other constraints it is easier to build a loop that produces near production ready code. \n\nYou must use tools like claude code, codex or opencode that operates over the whole source code, and a good agentic model, so you can feed it entire features, you already have a base and you can ask to generate the code that follows the same architecture/patterns as your current code. You might also have your handcoded segments that you absolutely want to preserve and your base.\n\nAI is particulary useful for financial code, if you have input <-> expected result and a sketch of the algorithm you want to use, it is easy to generate tests that verify precisely.\n\nTry to follow your usual workflow, design the databse, create the model, the controllers and the frontend for example, experiment with big tasks, subdivide in phases, use plan mode. use e2e tests to verify the application.\n\n\\--------------\n\nAt the end of the exercise you will have VERY FAST a large part of the application but buggy as hell, the reality is that you will need the same 3 months and the same 3 devs, one vibe coding and the other two doing qa and solving bugs. Since it is a new  process you might need  even more time since the bugs the AI generate are always very strange and hard to spot, and some code must be written manually.\n\nYou are working with experimental technology that is very imperfect, you should talk to your boss about the expectations and risks, and have two dev/test by monday, make it very clear that the testing cycle is non negotiable and longer than traditional development. If (when) the project fails it is because the manager didnt put enough resources, not because of you. \n\nIn my experience financial algorithms even with known input/output and enough samples should be made manually, you really need a wingman for this project, you will be fighting context rot and lobotomized models, you need a person dedicated to make sure the financial data is OK.  \n\\-----------\n\nIn conclusion you should give the AI a chance, use codex/claude (or kimi/minimax) + opencode, the project will most likely require MORE resources than a normal project, expected since it is an experiment and will take 2x the amount of testing.",

One group was encouraged to use AI tools, and the control group was not allowed to use them. They were given the same tasks.\n\nThe outcome was surprising for both sides of the argument. The team with the AI tools was able to deliver new features something like 30% faster. There was no difference between the two groups in code quality, or time to perform maintenance tasks.\n\nObviously, this result flies in the faces of any AI companies claiming 10x (or even 2x) velocities. On the other hand, it demonstrate value when the AI tool is guided by competent developers.\n\nThe real question is though, if 30% gains for new features are what we can realistically expect, are the costs of training and inference really justified?\n\nAnother impressive headline out there is that someone let 16 agents loose to build a new C compiler in two weeks. It did accomplish the goal, but if you read past the headlines the story is far more nuanced than the marketers and CEO’s would have you believe.\n\nThe agents were guided with a very heavy hand, and were allowed to use GCC and other existing test suites to validate the product. The agents needed almost constant guidance and correction by a human. The result, while technically a passing C compiler, produced far worse object code than even GCC with all optimizations disabled. The linker is also was buggy. There were also most likely hundreds or thousands of C compilers in its training data, so this wasn’t the same sort of task that most organizations are going to be asking it to do. Most companies build bespoke software when free software isn’t available, and COTS software is too expensive or doesn’t meet their needs, i.e. the example solution isn’t already in the training data.\n\nAnd they burned $20,000 USD worth of tokens. In two weeks. If you gave four CS grads $5,000 USD each and asked them to give you a C compiler in two weeks, they’d probably be able to build you a low quality C compiler.",

I found it was exhausting trying to review thousands of lines of code carefully over a sustained period of time. I think I was probably doing the work of 2-3 people, so I think it's possible to do it. Just keep the PRs as small as you can so that it's always clear what exactly you're trying to achieve. Once you start having larger PRs with thousands of lines of code, it becomes impossible to maintain quality control. I would recommend writing E2E tests and preferring it to unit tests, and don't try to make the tests comprehensive. It can become bloated and lose its effectiveness if you're just churning out giant test files. It's better to carefully plan what you think needs to be tested the most and make sure those areas are covered well. Another thing which I think can be very helpful, is to spend a good amount of time in the planning phase. If you can research and write up good technical documentation -- even if it takes days -- you can use those as living documents that you can load into new sessions, and have Claude Code keep them up to date. If you maintain a well-planned tech spec, it can easily generate Jira stories and tasks for you and save you a lot of administrative headache.",

And judgment doesn't scale 3x just because you have faster typing.\n\nTrust me - I'm at a licensed fintech company and have seen over the last 10 years many companies go bust because RBI comes knocking and asks you to just shutdown. When you're dealing with money, the accountability layer isn't optional. The parts you \"don't really understand\" become exactly the parts regulators or security audits find.\n\nWhat your company is betting on: AI writes code fast, so 1 person = 3 people.\n\nWhat they're missing: The bottleneck was never typing speed. It's understanding what you're building, catching the bugs before production, and being able to explain it when something goes wrong.\n\nThe uncomfortable answer: Document everything. Every scope assumption, every risk you flagged, every \"do it anyway\" response. If this fails, you need the paper trail showing you raised concerns. If it succeeds, you've proven you can deliver under unrealistic constraints.",

My question here is more related to whether you have been able to find a better fit elsewhere. For some context...  \n  \nI use plenty of AI, it's a great tool when used properly. But my company is pushing for heavy amounts of usage. I had my performance review where I started talking about the projects and what I had accomplished. My manager had little interest in that and we mostly talked about how I could create better prompts and use the tools more, as well as their success stories with what they've been doing with AI. \n\nHonestly I really like the company otherwise, and I've been there 3 years. But this has been frustrating and I am considering leaving. **If you've been in a similar situation, have you been able to find a better role?**   \n  \nI'm hoping to hear that some of you folks have made a jump to a team that has reasonable AI expectations. But I'm worried that my situation is the norm. Thanks in advance. ",

The solution is to throw as many features at the wall as they can by means of “everyone should have at least 3 agents running all the time” (that’s an actual quote). More than half the engineers were either junior, weren’t engineers to begin with (CEO, etc) or were traditional researchers asked to build enterprise grade software. Badly prompted LLMs write so much slop, I think I spent most of my days reviewing and coaching/teaching others. Then came the mandate to switch to “if it works, ship it and put the review in the backlog so we can address it later” or “if you review someone’s PR just do the changes yourself and ship it”. The mantra on testing was “I built something and your test broke, can you fix your test?”. It’s wild to watch how everyone is burning out.",

I'd imagine there's a lot of companies/devs right now that are going through the same thing. \n\nPersonally, I use AI moderately throughout the day. Really as a replacement for Google/SO. And only ~1 out of 10 lines of code I publish are generated by AI. Right now, I don't think AI is good enough atm to generate enterprise level projects without having an experienced developer (and also a great team) behind the wheel. But, who knows what it will be like 5 years from now.\n\nAlso, I don't mind seeing these AI questions every day. This is one of the biggest changes/shifts in programming that I think most of us have seen. It's important to discuss it and stay up to date with how we feel about it.",

Stop eating sugary sweets and junkfood. Get enough sleep. Take naps if needed.\n\nMedium: get the body moving. If you haven't exercised for a while it will do a ton of good if you can go for a walk after lunch, small bike ride, or just hit the gym for a 30-60 min strength workout 2-3 times a week. I was at my best when I woke up at 4 AM, went to the gym from 4.30 to 5.30 and then to work at 6.30.\n\nHarder to see: ensure you're not context switching too much. It's a productivity killer that's also linked to burnout, loss of motivation etc. I'm an architect on two different teams 50\\\\50 and I often feel exhausted and right now I'm dealing with loss of motivation. Even today I wake up to two different messages, before lunch I have had to jump between four different tasks and looked at PRs with two more. Afternoon I have to jump between huddles to help people with different things.. It takes it's toll. I've tried closing down all my notifications, list specific tasks I need to focus on, maintain focus on only one team, take regular breaks. Not sure if I just need to be harder on myself and enforce those boundaries even harder and not check messages so often.\n\nAnother thing for the dark winter (I'm from the Nordics); check that you're getting enough light exposure. I bought a bright light for my desk as I started to notice signs of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is more common in places that have long stretches of darkness and not enough sunlight.\n\nIf all else fails, seek professional help if it gets bad enough.",

Caffeine binds to those receptors and blocks actual adenosine from signaling them.\n\nCreatine works by allowing ADP to become ATP again and that also means less lactic acid. You realize creatine works on the brain when you realize it becomes quite easy to climb the stairs and even fun and you have explosive power only after 2 weeks of taking creatine then you start to notice noticeable decline in brain fog.",

      "text": "I want to write a blog, but in 2026, it feels like blogging doesn’t mean anything. AI is everywhere, and people can ask and get answers instantly.\n\nI still want to write a blog. I want to share my knowledge and my opinion. But I’m scared. I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nLogically, I know I shouldn’t care about that. I can just write and put it out there for anyone to read. If they like it, they like it. If not, that’s okay. But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nSo I want to ask you all: should I do it or not? Even though I’ll probably do it anyway, I still want your opinions. In 2026, should people still write blogs?  \n\n\nEdit: I was inspired by all the wisdom, heart warming comments in the thread, so I wrote a blog about it:  \n[https://dhung.dev/blog/blogs-are-dead-im-writing-one](https://dhung.dev/blog/blogs-are-dead-im-writing-one)",

I have a huge knowledge based stored in Obsidian, but there’s no fluff in it, because, well, it is written for me: I don’t have to write the “obvious stuff”, nor does it have to cover a subject fully. I don’t have to write engagingly, because it’s a brain dump. I also don’t necessarily have to keep it up to date.\n\nWhenever I thought “oh, I’m sitting on all this, let’s just make a blog!” (and I did that numerous times)… it did not end well. I’d run into imposter syndrome, where I didn’t feel qualified enough to write about any subject. Or any post would take ages to write, because I felt it should cover the subject thoroughly (and correctly). Then it would go out of date, and I’d have to deal with updating it. All that effort, and then no visitors. Or worse: visitors leaving comments pointing out shortcomings. I found it exhausting.\n\nI am not you, you are not me. Your mileage may vary and I don’t want to discourage you; the only way to know is to try. But in a sea of “yeah you should” comments, I thought I’d share a different view. Hope it helps, good luck!",

I want to share my knowledge and my opinion. But I’m scared. I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nDo this. When you build your site, don't enable analytics, don't enable comments, if you share it avoid looking at upvotes, shares, likes, whatever. Force yourself to write for your own benefit and develop your own voice before you let an audience (or perceived audience) dictate it.\n\n> But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nYou said in the paragraph before that you wanted to share your knowledge and your opinion. That's meaning enough. If you need more meaning, look for it intrinsically: writing solidifies your knowledge, it builds your brand, and opens opportunities down the line if you're willing to be patient and put the work in.\n\nFor me, when I started in this career (2014) I already had a long tradition of note-writing from my previous life in academia. I write primarily to learn and understand things better, and early on I built a simple website. I kept writing about interesting projects, things I learned from work projects, and more. In early 2018, I saw a call for writing samples to write for Real Python, and I got my first paid writing gig. Fast forward to 2022 or 2023, and an acquisitions editor for O'Reilly reached out about doing \"Reports\" - short sponsored ebooks (30-40 pages) on technical topics. I did 2 of them, got familiar with the staff there, and then about a year ago I pitched them on a full-length book. Guess what I'm procrastinating from writing right now?\n\n(On top of that, I'm still blogging)",

Trying to get “everybody to actually agree on” what the real process is will NEVER happen, especially among opinionated developers who are very skilled at proposing alternatives and seeing pitfalls.   Management needs to assign leadership responsibility to somebody everybody respects.  That person says “These are the rules.  There may be debate, but these are still the rules until I say otherwise.   Your job depends upon helping us implement these rules, not arguing their suitability”.\n\nThat is hard.   Software people always want autonomy and “circles of talent” that work independently.   And for 90% of the time that’s appropriate.  So whoever does the leadership needs to know the difference between rules and directives that MUST be followed and must know how to allow people to have self-leading teams as well.  It’s not easy.   But if management does not INSIST on having such leadership in a software organization, they don’t know what they’re doing.",

Not what they think it is off the top of their head, what they actually do as they actually do it.  With screen shots or whatever, as if they’re writing docs, which they kind of are.  Doing a screen recording can help.\n\nThen get them together and hash out a synthesis of those individual versions of actual practice into something that can be an SOP.  Whenever there’s a decision made between multiple possibilities, write down not just the decided path but *why* that’s the path.  SOPs without reasons behind them are brittle because they’re hard to safely change.  People can’t tell if the reasoning is still valid in a new context.\n\nThen get people to commit to using the SOP, making comments on it as edge cases come up, and revisit periodically.   Repeat for other processes.\n\nThis is a PITA but it’s part of growth.  It is impossible to do things reproducibly, and very hard to consistently improve how things are done over time, without documentation about how things are done.

The \"why\" behind how things work is what's missing, and that's way harder to reconstruct than the \"what.\"  \n\n\nA few things that actually moved the needle for us:  \n**1. Stop trying to document everything at once.** Pick the 3-5 processes that come up most in audits/customer questions and start there. Boiling the ocean is how documentation initiatives die.  \n**2. Record the explanations you're already giving.** Next time someone asks \"how does X work?\" and you find yourself explaining it, write that down immediately after. You just produced documentation in the most natural way possible - when context was fresh and the audience question shaped your answer. Way better than sitting down to \"write docs\" in a vacuum.  \n**3. Make someone own the narrative, not just the system.** The reason you get inconsistent answers is nobody owns the *story* of how things fit together. Individual owners know their piece. You need someone (maybe you, maybe a senior IC) who can explain the whole picture - and whose job includes keeping that explanation consistent.  \n**4. Use the \"new hire test\" ruthlessly.** Before any process is considered documented, a new person should be able to execute it from the docs alone. If they can't, the doc is incomplete - no matter how thorough it looks.  \n\n\nThe fragility you're feeling is real.
