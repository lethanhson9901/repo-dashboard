      "text": "Hey yall,  just wanted to share something I did as an engineer that helped me grow. A lot of this might be useless to y'all but there are some things here that seemed obvious but I was not doing.\n\n**The basics**\n\n* Setup a monthly 1:1 with your skip. Make sure they know:\n   * what projects you've shipped, what you're currently working on,\n   * how you are helping the team grow.\n* Keep a running doc of your projects and impact.\n* Communicate more than feels necessary.\n   * early code reviews,\n   * early design discussions,\n   * bring up things that can go wrong early\n   * announce when somethings been released\n* Before picking up projects/stories I started asking myself:\n   * Who benefits from this work? Just me, my team, multiple teams, whole org, or the whole company?\n   * What artifacts are the end goals? Just code? Code + design doc? Code + design doc + demo?\n   * Who will know about this work? My team, my manager, my skip, other teams, leadership?\n   * I made sure to note all of this down.\n* After shipping something:\n   * Post an update to your team channel channel\n   * Update my manager and skip directly.\n   * Dont assume they saw the Slack post.\n   * Update my brag doc immediately. You will forget the details later.\n* Skip level prep I used to show up to skip levels with nothing to say. Now I prep three things:\n   * One thing I shipped they might not know about\n   * One thing I'm working on that connects to their priorities\n   * One question: \"What does great look like for engineers at my level?\"\n\nNone of this is complicated. But actually doing it consistently is what made the difference. I feel like a lot of is political, but definitely helped a ton in my year end reviews.\n\nCurious what worked for you all.\n\nEDIT:   \nAfter people shit talking in the comments:   \n\\- Meet skip quarterly, some skips don't even know their engineering team   \n\\- This was mostly USA Big Tech centered.   \n\\- Of course this is on top of your engineering, design skills.

It’s clutch when you need to do a self-review at performance time.  If you have an absentee manager or one with 5 or more reports not including you, having that information helps surface information for your performance evaluation, promotion packet, or even switching teams.  And of course it’s great for when you look to interview for roles at a new company.  That part I do think is worthwhile.",

I also don’t think you need to blast what you ship quite as much as you listed.\n\nHow often you should meet really depends on how senior you and your skip are imo. Telling an intermediate or junior engineer to meet their skip monthly is pretty unhelpful since:\n\n1. your skip probably has dozens or hundreds of engineers at your level under them; they are going to be more interested in what your manager thinks of your work than regularly meeting with you\n\n2. you will have your work cut out making sure your direct manager has visibility on your work, so focus on impressing them\n\nAt senior level it starts to be more useful since your Skip is going to weight in when it's time for you to start pushing to get to Staff. Meeting with them once a quarter or so will help keep you in touch with their priorities and remind them what you're working on - sometimes they will give you things to work on separately from what your manager is giving you.\n\nIf you're Staff+ it starts become really important, because whatever your level is, your skip probably doesn't have more than a handful of others at your level, and will want to keep regular tabs on what you're spending time on and giving you direction directly without having to go through your manager - you may even be at the same level as the manager you report to, and your skip is not necessarily waiting for your manager to get your promoted - they may push for your promo before they push for your manager's promo.\n\nSo at that point, if your day to day work isn't giving your opportunities to talk with them at least monthly, it's worth actually scheduling 1:1s monthly.",

But if you're Staff or higher, your skips are going to be VPs and Directors, if not C-suite. They do not have dozens of Staff as their skip-reports, they do want to in touch with what you're doing without solely going through your manager.\n\nFor most of the past year I've been meeting with my skips multiple times a week - not because of 1:1s but because they want to stay close on a few key projects *their* skips-level managers (ie the CEO and his immediate team) want. Keeping them updated isn't my manager's job, he has his own priorities and they sync up with him on those, but they also sync up with me on the stuff they directly give me.",

They're going to prioritise highly visible tasks over less visible, but more important work, they're going to spend half the day spamming their accomplishments and the rest of it planning their spam.\n\nSo this advice starts junior engineers who are promotion grubbing psychopaths who aren't team players and don't actually spend time learning the technology or doing the hard graft to get working systems. They they get promoted into leadership roles who expect their reports and their report's reports to engage in this same behaviour while doing the same themselves and so everyone is focusing on highly visible tasks and brown nosing their boss' boss and no one's doing the work.\n\nAnd we wonder why these big tech companies are product graveyards cramming AI into every possible place and whose remaining products are getting worse and worse and worse. It's because their entire technical leadership is made up of people like OP who not only don't give a shit about the actual work or products, but don't even know what the work or products look like.\n\nIn actual engineering disciplines promotion means being the person who's neck is on the line that everything will go as it should, in our industry it means being the biggest sociopath and the least qualified.\n\nAnd for what? At most companies the salary difference here isn't even that significant and half the time you'll get a title bump you didn't earn so they don't have to give you a pay rise.\n\nSure at FAANG this shit really matters, but that's why FAANG products are so God damned bad and most of us do not and will never work for one of those companies.",

These might seem like small things, but having team members who can provide effective project updates is definitely not something to be taken for granted.\n\nUnlike what other comments are saying, I’ve noticed that these tips fall into the 'soft skills' category, something that technical profiles unfortunately tend to undervalue, only to complain later when their daily work life doesn’t improve.\n\nAs for the rest of the team, this isn’t 'hell' for them, nor is it a way to overshadow others. On the contrary, some of the junior and mid-level developers I’ve mentored eventually followed this example, they gained more trust and credibility from managers while still maintaining a great team atmosphere",

The goal here is to make it easy for your management to get the information they need. But if you do it like the OP suggested, it's simply too much redundancy in communication. No need to blast your manager, you presumably have 1-on-1s with them, you can share it then. No need to blast it to your team either, you work with them. No need to have *monthly* updates for your skip. You should tone it down.",

Jira is a pain in the ass to query for that, and it will miss a few things. I maintain an ongoing OneNote page for every sprint, updated daily to prep for scrums. Easy to jot down the good, the bad, and the ugly ahead of the sprint retro. It also makes it easy and quick to review ahead of my official performance review.",

I only keep rough notes, but every couple of months I use ChatGPT to talk about my projects, and summarize the whole thing by asking \"how should I write this up into my review\". Within a review period, I tend to remember everything I do. Afterall, a good review for us is really just one big byline, all those small wins only count if they aggregate towards something big.\n\nI'm a Senior at a big tech company, I'm leading a team right now, but I'm realizing that my job is not just doing great work, but doing great work that also comes across well.\n\nI do like these points, but man, it gets tricky to actually do all these things. For instance, I was just assigned to lead a team taking over some AI Agents. Sounds good, like we're on the edge using the cool new thing, but it's a project where we don't own the problem, are given the solution, and don't have pull to really cancel things. I asked my manager for a \"phase 0\" validation since the leading indicators are poor or just lack data, and they basically said: \"don't worry about that, we'll handle that, focus on getting these done\". F man, it's great they are thinking in the same direction, but it means this entire doc I wrote up is structurally out of my hands, and we're being used as fungible execution resources.\n\nThe solution here, at least for me and my team, is that we need to shift the narrative. I can't say \"no\", but I can own the technical roadmap, silently continue to gather evidence until a problem shows up (even if a full validation phase isn't possible), then shift the narrative from \"they are executing that existing plan\", to \"they identified key problems, are working it now, and saving/transforming the project's impact\".\n\nThe biggest thing, as a senior trying to reach for staff, is to always have a good answer for the counterfactural: \"what would have happened on project X without the contribution of u/justUseAnSvm ?\". That answer must always be something big, something that effects direction, or reduces risk through an insight I own.",

From a leadership perspective, most companies will want to see people contribute to the readiness of the department amongst top performers.\n\nTraining sessions or tech talks to get everyone to the same level, or develop specific engineers, is the most common option. Flavor of the month is effective/responsible AI use.\n\nAnother option is taking a best practice that your management wants done everywhere are a certain level and making that happen. Target things that have been pain points. Some of this may be shit work to a degree but you are there to get important shit done.\n\nAn example might be every team using CI/CD, or every team having security scanning of dependencies.

I was recently at a company party and my *skip's manager* (my boss' boss' boss?) walked up to say hi and talk about something I've been working on about 2 months, an I was fairly shocked they had any idea as it's not anything groundbreaking functionality I'm working on.\n\nWhere I work slack groups e.g. \\\\@YourTeamName include your skip, so if you were to just tag your team for a release in your team's channel (which is completely normal) they'd have a notification they can look at on their own time - but tagging them directly sound really weird.\n\nThis honestly seems like a failure on managements part, software work already includes like 20000% more beurocracy and logging than it needs to precisely so the infinite layer of middle managers can have visibility on every breath you take, I mean your work of course.",

In my case projects are like creating a dialysis machine for FDA approval, which takes years to do.  Sure there are multiple epics that get completed in a year, but nothing can really be \"shipped\" until the greater product is in the right state to ship.\n\nFor example, just because subsystem A reaches \"done\", doesn't mean it it can be shipped until the rest of the subsystems are also done.  It would be like saying they infotainment system in a car is \"done\", but the teams creating the engine are still working.  You cannot really \"ship\" the infotainment system on it's own, so it just sits there until the rest of the \"project\" catches up.\n\nIs \"projects\" really epics in the context I am familiar with?",

The manager presented but would call out individual engineers that did something impactful or the engineer responsible for the project did the demo. Our skip + director attended every one of these meetings.\n\nIf you wanted a promotion, you just had to ask where you stand at your level on impact, code production and project artifacts (designs, architecture, etc). If you wanted to grow you just tell your manager you want to lead a project that is on the roadmap. As long as your manager thinks you're capable you get the all clear.

          "text": "Hi. One of jobs I do is as a technical/business advisor to CEO of a very successful startup.\n\nI would suggest:\n\n1. Do not contact your employer about the project in any way for now. They do not need to know. There is no benefit to contacting them, but there is a negative in that they can behave irrationally and claim ownership of your project even when they do not have legal claim. Most importantly, you can lose your job and they can bog you down with legal problems at the time when you are most vulnerable.\n2. Hire a lawyer and go over your contract with your employer and over what you are doing in your project. The lawyer will be best positioned to advise you on any potential risks and how to protect your new business.\n3. Make sure you do no part of your side project in your official working time or with any tools/materials/licenses/inside knowledge/contacts provided through your employer. Make absolutely sure of that. You may want to keep some kind of evidence (logs of when you work on one or another, etc.) to substantiate your claims in the future.\n4. Keep your day job as long as possible as this is probably best way to minimize your risk. As long as you have a normal day job, you are free to develop your side project at a pace that is comfortable to you and you are immune to majority of the risk that the side project does not work out. Being pressed for time is major reason people make stupid decision. Give yourself time.\n5. Do not take outside funding (see the reason above). I suggest that as long as you do not have outside funding and as long as you have a day job, you have ability to make your own decisions about how to grow your project.\n6. Be frugal. The less you spend on your business, the lower your risk. Spend only when you need to grow your business. Do not spend money speculatively (like buying tools you \\*may\\* need in the future) -- only buy what you need and when you need it.\n7. If the load to maintain your project becomes too large for you to handle in your free time, you do not necessarily need to leave your day job. You can, for example, hire contractors on Fiverr or something like that to get stuff done that would take you a long time to get done.\n8. Most businesses die at early stage. Managing your risks preserves your ability to dust yourself off and build another business if this does not work. More importantly, being frugal and reducing your risks actually improves the chance that you will succeed.\n\nAnyway, good luck with your business!",

Pretty much everybody who avoided funding was very thankful that they did.\n\nThe moment you take funding, all your decisions now have to take that into account. If you take a loan, now you are forced to become successful by some point in time. That causes people to leave their day jobs (because they feel they need to put all their effort into it) and overspend on things and compromise quality and so much other problems.\n\nThere will be people who will try to give you money but remember that they almost never have \\*your\\* interest in mind. They have money they want to multiply and any money invested will come with strings attached regardless of what they say.\n\nAnd now for the biggest reason IMHO:\n\nBuilding a business is all about learning. As you grow it, you learn a bunch of stuff. But if you take funding, you no longer have time to learn at your own pace, you have to do stuff quickly which means you can't focus on learning. And this is bad, bad, bad... because, see, building a business should be \\*all\\* about learning.",

So TL;DR ask around and check your HR docs, there might be a process for this. \n\nPersonally I had a similar situation and had already setup things where I stuck to my hobby's \"company\" name and semi-anonymous (but traceable) reddit posts and I never really changed it even w/ my new company's willingness to accept. From a business standpoint this approach makes a lot of sense for your company, if everything is out in the open they can make sure it's kosher, and the same sort of ppl that can launch a decent side gig b/c they love building shit also tend to make great employees, not good to piss them off or stress them to leave.",

That went along with verbage that recognized my inventions as belonging to me.\n\nSo they handed me a large contract that claimed the sun, the moon and the starts, and even though I was pretty sure it wouldn't hold up in court, if I had just blinding signed it like a lot of people did, I'm sure I would be giving them a LOT of leverage over me in the event a side project of mine came to their attention and any dispute arised.\n\nAs to all the changes I made to it, they just accepted it without pushback.

I maintain multiple projects and engagements, particularly those that generate direct revenue.\n\nI manage my LinkedIn presence carefully. I am involved in a number of projects that are not publicly disclosed. Even when I exited a prior MSP engagement, I was already serving in advisory or board-level capacities with other organizations.\n\nIn one instance, a project I introduced to a company involved a partner organization where I already held a decision-making role. My involvement in that relationship was intentionally kept anonymous.\n\nThis approach continues today, and it is shared by my partners.\n\nWhen joining a new project, I am transparent about my ability to generate leads and introduce strategic relationships. This is supported by my ongoing involvement with multiple companies at the board or advisory level.\n\nIt is common for legal teams to closely monitor employees, including after departure, to identify and assert claims over background IP. This is a standard risk-management practice.\n\nWhen a potential conflict of interest arises, or when a project is positioned for significant growth, I make a point to formally and respectfully conclude my existing engagement before publicly announcing any new role.",

Also as new tech emerges, you have to ironically jump through more hoops to find people to talk to about how to use a new library, gadget, etc since AI will often just make shit up and/or gaslight you. \n\nHowever, that all being said, stackoverflow, just before chatgpt coming out, was already turning to shit. A lot of people marking threads as duplicates for no reason, and sometimes just straight up bullying for lack of knowledge. It's like, no wonder chatgpt dusted stackoverflow, it provides a judgement free zone where you can just say the most wrong thing possible and maybe get corrected.  \n\nBut stress on \"maybe get corrected\", because I've had juniors confidently say incredibly wrong things because chatgpt told them the right information for the wrong question.

No. The ai tool is still LLM based, so the generated code can (and likely will) contain subtle bugs. \n\nWhat's worse tho is that unless you create tiny apps that fit in 1 file, your code lives inside a bigger project, a larger codebase. Your 'new feature' likely works together with a lot of functionality already there. Adding new features in codebases like that takes more effort than just generating code for just that feature; changes ripple through.

Repeat\n\nThe result is that eventually 80% of your time should be spent on step 3 where you formulate the plan and then only 20% on all the other steps. You may also find that you start growing beyond the plan file into developing a “codebase” of documentation. Your job becomes managing and writing the documentation plus reviewing the code, and writing code only when it’s a simple change or when you need to unravel some problem that Claude created and that your reviews let slip.\n\nAlso, I find it easier to iterate with Claude on documentation than on code. Claude writes cleaner code the fewer iterations it makes on any implementation, so you want to really focus on iterating a plan and discarding the code when it’s wrong.",

If I hated that I'd have become a manager years ago.\n\nI get the feeling most people who are in favor of AI tools for development work on web frontends: lots of training data was available, the output seems reasonable and I can understand why people don't want to write JS by hand at times. However backend systems, game engines, complicated desktop apps... the picture is completely different there. Example: for my .NET ORM (LLBLGen Pro) I worked for more than a year full time on the Linq provider (which converts ASTs into command trees which are then used to generate SQL. The ASTs are produced by the C#/VB.NET compilers by generating code that builds them at *runtime* and are called Expression trees, so they exist at runtime). There wasn't (and still isn't) alot of documentation how to do this properly and the code that was there, was hard to understand complicated code. There are many corner cases to deal with (e.g. Linq's Group by has different scoping than SQLs so you have to interpret the tree to properly convert it at the right places, introducing projections etc.). \n\nWould an LLM be able to build that for me? No. I doubt it ever will. It's niche, I know, but I like it as an example of a complex system that requires a lot of work on many levels to make it work. The run-off-the-mill CRUD app might be an ideal case for LLM based AI tools, other complex tasks might be a bridge too far and always will be.",

They learn by identifying patterns in data, which allows them to generate new outputs by leveraging their internal parameters. This means that while you won't necessarily receive the most optimal or innovative code, you'll get solutions that reflect the **average** quality and approaches present in the training data.\n\nTherefore, you should employ machine learning in scenarios where **average** is acceptable. For instance, ML can be beneficial for *generating initial drafts of unit tests* or *creating functions that address common problems*. Additionally, ML can be useful in *identifying architectural errors* and *potential vulnerabilities* in code. You may also want to ask improvements to your existing code, to *learn and improve*.\n\nIf you use AI to generate full-blown, production-ready applications, oof. Don't do that.

They can upload contract language, we identify the clauses in the contract, provide some enrichment from internal and external datasets, score each clause using a combination of heuristics and ML, and provide an LLM generated top-line with citations.\n\nWe wanted to make these citations a bit more “rich”: add some icons, some conditional highlighting, some onHover behavior, etc.\n\nIt required some changes to our underlying datamodel, some new parsing logic, pipeline updates, then a bunch of wholey-new frontend components.\n\nI had a bunch of this already in my head. I knew which datamodel changes I wanted to make, and I knew how to write the parsing logic I wanted. I spent a morning writing a TDD for these changes. I sent it around to my team for comments. I used Claude Code with Opus 4.5 to plan out the tickets: I knew it would be like 5-8 tickets, but wasn’t sure *all* of the files I needed to touch, and wanted to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Took me about an hour to get all the tickets written to the level of detail I wanted.\n\nAfter that was done, and I’d reviewed my team’s comments, I started working through the tickets.\n\nI implemented the parsing logic myself, I made the datamodel changes and ran migrations. I used Claude Code to bang out the pipeline changes in the meantime. Took me about an hour to write my bit, I checked in on Claude Code every 15min or so to make sure it was moving in the right direction.\n\nThen, I spent about 10-15min reviewing its PR (not really a PR, I had it in a local git worktree, but same idea). Backend changes all look good to me.\n\nI push the branches to get CI going, tag a coworker or two to review. I start on the frontend tickets.\n\nFor these, I point Claude Code (still Opus 4.5) at each Linear ticket, and give it the TDD I wrote as context. I point it at the Figma mocks our designer made.\n\nI check back in on CI for the backend PRs. I ask Claude Code to write some new unit tests covering the backend work. I review them. I edit a few, add one for an edge case it missed. I push.\n\nSwing back to the frontend agents. Fire up the website locally. It doesn’t look right. I tell Claude Code it needs to match the mocks *pixel perfect*. It churns for 5min. Ok, now it matches.\n\nI spend 20min reviewing the frontend changes while CI runs. I add three new end-to-end tests. Everything looks good to me, I tag a coworker in a PR for awareness, set GH to automerge.\n\nMy mental model for Claude Code right now is basically “we are all tech leads”. I spend pretty close to zero time actually *writing* code in vim. Instead, my time is all pre-work and architecture, and code-review. To be fair, this is basically how my job *has* been for the last couple years: figure out what *should* be done, delegate, review what comes back. I think it’s actually made me a more rigorous tech lead because Claude can be super stupid sometimes. It means I have to think about what might be misinterpreted in my tickets, forces me to be really explicit about when I care about certain system specifics, and when I don’t. It means my people-engineers get better-scoped, more detailed plans from me as well.\n\nLater, we want to add the same citations frontend behavior to another part of the website. I didn’t bother writing a ticket — I just pointed Claude at it. “Make this field like XYZ other field, only use existing components and logic.” 3min later, PR ready to merge. I didn’t bother reading the code, just opened the website, made sure end2end tests were passing. Pushed, set to automerge.\n\nMaybe this is vibe coding, maybe it’s going to bite me in the ass. We’ll find out.\n\nIt takes a decent amount of work up-front. I put a lot of work into our test harness. My team’s quite defensive about changes there. It forces me to spend much more timing writing english and reviewing code. But I find that I end up with better process documentation. And honestly, “being an IC” and “being a tech lead” seem like they’re basically the same job to me.",

We have no juniors, everyone’s got minimum 5 years experience. Now I’m back to being an IC, but I think I’m basically bringing my tech lead workflow with me. Part of it is that at my current startup everyone on the team own certain products/initiatives, and borrows small parts of each other’s time. So we all sorta act like the lead for some things, and the IC for others. Having a lot of written material makes it easy for us to stay on top of what everyone else is doing.\n\nOnce we start hiring juniors/interns, I’m not sure how I’ll coach them to use LLMs. Seems tricky and it’s a bridge I haven’t crossed yet.\n\n2. Since we’re prototyping/shipping quite quickly, it’s quite important that we can refactor freely. One thing we experiment with quite a bit is our internal datamodels and some of our API contracts. To give us confidence that we aren’t breaking anyone up/downstream, we spent a bunch of time thinking through some truly end-to-end customer workflows. If they can come back green, we know our system works, even with significant refactors to big parts of our system. With this product we’re at the stage where we want to make breaking changes maybe every week, maybe multiple times a week. Having a strong test harness makes me more confident, and I also think it’s a useful piece of documentation (like a good README) to point the LLMs at in terms of explicit “intended system behavior”. You can often do stuff like “make ABC tests pass, you may not modify the tests”, and that helps bound the LLM a bunch. End-to-end works particularly well, as unit tests can get stale pretty quickly as we modify architecture and internal behavior.",

Imagine someone enters \"no peanuts\" on their order.  A human can read this, but that fails at scale.  Imagine if we could tag allergy concerns, so \"no peanuts\" and \"extra spicy\" have different urgencies?  Or if they said \"swap the chicken for shrimp\" - we want to call them and confirm the extra $$ on the order.  \n\nSo, we have a process which takes a newly submitted menu and queries the LLM. *\"You are a food preparer.  Given this menu and these comments, please read each comment and tell me if they're about allergies, potentially change the cost of the order, or are very negative. Return your answers as structured JSON\".*\n\nThis works amazingly well. Customers aren't exposed to AI slop.  Even if it's not 100% accurate, it's incredibly useful.

I enjoy coding and I don’t want to have a tool code my important logic for me and if I absolutely need the help I walk through the code step by step and make sure I understand it. \n\nWhat makes me use AI is when I have spent at least an hour trying to find documentation that better explains an error I’m finding or a solution with one of the build tools I use. I work in the embedded space and I have two build systems, Yocto and CMake. Yocto has a lot of lackluster documentation with no examples and lots of syntactical sugar that is not straightforward. Most of my times using AI have been because I could not figure out how to use some obscure feature in Yocto. This is largely since the space around Yocto is largely proprietary (how many open source embedded OSs are being made?) so you just don’t see a lot of examples or really any documentation when you get into obscure problems. Even then I have had AI fail on me but it did help me generate new ideas I couldn’t see. \n\nI have also used it once for CMake help when I could not figure out how to package and deploy a header only file for Conan2. I don’t recall well if AI helped or looking at Eigen3’s Conan config helped more.\n\nI have gotten so much junior code that they could not explain that was clearly written by AI that I cannot justify using it. Maybe it increases the individuals velocity but it does not hold under scrutiny of code review and wastes other people’s time. I’ve held PRs for weeks as they try to vibe code to meet expectations. I admit it would be easier if we had code quality CI/CD but that’s a battle that has been fought and lost in my code base.",

          "text": "I use AI constantly now, but for me there is a big difference between vibe coding and let’s call it “AI assisted programming”. \n\nLet’s firstly talk about vibe coding. I tried to vibe code a small statistical dashboard for our app. To be honest I achieved what I wanted to achieve, it shows all the data it looks ok, nothing fancy. I spent approximately 6 to 8 hours to do this. Which previously would take me maybe like 3 to 5 working days. So it’s really a noticeable speed up. But. The code is absolute fucking garbage and I absolutely don’t trust it. It’s cool as a demo, but I wouldn’t push this to prod. Also, I still used my knowledge as programmer. I told the AI how ETL pipeline should be structured, even though the code is garbage I still managed to have some separation of concerns there. But still, mine influence on the code was relatively minimal.\n\nBut when it comes to “AI assisted programming” that’s completely different thing. So here I’m more in control and I would create the structure, set everything up and I would just outsource the “boring part” to AI. For example, you just need to develop another simple feature, that doesn’t require much thought. It’s pretty clear how to implement it and you can explain to AI how it should be done. Yes, go ahead and give it to AI. But you see, for this you need to understand the structure of the existing code. In tools like Cursor/Claude code when prompting I quite often tag specific files where changes need to happen and tell it to reuse specific functions. AI is actually very good at solving small, structured and limited problems. Yes, people are too. But still even to mechanically type it and think about small details will take you like several hours, but with this you heavy it ready in 10 minutes.\n\nActually, I have like a rule of thumb to understand if I’m vibe coding or I do “AI assisted programming”. If I can’t review all the code that is generated by AI, and I don’t fully understand it, then it’s 100% vibe coding.\n\nAnother big thing what I use AI for is understanding different code bases. At work, and I work in a big corporate, we have a lot of different repositories that I need to use from time to time. And being in a big corporate means that in 90% of cases it’s much simpler and faster to figure things out on your own than trying to find the right person. So we have company approved Claude code. And I use it to understand what this code base does, how it works, and what parameters I should use. \n\nAnd another thing, is writing small throw away scripts. So there is a joke that programmers would spend 3 days automating things they can manually do in 30 minutes. Well, now with AI you can actually automate it in 5 minutes. And for such things I don’t even use AI code editors. I just ask ChatGPT or other to write script and I’ll copy paste it.",

          "text": "I started a project a few months ago to explore this very question: https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun\n\nIt's a functional programming language that transpiles to JS.  I don't necessarily intend to push for its usage, but it's meant to be complete enough that it _could_ be used.  I wanted a project with real world complexity that involved domains where I don't have deep knowledge (compilers, type systems, etc.).  It's been on hold for about a month due to RL, but the language design is probably 95% complete and the compiler is at about 80%.  The code is 100% written by Claude Code.  Probably about half Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5.\n\nWhat I'm finding is that it's surprisingly (even shockingly) capable.  But you MUST tailor your approach to work within the capabilities of the AI.  From my experience so far:\n\n* As always the hard part is the requirements.  Several times on this project I had to step back and work out more detailed requirements for the language and/or compiler (still using Claude) because _I_ could see that we were trying to implement something too vague.  Claude will sometimes ask questions when it realizes more detail is needed, but it's never going to tell you \"we need to stop and rethink this entire plan.\"\n* You must leverage CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.  Not just for understanding your code base and standards, but helping the agents navigate and maintain complex parts of the code and repo.  For example the docs/spec (language spec documentation) in my project.\n* You must add all the guardrails you possibly can - strongly typed languages, linters, etc. and you must make sure they're required.  CLAUDE.md isn't enough.  Git hooks aren't enough, Claude knows that it can bypass them with `HUSKY=0 git commit..`.  I added a [Claude hook](https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun/blob/main/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-verify.sh) to block it from committing without passing checks.\n* You must test the hell out of the code base.  My project is about 75% test code and has 90% coverage.  It's not just validating functionality, it's more documentation to tell the agent how the code is supposed to work AND more guardrails to catch problems if the agents starts to go nuts when refactoring or changing functionality.\n* You MUST have multiple layers of checks.  I have Claude form a plan and save it (see `.claude/archive` for examples), then usually have at least 2-3 clean sessions review and revise the plan.  After implementation have a clean session audit the implementation for completeness.  I also have Claude set up in github actions to review PRs (recently set up CodeRabbit tho haven't really used it yet) and it has absolutely pointed out problems with PRs.  Claude Code can use the github CLI to review feedback and update the PR, which is pretty nice.  You need all of this because no matter what you do the agent will sometimes just do whatever the hell it wants - decide that part of the work will be deferred to later, decide that a linter or type error can just be marked with a TODO, or that failing tests are ok because they represent \"pre-existing problems\", etc.\n\nAlso, it's gonna cost money unless you're very casual.  When I started I was on the $20/month plan, it took less than 90 min of coding to hit limits.  I bumped to the $100 plan and have been ok with it, only came close to hitting the limits once when I tried running 3 sessions simultaneously with worktrees.  That gave me a serious headache tho, not interested in doing it regularly.\n\nIf I was starting a new greenfield project with complete control over the technical direction I'd seriously consider vibing it with Claude.  But what does this mean for existing code bases, especially messy legacy code with poor structure, no tests, etc.?  That I don't know, and I think it's going to be very challenging to effectively integrate agents into those code bases.  Unfortunately my day job only allows Copilot, so I haven't been able to explore that aspect very much.",

Whether that's to gather information - I have Github MCP hooked up to Copilot - so Copilot can gather any historical context or whatever that I might need, or just ask Copilot to do the task for me and see where it gets. \n\nSimple tasks it will just one-shot. I need to review the code and handle the PR workflow and deployment and all that stuff, but the code change is all done by AI. \n\nMore complex tasks, it will handle all the leg work of investigating legacy code and making the required code changes. Quite often the changes are not 100% correct, so I ask it questions to verify it's reasoning and sometimes adjust the code myself. \n\nIn a PR workflow, I now consider it rude and wasteful to ask for human reviewers before getting a Copilot review. \n\nI also use AI for answering questions from Product Managers. eg \"How does <xyz> feature work?\" -  Copilot is absolutely great for these kind of tasks. \n\nThis is just scratching the surface.\n\nI've also built a number of personal projects using OpenAI codex using a relatively obscure tech stacks (Rust + Dioxus or Bevy) which it handles absolutely brilliantly. It does make mistakes, but they're surprisingly human mistakes like a few compile errors after a big change, which it then fixes in 1 or 2 attempts.   \n  \nMy personal projects have become much more ambitious and high quality. What would have taken weeks or months is now taking days or hours, seriously. \n\nA big part of the improvement is not having to pour through sketchy documentation and blog articles trying to piece together the correct way to do something, the AI *just does it.*",

I basically do a full pr review of it and have the AI explain the decision making process on different parts. I tweak the hell out of anything produced, but am grateful AI can show me the baseline solution to bugs or features.\n\nOne thing I did the other day using Codex (chatgpt extension for VS code) is ask it to look through my entire codebase and point out things that are janky or non-standard. This was extremely helpful to find areas I needed to clean up, discover features I didn't know existed in libraries I was using, and also find obscure bugs I would not have noticed otherwise. There were some things it found however which I knew were false flags and I was able to filter those out. \n\nI saw a post on an adjacent sub about a CEO firing their devs and thinking they can vibe code their app. They are going to have an extremely bad time if they are not an experienced dev who can review what AI spits out.\n\nThis is my experience as someone with 9yoe, half of that at an extremely recognizable tech company.",

          "text": "I use it in two settings: exploration and coding. \n\nWhen I'm first deciding how to set something up I often start with a convo with Claude. Asking questions about libraries or services I could use, trade offs, capabilities. For example I once asked for a reverse proxy like nginx but something better documented and more opinionated and it suggested caddy. I evaluated caddy, decided it was indeed what I was looking for and I've been using it ever since.\n\nFor coding I use cursor, either through its UI or a custom cli tool I wrote. If through cursor UI, I'll ask for something in broad strokes, like adding an onboarding flow and explaining the pages I want, then for changes like a better component organization or interface adjustments. Eventually I reach diminishing returns and finish and polish whatever it wrote. LLMs always write more than is necessary and cleanup needs to happen to manage project complexity.\n\nThe main value here I think is rapid prototyping. Even for old projects, you sometimes add new things to it and telling an LLM to build it from scratch in a few different ways can quickly test feasibility. Much gets thrown out in these cases anyway. Just, when you've found the approach you prefer, it's important to rework and test and simplify whatever was generated and not just merge it in.\n\nFor the custom tool, I just use that when I'm doing rote work. It's kind of an experiment with getting LLMs to build things more reliably, more info here:\n\nhttps://workflows.saf-demo.online/\n\nIt's basically a way to generate boilerplate then run prompts and checks automatically. It's the only way that I can see where I can have these tools build something non trivial without constant supervision or massive tech debt.",

I then go through a review process with the LLM where I read, ask for corrections, ask questions to get understanding of what it meant, etc.  When I'm satisfied, I copy that into my Confluence design page.  I do a couple more rounds of review and polish there, then present it.  It is so much faster than before I had the LLM assistant and I end up being more grounded in the design because of the review process I did with the LLM.\n\nAnother project I have set up (instructions plus context persisted for all chats in that project) that will generate code from that design.  Again, I go through a review and polishing process with the LLM until I'm ready to try to build and unit test.  With this one, I've learned that ChatGPT tends to overengineer and it's a process of getting simple.  \n\nOne is for code reviews.  It has our standards and templates for context and generates a compliance checklist.  Again, I always go through a review and refinement process before I'm done.  \n\nI have others to help with the repetitive tasks, and then I'll spin up an ad hoc chat when I'm needing to bounce something off 'someone' else.  \n\nI've only been using it for a few months, am a senior dev with more than 30 years experience in my platform/dev stack.

          "text": "I've been using ChatGPT extensively since it came out and I feel like it really improved with their thinking models. Today it is usually much better and quicker than just searching on Google.\n\nAs a coding assistant, it became better and better over time. Initially I was just copying code from my machine to ChatGPT and some context, which was super annoying and slow.\n\nI remember trying out Codex (or Claude Code (?), don't remember) at the beginning of this year or in the early part of the summer and wanting to try out just how much could I push these models and how heavilly I could rely on them to do most if not all of the coding work. The first 2 hours were really impressive but then the code became full of design problems / code smell / repeated slightly different versions of code. It would also get stuck in edit/unedit loops (e.g. make change X, doesn't work, revert change X, doesn't work, do change X, repeat).\n\nSo I didn't try these agnetic models after that, until in the middle of November this year when I had an ambitious, low-ish risk project project at work and I had read these models had greatly improved. So I thought about doing the exact same thing, that is see how far I could push these models and check out how heavilly I could rely on them. So I tried Codex once again.\n\nLong-story short: At this point in time I don't think I ever need to write code ever again for mainstream programming language work. These models have improved \\_A LOT\\_ over these few months.\n\nI'd plan the project with ChatGPT 5.something Thinking and Pro and construct a \\`PLAN.md\\` that I'd then have Codex work off of.\n\nAnd it turned out really well. I was very cautious first. Checking all the edits it made and vetting all of them. Criticising the code it wrote or the reasoning for writing the code. I then slowly let that go and just wanted to see how fast we could possibly progress. Turns out I was the biggest bottleneck in getting features out.\n\nAs the project grew and started working, there were tons of features I wanted to add to it and when I reached a point where the work could be done in parallel I would run multiple agents working on different parts of the code base that don't intersect with each other. Now I've reached a point where that is too slow (e.g. having multiple agents working on the same code base) as they step onto each others toes when implementing features, and I am figuring out how to proceed (e.g. each agent runs on its own container and has a copy of the code base and the something-something merge requests, etc.)\n\nIt was also super addicting.\n\nBut as you do it for 12 hours a day for a few weeks you start to notices the issues and quirks of Codex, e.g. it would sometimes just want to delete the contents of your files, get stuck in edit/unedit loops (where something is broken, make change X, still broken, undo change X, still broken, redo change X, repeat), get stuck in really long thinking loops where it made no progress for up to an hour at least for what seemd like a trivial task, or its personality would flip and it would become really hesitant about editing code (to the extent it refused to do, e.g. \"Are you really sure you want to do it? It is a really big change and has to touch on all the files of the codebase.\"), etc. The code it makes also starts to become smelly and poorly architected over time and you have to explicitly suggest for it to rearchitecture/refactor. After multiple compactions it would also tend to become weird and glitchy, so I often start a new fresh codex once it starts to behave weirdly. I was also surprised that 400K tokens is pretty small (about 10 - 20 minutes of work on gpt-5.1.codex high).\n\nSo, yes, I am in the process of figuring out how I can accelerate even more as there are lots of features I want it to work on simultaneously but my environment is poorly structured for that. It definitely feels now you can 10x (or more) your productivity with these current models.\n\nIf you are skeptical just try them out for yourself.\n\nBTW: I was using Codex CLI.",

I've dabbled a tiny bit with NotebookLLM for organising notes, but not enough to give much of an opinion.\n\nThe \"smallest\" hurdle for me is the conversational aspect. Back-and-forth with an AI just seems weird, and that's a mental bloc for me. The anthromorphisation (sp?) of AI annoys the heck out of me.\n\nFor writing code, my observations from reviewing AI-generated code is that it'll produce more of the same - quality is inconsistent across our repos (and I'll hold my hand up as being someone who has contributed to that) so more of the same isn't necessarily desirable IMO, and the test suites don't always  provide great confidence to support an AI-assisted reactor. \n\n---\n\nThe rest of my team have been using it, along with a reasonable degree of adoption across other teams. Within my team, I've seen it used a lot for essentially transcribing designs from Figma to React - in these cases, the \"more of the same\" aspect comes up and you see a lot of low-level building blocks being used. For example, `<Typography variant=\"m\">` instead of a higher-level component that would describe the semantics.\n\nAI-assisted PRs have tended to be big, but I think that's down to both our code structure and the AI tools\n\nThe tests I've seen it produce are mostly fine, but it will often introduce a couple of tests that are worthless. One such case, it added a comment over a test saying `// CRITICAL BUG FIX` but the test itself didn't assert anything related to the bug in question.",

I hope this helps someone figure out the best way to utilize it within your workflow.\n\nBefore applying LLMs anywhere in my workflow, first, I break my workflow into different steps. For me, a value stream map, would look like this:\n\n- PM writes JIRA ticket\n- read JIRA ticket to identify scope, priority, and complexity\n- update JIRA ticket with my understanding\n- JIRA ticket goes through refinement\n- engineers critique ticket until it meets definition of ready\n- engineers place story in ready for work\n- engineer gather context of the scope\n- engineer begins work with context\n- engineer validates work locally\n- engineer reviews work locally\n- engineer creates code review\n- engineer has work reviewed\n- engineer has code merged\n- code is deployed\n- engineer monitors changes\n- engineer reverts changes if issues arise\n\n\n\nThis likely is pretty similar to something you’ve worked in before, but it’s important to label each step. Your goal is to automate any of these steps.\n\nIf you can utilize an LLM to reduce the time spent on reviewing your local code by 70%, is it worth it?\n\nIf it is… this is typically how I create a Claude Code Skill:\n\n- begin by utilizing the superpowers skill\n- then, provide as much basic context as you can for how you would personally review this piece of work locally. Do you look for syntax errors? Do you care about cyclomatic complexity? Are you following a certain pattern you’ve defined as a best practice? Are these documented anywhere?\n- add as much context as you can. This is the key. Don’t add too much to the skill itself, let the superpower create referential documentation.\n- review with your skill\n- review the code yourself\n- what was different? Can you update the skill to enhance the output?\n- if you ran the review with 5 sub-agents, does this catch as many bugs as you would expect?\n\nWith this, remember, this is one tiny step of automating your process.

Ended up arguing with it for an hour, because it was telling me things that were not part of the AWS documentation. Gave up on the LLM, and read documentation by hand and took notes.\n   * Still used ChatGPT as a rubber duck for this project, but only \\_after\\_ I understood the domain a bit more, and learned where the LLM was likely to hallucinate on me\n* Asked Claude to write unit tests for me, following a pattern that was already in the code base. Very good.\n* Asked Claude to write unit tests for a new piece of code I just wrote. It produced \\~200 lines, of which 140 had to be deleted, and the rest had to be rewritten. It was decent enough, it flagged one good edge case.\n* Asked Claude to review code. I love Claude for this. Just tell it to \"review the code on this branch as a pedantic senior engineer would\". Claude will produce a long list of suggestions. You have to be careful not to go overboard fixing all of it, just choose the ones that are actually relevant.\n   * When I don't have time to sift through 10+ suggestions,  I tell it to \"review the code and give me the 3 most important things to fix\".\n* Asked Claude to write code to benchmark some performance-critical functions that I wrote. It vomited out a CLI command that was more or less what I needed\n* Regularly ask ChatGPT / Claude to read logs for debugging\n* Bonus: I use AWS logging service (Cloudwatch), and it has a built-in LLM for writing log queries. I use their LLM to write more complicated queries.\n\n\\----\n\nLLMs are 100% useful. Things I want to learn next year is to use agents and MCP (beyond basic Claude Code). I will dedicate at least a couple of weekends to that.\n\nAlso, when I search my feelings, I think the experience of using LLMs is delightful. C'mon you have a faux-intelligent robot in your pocket. Yes, it's a dumb word salad generator, but it's still so cool. If my job, for example, banned these tools, I would be annoyed.\n\n\\----\n\nAll that being said, I certainly don't feel like I am getting replaced. Nor have LLM made me 10X more productive.\n\nI do not understand where claims of 10X productivity come from. Sure, if you have a very narrowly scoped project (migrate X to Y), or you are starting with a green field project, I can see it. But most software dev that I do is not like that.\n\nPS:\n\nAnd as a bonus here is an awesome blog post that helps keep me centered:\n\n>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work [https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\n\nBottom line, LLM is just a tool.

I also integrate other peoples' contributions, including AI generated ones. I do however use AI multiple times, every day. I'm also one of the main contributors in one of internal projects integrating LLMs for specific purposes.\n\nFirst things first. Ignore all the internet influencer noise. Ignore LLM model provider and LLM based tooling vendor marketing. It's mostly bs.\n\nAlways remember that LLMs are token prediction machines. Very complex and large ones so they give an illusion of understanding or thought sometimes but that's just that, an illusion. Asking a chatbot about something is like taking top 3 results from google search and skimming the contents (gross oversimplification on my part but close enough). Can be 100% right for something popular and uncontroversial, can be plain wrong, or in between. And that's not even taking into account settings you don't see when interacting with a chatbot (system prompt, temperature, top K, input & output filtering, ...).\n\nThere are programming use cases & niches where AI, especially the top models combined with top tier tooling (cough, Cursor, cough) shine. I know actual people not writing any (or almost any) code by hand in professional setting. There are caveats and specifics to that so don't expect anyone to be able to do the same in every programming related role.\n\n(continued below)",

I have a new business idea (genuine gap in the market, no competitors since it's very niche, looking for funding, DM me /s) so I've given the broad business context to chatGPT and I'm having it create prompts for Codex to do the work implementing. \n\nIt ... works surprisingly well for MVP and since I'm a dev I've set up enough quality guardrails (tests, linting, security, etc)  to avoid the worst pitfalls. I'd done a lot of experimentation early on this year and hadn't been particularly impressed. Things have dramatically changed though and I'm now pretty shocked at what is possible. There is still a ways to go, especially on the web design side but it's impressive. \n\nThe problem however is now that rather being a software engineer I'm far closer to being a product owner who is doing requirements engineering. It's possible to 'vibe' it but then it's a pretty crappy loop of describing a small change, evaluating the plan, letting Codex implement and then evaluating the change. \n\nIt's also .. unsatisfying. I got into software engineering due to ADHD traits and focusing on problems felt great. As said, this is closer to requirements engineering/product ownership and fixing a problem ... just isn't as satisfying.\n\nLong story short, if approaches like Codex continue to improve I expect a shift in what we do (for apps) to change to being more requirements driven, but having an understanding of the technical tradeoffs that approaches an AI might take in implementing features or addressing problems is going to remain valuable.",

Create a pipeline for translating online documentation to JSON templates, and making API calls to generate resources for those templates. This collection of Md files has already saved dozens of hours of work.\n\n2. Big giant find replace for css colors and variables in css. Stuff I could have done (and did a lot of) manually. But yeah literally just like 200 css files and 3-4K hex codes, translated to css variables. AI also solved all the things where you can use hex codes but can’t use variables.\n\n3. Setting up a npm package/vite library for React components and css tokens, so different apps can use the same styling. I had never set up a library before and AI walked me through how to configure vite for a package, the build, etc.\n\n4. Any figma design, I can throw Claude at it and it gets it 90% of the way there in minutes. No more manually going back and forth or copy pasting a figma component and editing it in your code. If Claude is set up to do “best practices” and pull from existing styles it’s very easy to get it to pull stuff over in a DRY way.\n\n5. I will throw a full ticket at it, copy pasted from Jira, and it will hunt down what might be causing the problem in the code. I will continue to prompt Claude forward until it can explain or point at something that I can then manually go in and investigate. Great when you don’t have domain knowledge.\n\n6. 3rd party integrations. If the 3rd party has online documentation that is public (like most) -super easy. I have only done this with one company so far but it is basically telling Claude where I want it in the code, what the url of the documentation is, and then going and cleaning it up after.",

For example if I want to write a chrome plugin for the first time, it is pretty great at setting up the framework to do all of it. Similarly with any sort of scripts to improve productivity, they are one off and not hooked into a larger code base and these can increase productivity.\n\n\nTests: \n\n\n- I like to make it write the first few tests, but I hate when it writes 30 tests. Now I just ask it to write one test to test a specific thing. Then I make sure the test is functioning correctly then copy it to make the five tests that I want of that style.\n\n\n- when it writes all 30 tests, it often isn't testing what it appears to be testing. Or is testing in such a way that it passes regardless of whether the code is right. In a sense it is trying to write tests that pass.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n- One shot it works, or it goes around in circles and sucks. Mostly the latter, so far as I can tell. \n\n\n- It very quickly turns to hacky solutions to make things work rather than sticking to best practices that you have asked it to, or that exist in the code base.\n\n\nOverall, it is too eager to write too much. And the more code there is written the more bugs there are. The more code there is to read, surpassing the ability of the dev to comprehend and parse all of it. So I don't understand how people are letting agents loose to write tons of code. I end up trying my best to constrain it to write less code most of the time, so that I can ensure it's doing the right thing.",

          "text": "I'm mostly working in Cursor if that matters.\n\n1. I've found it pretty darn good at git blame. In Cursor, I describe the issue I'm seeing and use the file/line as context and ask it to trace the issue. I also ask for a report at the end with commit hashes and commit links to gitlab/GitHub. The report means I can quickly check if it's correct and throw it away if it's wrong.\n\nGeneralizing, I've found it quite good at chasing around command line output.\n\n2. Doing a task that is scriptable, but might take too long to script by hand? I ask the AI to do it and often get something close enough to make automation worthwhile.\n\nI find building things up piece by piece works much better  than having it write the whole thing in one shot. The code is way easier to review too. \n\nGiving algorithmic suggestions can also cut off some hacky solutions. E.g. parse by matching parens rather than a brittle regex.\n\n3. When I'm working in a domain, tool, etc I don't know well, I find that the suggestions/code it produces are useful to give me ideas and pointers to strategies even if I don't directly use the output. E.g. some CMake issue I don't know anything about or some Linux system config I have no experience with.\n\n4. Searching the code base. Where are the tests for this function? Do we have tools that do X? What idioms do we use for Y?\n\n5. Ideation. Getting ideas for alternative implementation strategies or architectures. Asking for feedback on something I've written. \n\nAlso, I've found connecting MCP servers to be very helpful for giving context. With those, I can paste links to our issue tracker, source control, documentation, etc. to set up my prompt just like if I was working with a colleague.",

I don't really write much code any more, and am able to build out major features in days that would have taken a team and months to do without AI. \n\nMy time is spent mostly in an IDE still writing planning documents, reviewing agent results, managing version control, and providing guidance by prompting with speech-to-text. I push the agent to use modern standards and tools. It tries to hand-roll everything by default, like it's in a coding contest, so it needs to be told. \n\nValidation is done the same as before: Manual, E2E, or Unit depending on the project. Unit is mostly for libraries. E2E for user-facing apps. Manual is all you need for prototypes and experimental branches. \n\nAs far as evaluating the upsides and downsides, there is far less \"low-level\" thinking required which means you get more practice at conceptual planning. More code review means your intuition for code quality grows. More time writing natural language means your communication skills improve. If your goal is just to build stuff, then this is all great. The downside is that you won't be in touch with the inner workings of your projects. On the other hand, building your own libraries is easier than ever so you might end up with a deep understanding anyways. \n\nIn the past, I would plan things out as well as I could and do the coding in dedicated, high-intensity sessions. It's these sessions which are eliminated by using AI and I don't miss them because I feel like they were stressful and unhealthy. The speed boost and reduced stress makes programming feel like a game now.",

Some stuff i know the model can nail. A lot of this is just looking at code and questioning things that look wrong to me. Should be using your noggin here  \n\\- As im reviewing i may have conversations about things i didnt catch during implementation. It may find stuff in its own review / reflection, its actually getting really good at that.   \n\\- I ask it to review documentation for things that need to be created or updated. We have a conversation about this, as well as tone / detail  / etc. I have a document on how to document i make sure it reads. As its doing that, ill be manually testing and wrapping stuff up.  \n\\- When we are both happy, I ask it to make a commit / PR / whatever\n\nWhen i see people talk about brain atrophy or whatever, thats completely alien to me, same with \"I kick it off and go play with my kids for an hour\". If you use it enough, you know the limitations, trust me. I am more intensely engaged then when i type code.\n\nIf you dont know how to think without writing code you are in trouble. Would suggest strongly working on that, come up with a plan before you do your tickets, see how well it stands up to reality, figure out how to get good at that. Its a pre-requisite skill to proper AI usage. And don't expect ai to think for you, its a fantastic \"thought amplification\" tool and collaboration tool, it can write great code quickly, and solve small bullshit that normally will eat into momentum. \n\nLines of code dont mean much, but I can probably get out 3-4x what i can without ai in terms of sheer volume in a day, and im less cranky at the end of it.

          "text": "I'll tell you three different stories about AI use. \n\n*How I use it at home*\n\nGmail does not have a sort by sender.  To replicate this, I copy the email address of the sender of the email I'm on, and paste it into the search bar with [from:$sender in:inbox].  But last week, instead of doing that, I realized that I could have Claude write a chrome plugin to do this for me.  So I gave it this prompt:  \n\n    i want to create a chrome extension called \"gmail search for sender\".  requirements:\n\n    add a keyboard shortcut to gmail to activate the functionality\n    the keyboard shortcut should be pressing i.\n    when you press the shortcut, it will search the current message for it's sender, ideally using the from: line, and then do a gmail search for messages from that sender in the inbox.\n    The search should look like \"from:$email in:inbox\"\n\nAnd it gave me a chrome plugin and install instructions.  I found one bug, that I told it about and it fixed, and then I had a plugin.  This plugin 10x my email productivity.  Now I can get through 1000 messages at a time -- before I could get through maybe 10 before I got tired of the copy/paste.\n\nI am not a frontend dev, so I could not have done this myself without hours of work and I most likely would have given up before getting it to work.  Using Claude was the only way this would happen.\n\n*How we use it at work*\n\nI'm the CEO of a small software company.  I've told my team that they can use the company card to pay for any AI tool they find value in.  Some are using Claude, some are using Gemini, some are using Codex.  Each uses it for different things.\n\n- One team member uses it for simple frontend work.  He's great at backend, but not at frontend, so he will use AI to write frontend code.\n\n- Another team member used it for porting work.  We had a library in Python and wanted to make a Go version.  He did not just ask it to port the whole library, but instead went function by function asking it to port each one using the Python as a reference.  He would give Claude the general plan and context as to what the function does, and then iterate with Claude for a bit, sometimes making manual changes.  He also used Claude to write the initial test suite by porting over the Python test suite.  *Claude/AI is really good at porting existing code to a new language*.\n\n- Others are using it for code review.  They will plug their code into AI after writing it and ask for a code review.  Sometimes it comes up with some useful suggestions, which they will implement themselves before submitting for human code review.\n\nOverall my team members say that it's increased their productivity 2-3x.\n\n*How my friends use it*\n\nhttps://github.com/adrianco/meGPT\n\nHe built an entire MCP server to replicate himself, and it was 100% coded in AI.  He also has another project where he wrote a Swift app, also 100% coded in AI.  He's doing this work in the open on his GitHub so people can follow along.  He's retired now, so he just does this for a couple hours a week, but he's outputting as many results as he used to when he was working full time.\n\nAnother friend set up an \"AI coding team\", where they gave each AI a personality (\"you are a principal engineer and believe in test driven development\", \"you are a curmudgeon, you poke holes in everyone else's code\").  Then they give the task to the \"team\" with a detailed design document, which iterates and comes up with a solution.",

The people in charge of the bureaucracy act like the system is infallible, which means they only check what's directly in front of them. Nobody really wants to report anyone because the end result is probably a new redundant document for everyone that needs to be constantly recertified. At the end of the day, the people that try to be honest but make minor mistakes are the ones that get punished.\n\n\nIronically, the security side is the worst at bureaucracy. We keep a pretty locked down network so a lot of requests need cyber approval. Except they sit on approval requests unless you call them out. Not to mention the actual implementation is usually a manual process, even though my company has been pushing automation for years.",

The office manager takes this employee aside and lays out that there will be no more modifications to the office lunches. It was a sore point for the office manager to have to navigate the Pizza / Lasagna debacle, and the manager lays it out that nobody else is going to touch the food schedule.\n\nNow, there's the unwritten rule that nobody can mess with food schedule, the office is on the hook for the expense of both Pizza Fridays and Lasagna Tuesdays, and employees know there's an issue going on they should better steer clear of, so nobody ever talks about the food schedule again.\n\nThis is office culture, it's office politics, and these are policies that are going to stay in place until the originators of the Lasagna and Pizza days are no longer in this part of the organization.\n\nWelcome to bureaucracy. Now multiply this many times for how long and how large an organization has become.

Also, there's less institutional urgency on the front and back office application side. The company is already established with reliable customers and revenue. They aren't trying to survive, attract investment, or grow in an order-of-magnitude sense. They already have systems to support growth and are trying to do that in a steady manner that doesn't mess up what they already have.

They're still small enough to be more informal, have fewer stakeholders, have shorter planning cycles, and may genuinely need better technical infrastructure to expand further.

Often it's because people are just in it for promotion and pay raises rather than the actual core business objectives so the interested end up weird and misaligned.\n\nFrequently you end up in a bizarre position of \"hands-off micromanagement\", a paradox where middle management want to be constantly kept updated on stuff but they don't understand any of it so they're 'there' but give no meaningful direction.\n\nIn a way you kinda just have to get used to the baseline dysfunction and that's very painful for people who actually want to do useful things. Within big businesses you'll usually find there are a few people who are actually good and you should gravitate towards their org if you get the chance.",

Informally, I have ownership and accountability over design, quality, and software architecture. I'm often involved in cross-team discussions and longer-term technical direction, and I'm expected to mentor others.\n\nFor the coming year, I'm explicitly expected to stop writing code almost entirely and focus mainly on architecture and design decisions.\n\nAt the same time, formally, nothing changes:\n\n* My level stays the same\n* I’m evaluated at the same level as my peers\n* There is no concrete promotion path or timeline (just \"show next year you can do it\")\n\nIn practice, my scope and responsibility increase, but my formal role and evaluation do not.\n\nTo be fair, I could probably have done a better job earlier in documenting impact (brag document) and aligning more frequently with my manager. That said, the increased scope and expectations are well known internally.\n\nI think my main question is: is it normal to be expected to outperform peers and **first** demonstrate \"visible impact\" before moving to the next level, even when your day-to-day responsibilities already go beyond what other L4 engineers are doing?",

Decade of experience so less than many around here, but the only meaningful raises I've ever received are when I switched companies.\n\nStrangely enough, my current role (1.5 years) is Staff level and I am working through the promo to Principal side-by-side with my manager. Who knows if they actually follow through! \n\nI share this to emphasize:\n\n**My manager has a job description w/ a title, role description, specific responsibilities, etc of which we collaborated in order to create/define. We also have accompanied this with a timeline that we are actively moving through together while documenting the journey the entire way.**\n\nIf you don't have something akin to the above, I echo the sentiments expressed here to:\n\n- update your CV\n- start interview prep (LC, SD, etc)\n- begin interviewing\n\nWorst case: you have leverage when you land a few offers",

To be comfortable at CurrentLevel+1 you are expected to be able meet your CurrentLevel responsibilities without having it take up all your time. So if you're able to do CurrentLevel + 80% of CurrentLevel+1 for a year or so, you should have a good case for promo into CurrentLevel+1. \n\nThat being said, your manager should know when particularly time consuming responsibilities (eg crunch or oncall for CurrentLevel, or a bunch of allday meetings for CurrentLevel+1) get in the way for short periods of time. And if it's been 2-3 years of this as you say, either your manager's expectations of what you need to show don't align with reality, or they are stringing you along.

The team is working well and we're optimistic to get QA operational by the end of Q3'26. \n\nMy next big task is assembling a team to migrate the stored procedure nightmare that basically runs the entire company. There's 4 or 5 databases each with \\~500 stored procedures running on a single Microsoft SQL instance. As you can imagine, costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers. \n\nThe system is slightly decoupled, HTTP requests ping back and forth between 3 main components, and there's an in-house ORM orchestrating all of the magic. There's nothing inherently wrong with the ORM, and I'd like to keep it place, but it is responsible for calling all the stored procedures.  \n\nThe final component/layer is responsible for receiving the HTTP requests and executing the query/insert/stored procedure (It's basically SQL over HTTP, the payload contains the statement to be executed). \n\n  \nWhile some of the functions are appropriately locked in the database, a very large percentage of them would be simplified as code. This would remove load from the database, expand the pool of developers that are able to work on them, and sweet sweet unit testing.\n\nI'm thinking of \"intercepting\" the stored procedure requests, and more-or-less building a switch statement/dictionary with feature flags (procedure, tenant, percentage) that would call native code opposed to the stored proc.  \n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with this?\n\n  \n",

The database itself is SQL over HTTP -- why do you need an additional layer? Furthermore, having the SQL over HTTP service rewrite the queries sounds extremely confusing and error-prone.

Oh, you can't because your software architecture does not support that for what ever reason.... Ok.... Have fun. No, throwing half a million in hardware and resources at the problem is NOT going to solve that.\n\nDon't be that black and white. Stored Procs can be a LOT better than ORM generated queries. CRUD stuff being piped trough Stored Procs, cause it has to be a Stored Proc.... well... thats not good. There is a sensible middle ground thou. Besides, while it would suck to work with, Insert new row, update single row, select single row, delete single row..... piping that through a stored proc, will not consume messurable more resources than doing it with adhoc queries generated by an ORM. I challenge the internet to provide execution plans to me.\n\nAnyway, why do you think, stored procedures are the reason \"costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers\" ?\n\nI guess, they implemented the middleware in SQL, but that is giving you a lot of credit without any real stated reasoning there.",

It sounds like this backend highly couples the UI and database on various levels, especially if it literally inserts fragments of SQL statements straight from the request, without anything in between.

I spend way more time coordinating with teams and figuring out issues than actually writing code.\n\nIt’s challenging, but I feel like I’m leveling up in detective work, not development. I have autonomy and can solve problems independently, but I’m starting to feel stagnant. When i find the bug i dont code the solution, i just Change config files that other teams tell me to change. Its mostly communication and act as an integrator. \n\nFor those who’ve been here: did taking ownership of a big project help you get back to coding-heavy work? Or did you have to seek new challenges elsewhere? How do you escape this maintenance/debug loop?\n\nWould love to hear your tips and experiences\n\nThank you\n\n\n",

If config file twiddling is the main work to be done, and you want to be doing coding, then you need a different project, which may mean a different team/company. If this project has a fun part only somebody else gets to do it while you get the scut work, then you may get somewhere by asking your manager to balance the assignments better.\n\nI will say though that:\n\n> I spend way more time coordinating with teams and figuring out issues\n\nCross-team coordination and communication looks really good on a resume or promotion request.

Whatever is at the top of the queue takes priority in the moment and that's what is worked on\n\nAt first, this actually worked very very well for me. I was able to thrive because the most important thing was always clear to me. Until I went up a few engineering levels and then it wasn't. Because no other team was driven by a queue\n\nThis made things hard, it made things stressful... Hell, I even nearly left because of how inflexible I always felt\n\nBut point being, in the beginning, we were small. We had one product. Other teams drove our product, and as a result, drove the tooling we used\n\nSo we had capacity to only focus on the queue, knock items that existed in the queue out, and move on to the next thing. Easy.\n\nThen we were bigger. Now we have multiple products. Other teams began working on those. We were left to support existing and proven product. We were asked to take on tooling, escalations, etc that other teams had been working on. We did not have capacity. All we knew was the queue. To some people, the queue was the most important thing. To other people, speeding up our team through better tooling was the important thing. And to others, grand standing was the most important thing\n\nSenior engineers hated this. Senior engineers switched teams. Team was left with inexperienced engineers. Quality of product produced by team has significantly depreciated\n\nMe not at company anymore. Me at different company\n\nMe not know why start talking like this. Me weird sometimes, but me happy that my work isn't driven by a queue that's all important meanwhile having other priorities that me told are equally important by stupid management cross teams\n\nThank you",

And it wasn’t due to team size or company size, the low process team was the biggest team I’ve been on (8 engineers). \n\nThe reason is that I spent hours every day on process before, be it daily standup, point estimation, jira wrangling, triage meetings, prioritization meetings etc.. it often took more time deciding to work on something small than just doing it. \n\nMy last team (the low process team) eliminated most of that. We had our main projects, which were loosely determined by PMs and then given to us, a weekly standup, a weekly project sync and that was more or less that. When it came time to work on a project, we’d scope it out and design it within a small group and then just go. \n\nI can’t tell you how liberating it is to start coding days after starting the project instead of being bogged down on scope and design meetings for weeks. Occasionally our process meant we’d have to redo some work if our design was flawed, and for more complex projects we’d jump into prototypes in the beginning, but its still vastly faster than trying to perfect everything at the beginning. And all the pointless bike shedding is gone. \n\nThe best part of this is that I had all this time cleared out and we had the autonomy to just do things when we wanted to. Have some tech debt you want to clean up? Just spend a few hours, get a review and get it merged. The burden is unfathomably lower when you don’t have to justify it, track it, estimate it, triage it, and schedule it. \n\nLike I’m telling you we had the cleanest code base I’d ever seen. We had helper tools for days because people cared to do it and we had the autonomy to make it happen. Some of my most impactful changes happened on a whim when I’d be debugging something and decided to spend a few hours adding some diagnostics or whatever. \n\nI had this one project that I suspected would save us a good bit of money, but turned out we have no good way to get an accurate picture of team infrastructure cost. No worries, napkin math was enough, but I snooped further and saw we had all the raw cost event tables covering our team’s infrastructure in our data warehouse. So on a whim I spent a couple of days creating some team specific tables to make cost easier to calculate and a nice dashboard with various aggregations and charts.\n\nWell lo and behold I get a slack a few weeks later from higher up asking why we had a cost spike with X service. Turns out someone had shared the dashboard and they added it to their cost review resources. \n\nI didnt tell anyone I was making this, I just presented it to the team when it was done (then I think one of our PMs spread it around). At my old companies I doubt this would’ve been prioritized over project work, and we’d spend time discussing the rights aggregations and charts and what tables to make and blah blah blah and it would never happen.\n\nAnyways, sorry for my rant. I’m sure this won’t work on every team but it’s been such a breath of fresh air to “just do things” and I really don’t want to go back.",

What we do is create tasks when technical (invisible) work is needed and use it to make it visible for other stakeholders (product manager). It does not equate to having a heavyweight process around that, and honestly, it helps a lot: every dev is assigned a task, everyone can see what's being worked on, etc. And the best part is that rarely anyone outside of the dev team argues that those tasks are not needed.\n\nBefore, we had a horrible way of trying to squeeze that technical work into existing feature tickets, and it was painful because it did not give a real picture of what's happening. Now we can have a refactoring task that must be done before a feature can be delivered, and everyone is OK with that.",

Like, some literal examples I've used internally are jira tickets with titles like \"Make (Redacted Feature Name) More Usable\" and \"Build Integration With (Redacted Third Party Service)\", and no body.  The kanban process worked for us because we just adapted to it and when the ticket is that vague the developer's action item is to get on a zoom call with the product manager and babysit them through writing some actual tickets (then put those in the backlog for somebody to work on).  It wasn't perfect, because obviously developers would prefer not to do that, but over time some of the product managers learned how to just write reasonable requirements in the first place (and then regressed when upper management forced a different process across the whole company).  \n\nSAFe's a terrible fit for that because it assumes you've already got that \"Twitter, but for Dogs\" feature broken down into actionable/estimable tickets before the quarter starts, when in actuality you're forced to figure that shit out on the fly.",

          "text": "On the teams I've led I've always advocated for two rotations: focused dev work and KTLO (keeping the lights on). Focused dev is as you expect, you're heads down on a major feature or whatever and just doing the next step in the feature day in day out. When you're on KTLO you're doing things like production support, small bug fixes, technical debt, dealing with small client requests, etc. Another way to put it, one of you knows exactly what you're doing each day for the next week or month or however long that feature takes you to deliver while one of you swaps your tasks daily or even faster depending on what comes up. We do tend to have a KTLO backlog just to make sure you do have things to do, but your priorities will shift quite regularly. People on KTLO aren't part of the former so you're never stuck twiddling your thumbs.\n\nOur KTLO person rotates based on feature completion instead of weekly or whatever. That is to say, it's better to keep focused dev work going and people on task than it is to give KTLO people a break. In the long run it makes little difference and we found longer rotations were better for continuity, on both sides. We even got it to a point where it fell outside of our product capacity. We hired so product had at least the capacity we saw and then hired more to make sure we had this capacity as well. Yes, it got to a point where everything not on their radar fell into KTLO but we similarly planned and projected and hired accordingly. At times it was bad and we didn't have capacity and it kept being underfunded, but right now we're at a health size for this to work.\n\nMy two cents is that you have to plan for it. There will always be unexpected things that come up and the worst you can do is try to scramble to figure it out. However much capacity you may have for it you figure that out, but you need to have at least someone ready for it.",

The worst thing you can do is be afraid to clarify so that you do understand, and then become a problem for everyone else when it's clear you don't. In my role, that's my biggest pet peeve. It seems like folks often don't ask questions because it might make them look stupid or whatever. I don't give a shit about having to explain things multiple times in multiple ways. I actually view that as at least partially my fault for not communicating things effectively. The worst thing folks do in that situation is not speak up, because then when the misunderstanding becomes obvious, and it always does, it is at a time when it costs more time and patience to resolve than if they'd just asked repeatedly until they understood it. \n\nNow, there's always the chance that you just don't understand because of some shortcoming on your part.

If I didn’t get it the first or second or third time, the problem is usually that I’ve made a bad assumption, or there’s a logical leap or conclusion that I didn’t follow, and going through step by step - basically debugging the design or conclusion - is the way to figure out where the disconnect happened.\n\nBecoming the go-to person for something is a lagging signal of expertise and social proof. For building the expertise, there’s no substitute for curiosity. For instance, in our system, any time someone describes something the system does - like in on-call review or as part of an incident response - if I didn’t already know it, I dig into the code until I can trace for myself exactly how that works. Any time I hear about a feature that we want to write, I do a mini design myself to see where it aligns with our system and where it’s mismatched, and then I think of good ways to resolve the mismatch. Whenever I answer a question on Slack, I don’t just answer the question, I also try to think about the context of the question and understand that - why did this person ask this question? How did they end up coming to ME with it? Etc. and if appropriate I offer feedback on that. Do this enough, and you’ll become an expert naturally.\n\nThen the social proof - when discussions are happening, offer your knowledge. And the critical thinking you’re doing will lead you to develop opinions - offer them, too. Eventually people will remember that you helped them out or clarified something for them, and they’ll start going to you directly. And when they start recommending you to their peers, then you’re literally the go-to person.",

      "text": "Not once or twice was my work as a developer/DevOps interrupted by various restrictions, constraints and limitations that severly limit my technical abilities with little to no utility with regards to \"security\". Now I do \"security\" in quotes not as a denegration to an important concern, but to the hand wavy \"security concerns\" I often hear from security officers which actually harms security.\n\nNow it's important to mention I am not working at FAANG. I'm not working at a startup either, nor in any firm that has tech as it's core competency. I'm working at the IT department of a non-tech firm. This is important to mention as i've noticed that in those cases, the security officers were not previously engineers - they barely interact with computers on a technical levels. Few of them even said to me \"I don't know the first thing about engineering.\" \n\nI don't know how it came to be, I also think it's crazy. But I don't make the rules.\n\nAsk them to open SSH access for a machine? \"SSH is not secure. Drag and drop your files thorugh the approved FTP GUI.\" Ask to them to give me EC2 roles in AWS? \"It's not secure. Just ask GUY\\_WHO\\_DOES\\_EVERYTHING to send you the client secret in plaintext on teams.\"\n\nI think we all here can tell based on how someone talks about technology if they *actually* know anything about it (i.e. saying the verb \"codes\" instead of code). Whenever I get declined I ask why they never give an argument. Just \"security problems.\" and I KNOW they have no clue what are the security implications which is why they choose vague language. Or they just can be bothered to do anything new. \n\nNow I will re-iterate again that i'm speaking with non-technical people, or boomers who are *extremely out of date* on software. Like, the newest IDE they know is Notepad++. They don't know what git is. They never wrote a unit test or understand the point of me adovcating for it.\n\nThis is my current job. No I can't get a new one ATM(cause \"get a better job\" is the typical reddit response). Yes I am working on my CV (and being able to DO things is helpful for it..). There no technically competent people above him I can talk to (most technical competency is at engineer level but not management). I need to know how to work and communicate with those people.",

I get paid the same amount regardless of work done.\n\nYup I worked at company like this for years.  They were closer to a tech company than OPs post, but I still call them a non-tech company in the big picture.  I worked on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machine, and the goal was to do the bare minimum to meet FDA guidelines over creating a great product.\n\nI remember many occasions where manager would give me some patient problem to investigate and come back with some solution for the product.  I would come back with a fleshed out plan and how to get there.   The manager would then proceed to put separate the work in to 2 buckets.\n\nOne bucket would be what we do now and the other would be phase 2 of the work.  Guess what, phase 2 never gets scheduled as priority.  So things like encrypting communications over the internet or having message retries would get pushed aside.\n\nThese things get will get done when they become a fire because somebody hacked the communications and stole patient medical data.  Otherwise they are betting on the fact the nobody cares enough about these dialysis machines to actually try to do anything.\n\nHell the password on the serial port was root/root and they didn't disable it in production.  So anybody can take the back panel off and connect to the board and get full access to the OS and everything on it.\n\nI remember one time I wanted to automate some things like builds and testing to run nightly using Jenkins.  I did a proof of concept over the weekend and when I presented it to management as something the team should do to increase code quality I was told \"If you want to work extra work on project priorities or do not work at all\".\n\nAt the end of the day management was fine with the pace of work and how often bugs were being introduced.  I guess they just saw it the cost of doing business and it was a waste of time / money to be better.\n\nLike you I stopped caring at this point because nothing was going to change and, as you said, I get paid either way so whatever.  I just did my job to the best that I could and just went home at the end of the day.\n\nThese companies were not going out of business either. They have been around since the 80's making money hand over fist with medical devices in the field helping patients.",

Makes sense, until you dig in and the firewalls are being provided by 2 separate external vendors, and the integration point is the shit tier cybersecurity team self managing the vendor product on their own cloud subscription VM with no monitoring, scaling, or resiliency put into place. Many pillars are all sharing the exact same firewall, which is a huge risk and single point of failure for the entire company.\n\nAny questions about these missing items got you put in the \"troublemaker\" box.  Any attempts to implement your own firewall with full prod bells and whistles are rejected and your director is flagged.\n\nThe result? Weve already seen 5+ major Sev1 outages in the past 4 months from these firewalls randomly exploding in production due to high peak season volume.  And now, since all the firewall stuff has been outsourced to a vendor, we have 300+ people just sitting on a call, screaming they are fully down, with 0 troubleshooting occuring. The nontechnical cybersecurity team has no idea what to do.  Theyre all just waiting for vendor support to grace us with a half baked \"solution\" which usually takes hours and the company has already lost millions of dollars from the full 100% outage.\n\nBonus points for whenever a non technical exec who ignored all warnings about these integrations randomly barges in and demands to know how this was allowed to happen and how we can prevent this.",

But how does security know that ssh server is properly secured?  Every ssh server needs to be monitored and maintained, while a central ftp application is one thing to monitor that can be subjected to extended scanning and auditing.  SSH  is also great for data exfiltration, which is likely why that tool is mandatory.  DLP is massive.\n\nAnd letting a dev touch prod services?  That's just rolling the dice.  Sooner or later an exploratory command will accidentally become a write command.  The old infamous rm / -rf comes to mind, as one of the most extreme examples, but data exfiltration is a concern too.\n\nYou've touched on something key in your continued rant.  You're right, most admins don't git.  I never even touched it in my sysadmin days.  I will tell you though, it won't undelete your server, uncorruot that database, or put to he cork back in on that data a disillusioned employee stole on their way out.  They have their lane, you have yours.  You want to change lanes, you look first.\n\nAs for the hand wavy responses...  You're smart, developers.  Inquisitive, good at attacking problems.  Actually answering the question properly leads to more questions and attacks on the rule.  (\"Oh but I'll make sure it stays up to date and I'd never change prod files or steal data.  Don't you trust me?\")  imagine a child doing the \"why\" thing, except instead of a child it's a very intelligent adult whose chief value comes from their ability to creatively diassemble problems.\n\nSorry, I'm with IT on this one.  I would not allow those file transfer methods if a viable method is already in place, and I certainly wouldn't give access to manage cloud services to people that get hired for their ingenuity.\n\nNow, PAM software on your dev box, THAT is a giant pita, and the impact it has even on non dev tasks makes it a dubious value, never mind having to wait for someone in IT having to hit an approve button for a dependency they don't recognize...",

There are lots of optional specifications with various different interpretations that is ultimately driving developers to add more and more hacks into their implementations, and before you say \"never roll your own auth\", have you considered that the people behind your favorite auth libraries are also adding these hacks? Just because it's abstracted away doesn't mean there aren't hacks in the implementations.\n\nImplicit flow is one of my greatest pet peeves. Everyone says it's bad practice and inherently insecure to pass tokens in the browser URL, but if we were to force auth-code flow in ALL apps tomorrow, there is certainly going to be some major pushback. Furthermore, Some providers provide an `expires_in` and some just rely on the service to poll the token until they get an error before retrieving another token.\n\nThe lack of care given to validating tokens on the client side doesn't bother me as much, but it does concern me. Most will at the very least, check for expiration and issuer. Signing Keys is a hit or miss, some will check it, and some rely on the \"inherent security\" of the auth code flow or  [checks signature validity but not the signing certificate](https://docs.goauthentik.io/sys-mgmt/certificates/#certificate-considerations)\n\nDoes this bother anyone else?\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more widespread breaches just from the lackluster implementation of OAuth as a standard.",

It’s “which client is allowed to access your Google Calendar” type of stuff. The access control part is not part (nor should it be) of Oauth; which calendar is this particular user allowed to see/edit/etc. \n\nI found the terminology always to leave something to be desired, scopes/resource/authorization server etc all can mean different things in different (=other than Oauth) contexts. \n\nSo, yeah there are a ton of implementations but at least there is a spec and you can raise incompliancies to the spec with the implementer.

Only approved software allowed on workstations (probably typical in some organizations) but in this case the approval process takes months, including for security patches on already approved software. The duration of the approval process isn't an indication of rigor of the vetting in this case. Automated software is used that takes about 10 mins to run before the stamp of approval is given. The remaining time is due to having multiple people required to check a box and pass it along. Most of the time, the process is stuck with someone in the chain and it needs to be escalated to get it moving. There seems to be a disconnected between the need to control the environment and the ability to quickly react to new vulnerabilities with patched software.\n2. Vulnerability checks on internal software libraries set up in *some* internal software project repositories, but are either: a) never run, b) have builds that are permanently broken, c) only run on 'main', d) are used to merely internally *record* vulnerabilities with no priority to fix, upgrade, or replace the library. Although I think it's a good start to identify these things, it appears that in some cases, without follow up, this starts to look like busy work (e.g., l*ook how much time we spent on 'security processes'*) without actually doing something about it.\n3. Vulnerability checks run on 3rd party software only. However, no security testing done on company generated code, even when a company has a dedicated security team. This includes checks for misconfiguration. \n4. Individuals with 'security' in their role's title (not necessarily C-level) being perpetually absent or unavailable from any real life security discussion. This can be either before, during, or after a very specific security problem. Occasionally, these individuals will even have presentations on the company's security internally which rarely reflects reality.\n\nI'm interested to hear if any of this sounds familiar or if I've just had bad luck. I'm looking for both sides of this though, examples of good and bad in your opinion.",

I show up to a meeting and it turns out they need $securityThing next week, but literally everyone else present knew about it for a year+. And now you get a solution thrown into production from procurement, to design, to review (also hastily done), no PoC, and now in production.. likely checking a box that customers care about. \n\nAnother challenge is hiring more experienced security folks. Guys worth their salt that truly understand developers pain cost as much as developers.. but they also don’t make you any money \n\nOn the topic of devs doing insecure stuff… unfortunately they don’t yell at the dev (not that anybody should be yelling).. they yell at me . Trust me, I’d love to leave you to your devices. I think beyond your typical vpn, endpoint monitoring, domain joining, and other network/cloud based tooling, we shouldn’t need to block devs much at the local level. But the dev goes and publishes a password for the umpteenth time, and now I’m getting yelled at for the umpteenth time. I tell them don’t do that, they roll their eyes because security is not in their job description and they’re not the ones whose livelihood is on the line if something happens. So now the annoying scanner is here and it takes longer to deploy. \n\nThe best orgs I’ve seen makes security everyone’s job. Having security champs embedded in dev and OPs teams to help make more secure services together as well as extending the function of security to catch these things early. Shifting left: get security involved early. If you’re adding new infra and other components involving permissions, networking, etc, get them in for a threat model review ASAP whether that’s the champs or the security team themselves. Get your management to buy in as well. Of course this is some pie in the sky stuff. Part of it is also just being in the “right” place. Where I’m at plenty of security are former devs. The scanner isn’t only for main, but for any branch. They provide hardened images for us to pull from for our OSes.  As long as it’s not explicitly black listed or pops the anti-virus, put whatever you want on your local machine… but in my experience in a lot of places, whatever bad things that can be done, will be done if you don’t try to restrict it.

Not necessarily just in security but in other areas too like architecture. I find that in some companies, 'Everyone is responsible for X' turns into a diffusion of responsibility where no one does anything because someone else is going to do it or because no one is going to come asking questions to them specifically if it doesn't get done or if the decision later turns out poorly.\n\nPerhaps it's just a luck of the draw for what a specific company culture values as to whether it grows into real responsibility or not. This is part of why I asked the question, was to see what was 'normal' or 'typical' to see if I need to adjust my expectations around this stuff.",

What can come across as ineffective from the outside is usually about legibility and accountability, not the belief that control is perfect.\n\nIn large system, the primary constraint isn't ease of use or effectiveness, but instead if responsibility can be clearly assigned and defended. From that perspective, many measures exist to serve critical initiatives (like SOC2 compliance, or FedRamp), not because anyone believes they eliminate risk or are alone effective.\n\nUsually when a control is imperfect or apparently symbolic, the people maintaining it understand the limits and are optimizing for broader constraints. If something didn't do anything, it wouldn't survive sustained scrutiny.\n\nOpacity is often a feature of scale.",

I'm leaving.  \n  \nI know any tool should do the job and the editor you use shouldn't affect your ability to do your tasks as much, but I'm doing this full time and it's becoming a daily inconvenience.\n\nI'm mandated to use VS code and Sourcetree. Both great tools, but *I* *live* inside the shell. Their workflow is good, but not for me. I have asked for a reason and they gave the following:\n\n\\- They want to prevent mistakes from happening --> So instead of responsibility, they introduced a seatbelt  \n\\- They want me to be able to help others, as well as have them help me. If I use different tools, that becomes harder --> We can just open GitLab, or, I don't know, open a different editor when someone is looking at my screen :)\n\nI've already addressed this multiple times and it starts to gnaw at me. I proposed the idea of instead of mandating a tool, mandating key features of said tool. For example, instead of \"You should use VSCode\", they could say \"You should use an editor with LSP support and a linter as well as basic highlighting features\". They then told me that they don't feel like managing multiple types of software and they don't want everyone to download whatever they feel like (I should mention, we are concerned with information security and therefore comply to ISO/IEC 27001 standard.)\n\nI seem to be alone in this, because I'm the only dev at my workplace that seems to have a problem with this. This makes it very hard to have a credible opinion. Most other devs already used VS code along with Sourcetree (or Fork) and others have started their careers at this place with said tools.\n\nI feels like I'm at a dead end with this. I'm not planning to leave for this, but the fact that we're being micro managed like this does give me the ick. Do you think it's feasible to try and convince management? And if so, what do you recommend?",

People aren't standard.  The implication is that they're not interested in getting the best you have to offer, they just want what you can give without tailoring your role to you because customizing your company laptop undermines the ability to pass it along to drone 53 and they pick up where you left off.  \n\nAnd again, I get why; they development to be a solid bedrock on which they can build.  They want it to be dependable engine so it can manage itself and they can make more interesting and profitable manoeuvres with marketing, and sales strategy.\n\nBut the thing is: as a developer, it sucks to be forgotten and ignored.

It’s _much_ easier to simply train everyone on a consistent set of tools, so that any developer can be productive on any project, and if there is investment in common infrastructure that impact is maximized because the support surface is minimized.\n\nAlso you’re not considering other issues:\n* Security and Compliance review. Every tool that touches the source code needs to be validated to ensure it’s not leaking your company’s IP or customer data. Particularly if you deal with GDPR stuff, you have to be *super careful* around compliance for any tool that might interact with any customer data. \n* Liability issues in the event of a defect. This is usually only relevant to safety critical software, but if it turns out a defect is introduced into the source due to a defect in the tool used to modify the source, this can open up the company to liability. Therefore all of the tools must be explicitly certified. Certifying tools is very expensive and time consuming. Your individual velocity is not worth that effort.\n\nIt’s fine to think a workplace isn’t for you if their workflow doesn’t suit your needs. That’s a mature decision to make. But there are a _lot_ of very good reasons a company, especially a large company where no single developer actually has that much impact in the end, may want to restrict the set of tools their employees use, even if those tools are “free” from a license standpoint.",

Their local tools could be completely secure and compliant, but that's completely irrelevant if there's no CI. And if there *is* (proper) CI, there's no need to control the editor in terms of reliability. Unless of course, a developer continuously delivers, for example, incorrectly indented code (even that could be handled at CI level, depending on the language/format). That's why I did propose a standard for the features of the tool, instead of the tool itself.\n\nThink of it like a client/server architecture. From a server POV, you should *never* trust a client and always validate the request/message/whatever.\n\nTo connect the analogy: if you have no CI and instead mandate all code editors to adhere to certain policies, you're trusting the client. That's a security risk in and of itself.\n\nThe other way around: if you *do* have CI, mandating or not mandating policies among code editors will have absolutely zero effect.\n\nAnd I did take into consideration the idea of telemetry features (or even malicious/undesirable sharing of data) within editors. I'm not sure where you got the idea from that I didn't. Of course, software should be audited before using.",

To be honest, I think if you study LC properly (i.e. truly internalize the patterns underlying the most common data structures and algos), it’s really not so bad. I (really learned) ~all of the Neetcode 150 and it was sufficient for all my interviews. I wouldn’t waste time with more esoteric algos (even dynamic programming problems).\n\n> I sometimes feel stuck because I’m good at job but suck at interviewing and have seen my ex colleagues getting really lucrative offers despite not being great at work.

I found doing the Neetcode questions pretty enjoyable once I left the grinding mode and went into “I want to internalize this” mode.\n\n> How do people balance between spending time on system design vs coding questions??\n\nSpend time on what you need to improve the most.",

I experience that every day, but I do not see those folks ever being truly happy. They are the ones that bitch about work and view it as a means to an end. I choose not to dig that rut. I'm one of those people that are happy when they can be out for a walk and thinking about a problem. You only get that when you actually give a shit about what you're working on. You'll hear the argument of \"they don't give a shit about you, so why should you give a shit about the work,\" and IMO if that's your argument, go be a plumber (pun, jabs intended). \n\nI work on stuff that is interesting to me, and I always try to find things that interest me. I can't see wanting to constantly looking for a job just so I could be judged by some asshole that spends their entire time googling or leaning on AI to solve their problems, but they work for a big company and have a cushy salary, so they must be smarter than me, right? I know what my talent is, and as long as I can put it to use, I'll happily avoid the 90% of judgmental asshats that work for these \"lucrative\" companies. \n\nThis whole leetcode culture never made any sense to me. We don't use it when interviewing. I actually don't really care to ask you to write code. I ask you point blank questions that I expect you to answer right there. I'm not even really looking to see if it's the right answer, I'm instead looking for honesty and passion. If you're the kind of person that is a natural problem solver and humble, you'll admit when you don't know something and it'll be clear how insignificant that is, because you'll figure it out. If I have to go through an experience like college, taking tests to get a job when I've been doing this for 20 years, I don't even want the fucking job. If you're not going to ask me about what I've worked on, which is the most important thing we should be talking about, because then you'll see my passion for my work, then I don't even want to work with you.\n\nSo, long story short, IMO those places that you're failing to join because you didn't pass some arbitrary test are not the kind of place I want to work.

You don’t score points for finishing 30 minutes early. You might however lose points for not explaining your thought process clearly enough. So unless you aren’t finishing take a step back and confirm that speed is actually the issue. I do very well in interviews and I rarely finish more than maybe 10 minutes before the end of the interview (that’s usually when people plan for you to finish) and I only actually write the fully optimal answer maybe 70% of the time. I usually write and explain the realistic answer then tell them how to get from that to the optimal one. \n\nAgree to disagree that algorithms are idiotic. I have found at staff level knowing them has actually come up multiple times. And at this point I’m basically an SRE. \n\nI actually think that position might be why you don’t know the edge cases of the system design. Most edge cases are actually usually related to some really specific piece of how a system works. A system design interview isn’t testing that you know that thing it’s testing that you know how to think about that problem. So for example if someone asked why you would use weighted random over round robin or least outstanding requests it’s useful to know a bit about why those algorithms actually work. But you can ask follow up questions to the interviewer to get more info about the edge case to help you determine how to solve for it. \n\nThe one that comes up the most for me personally is dfs and bfs searches. But that might be industry related or just how I solve problems. \n\nWhat I can say is I think that you are likely too focused on the exact right answer and not focused enough on proving you can effectively work with other people. I’ve failed plenty of people who can parrot the textbook to me because they can’t actually talk to me about the problem. I’m not hiring someone to lock in a closet I’m hiring someone to help out the junior engineer that needs to upgrade sqlalchemy. \n\nAlso just a side note. I assume you are just complaining because it’s Reddit. But if you are giving the complaint about the other engineers as the reason you want a job swap it out. Without proof it is not possible to tell if they are the problem or you are, and you don’t want to make an interviewer guess.",

I'm fine looking at bare markdown, but my stakeholders like to look at fancy rendering and be able to search.\n\nThen, in my docs repo, here's the folder structure I'm using:\n\n- Architecture\n- Engineer-Onboarding\n- Example-Code-and-POCs\n- Meeting-Notes\n- Meeting-Transcripts\n- Presales-Notes\n- Project-Plan\n\nI have a couple goals with this:\n\n- I want everything possible in markdown, so that the wiki renders it, but also so that Copilot has an easy time reading it.\n- It is both readable documentation for humans, and also a virtual brain for me to ask Copilot about, and use Copilot to help organize and document.\n\nI have a couple key MCP Servers configured:\n\n- ado, so that copilot can make suggestions as I work on documentation, and also so that it can turn my meeting transcripts into beautiful updates on ADO tickets.\n- context7, for help documenting things that depend on open-source frameworks\n- browsermcp, because sometimes I want copilot to do things on the web based on what I've documented.\n\nI also have a very extensive /.github/copilot-instructions.md to tell copilot how to work with me.  It has sections like:\n\n- Project Context\n- Key Architecture Components\n- Core Business Requirements\n- Documentation Patterns\n- Key Stakeholders\n- Technology Constraints\n- Meeting Transcript Standards\n- Folder Organization\n- Azure Devops Integration (Describing how I use ADO and how I like things to be entered and formatted)\n- I also have a section of what I call \"Copilot Scripts\".  Sometimes after I've been having copilot do some work, and it took a bit to figure out the best method, I'll tell it, \"Add a section to copilot-instruction.md telling your future self the best way to do this in the future if I ask for it.\"\n\nThis has been huge for me.  Let me give just one example:  After my team's standups, I'll pull the transcript off of Teams.  It comes down as a .docx, and I'll copy-paste that into an .md file.  It won't have formatting.  But I had copilot write a script for itself to use some simple sed commands to format transcripts.  Then, Teams transcription is pretty good, but it has trouble with names and technical proper nouns.  However, I'll ask copilot to \"fix any obvious transcription errors\".  It uses the context of everything in my virtual brain, and does an amazing job fixing these up.\n\nA few other useful queries I use sometimes:\n\n- \"Did this architecture document cover every requirement I have for this feature?  Either here, or in ADO.\"\n- \"The client made some new requests in our meeting today.  Can you extract those as a list of new requirements, and a second list of altered requirements?\"\n- \"One of my engineers went wild and built something before I had finished writing architecture.  That's fine and it's good code.  Please examine what they did and document it for me.\"\n\nOf course, I read (and often modify) *everything* copilot does for me.  Still have to use my brain or it will go off the rails sometimes.  But overall, it's been very useful.",

That means I often spend more time unwinding unintended side effects than the original change was worth.\n\nFor example, I’ll ask for an Angular component that renders data without mutating state, and the result is a complex effect-based solution that mutates shared state because the architecture doesn’t sufficiently constrain how changes are made.\n\nThe problem isn’t that people aren’t trying — it’s that the system allows low-context contributions to have high semantic impact, and review becomes the only safety net.

Solid at team health initiatives like alerting, monitoring, runbooks, documentation. I sense he's fairly burnt out on the red tape and others not carrying their weight. I am happy to plug the minimal gaps of telemetry and overall systems knowledge/experience he lacks and he is for sure a net plus.\n\n**Eng 2** \\- Below average Staff level, 3.5 years company tenure, 22 months team tenure, who can basically only run with fractions of things at a time (a new endpoint or simple controller, a simple module, etc) requires immense spelling out of design from me, very low level code hand holding as he will routinely make incorrect decisions and over-abstract, impatient and has somewhat of an attitude. He's been on the team since the start and has grown only slightly in terms of communication and whenever I see one step forward I also see one back. Zero trust of mine or my managers to investigate mission critical issues and communicate them effectively cross team or in team. Not an owner.\n\n**Eng 3** \\- Average Staff level, 4 years company tenure, 20 months team tenure, slightly stronger than the above in terms of initiative, ownership, and best practices, but still very junior in overall technical experience. Net neutral who could become a net positive with a lot of time.\n\n**Eng 4** \\- Below average Senior, 3.5 years company tenure, 20 months team tenure, who severely lacks communication skills, is very technically inexperienced, over-abstracts all code and thinks they're making it \"cleaner\", pushes back sometimes on my coaching against this. Puts in a solid amount of effort, but I don't see this engineer becoming a net positive to the team across all of our projects in less than over a year as they've been on the team for quite a bit.\n\n**Eng 5** \\- Eng I, 18 months company tenure, 18 months team tenure, who is finally showing initiative now that my manager has really pushed him, I'm happy to coach him and think he can be a net positive for his level. Very receptive to feedback and certainly wants to grow and do a good job.\n\n**Eng 6** \\- Above average Senior, 6 months company/6 months team, is already owning a new feature entirely. He's learning very quickly, excellent investigation muscle and communication skills. Already clear he will become the second strongest member of the team. My EM and I are going to get him involved in the hardest projects immediately.",

I think your best bet as a TL is to heavily prioritize which tracks are the most important and subtly drop the ones that are not. Your team needs focus to succeed too, you can’t spread them thin and then expect high performance, if necessary make of the lowest performers take the fall for the tracks that you decide on subtly dropping.\n\nJust make sure the tracks you drop are the ones your management will be okay with. Of course no one in management will tell you it’s okay to drop any of these tracks but every team as their core track and then a bunch of side tracks that can get derailed.",

My org uses a pretty standard Java backend & React-based frontend. There's nothing special about it, and my team mostly writes a domain-specific app built into the wider company platform using standard (and some custom built) integrations.\n\nAnyway, all that to say, it's good work, and I like it, and I'm happy with my company/org/team (and vice-versa). However, it only offers so much variety in the sorts of technical problems I get to solve, and the tech stack itself is rather pedestrian. I did get into software engineering because it always fascinated me, and I really love the technical side of things. My 40 hours a week is *usually* enough to keep me feeling satisfied. Lately, though, I've had a stronger itch than usual, and been wanting to try out some personal projects, learn some new tech, even dive into more theoretical CS-y things.\n\nUndergrad was great because I could go deep on whatever interested me just through taking classes. I never much had personal side projects then, though, because I got enough out of my coursework and extracurriculars. I've dabbled a *tiny* bit before in trying to learn some new languages with different paradigms, but nothing stuck. Usually it just feels too artificial. I like to have some sort of problem solving to go with it instead of just \"memorize some syntax\" or something, but it's hard to come up with those problems on my own. So I've just never developed the skills needed to learn on my own.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions, or strategies they use? Like, ways to generate ideas for side projects if you want to get hands-on, or resources for teaching yourself something new (including learning about what topics are even out there to explore).\n\nIt feels like such a silly thing to ask, but I think it'd do me well for both my career and my personal satisfaction to work on these tools, to keep the intellectual spark alive.\n\nETA: A little late, but I've read all the replies! Thanks everyone for the suggestions. These are all some helpful pointers, and it's nice to get some insight and direction.",

However, finding the right balance between providing guidance and allowing them to explore and learn independently can be challenging. I've noticed that overly prescriptive mentorship can stifle creativity and confidence in juniors, while too much freedom might leave them feeling lost. One approach I've adopted is to set clear expectations and goals for their development while encouraging them to ask questions and seek solutions themselves. I also find it beneficial to share real-world examples from my own experiences, which helps contextualize concepts in a way that's relatable. I'm curious to hear from others: what strategies have you successfully implemented to mentor juniors? How do you ensure they feel supported while still fostering their growth and autonomy?",

Resume based shortlisting have false positives because it’s hard to verify the details. Take home assignments can also be cheated on. \n\nUntil and unless the interviews are conducted, it’s hard to really gauge competence of a candidate. The leetcode-styled online assessments provide a way where large pool of candidates can be evaluated on ‘general’ problem solving skills which can serve as a somewhat useful metric. \n\nThis is not optimal though. But, the online assessment is a way to somewhat objectively judge a candidate and lots of them at a time, without having to take their word on it. So, why can’t these assessments be made to mimic real software challenges. Like fixing a bug in a big codebase or writing unit tests for a piece of code. This stuff can be evaluated by an online judge based on some criteria.\n\nI feel this would really help in filtering out skilled and role-relevant candidates which can then easily be evaluated in 1-2 interviews max saving time and money. Does any company does this already? I have never seen this style of assessment anywhere. There is Stripe which has very specific rounds to judge practical skills, but even they are in the form of live interviews.\n\nAm I missing something?",

The hope is that it still provides some signal about the candidate.\n\n> Until and unless the interviews are conducted, it’s hard to really gauge competence of a candidate.\n\nIt’s still hard to gauge competence after in-person interviews. We’ve all forgotten how to type when someone was looking over our shoulder… it only gets worse when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n> The leetcode-styled online assessments provide a way where large pool of candidates can be evaluated on ‘general’ problem solving skills which can serve as a somewhat useful metric.\n\nThere’s nothing “general” about leetcode-assessed skills. They test deep DSA knowledge and, usually, little else. They tend to be valued by people that believe “if you can show me hard stuff, I can assume you know easy stuff.”\n\n> Why can’t these assessments be made to mimic real software challenges. Like fixing a bug in a big codebase or writing unit tests for a piece of code.\n\nPeople comfortable in a sufficiently-complex codebase usually can’t fix a meaningfully-complex bug in less than an hour. If a candidate can do it in <60min - likely - the bug is trivial or the codebase isn’t complex. Either way, it’s not much of a filter.\n\n> Does any company does this already?\n\nYes, but many don’t do it for long (for the reasons stated above). Those that stick with it usually have a lower-volume of candidates, can afford more in-person interviews, and desperately want to pass the we’re-reasonable-people vibe check to keep their recruiting pipeline flowing.\n\n> Am I missing something?\n\nHiring is an impossible task. The only way to truly know if someone will be a good fit is to hire them. And, it turns out, that’s a tough-sell to candidates AND management.",

This stuff can be evaluated by an online judge based on some criteria.\n\nI've taken online assessments that are supposed to mimic real world problems. Most of them still suck and feel unfair for several reasons:\n\n- They are almost always timed. The time given is usually enough to solve the problem, but getting stuck for any reason will eat up valuable time.\n- There is no one you can ask question to if something is unclear, or to give you a hint if you're stuck.\n- Debugging rarely resembles how real world debugging works. Often you have no access to a debugger and the only feedback you get is that some test cases are failing with no other clues. So you end up having to choose between trial and error that lets you try a lot of different things but without any real direction, or something more robust like unit tests or a refactor that would potentially yield better results but takes up much more time.\n\nThe most annoying one I did was a 3 hour assessment that involved making a request to an endpoint to get some JSON, doing some processing, then submitting a new JSON payload to another endpoint. After about 90 minutes it was effectively complete but there was something about the JSON I was returning that wasn't quite correct. I tried changing a few things that I thought might be the problem but had no luck, and by that point there wasn't enough time to try a different approach like writing unit tests.\n\nI ended up running out of time and failing the assessment. The reason why the request was failing ended up being something trivial that could have been easily cleared up if there had been an actual human there I could have talked to.",

On top of that, I’m a \"solo\" mom aka my husband works a lot. I don’t have the luxury of working 80-hour weeks to grind through the learning curve; I have to be efficient and present for my kid.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who stepped into a Lead/Architect role without being the absolute expert on day one.

There's folks at your company who have been training QLoRA's at home (and capitalize it that way), have strong opinions about MCP servers and langgraph, and can tell you the purpose of QKV matrices in a transformer. Empower them. Don't steal credit, but this is a topic with a lot of passionate hobbyists out there, and as a Principle in AI you can get engineers who care about this topic but are working in FE or whatever a chance to actually meaningfully contribute. Executives love the idea this is super transformative and effects everyone. \"Finding\" talent within an organization is also appreciated. Reading groups, vendor evaluation teams, tiger teams, whatever. Use \"up-leveling\" others as an excuse to learn what you need to learn yourself.\n\nYou can also always fall back on \"this stuff changes so fast. How do we build in flexibility?\" It's a good idea in all software - avoiding vendor lock-in and such - but damn this field has changed over my lifetime. It's fundamentally a good technical direction anyways, but from a selfish perspective it shows you're \"forward looking\". And it gives you cover for mistakes you'll make. Oops, you bet on the wrong standard. That's ok, you were warning about this, you have a somewhat flexible architecture, choose a new horse and pivot.\n\nBeyond that, full time parent & top level technical employee is a beast of a combo. Be organized, use your time wisely, look for out of the box solutions (e.g. \"mentoring\" to learn yourself), look for high value to low effort solutions, lean on others (hackathons are a blast in AI), it's doable but the answer in your case can't ever be \"just grind\". That's good in one way, and there is always another solution in all but the direst circumstances, but that's the easy plan B so you've got to be making smart decisions every step.\n\nHonestly, there's far worse fields to be faking it in then AI, though. It's new, it's changing, there aren't \"right answers\", knowledge decays quickly. Play to your strengths, know and avoid your weaknesses, and you'll be fine.",

I run them as local tests alongside unit tests, and also in the pipeline. I call them \"acceptance tests\", because I write them from the perspective of the user (not from perspective of ui). The ui is being called in tests, but is abstracted.\n\nLast 10 of my applications were like that:  \n\\- 300-600 acceptance tests (parallelized, tests on a running application) around 1-2 minutes for the whole suite  \n\\- 2000-3000 unit tests - for accidental complexity, domain, no mention of 3rd party usage, around 5-10 seconds for the whole suite.\n\n3rd party libraries, like db, ui, etc. are being exercised in acceptance tests; but logic is tested with unit tests just the library is abstracted away; unless the library can be unittestable too, like string helpers.\n\nMy approach is actually 4-layer approach by Dave Farley, author of Continuous Delivery.\n\nPS: As to who owns the tests - tests are owned by people who break them, because they're supposed to fix them. That's developers, so developers own all of those tests.\n\nMy developmental sequence would be like that:\n\n1. A pair needs to understand what work/problem the user has.\n2. A pair decised they'd do an expierment of what might work to solve the problem for the user.\n3. A pair expresses that as an example, and then writes that as a failing acceptance tests, they decide on an assertion that needs to initially fail.\n4. They write the driver for the acceptance test, so that it can click/fill buttons/inputs that don't exist yet. That already constraints a UI, which is a good thing.\n5. They create the ui and the necessary plumbing to go to the core/domain.\n6. They switch to unit tests, they write unit tests for the necessary logic in the domain.\n7. They stich the calls from the domain to the ui.\n8. They run the acceptance tests, if it passes, they're good to go. If it doesn't, they need to update the code so it works.\n9. Given the pair agrees on the acceptance and unit tests, they push it to the main branch, they're fairly confident in their code, because locally unit and acceptance tests work.\n10. The pipieline runs the tests, and if they pass the feature is deployed to production.\n11. The pair needs now to observe a user use that feature in production, and actually see that the feature solves the problem for the user. When they see it, their job is done.\n12. If the user uses the feature, but still didn't solve his issue or there is still some problems or bugs, that means experiment from 2. should count as invalidated, and the process 2.-11. repeats until a user achieves some benefit and the pair can observe it.\n\nIf the cycle 2.-12. takes too long, that means they took too big of a feature at once. They need to split it into smaller feature, and do 2.-12. cycle on something that can be achieved in 1-2 hours (3 hours tops).\n\nCode review was being done throughout the work by the pair, the tests have been executed throught the test. In steps 3., 6. and 8. they gather feedback on their design decisions, so they can correct the design while they're still working. This is very quick.\n\nThe approach can be desicribed as: TBD,CD,TDD,ATDD,CI,XP.",

I got an opportunity for a SharePoint Architect role, the job descriptions lists .NET/React as important tools as well as SharePoint specific stuff such as SPFx and other Microsoft technologies like Graph API. My concern is how much coding/engineering this role will have me doing. I dont want to just do SharePoint stuff and lose my engineering identity and become less marketable for future engineering roles. The company said I can focus on the .NET backend services and lean on the contractors for SharePoint stuff but I'd be the only non-contractor for SharePoint. They said the coding part is 60% backend and 40% front end and other responsibilities would be creating roadmaps for the entire company's SharePoint infrastructure. If I take this job at the large pay raise I'm aiming for, would my general coding/engineering skills diminish due to being in the SharePoint ecosystem? Looking for any and all advice, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

I’ve built my entire career around custom development on and with SharePoint, and teaching developers how to do the same.\n\nHonestly, it’s hard to predict exactly what you’ll be exposed to or how much development you’ll actually do. Some companies lean heavily into SharePoint customization and extensibility, while others use it much more lightly. Most job descriptions still include “developer” responsibilities, even when the role ends up being mostly configuration.\n\nBased on what you’ve been told, it sounds like you’ll be doing plenty of development. That said, I’d strongly recommend asking the company directly what types of projects you’ll work on and which stacks you’ll be exposed to during your time there. As others have mentioned, a lot of SharePoint work can be out-of-the-box configuration rather than true development. But there are also plenty of companies doing serious custom work on the platform.\n\nFrom a marketability standpoint, I wouldn’t worry too much if the company is genuinely invested in customization and extensibility. I’ve always looked at SharePoint as another API to integrate with, even though it’s obviously more than that. Despite working with SharePoint for 15 years, I still consider myself a \"Microsoft developer\". Most real-world SharePoint solutions involve modern stacks like React, TypeScript, and Webpack, along with Azure services, custom middleware and APIs, and third-party integrations.\n\nWith the right company, there’s plenty of real software engineering to be done. If the role ends up being mostly out-of-the-box configuration, then yes, I’d be a bit more concerned about getting pigeonholed as “just a SharePoint person.”\n\nHappy to answer any questions or offer recommendations. The SharePoint ecosystem is huge, and has a passionate developer community who can help you if you end up taking the job. \n\nTL;DR: You can absolutely exercise strong developer skills in a SharePoint role, but it really depends on the company and the kinds of projects they take on.",

If it's a lot, then I would think this is a SharePoint heavy role, which for your goals, I'd be a tad weary of.\n\nIf the company uses SharePoint more as a document repository and they build applications on top (via SPFx and middleware), then it sounds like it'd fit your Developer goals.",

It gets \\~15k entries a day.\n\nIm adding a feature to that service but am thinking about decreased performance and the implications.\n\nHow the serivce works presently, and this process is not something I can change, is\n\n1. The request enters the consumer and we save to the database, via the MS, the payload and some other data syncronously.\n2. The consumer does it's logic.\n3. On the way back upstream we call again the service and add the response.\n\nBecause of my feature, I want to make my new code async. It's unlikely but not impossible that it could cause performance issues if there's a delay in the upstream waiting for step 1. I also think making it async in the consumer is just kicking the bucket down the road.\n\n**What if my DB logging service hasn't finished saving data from step 1 by the time the consumer has finished step 2?**\n\nIt's a java springboot MS using a postgres container and JPA. Im worried about object optimistic locking issues. I was thinking I can wait n seconds and retry m times for step 3 if I encounter these errors. Or if step 1 hasnt finished by the time step 3 executes, I can wait n seconds to retry before giving up and logging some error.\n\nIs this the best way to do it? The database is used for auditing purposes for our tech support so it's not vital to have live, readily accessible data. 4-8 hours is the minimum time it would need to be accessible, but obviously ASAP is better. Is it overkill to push step 3 to a queue if the object locking failure retries exhaust?\n\n**One other way is to wait for step 3 to save to the DB the data from step 1 and 3. Given the data doesn't need to be accessed straight away, we can just push this all to a queue and not worry about performance.**\n\nLet's just assume step 1 or 2 failures are handled for in step 3.\n\nThanks everyone.

There are a bunch of different options, and which one is appropriate for your use-case depends on the details of your use case and the trade-offs you're willing to accept.\n\nThe reason why people generally gravitate towards just doing things synchronously is because it avoids having to answer a bunch of awkward questions about partial failure modes and out of order event processing and this generally leads to the simplest implementation at the expense of performance. \n\nIf I asked you what should happen if you're unable to produce an audit trail but the actual underlying services are operational, what would you say? \n\nYou mentioned it's OK for the audit trail to be lagged behind, but is it OK to miss requests and responses entirely? \n\nAnd exactly how far lagged behind is it OK to be? What should your audit trail service say about data being requested when its farther lagged behind than that?\n\nAre you prepared to think through what should happen if the audit trail service receives a response before a request? How long should it wait if it's going to wait? \n\nHow does the audit trail service want to handle requests received with no responses? Are those going to be presented as errors, still in progress (if so, how long do you wait?), or something else?\n\nBefore you think through any of those ask yourself a much simpler question: do I really have a performance bottleneck if I just do things synchronously? Your post begs the question that you *will* have a performance issue, but that's not necessarily true unless you've measured... anything. If you're willing to operate the audit service with high availability and low latency SLAs then you might not have any issue to worry about at all depending on what the needs of your calling services are. At 15k requests per day being audited, we're not exactly talking about massive scale here. Can you *really* not handle, say, 100 milliseconds more latency on all these calls?",
