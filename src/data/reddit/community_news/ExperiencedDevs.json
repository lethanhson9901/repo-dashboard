Yes it's great. But it also consistently (although not very often) makes horrible decisions and writes dumbest code possible, which means it's absolutely incapable of working on its own without meticoulus guidance, unless you want your project to be unusable mess. I love this tool because it speeds up development a lot but there are rarely days without making a facepalm when I see its mistakes.\n\n8 yoe",

I spent a long time in consulting across probably 50 or more places, many Fortune 500's (sloppy companies tend to pay consultants more, for obvious reasons) and some more time in FAANG type stuff so I have a wider point of view than most... \n\nWith that said, I think there are two places where something like Claude seem like absolutely clear wins:\n\n1. Really shitty places: If the opex, code coverage and dev quality are all \"lowest offshore bidder\" quality, Claude will legitimately be better than regular devs, and a few smart people can seem like gods. If the system was already broken and unstable the downsides of the churn to get to green is also lower. \n\n2. Really good places, for a little while: If you have a solid system w/ good docs and great unit tests and wonderful CI/CD etc, you can trust Claude to act like a meth-addicted intern refactoring and cleaning up tech debt and hammering out a dozen of those \"we'll get to it some day\" stuff. I'm at a level where I'm in meetings and Slack DM's all day and don't get to write a lot of code, and Claude has let me clean up so much junk that was bugging me but that I couldn't justify prioritizing for myself or any more junior folks.\n\nOTOH the middle is scary. A half decent place is just the trap where even great LLM's can do a lot of damage, b/c there is enough good stuff to damage but not enough safety nets to protect things. In the great places, I  suspect we'll hit a price in 5 years as all the juniors were either laid-off/not-hired/or utterly crippled by brain rot.\n\nIn theory, it's a great ecosystem for a curious, ambitious senior engineer to make more impact than ever. In practice this shit is mostly over-hyped and dangerous.",

For example, the Agile Manifesto rejects processes as a way to accelerate developers. And one of the signers started the insanity of scrum certifications and whatnot. DevOps is orthogonally related; a way for devs to manage their own ops to avoid the process of going through ops. Now DevOps is its own distinct thing in many orgs with a lot of processes.\n\nWe have a history of getting bogged down in processes, creating/using something to relieve us of the weight, then readding processes. Processes aren’t bad; too few is bad and too many is bad and what is enough varies by team and product and company.\n\nWrt GenAI, I think we’ll probably find more processes to slow down how fast we can go with it too.

I agreed with you completely even 6 months ago but have you used Opus 4.5 / GPT 5.2 both on High settings?\n\nYesterday I got word that a fundamental service at my company is being rearchitected. My team owns a repo that’s hardly used but can’t be killed, we inherited it. Needed to know if it was actually using one of the methods that’s changing, or if it was dead code. \n\nAdded the backend repo and frontend repo to the same cursor project. Wrote one paragraph of instruction with context I was aware of. Let claude do its thing while I went and worked on other stuff for 15 min. \n\nCame back and it had grepped the method name then followed the chain all the way up to the endpoint that eventually called it, then tied that back to the frontend code. I manually checked the work and it was perfect. \n\nIt saved me 30 min to an hour and really reduced the cognitive load of the whole thing. To me that is incredibly useful, because I do that kind of work (undocumented code spelunking) constantly. Obviously I’ll keep checking the output but knowing exactly where to look makes it easy and quick. \n\nEarlier models were trash and had no semantic understanding of the code and would make things up based on words/methods that seemed similar but were totally unrelated. ",

          "text": "I don't get those people. AI coding tools produce output that’s only as good as the codebase they have context over and as good as the team using them. I worked on two projects:\n\nOne had a very clean and simple codebase: a good amount of abstractions, dependency injection, solid type definitions for all layers of data, good unit test coverage, documentation, etc. The state of the repo made you feel like you were putting together Lego blocks. The LLMs I used at that time did a good job because they could figure out the proper pieces of functionality to use. In this case, yeah, LLMs can speed up a mature and skilled developer quite a lot—but not to the point of replacing them, because they aren’t able to foresee future bottlenecks like a human can.\n\nThe other project? Oh boy… 20-year-old code with TONS of baked-in logic at the database level, hardcoded values all over the place, no abstractions, no unit tests, SQL queries with 600+ lines of code (repeated all over the codebase with maybe 1 or 2 changes), no reusable code, nothing… The code? It was Jenga code. Spaghetti code is an understatement. The state of the project and team was so bad that we were doing one release and 2–3 hotfixes just to keep the app running.\n\nAnyhow, LLMs were introduced by management to “increase productivity” and all that crap. The result? Even worse code, more bugs, less attention paid by developers due to the commodity effect, more hotfixes, and no standardization on anything new introduced.   \n  \nBasically, the LLMs were making sense of the current codebase and producing equally bad solutions. On a 20+ person team, where maybe 16 of them simply don’t care anymore, the amount of bad code, issues, and debt we pushed in a month was astonishing. I pray not to reach the one-year milestone on that project under those conditions. We reached a state where in theory we push lot's of items but the rate of bounces is at least 75%. QA people can't keep up with this amount of change. Found solution? You guessed it: they hired a QA agency where they leverage AI to write tests based on our AI written Jira items and the codebase changes. The result? Many of our items are simply tested in production by clients.\n\nIn an effort to solve this newly created problem, the C-level executives said: “Let’s add AI code review.” Guess what? Devs are silencing over 20+ comments on a single MR because it keeps pointing out already-present bad patterns and bugs.\n\nSo the moral of my experience is: these tools can’t replace developers on real-life projects. It’s simply impossible without hitting a point where you can’t move forward due to the state of the codebase. Looking at the product milestones, I’m like: yeah, we aren’t able to deliver that, because every new feature introduced creates 3–4–5 other problems on its own that pile up.\n\nWith any new AI tool that was added in my team, the problems increased, quality went even lower, it's harder and harder to write code buuuuut, the numbers look great: +120% more bugs solved (because we created 2x the amount of bugs vs the pre AI era), +200% more features shipped (but 90% of them are not working as expected or they have lot's of problems) and so on....",

Eventually it get to something decent, but in that amount of time I believe I could have done it better myself.\n\nBottom-line: If you're a dogshit coder, Agents may seem like an amazing leap forward, but if you're technical enough and work in statically typed languages where simple copy/pasting isn't good enough the Agents are a small drag on productivity/a small gain depending on the specific task. Unless you are doing a very boilerplate/braindead thing then yes the agents are great at that -- things like Makefiles, Github Actions, etc stuff a junior dev would take a day to do.\n\nIf you look at the thought loop an Agent has as it implements your ask it looks like a 12 year old thinking loop. Agents are built on top of the LLMs directly, and since those have no clue what they are really doing, it's the blind leading the blind. The tech-industrial complex and VC-funded gaslighters will keep posting everywhere that LLMs are a gamechanger and the future, but it's just a cover to push overshoring and layoffs. Plus they are invested in literally 900 AI startups so it's part of their portfolio strategy. The sad part is the entire US equities market is being propped up by these AI narratives and when the music stops it will be harmful for everyone. \n\nNot to mention the only reason companies like OpenAI are still running is because they got 100s of billions of dollars from Dubai and the UAE. It's a national security priority at this point. The last thing anyone cares about is if it actually works for the average dev.",

It can solve problems and iterate on them. The same issues you or I may run into it will run into. But it can realize and solve them much quicker. That's the danger. \n\nIf you're a Company who wants to develop a feature . You still have a developer or two who manages these tests and to guide the agents. That is instead of en entire team of devs who work on the different parts. You set the agents free and have them work. They try things, write what worked and what failed into a central source of truth and keep moving along. Iteratively eventually the AI will get a working piece of code.",

I sometimes asks it to execute smaller tasks, but in general it's much faster to do it myself than to wait for Copilot to do its thing. Even if it does it, I am still spending some time reviewing it to be sure it didn't do anything moronic (it really likes to call ToArray() on a byte stream that represents a file that can be tens of GB).\n\nIt's pretty good at SQL, especially if I don't remember the syntax for PARTITION OVER, but at the same time it means I will never learn that syntax, which sucks. Still, I almost always have to change the SQL later, because we have millions of rows in the database, and the first version with 12 joins (4 of which are on the same table) just takes too long. \n\nIt is a useful tool, very useful, but I don't feel threatened by it at all, at least for now. If I was a React dev, I would start learning C#/Java/Go though.\n\nI am also in the camp where actually typing out the code is the fun part of the job (especially with vim mode!), and then hitting save and seeing the autoformatter put everything in the correct spot.

Here's the first example I found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i\\_built\\_embex\\_a\\_universal\\_vector\\_database\\_orm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/)\n\nHere's the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust](https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust) Open the repo, look at the code, and especially take a look at the commit history to see how the developer wrote it. Take a look at several other projects like that and you'll get your answer.\n\nPersonally I've become incredibly productive using agents. I used Aider first, and now Codex-CLI. I've done some internal projects for my last employer which I wouldn't have been able to do in the normal way. I'm currently unemployed and I'm working on this: [https://github.com/tzanko-matev/cogni](https://github.com/tzanko-matev/cogni) \\- a framework for evaluating a codebase based on the effort that it takes an agent to answer a question about it. So far I've written 0 manual lines of code. You can see my commit history for a better idea how I work, and especially you can take a look at the very messy /spec folder where I keep the documents which drive the agent.\n\nThe general rules for working successfully with agents in my opinion are:\n\n1. When you want to do something first make the agent write a plan. Once the plan is done and to your satisfaction make the agent start implementing the plan  \n  \n2. Make the agent commit frequently. Tell them that before each commit code must build successfully, relevant tests must be written and must pass. This will significantly improve the output of the agent  \n  \n3. You need to set up your development environment and your test suite so that the agent can use them easily. You need to have full test coverage. This might mean things like Playwright tests, e2e tests involving one or more VMs and so on. Agents can create much more sophisticated test harnesses than what human developers would do in the past. \n\nFor example I worked on developing a BPF Linux kernel program. My agent was testing it by starting a VM, running the code, and examining the output. I had a single command \\`just vm-test\\` which would do all of this so that the agent could start it easily. The agent could also SSH into the vm and run commands inside in order to see what's going on when the program wasn't working correctly.  \n  \n4. Refactor often. In order for the agent to work efficiently the code must be maintainable. From time to time I ask the agent to do a full code review and see if the code matches the coding guidelines that I have set. Most important guidelines are to follow Single Responsibility Principle and to have short files. I would ask the the agent to develop a refactoring plan and then to implement it.\n\nI believe that following those rules I can handle codebases with hundreds of thousands of lines of text (code, tests, docs). I don't have experience for larger codebases.",

Utility varies by application and code base; I find it struggles with research type tasks, but most of the work I do isn't like that. \n\nI ended up picking up a side job (couple hours per week) doing something more interesting than my day job because I had so much more free time and because I can use Claude code there as well. \n\nMost of my dev friends have gone all in on it. One guy set up a jira board, GitHub, databricks, and notion with connectors to Claude code, and a bunch of other stuff, and he's been developing at a frenetic pace. Another couple of them have spun up a side business and do most of their development with CC; these are expert engineers btw, just so much faster than they were before. \n\nI see posts like this and I wonder if we're using the tools in the same way. It's fun and also a little depressing how good these tools are. Sure they struggle occasionally but they are also extremely powerful. And they get a lot better the more creative you are and the more context you can provide via connectors, and the more guardrails you build. \n\nP.S. as good as it is, the company leadership at my current day job is still fumbling the bag, as they seem to have ambitious goals that somehow don't align with how to build useful patterns. So it's gonna be a waste of time and money even when people at their own company are secretly finding amazing and useful workflows. It's a bizarre situation and a frustrating one.

      "text": "I have 25yoe. All 3 jobs I've had after the pandemic have been so, so fucking bad. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Here is my latest nightmare:  \n    \nLaid off from a contract. Unemployed for 3 months. Old coworker has a job opening but hed be my manager. Cool, ive worked with him on some projects. Its a long ass commute and im getting paid the lowest I have in the last 8 years. But they say it's super chill and an easy gig.  \n     \nI start my first week and im told the current lead is leavung in 1 week. I am now to take over and entire application where they, somehow, got the idea they could make a simultaneous  multi 4k video stream player that uses raw h264 being piped over websockets, decoded, and manually painted to canvas at 120fps per feed (its a multi camera monitoring system). \n  \nIts written in angular many, many versions behind. Uses web workers. It has to work in an air gapped system with no cloud or internet support. The front end client has to do all the work because the backend servers they sold are basically $99 used dells from 2008. They had a system working using ffmpeg but the transcending was \"melting their recording servers\". The e tire state manage is a giant ball of spaghetti code thats impossible to debug.  \n    \nThey then say I have to get it actually working for a big client that's already pissed that they haven't gotten things they already promised. All during the holidays. And all the other devs are working on other things.  \n    \nNo real requirements, no project management, no QA, just a big ole \"make it work at least better. Old  coworker now new boss is more interested in having meetings and being \"fun manager\". I had to melt Claude and make my own epic and stories with all the implementation guides. They ask me in the beginning if I can get it to work. I said I can get it to work better but cant grantee anything. Which they constantly forget and the product guy is promising the client a release they can \"play with\". \n    \nLike I said, zero qa. No ci/cd. Oh, and surprise \"we need a release on a dev server\" randomly no matter the state of my feature branch. Im having to learn the product while simultaneously trying to fix it. I've got juniors who only know how to optimize rxjs to the nth degree but dont understand the state \"management\" of the application doing nitpicking comments on the PRs.  \n     \nSo yeah, two months slinging code on the tickets I have to create. Creating my own documentation of an existing product. The day comes and I get the FPS drops down from 98% to 75%, there is no more perpetual loading. But they create an entirely new environment with all new cameras and throw it up on it the day before and freak out. Nothing is working with all these fucking cameras i didnt even know existed. They are complaining about things lile \"auto pause\" that i havent even heard of. They say its not 100% working. I told them there was zero chance that it could be. Now the old chum boss wants to have a talk because he just got his ass handed to him and wants to know what the disconnect is with my definition of \"working\". I never said it would be \"working\" I said it will be working better because the entire architecture is a nightmare that I have zero idea how anybody could say it was a good idea.   \n    \nBut great. Already had to use mortgage assistance after the layoff because a ton of family bills rolled in. So now im probably getting shit canned and just need to sell my home.  \n     \nMaybe im have just become a shitty dev. Bit it really feels like im hooking up with one BPD job after another. Im cooked.  \n    \nWhat do you all think? Am I crazy? Just shit at my job now?",

Just curious because as a web developer I would have probably been blindsided with a job having to use some niche technology or whatever. But yeah, unfortunately software engineers these days aren't respected at all. We used to be among the most respected white collar profession. But I think AI is the culprit. It allows every dumb fuck to just spit out code, or some kind of app, and it makes people think our job is easy. It also enables people who would be too dumb to do these kind of jobs at all, to at least have a shot at it, which also devalues the field. And I'm not saying you're dumb at all, but e.g. even you probably wouldn't have been able to jump in and make progress on this random obscure tech without \"melting Claude\" as you put it. Other people do that too, just on a much lower level scale where they go from not being able to do any software engineering work themselves to actually doing work.

I’ve been in the industry nearly 30 years, and have lots of friends in the industry, and man – the stories I could tell!\n\nI’ve also walked in to a lot of jobs like this, especially when working freelance. I’ve found what works for me is brutal, but polite, honesty. Staying frosty while letting management know just how much of a shit-show something is by way of asking clarifying questions and setting expectations early and often. When I walk onto a job like that I question **every** decision looking to simplify everything as quickly as possible, but I’m also mindful of project delivery: they can’t pay me if they’re not getting paid themselves. An impressive demo showing a little (often faked) progress can help get some extra time to get things working properly. Remember: they’re not out to get you, they’re out to get money from the client. You’re actually part of the team, and the team’s goal is sales. You’re not there to build nice software, you’re there to provide value, both to your employer and to their clients. If you can reframe around that, things actually get a bit easier for you; you can balance “building nice things” with “keeping my job” and hopefully have less stress. You’re already breaking stuff into tickets, now group them into milestones with the MVP features done ASAP and get sign off from the client. That clarity may help them chill out.\n\nGood luck!",

The freaking requirements doc that was written up by the product owner doesn't even cover the scope that the software I helped build and develop covers, and I keep telling them that unless we get more staff with dotnet expertise or move at least some people over this is going no where.\n\nHeck, I even let them try doing a ticket for this guy involving a smaller application, they did the ticket only because I provided help and guidance because no one had any idea how to do azure, and even with all that work, the entire thing failed.  Mainly because some person hard coded passwords for users that no one remembers, as well as the user names, stuck them in the software and yeeted out of existence to another job.  There's no source control for the project that was being replaced so if it goes down due to updating the user password the entire thing is toast.\n\nGoing from a dotnet project to a java / spring project that has 5 years or more of history on it is not a code swap, it is a complete rebuild that requires heavy amounts of work to even pull off.  Most likely nuanced lessons are going to get lost and every time a new customer gets added to this thing there is something new that needs to get handled.",

The only way to come out of this as positive is to setup a meeting with your boss to discuss setting up a roadmap for the next 3 months at least, preferably 6+ months. You need concrete and reasonable requirements. Work through the main issues about performance and architecture, and highlight the huge risks of the project promised as-is. The more risk and bleeding-edge techniques applied, the more unpredictable the deadline is. \n\nSetup SLOs and SLAs for the service. Clarify what is and isn’t included. Setup another meeting with stakeholders and get them to agree on these, working through the issues over one or more sessions until both sides are in agreement. No commitments of any kind until this is done. \n\nDon’t commit to any deadlines unless you’re being threatened with termination. You _need_ time to understand the system. They will not be happy, but you should not care about their happiness. You were hired to be an engineer, and a large part of that is preparation and planning. Remind them of that, and specifically that this project will never get back on track without that.\n\nThere is no quick fix to a situation like this, and they need to reset expectations with stakeholders. If there’s a contract/money tied to this, it’s a lost cause already, but don’t let them force you into working overtime and doing death-marches. Their failure to plan and deliver does not constitute treating this as your fault. You deserve to be treated with respect. \n\nSend emails at the end of every meeting with all attendees summarizing the agreements made in the meetings, along with follow-ups for any items that still need resolution. You need to do this to protect yourself from people over-committing on your behalf, and this form of over-communication makes it very difficult for anyone to pass the buck.",

      "text": "I am hearing a lot of stuff about agents as in Claude Code or Antigravity. There are even people saying, that they have 5, 10 or even 20+ agents running at the same time while saying, that they haven't touched an IDE for weeks. That would be a huge change in my workflow. So I gave it an honest try with Antigravity since I have the Gemini Subscriptions anyways and its included in the pricing.\n\nI tried to bootstrap a project and generated specific prompts for the agent and it started working. It looked really good first and I was slowly getting further with the project. I could not \"one-shot\" every functionality, but I kept going further and further.\n\nAt some point, some features were not working as expected. I tried many ways around it, but then something else started to break. \n\nSo eventually I have hit a point, where I suddenly have some random codebase with many thousands of lines and nobody on this world knows how anything is working at all. And even if it seemingly works on the first glance: I have no idea what already works beneath (what might not be visible in the UI), how it works, which tasks are specifically already fully implemented and how easy it may be to add potential requirements in the near future.\n\nI have no idea if there are any security holes or similar. The whole reliability is gone. This may also have legal implications for teams or the whole company, if it is going to be a real production application.\n\nI would need to reverse all of the code to undestand it and build some mental map of it. If I would have prompted it further and further, the codebase would probably grow larger with the same concerns. It feels like the new bottleneck is the cognitive load one can take to understand the huge amount of code that is being generated.\n\nSo my question is: If you work like I described in the first paragraph or know somebody who does something similar like that, do you just dismiss the actual context and understanding of the codebase? Just a quick glance and a \"LGTM\" for the code you produced on your own and up to prod? Or what am I missing here? How does that play out in the real world? I am not a hater or anything, I am just genuinely curious what's going on, since I get flooded on social media with those claims.",

The idea is to provide an agent with some bootstrapping instructions and a number of files it can use to store a roadmap, changelog, and documentation, all intended to make human review of agentic work much easier.\n\nThe framework is intended to limit how much an agent focuses on, keeping its work sessions short and tightly focused.

It's definitely faster than typing everything out charcter by character, switching between mouse and keyboard, or refactoring symbols one instance at a time, but that's not what I do. I have (dumb) autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, code search, macros, and multiple selection, etc., so overall the actual editing is fairly quick and painless. Sometimes it's even a little fun; figuring out how to efficiently perform an unusual transformation with the tools available is like a mini puzzle.\n\n\nSo I'm left wondering if it's a tooling problem. As in, maybe people justifyably find editing code in a barebones or unfamiliar editor tedious, but now instead of looking for a more advanced editor or learning more about the editor they already use, they reach for LLM code generation, because there's less friction getting started with it.",

They are doing performance demos for social media. \"Twenty agents, no IDE for weeks\" is pure bullshit. It only sounds impressive to people who have never owned a production system, never carried pager duty, never been through an incident review, and never had legal, security, or compliance exposure. The moment you care about correctness, auditability, security boundaries, data handling, or long-term maintainability, that entire workflow collapses.\n\nWhat you experienced is the inevitable outcome: a probabilistically assembled code dump with no invariants, no mental model, no trust boundaries, and no ownership. The model has no concept of architectural intent, latent coupling, or future constraints. It optimises locally for \"looks plausible\" and globally for token continuation. That is why fixing one thing breaks three others. That is why you end up with thousands of lines nobody understands, including the system that generated them. The people pushing this are the same class of grifters that pushed crypto, NFTs, and no-code revolutions. They don’t ship regulated systems. They don’t run real businesses. They don’t get sued. They don’t get audited. They don’t maintain anything past a demo window. They sell vibes, screenshots, and affiliate links.\n\nIn the real world, no serious team dismisses context or understanding. \"LGTM\" without comprehension is professional negligence. Shipping code you cannot reason about is how you create security holes, data breaches, operational outages, and legal liability. The cognitive load you identified is not a temporary problem; it is the core bottleneck. You cannot outsource understanding. Once you do, you are no longer engineering you are gambling. Agents are useful as accelerators inside a discipline, not replacements for it. They help write boilerplate, explore options, and reduce mechanical effort. They do not replace architectural thinking, code review, threat modelling, or system ownership. Anyone claiming otherwise is either ignorant, lying, or selling something.\n\nWhat you’re seeing on social media is not the future of software development. It’s the new crypto grift, rebranded for people who don’t know enough to see the failure modes yet.",

Sometimes I officially go in to plan mode, but I don't find it necessary most of the time. Because my framework is so conventional and well documented, everything has a pattern or file type for each need. I can talk through TDD and get the functionality all in place (really complex stuff).

I am detail oriented and acting as UI designer and things in this case too, so - I'm going to tune up the HTML and address and test the accessibility concerns - and I'm personally going to write a lot of the CSS -- but for the most part (besides that) I'm letting CC write all the application logic and wireframe all the interfaces out. I have 2 or 3 windows working on specific areas with their own unique context being built up / or for different features or review tasks. As I go, I review the code in GitTower and make clear grouped commits just like I've always done. I'd rather someone else write all this code... but given that I have to in this case, CC is amazing. It totally works. But it also took me 15 years to learn enough to be able to use it like this. If I didn't have that experience - I'd just be guessing and accepting everything. That wouldn't work out that great. I have to be here to steer things. And since I'm not just producing output based on Figma or spec - it's really important that it *does* work this way. It's iterative and I'm building the real things and having people test along the way. (and I'm not trying to sell anyone on LLMs - I don't care about your code - or your job at all).

          "text": "First of all, I’m not a full-time 'AI agent' developer, but I’ve had enough bad experiences with them to learn a few lessons that might help you.\n\nThe main takeaway is this: \\*\\*You cannot expect the AI to be the software engineer.\\*\\* You are the one who must keep the 'map' of the project in your head. When a project gets complex, AI agents lose the big picture. That’s when hallucinations kick in, and the AI starts making decisions for you—like suggesting a weird version downgrade—that can turn your whole codebase into useless crap.\n\nFor example, I once had Claude try to fix a dependency conflict in an \\*\\*Expo (React Native)\\*\\* project by forcing a \\*\\*version downgrade\\*\\* from SDK 54 all the way back to SDK 40! It basically tried to solve a modern problem by dragging the project back years into the past, making it completely incompatible with everything else. If you don't catch these things, you end up in \\*\\*dependency hell\\*\\*.\n\nInstead of treating AI as a brain, treat it like a \\*\\*scalpel\\*\\*. Use it to make surgical cuts on a very limited scope. Your prompt should define and set strict limits to that scope. For example, ask it to write a specific function and treat it as a 'black box.' Use the AI to comment the code so you know how to interface with it later without having to dive into the logic every time. This is how you actually get a professional advantage from these tools.\n\nBottom line: AI is not a thinking entity; it’s a tool you must direct. Never let it make high-level design decisions. It works great within bounds, but the moment you put your own brain on \\*\\*autopilot\\*\\*, you’re in trouble.",

They're incentivized via their architecture and training to prefer shorter resolutions, so they try to finish everything as fast as possible.\n\nWith that in mind, you are better off keeping their scope as limited as possible, only feeding them additional scope once you've confirmed they succeeded at all prior tasks. They also benefit from grounding, keeping them anchored to something real and steady, as language can drift as semantics get misaligned. So, for your project, try writing all of the tickets ahead of time, define their business requirements, acceptance criteria, any implementation details or preferences, etc. and then whether you are using one agent or 20, they're all pointing at the same thing.",

          "text": "Not to pump TDD too hard, but tests are even more important when working with LLMs. Tests are specifications you can run to validate everything works correctly. If your tests are well written and cover the functionality you need, then an LLM can work with that back and forth until it meets the specs, and when the tests pass you know it is actually working not kind of working. This addresses the issue of fragility you touched upon where \"some features were not working as expected. I tried many ways around it, but then something else started to break.\" Almost certainly the \"something else\" was totally uncovered by your tests so the LLM didn't know and you had to discover it with manual checks. Consider if it was covered by your tests and you required your agent to pass all tests, formatting, lint, etc. the typical CI checks we use to make sure humans don't merge bad code also helps LLMs from making bad commits by providing guardrails.\n\nWhen people say \"one shot\" they usually just typed a single prompt into an AI and hoped for the best despite ambiguity, lack of specification review, lack of validation/testing steps to make sure implementation actually matches the reviewed specification, lack of retry in their development loop to fix any implementation gaps, etc. Consider orchestrating or sequencing multiple agents together like we do with human engineers at scale. With humans in larger companies, when an error gets into production it's never the fault of one engineer. It's always the fault of the process. The process is what is supposed to protect us from getting bad bugs into production and should make it impossible for a single engineer to be able to get code into production alone. Was the change tested, passing the gauntlet of CI checks, was it reviewed with the context to understand what it \\*should\\* do, was it deployed to staging before production, and so on. Anytime someone says \"one shot\" I know they aren't codifying their process properly for systematic checks and fixes. Iterative > one shot.\n\nCognitive load is a real issue not just for humans but LLMs too. I created a static analysis tool for technical debt/complexity analysis as part of the CI flow for my workflows so that terribly written highly complex code is automatically identified with appropriate context provided to an agent to fix during my implementation workflow. You can find tools that can help you with this out there. If you happen to be using Rust I can link you to the tool I built for my projects which is specialized for Rust and LLM consumption.",

Markdown documentation files in the repo are your friend. You can even get the agent to help write some of it, but the point is that you're defining, in detail, what you want the thing to build. Design patterns. Class hierarchies. Interfaces. Any non-trivial design decision. Before you send the agent on its merry way you should have a very strong understanding of what the result should look like architecturally.\n\nThe perk of doing this is that a) you know what it is the agent is supposed to be doing, because it's your docs. And b) it makes reviewing agent code *much* easier because you're not trying to figure out what it's doing, you're just evaluating whether or not the produced code is consistent with your spec.\n\n- Tests tests tests. In the same way if another human programmer turned in some non-trivial bit of code you would expect to see tests with it, you should be expecting tests from the LLM. The scaffold for tests is one of the first things you want to set up.

It is never going to be perfect the first time, so the idea of one-shot prompting it is not remotely the right approach. \n\n2. You must stay on top of what it is doing. You can't trust it to write more code than what you can review and test. \n\n3. Building features is going to be better than starting from scratch on a new project. AI feeds off examples, so showing it exactly how it should build is always going to improve the quality and make reviewing easier. \n\n4. Accept that it isn't going to figure out anything for you, you have to tell it what to do. It can pull things together and seem like it is \"designing\", but it is just parroting examples.

Constantly inventing new patterns inside an existing codebase is a road towards a mess.\n\nCoding with AI is not going to write better code than coding without AI, but it is definitely faster.

You need to architect specifically for the agent and you need to execute with strong oversight. You dont need to watch the code itself, but you need to set small testable and provable deliverables and keep the agent accountable to meet these deliverables. \n\nYou can do the TDD approach where you ask it to write tests first, then ask it to write code that passes all of them. You can iteratively discuss a full user story -> requirements -> task and you should store them to a file and have the LLM reference these files for context. You also need to ask it write extensive logging for errors and exceptions, but you have to prioritize only important logs as spammy logs blow up your context window and completely cripple the LLM. Make the agent write documentation, make it write --help content, LLMs LOVE documentation. \n\nIf you do not follow the correct approach, the agent will likely blow up its context at around 10k LoC with a large error and you will be left holding a bag of 10k lines of code that's borderline worthless.",

          "text": "Why do people expect AI to upload a codebase directly into their brains? You can’t expect to understand a codebase when you “kept going further and further”. \n\nSadly, I know what you mean. AI can do a lot with vague, one-shot prompts. It’s amazing. Someone who doesn’t know a lot can build and explore and learn. I ask AI to do things that are on the edge (and way over the edge) of what I understand. I “vibe code”. It’s a fun way to ask stupid questions and learn. \n\nBut somehow people interpret this as a reason why AI is bad—and how software developers sucks. It’s clickbait for the AI marketing bots. \n\nMore seriously, if you want to work with AI in a long-term live environment as a contributor or small group (not speaking to production environments for engineering teams), you should understand all the code you create. What this means for me is a lot more upfront planning.\n\nIf someone is using 20 agents (and doing it the right way), then they’re probably have a lot of upfront agents that work as a team with other agents. For example, I have a few layers of agents and context:\n\n**Workspace**\nCopilot provides a default “.github/copilot-instructions.md” where I define the language/version, package manager, external links/MCP servers, linking rules, workspace settings, and git. Then, I create a small agent checks those settings, searches websites to suggest stable, popular dependencies. Another agent to summarize commits. \n\n**Development**\nI have a dedicated folder structure for planning. Initially, I create three .md files: \n- scope: describes boundaries and limits; i.e. “building a store with frontend client and backend container. use node. Don’t create infrastructure—use containers”; user stories if you want to go that far\n- plan: describes goals and patterns (i.e. ports and adapters architecture, unit of work for aggregates, helpers for server actions, etc.). Also define entities. These should be explicitly defined, use an example json/yaml file and describe the transaction. Ideally, this plan outlines the tasks to complete. \n- tasks: I usually generate with AI, but look over closely before moving forward. It describes stages and tasks to complete. Tasks includes steps to insure a previous stage is complete. Ideally, when a stage is complete (save the first couple) the app runs and can be tested in that state before moving forward. Tests are crucial. I don’t exactly follow test driven development. I create tests to drive the agents. So, tests that enforce invariants are a base layer—if checkout product doesn’t match cart product, instruct agents to review domain packages. Also for behavior, like this route should never/always be available, if it fails retry precious step. \ntasks.md is an interactive file. Instructions tell agents to mark tasks as complete as they run. \n\nThen that’s when more agents start to get useful. Agent to keep a changelog during development. Agent to create and update documentation. Agents for linting, type checking, summarizing logs, and testing. Agent to suggest features and warn about complexity or check redundancies or performance. Small single purpose agents. I try and get creative sometimes. \n\nIdk about 20 agents running at once, but you can easily get to 20 agents total. It’s fun and cool. Can everyone chill out on the AI coding hate.",

LLMs are a tool, not a magic wish-granting genie in a lamp, and require investment to learn how to use effectively. Without proper context engineering and oversight, they will happily generate complete garbage.

There's a lot of nuance to getting what you want out of using AI properly that comes with practice.\n\nTo start with, you need to always understand what it's produced. There's a lot more time in AI workflows needed for understanding and validation. It's okay to have small parts of the code you don't fully understand, but those need to be well tested. \n\nOne trick to get some level of understanding fast is to start with interactive design. Communicate exactly what you want, and why, have it bring you a few solutions for that, and pick one. That way you know exactly what it's building, and both of you can set guard rails before you start.\n\nGuard rails are critical. Type checking, aggressive linting, and other checks (e.g. I run lighthouse on a stop hook on some projects) will help no end. Treat it like a junior report, where you'll still need to understand what it did. \n\nThe ideal of running 10+ Claudes at once is very real (I'm up to about 12 sometimes), but it takes a lot of practice. Start by getting very good at using one, and add a second once you've mastered the first. And master parallelism via sub-agents before you try to juggle projects. \n\nIt's a difficult skill. The people accurately using 5+ agents at once have been practicing for years now. It's great you've taken the first step now, but don't try to do it all at once.",

No. The ai tool is still LLM based, so the generated code can (and likely will) contain subtle bugs. \n\nWhat's worse tho is that unless you create tiny apps that fit in 1 file, your code lives inside a bigger project, a larger codebase. Your 'new feature' likely works together with a lot of functionality already there. Adding new features in codebases like that takes more effort than just generating code for just that feature; changes ripple through.

And now they’re damaging a lot more and speedrunning to that unmaintainable state.\n\nPeople who were good coders and knew their code backwards and forwards are generally adopting AI as a helper. They’ll run a planning session, then start coding and generate small scope requests, where they read, understand, and refine the output. Their productivity is much higher and the code quality is the same or better, and their understanding is the same. The output gains are very real if you know what you’re doing.\n\nMany are resisting adoption, both good and bad.\n\n“Vibe coding” really only has a place professionally when creating prototypes or internal tools. Theres a reason we haven’t seen an onslaught of vibe coded apps consuming the software market, because you can’t actually build broad scope fully functioning software this way. It will always reach a point where you can’t change it anymore, and it happens very fast.

If I hated that I'd have become a manager years ago.\n\nI get the feeling most people who are in favor of AI tools for development work on web frontends: lots of training data was available, the output seems reasonable and I can understand why people don't want to write JS by hand at times. However backend systems, game engines, complicated desktop apps... the picture is completely different there. Example: for my .NET ORM (LLBLGen Pro) I worked for more than a year full time on the Linq provider (which converts ASTs into command trees which are then used to generate SQL. The ASTs are produced by the C#/VB.NET compilers by generating code that builds them at *runtime* and are called Expression trees, so they exist at runtime). There wasn't (and still isn't) alot of documentation how to do this properly and the code that was there, was hard to understand complicated code. There are many corner cases to deal with (e.g. Linq's Group by has different scoping than SQLs so you have to interpret the tree to properly convert it at the right places, introducing projections etc.). \n\nWould an LLM be able to build that for me? No. I doubt it ever will. It's niche, I know, but I like it as an example of a complex system that requires a lot of work on many levels to make it work. The run-off-the-mill CRUD app might be an ideal case for LLM based AI tools, other complex tasks might be a bridge too far and always will be.",

They learn by identifying patterns in data, which allows them to generate new outputs by leveraging their internal parameters. This means that while you won't necessarily receive the most optimal or innovative code, you'll get solutions that reflect the **average** quality and approaches present in the training data.\n\nTherefore, you should employ machine learning in scenarios where **average** is acceptable. For instance, ML can be beneficial for *generating initial drafts of unit tests* or *creating functions that address common problems*. Additionally, ML can be useful in *identifying architectural errors* and *potential vulnerabilities* in code. You may also want to ask improvements to your existing code, to *learn and improve*.\n\nIf you use AI to generate full-blown, production-ready applications, oof. Don't do that. We'll all eventually pay the price with the spread of crappy, unmanageable code throughout the world.",

Imagine if we could tag allergy concerns, so \"no peanuts\" and \"extra spicy\" have different urgencies?  Or if they said \"swap the chicken for shrimp\" - we want to call them and confirm the extra $$ on the order.  \n\nSo, we have a process which takes a newly submitted menu and queries the LLM. *\"You are a food preparer.  Given this menu and these comments, please read each comment and tell me if they're about allergies, potentially change the cost of the order, or are very negative. Return your answers as structured JSON\".*\n\nThis works amazingly well. Customers aren't exposed to AI slop.  Even if it's not 100% accurate, it's incredibly useful.  It's affordable (about 10c per order) and runs fast enough (5-10 seconds). It's even cheaper in batch (you save on input tokens), so you can run dozens of orders at a time.",

          "text": "Here, I’ll give you an example of what my workflow might look like:\n\nMy team is deploying an internal product to help our Contracts folks negotiate with our suppliers and with our customers. They can upload contract language, we identify the clauses in the contract, provide some enrichment from internal and external datasets, score each clause using a combination of heuristics and ML, and provide an LLM generated top-line with citations.\n\nWe wanted to make these citations a bit more “rich”: add some icons, some conditional highlighting, some onHover behavior, etc.\n\nIt required some changes to our underlying datamodel, some new parsing logic, pipeline updates, then a bunch of wholey-new frontend components.\n\nI had a bunch of this already in my head. I knew which datamodel changes I wanted to make, and I knew how to write the parsing logic I wanted. I spent a morning writing a TDD for these changes. I sent it around to my team for comments. I used Claude Code with Opus 4.5 to plan out the tickets: I knew it would be like 5-8 tickets, but wasn’t sure *all* of the files I needed to touch, and wanted to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Took me about an hour to get all the tickets written to the level of detail I wanted.\n\nAfter that was done, and I’d reviewed my team’s comments, I started working through the tickets.\n\nI implemented the parsing logic myself, I made the datamodel changes and ran migrations. I used Claude Code to bang out the pipeline changes in the meantime. Took me about an hour to write my bit, I checked in on Claude Code every 15min or so to make sure it was moving in the right direction.\n\nThen, I spent about 10-15min reviewing its PR (not really a PR, I had it in a local git worktree, but same idea). Backend changes all look good to me.\n\nI push the branches to get CI going, tag a coworker or two to review. I start on the frontend tickets.\n\nFor these, I point Claude Code (still Opus 4.5) at each Linear ticket, and give it the TDD I wrote as context. I point it at the Figma mocks our designer made.\n\nI check back in on CI for the backend PRs. I ask Claude Code to write some new unit tests covering the backend work. I review them. I edit a few, add one for an edge case it missed. I push.\n\nSwing back to the frontend agents. Fire up the website locally. It doesn’t look right. I tell Claude Code it needs to match the mocks *pixel perfect*. It churns for 5min. Ok, now it matches.\n\nI spend 20min reviewing the frontend changes while CI runs. I add three new end-to-end tests. Everything looks good to me, I tag a coworker in a PR for awareness, set GH to automerge.\n\nMy mental model for Claude Code right now is basically “we are all tech leads”. I spend pretty close to zero time actually *writing* code in vim. Instead, my time is all pre-work and architecture, and code-review. To be fair, this is basically how my job *has* been for the last couple years: figure out what *should* be done, delegate, review what comes back. I think it’s actually made me a more rigorous tech lead because Claude can be super stupid sometimes. It means I have to think about what might be misinterpreted in my tickets, forces me to be really explicit about when I care about certain system specifics, and when I don’t. It means my people-engineers get better-scoped, more detailed plans from me as well.\n\nLater, we want to add the same citations frontend behavior to another part of the website. I didn’t bother writing a ticket — I just pointed Claude at it. “Make this field like XYZ other field, only use existing components and logic.” 3min later, PR ready to merge. I didn’t bother reading the code, just opened the website, made sure end2end tests were passing. Pushed, set to automerge.\n\nMaybe this is vibe coding, maybe it’s going to bite me in the ass. We’ll find out.\n\nIt takes a decent amount of work up-front. I put a lot of work into our test harness. My team’s quite defensive about changes there. It forces me to spend much more timing writing english and reviewing code. But I find that I end up with better process documentation. And honestly, “being an IC” and “being a tech lead” seem like they’re basically the same job to me.",

We have no juniors, everyone’s got minimum 5 years experience. Now I’m back to being an IC, but I think I’m basically bringing my tech lead workflow with me. Part of it is that at my current startup everyone on the team own certain products/initiatives, and borrows small parts of each other’s time. So we all sorta act like the lead for some things, and the IC for others. Having a lot of written material makes it easy for us to stay on top of what everyone else is doing.\n\nOnce we start hiring juniors/interns, I’m not sure how I’ll coach them to use LLMs. Seems tricky and it’s a bridge I haven’t crossed yet.\n\n2. Since we’re prototyping/shipping quite quickly, it’s quite important that we can refactor freely. One thing we experiment with quite a bit is our internal datamodels and some of our API contracts. To give us confidence that we aren’t breaking anyone up/downstream, we spent a bunch of time thinking through some truly end-to-end customer workflows. If they can come back green, we know our system works, even with significant refactors to big parts of our system. With this product we’re at the stage where we want to make breaking changes maybe every week, maybe multiple times a week. Having a strong test harness makes me more confident, and I also think it’s a useful piece of documentation (like a good README) to point the LLMs at in terms of explicit “intended system behavior”. You can often do stuff like “make ABC tests pass, you may not modify the tests”, and that helps bound the LLM a bunch. End-to-end works particularly well, as unit tests can get stale pretty quickly as we modify architecture and internal behavior.",

          "text": "I use AI constantly now, but for me there is a big difference between vibe coding and let’s call it “AI assisted programming”. \n\nLet’s firstly talk about vibe coding. I tried to vibe code a small statistical dashboard for our app. To be honest I achieved what I wanted to achieve, it shows all the data it looks ok, nothing fancy. I spent approximately 6 to 8 hours to do this. Which previously would take me maybe like 3 to 5 working days. So it’s really a noticeable speed up. But. The code is absolute fucking garbage and I absolutely don’t trust it. It’s cool as a demo, but I wouldn’t push this to prod. Also, I still used my knowledge as programmer. I told the AI how ETL pipeline should be structured, even though the code is garbage I still managed to have some separation of concerns there. But still, mine influence on the code was relatively minimal.\n\nBut when it comes to “AI assisted programming” that’s completely different thing. So here I’m more in control and I would create the structure, set everything up and I would just outsource the “boring part” to AI. For example, you just need to develop another simple feature, that doesn’t require much thought. It’s pretty clear how to implement it and you can explain to AI how it should be done. Yes, go ahead and give it to AI. But you see, for this you need to understand the structure of the existing code. In tools like Cursor/Claude code when prompting I quite often tag specific files where changes need to happen and tell it to reuse specific functions. AI is actually very good at solving small, structured and limited problems. Yes, people are too. But still even to mechanically type it and think about small details will take you like several hours, but with this you heavy it ready in 10 minutes.\n\nActually, I have like a rule of thumb to understand if I’m vibe coding or I do “AI assisted programming”. If I can’t review all the code that is generated by AI, and I don’t fully understand it, then it’s 100% vibe coding.\n\nAnother big thing what I use AI for is understanding different code bases. At work, and I work in a big corporate, we have a lot of different repositories that I need to use from time to time. And being in a big corporate means that in 90% of cases it’s much simpler and faster to figure things out on your own than trying to find the right person. So we have company approved Claude code. And I use it to understand what this code base does, how it works, and what parameters I should use. \n\nAnd another thing, is writing small throw away scripts. So there is a joke that programmers would spend 3 days automating things they can manually do in 30 minutes. Well, now with AI you can actually automate it in 5 minutes. And for such things I don’t even use AI code editors. I just ask ChatGPT or other to write script and I’ll copy paste it.",

I enjoy coding and I don’t want to have a tool code my important logic for me and if I absolutely need the help I walk through the code step by step and make sure I understand it. \n\nWhat makes me use AI is when I have spent at least an hour trying to find documentation that better explains an error I’m finding or a solution with one of the build tools I use. I work in the embedded space and I have two build systems, Yocto and CMake. Yocto has a lot of lackluster documentation with no examples and lots of syntactical sugar that is not straightforward. Most of my times using AI have been because I could not figure out how to use some obscure feature in Yocto. This is largely since the space around Yocto is largely proprietary (how many open source embedded OSs are being made?) so you just don’t see a lot of examples or really any documentation when you get into obscure problems. Even then I have had AI fail on me but it did help me generate new ideas I couldn’t see. \n\nI have also used it once for CMake help when I could not figure out how to package and deploy a header only file for Conan2.

          "text": "I started a project a few months ago to explore this very question: https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun\n\nIt's a functional programming language that transpiles to JS.  I don't necessarily intend to push for its usage, but it's meant to be complete enough that it _could_ be used.  I wanted a project with real world complexity that involved domains where I don't have deep knowledge (compilers, type systems, etc.).  It's been on hold for about a month due to RL, but the language design is probably 95% complete and the compiler is at about 80%.  The code is 100% written by Claude Code.  Probably about half Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5.\n\nWhat I'm finding is that it's surprisingly (even shockingly) capable.  But you MUST tailor your approach to work within the capabilities of the AI.  From my experience so far:\n\n* As always the hard part is the requirements.  Several times on this project I had to step back and work out more detailed requirements for the language and/or compiler (still using Claude) because _I_ could see that we were trying to implement something too vague.  Claude will sometimes ask questions when it realizes more detail is needed, but it's never going to tell you \"we need to stop and rethink this entire plan.\"\n* You must leverage CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.  Not just for understanding your code base and standards, but helping the agents navigate and maintain complex parts of the code and repo.  For example the docs/spec (language spec documentation) in my project.\n* You must add all the guardrails you possibly can - strongly typed languages, linters, etc. and you must make sure they're required.  CLAUDE.md isn't enough.  Git hooks aren't enough, Claude knows that it can bypass them with `HUSKY=0 git commit..`.  I added a [Claude hook](https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun/blob/main/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-verify.sh) to block it from committing without passing checks.\n* You must test the hell out of the code base.  My project is about 75% test code and has 90% coverage.  It's not just validating functionality, it's more documentation to tell the agent how the code is supposed to work AND more guardrails to catch problems if the agents starts to go nuts when refactoring or changing functionality.\n* You MUST have multiple layers of checks.  I have Claude form a plan and save it (see `.claude/archive` for examples), then usually have at least 2-3 clean sessions review and revise the plan.  After implementation have a clean session audit the implementation for completeness.  I also have Claude set up in github actions to review PRs (recently set up CodeRabbit tho haven't really used it yet) and it has absolutely pointed out problems with PRs.  Claude Code can use the github CLI to review feedback and update the PR, which is pretty nice.  You need all of this because no matter what you do the agent will sometimes just do whatever the hell it wants - decide that part of the work will be deferred to later, decide that a linter or type error can just be marked with a TODO, or that failing tests are ok because they represent \"pre-existing problems\", etc.\n\nAlso, it's gonna cost money unless you're very casual.  When I started I was on the $20/month plan, it took less than 90 min of coding to hit limits.  I bumped to the $100 plan and have been ok with it, only came close to hitting the limits once when I tried running 3 sessions simultaneously with worktrees.  That gave me a serious headache tho, not interested in doing it regularly.\n\nIf I was starting a new greenfield project with complete control over the technical direction I'd seriously consider vibing it with Claude.  But what does this mean for existing code bases, especially messy legacy code with poor structure, no tests, etc.?  That I don't know, and I think it's going to be very challenging to effectively integrate agents into those code bases.  Unfortunately my day job only allows Copilot, so I haven't been able to explore that aspect very much.",

          "text": "I have around 10 years of experience as a fe dev, started using claude code about three months ago. \n\nGot a project written in angular which we needed to redesign with an actual design from a designer, the design was improvised by the developer along the way in the original version and had really bad UX. \n\nSince we are a react based FE team and we might want to maintain this and develop it in the long run, part of the project was to recreate what existed before but with react now while applying the new design. \n\nThe plan was to go all in with AI from start to finish and evaluate how to integrate it in our workflows from now on. \n\nFirst week or so, I didnt create any code, I created a bunch of “analysis” .md files, I explained to claude code what the project was about, had it read through both the angular project which we would replace, read through the dotnet BE project which we will keep using with minor modifications where needed, explained the stack and architecture I wanted in the end (vite, react, tanstack router, vitest, shad/cn, react hook forms, zod, tanstack query prebuilt with orval etc.), had it read our companies testing guidelines, use our linter setup packages etc. \n\nThis resulted in about 250 of pages of .md if all of the output were combined. From that I started extracting smaller .md files as phases of a plan and then fed that as initial input to the ai, along the way I keep generting various analysis, plan, implementation log and report files and have a mix od human in the loop and more autonomous sessions reading those and spitting out new ones along side the code changes they are doing. \n\nI had a mix of going back and forth between implementing new features, testing, debugging, fixing and refactoring stuff already added and so on. \n\nThe current result is that I have all the functionality ported and it will be tested by our qa for 2 weeks while I am on vacation, on the code side I have 4 different branches covering all the implemenation besides the initial setup stuff, just actual features.\n\nFrist one is the entire auth, profile, onboarding flow, the second one is around 10 simple entity crud flows for the admin, the last two are the actual user flows, the users create something over a multi step detailed form and then they are matched with other users based on some logic and that is basically it.\n\nI probably spent about 20% of my total time on the project on the review and refactoring of the first release MR and I have it exactly how I would want it, and probably at a better state then if I would have wrote it, cause I usually wouldnt add this many tests, besides that,  it would be hard to tell that this looks different then what I would have written without ai.\n\nThe other release merge requests are a lot messier and contain a lot of stuff that is either overcomplicated, not consistent, or plain old wrong etc. \n\nThe plan now is to get all the QA found bugs that will be there in two weeks when I am back from vacation, fix them and go through the same process for all the remaining not refactored release branches and get the code to a place where I am confident to accept it and merge it to production. \n\nIn the entire process I did a couple of manual changes here and there, but for all practical considerations the ai wrote and rewrote the entire project. \n\nI dont have a strong conclusions at this point, besides that using ai as a web dev is probably not going to be optional anymore, besides that, what the process should look like, where the human in the loop is important, exactly how much faster or better on the one hand or worse if overused and underchecked on the other will this make us I have no confidence to say yet.",

Whether that's to gather information - I have Github MCP hooked up to Copilot - so Copilot can gather any historical context or whatever that I might need, or just ask Copilot to do the task for me and see where it gets. \n\nSimple tasks it will just one-shot. I need to review the code and handle the PR workflow and deployment and all that stuff, but the code change is all done by AI. \n\nMore complex tasks, it will handle all the leg work of investigating legacy code and making the required code changes. Quite often the changes are not 100% correct, so I ask it questions to verify it's reasoning and sometimes adjust the code myself. \n\nIn a PR workflow, I now consider it rude and wasteful to ask for human reviewers before getting a Copilot review. \n\nI also use AI for answering questions from Product Managers. eg \"How does <xyz> feature work?\" -  Copilot is absolutely great for these kind of tasks. \n\nThis is just scratching the surface.\n\nI've also built a number of personal projects using OpenAI codex using a relatively obscure tech stacks (Rust + Dioxus or Bevy) which it handles absolutely brilliantly. It does make mistakes, but they're surprisingly human mistakes like a few compile errors after a big change, which it then fixes in 1 or 2 attempts.   \n  \nMy personal projects have become much more ambitious and high quality. What would have taken weeks or months is now taking days or hours, seriously. \n\nA big part of the improvement is not having to pour through sketchy documentation and blog articles trying to piece together the correct way to do something, the AI *just does it.*",

If I don't remember something useful by then, I move on and stop using the LLM.\n\n\nAs far as *actually* executing tasks, I find it produces code that feels like an Escher painting. Nonsense that vaguely *looks* like code until you scrutinize it, and generally it doesn't work the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, nth time you prompt it to \"fix this\" or \"do this\". Much faster just to do the work myself and not have to wander a labyrinth of nonsense. The reason for this is that many systems do the equivalent of cutting up and stitching a recipe book back together whenever you ask for a recipe -- there is no comprehension of the task.\n\n\nBeing able to conversationally prompt for an overview of a topic (prompting for specific references/comparison to topics I do know) is new. It's a feature very few prior technologies could do this well!\n\n\nBut these LLMs do everything else sloppy enough that I can verify the output is wrong and non-fixable with prompting.

I try to “one-shot a simple application” with a SOTA model in my area (databases, asking for a simple unreplicated kv store, aka a hash map with an api), and it crashes and burns. It also takes longer to “think” than it takes me to write the thing myself. I fine-tuned my own model for more systems-level stuff and it works much better to the degree that I find GPT 5 Pro and it to be about equal, except that it runs on my desktop instead of multiple gpu servers. \n\nI trust agents very little. They seem to maybe be functional if you do heavy TDD in a strongly typed language, but that’s borderline imo. \n\nNobody I’ve talked to working in “more critical” software (dbs, drivers, firmware, other systems software) has found a lot of value in LLMs for coding and I had to go to fairly extreme lengths to get something that could maybe replace an intern (at least one I would hire).",

I talk to Claude about what we want to accomplish, it tells me what to do, i help it refine that answer, and then in my role as driver i go in and make the edit myself.

Asking questions about libraries or services I could use, trade offs, capabilities. For example I once asked for a reverse proxy like nginx but something better documented and more opinionated and it suggested caddy. I evaluated caddy, decided it was indeed what I was looking for and I've been using it ever since.\n\nFor coding I use cursor, either through its UI or a custom cli tool I wrote. If through cursor UI, I'll ask for something in broad strokes, like adding an onboarding flow and explaining the pages I want, then for changes like a better component organization or interface adjustments. Eventually I reach diminishing returns and finish and polish whatever it wrote. LLMs always write more than is necessary and cleanup needs to happen to manage project complexity.\n\nThe main value here I think is rapid prototyping. Even for old projects, you sometimes add new things to it and telling an LLM to build it from scratch in a few different ways can quickly test feasibility. Much gets thrown out in these cases anyway. Just, when you've found the approach you prefer, it's important to rework and test and simplify whatever was generated and not just merge it in.\n\nFor the custom tool, I just use that when I'm doing rote work. It's kind of an experiment with getting LLMs to build things more reliably, more info here:\n\nhttps://workflows.saf-demo.online/\n\nIt's basically a way to generate boilerplate then run prompts and checks automatically. It's the only way that I can see where I can have these tools build something non trivial without constant supervision or massive tech debt.",

I do a couple more rounds of review and polish there, then present it.  It is so much faster than before I had the LLM assistant and I end up being more grounded in the design because of the review process I did with the LLM.\n\nAnother project I have set up (instructions plus context persisted for all chats in that project) that will generate code from that design.

          "text": "I've been using ChatGPT extensively since it came out and I feel like it really improved with their thinking models. Today it is usually much better and quicker than just searching on Google.\n\nAs a coding assistant, it became better and better over time. Initially I was just copying code from my machine to ChatGPT and some context, which was super annoying and slow.\n\nI remember trying out Codex (or Claude Code (?), don't remember) at the beginning of this year or in the early part of the summer and wanting to try out just how much could I push these models and how heavilly I could rely on them to do most if not all of the coding work. The first 2 hours were really impressive but then the code became full of design problems / code smell / repeated slightly different versions of code. It would also get stuck in edit/unedit loops (e.g. make change X, doesn't work, revert change X, doesn't work, do change X, repeat).\n\nSo I didn't try these agnetic models after that, until in the middle of November this year when I had an ambitious, low-ish risk project project at work and I had read these models had greatly improved. So I thought about doing the exact same thing, that is see how far I could push these models and check out how heavilly I could rely on them. So I tried Codex once again.\n\nLong-story short: At this point in time I don't think I ever need to write code ever again for mainstream programming language work. These models have improved \\_A LOT\\_ over these few months.\n\nI'd plan the project with ChatGPT 5.something Thinking and Pro and construct a \\`PLAN.md\\` that I'd then have Codex work off of.\n\nAnd it turned out really well. I was very cautious first. Checking all the edits it made and vetting all of them. Criticising the code it wrote or the reasoning for writing the code. I then slowly let that go and just wanted to see how fast we could possibly progress. Turns out I was the biggest bottleneck in getting features out.\n\nAs the project grew and started working, there were tons of features I wanted to add to it and when I reached a point where the work could be done in parallel I would run multiple agents working on different parts of the code base that don't intersect with each other. Now I've reached a point where that is too slow (e.g. having multiple agents working on the same code base) as they step onto each others toes when implementing features, and I am figuring out how to proceed (e.g. each agent runs on its own container and has a copy of the code base and the something-something merge requests, etc.)\n\nIt was also super addicting.\n\nBut as you do it for 12 hours a day for a few weeks you start to notices the issues and quirks of Codex, e.g. it would sometimes just want to delete the contents of your files, get stuck in edit/unedit loops (where something is broken, make change X, still broken, undo change X, still broken, redo change X, repeat), get stuck in really long thinking loops where it made no progress for up to an hour at least for what seemd like a trivial task, or its personality would flip and it would become really hesitant about editing code (to the extent it refused to do, e.g. \"Are you really sure you want to do it? It is a really big change and has to touch on all the files of the codebase.\"), etc. The code it makes also starts to become smelly and poorly architected over time and you have to explicitly suggest for it to rearchitecture/refactor. After multiple compactions it would also tend to become weird and glitchy, so I often start a new fresh codex once it starts to behave weirdly. I was also surprised that 400K tokens is pretty small (about 10 - 20 minutes of work on gpt-5.1.codex high).\n\nSo, yes, I am in the process of figuring out how I can accelerate even more as there are lots of features I want it to work on simultaneously but my environment is poorly structured for that. It definitely feels now you can 10x (or more) your productivity with these current models.\n\nIf you are skeptical just try them out for yourself.\n\nBTW: I was using Codex CLI.",

I've dabbled a tiny bit with NotebookLLM for organising notes, but not enough to give much of an opinion.\n\nThe \"smallest\" hurdle for me is the conversational aspect. Back-and-forth with an AI just seems weird, and that's a mental bloc for me. The anthromorphisation (sp?) of AI annoys the heck out of me.\n\nFor writing code, my observations from reviewing AI-generated code is that it'll produce more of the same - quality is inconsistent across our repos (and I'll hold my hand up as being someone who has contributed to that) so more of the same isn't necessarily desirable IMO, and the test suites don't always  provide great confidence to support an AI-assisted reactor. \n\n---\n\nThe rest of my team have been using it, along with a reasonable degree of adoption across other teams. Within my team, I've seen it used a lot for essentially transcribing designs from Figma to React - in these cases, the \"more of the same\" aspect comes up and you see a lot of low-level building blocks being used. For example, `<Typography variant=\"m\">` instead of a higher-level component that would describe the semantics.\n\nAI-assisted PRs have tended to be big, but I think that's down to both our code structure and the AI tools\n\nThe tests I've seen it produce are mostly fine, but it will often introduce a couple of tests that are worthless. One such case, it added a comment over a test saying `// CRITICAL BUG FIX` but the test itself didn't assert anything related to the bug in question.",

For me, a value stream map, would look like this:\n\n- PM writes JIRA ticket\n- read JIRA ticket to identify scope, priority, and complexity\n- update JIRA ticket with my understanding\n- JIRA ticket goes through refinement\n- engineers critique ticket until it meets definition of ready\n- engineers place story in ready for work\n- engineer gather context of the scope\n- engineer begins work with context\n- engineer validates work locally\n- engineer reviews work locally\n- engineer creates code review\n- engineer has work reviewed\n- engineer has code merged\n- code is deployed\n- engineer monitors changes\n- engineer reverts changes if issues arise\n\n\n\nThis likely is pretty similar to something you’ve worked in before, but it’s important to label each step.

Do you look for syntax errors? Do you care about cyclomatic complexity? Are you following a certain pattern you’ve defined as a best practice? Are these documented anywhere?\n- add as much context as you can. This is the key. Don’t add too much to the skill itself, let the superpower create referential documentation.\n- review with your skill\n- review the code yourself\n- what was different? Can you update the skill to enhance the output?\n- if you ran the review with 5 sub-agents, does this catch as many bugs as you would expect?\n\nWith this, remember, this is one tiny step of automating your process.

I'd done a lot of experimentation early on this year and hadn't been particularly impressed. Things have dramatically changed though and I'm now pretty shocked at what is possible. There is still a ways to go, especially on the web design side but it's impressive. \n\nThe problem however is now that rather being a software engineer I'm far closer to being a product owner who is doing requirements engineering. It's possible to 'vibe' it but then it's a pretty crappy loop of describing a small change, evaluating the plan, letting Codex implement and then evaluating the change. \n\nIt's also .. unsatisfying. I got into software engineering due to ADHD traits and focusing on problems felt great. As said, this is closer to requirements engineering/product ownership and fixing a problem ... just isn't as satisfying.\n\nLong story short, if approaches like Codex continue to improve I expect a shift in what we do (for apps) to change to being more requirements driven, but having an understanding of the technical tradeoffs that approaches an AI might take in implementing features or addressing problems is going to remain valuable.",

Create a pipeline for translating online documentation to JSON templates, and making API calls to generate resources for those templates. This collection of Md files has already saved dozens of hours of work.\n\n2. Big giant find replace for css colors and variables in css. Stuff I could have done (and did a lot of) manually. But yeah literally just like 200 css files and 3-4K hex codes, translated to css variables. AI also solved all the things where you can use hex codes but can’t use variables.\n\n3. Setting up a npm package/vite library for React components and css tokens, so different apps can use the same styling. I had never set up a library before and AI walked me through how to configure vite for a package, the build, etc.\n\n4. Any figma design, I can throw Claude at it and it gets it 90% of the way there in minutes. No more manually going back and forth or copy pasting a figma component and editing it in your code. If Claude is set up to do “best practices” and pull from existing styles it’s very easy to get it to pull stuff over in a DRY way.\n\n5. I will throw a full ticket at it, copy pasted from Jira, and it will hunt down what might be causing the problem in the code. I will continue to prompt Claude forward until it can explain or point at something that I can then manually go in and investigate. Great when you don’t have domain knowledge.\n\n6. 3rd party integrations. If the 3rd party has online documentation that is public (like most) -super easy. I have only done this with one company so far but it is basically telling Claude where I want it in the code, what the url of the documentation is, and then going and cleaning it up after.",

I find writing tests more enjoyable than reviewing and correcting generated tests.\n\nI've also found that generated code is often more like a StackOverflow answer - it may address the immediate question at hand, but may not be written in a way that works as well if you need a bit more abstraction.

For example if I want to write a chrome plugin for the first time, it is pretty great at setting up the framework to do all of it. Similarly with any sort of scripts to improve productivity, they are one off and not hooked into a larger code base and these can increase productivity.\n\n\nTests: \n\n\n- I like to make it write the first few tests, but I hate when it writes 30 tests. Now I just ask it to write one test to test a specific thing. Then I make sure the test is functioning correctly then copy it to make the five tests that I want of that style.\n\n\n- when it writes all 30 tests, it often isn't testing what it appears to be testing. Or is testing in such a way that it passes regardless of whether the code is right. In a sense it is trying to write tests that pass.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n- One shot it works, or it goes around in circles and sucks. Mostly the latter, so far as I can tell. \n\n\n- It very quickly turns to hacky solutions to make things work rather than sticking to best practices that you have asked it to, or that exist in the code base.\n\n\nOverall, it is too eager to write too much. And the more code there is written the more bugs there are. The more code there is to read, surpassing the ability of the dev to comprehend and parse all of it. So I don't understand how people are letting agents loose to write tons of code. I end up trying my best to constrain it to write less code most of the time, so that I can ensure it's doing the right thing.",

In Cursor, I describe the issue I'm seeing and use the file/line as context and ask it to trace the issue. I also ask for a report at the end with commit hashes and commit links to gitlab/GitHub. The report means I can quickly check if it's correct and throw it away if it's wrong.\n\nGeneralizing, I've found it quite good at chasing around command line output.\n\n2. Doing a task that is scriptable, but might take too long to script by hand? I ask the AI to do it and often get something close enough to make automation worthwhile.\n\nI find building things up piece by piece works much better  than having it write the whole thing in one shot. The code is way easier to review too. \n\nGiving algorithmic suggestions can also cut off some hacky solutions. E.g. parse by matching parens rather than a brittle regex.\n\n3. When I'm working in a domain, tool, etc I don't know well, I find that the suggestions/code it produces are useful to give me ideas and pointers to strategies even if I don't directly use the output. E.g. some CMake issue I don't know anything about or some Linux system config I have no experience with.\n\n4. Searching the code base. Where are the tests for this function? Do we have tools that do X? What idioms do we use for Y?\n\n5. Ideation. Getting ideas for alternative implementation strategies or architectures. Asking for feedback on something I've written. \n\nAlso, I've found connecting MCP servers to be very helpful for giving context.

I push the agent to use modern standards and tools. It tries to hand-roll everything by default, like it's in a coding contest, so it needs to be told. \n\nValidation is done the same as before: Manual, E2E, or Unit depending on the project. Unit is mostly for libraries. E2E for user-facing apps. Manual is all you need for prototypes and experimental branches. \n\nAs far as evaluating the upsides and downsides, there is far less \"low-level\" thinking required which means you get more practice at conceptual planning. More code review means your intuition for code quality grows. More time writing natural language means your communication skills improve. If your goal is just to build stuff, then this is all great. The downside is that you won't be in touch with the inner workings of your projects. On the other hand, building your own libraries is easier than ever so you might end up with a deep understanding anyways. \n\nIn the past, I would plan things out as well as I could and do the coding in dedicated, high-intensity sessions.

However my expectation isn't that it makes the work magically go away, it shifts it and in the process increases my output.\n\nSpecifically I have one folder \"work\" with a Claude.md file that contains general instructions: the code bases we run, the db servers we use and for what, how to connect to the ticket system (devops, could be jira or whatever), the general workflow, general guidelines.\n\nThen I have one folder for each of the repos I work with that contains the main branch and for each work item I one sub folder.\n\nThe main branch folder has more specific instructions for that repo, each solution/project in there more specific ones for that solution.\n\nWhen I start working on a work item, I open claude in the /folder with the main branch, ask it to read the claude.md, have a look at work item at <url> and then create a new worktree and branch.\n\nIt creates the git worktree (a copy of a repo, mapped to one specific branch) and the branch. \n\nFrom there I then let it work through the item. Depending on the day, I pop into that new directory, open claude from there, paste the URL again, turn on planning mode and ask it to use ultrathink to come up with a plan on how to tackle this.\n\nThen there can be a back and forth until we settle on a solution, and claude gets to implementing. First the thing itself, then the tests.\n\nI usually don't let it commit, but read everything through myself, test and eventually ask it to make the commit, push and create the PR.",

          "text": "I'll tell you three different stories about AI use. \n\n*How I use it at home*\n\nGmail does not have a sort by sender.  To replicate this, I copy the email address of the sender of the email I'm on, and paste it into the search bar with [from:$sender in:inbox].  But last week, instead of doing that, I realized that I could have Claude write a chrome plugin to do this for me.  So I gave it this prompt:  \n\n    i want to create a chrome extension called \"gmail search for sender\".  requirements:\n\n    add a keyboard shortcut to gmail to activate the functionality\n    the keyboard shortcut should be pressing i.\n    when you press the shortcut, it will search the current message for it's sender, ideally using the from: line, and then do a gmail search for messages from that sender in the inbox.\n    The search should look like \"from:$email in:inbox\"\n\nAnd it gave me a chrome plugin and install instructions.  I found one bug, that I told it about and it fixed, and then I had a plugin.  This plugin 10x my email productivity.  Now I can get through 1000 messages at a time -- before I could get through maybe 10 before I got tired of the copy/paste.\n\nI am not a frontend dev, so I could not have done this myself without hours of work and I most likely would have given up before getting it to work.  Using Claude was the only way this would happen.\n\n*How we use it at work*\n\nI'm the CEO of a small software company.  I've told my team that they can use the company card to pay for any AI tool they find value in.  Some are using Claude, some are using Gemini, some are using Codex.  Each uses it for different things.\n\n- One team member uses it for simple frontend work.  He's great at backend, but not at frontend, so he will use AI to write frontend code.\n\n- Another team member used it for porting work.  We had a library in Python and wanted to make a Go version.  He did not just ask it to port the whole library, but instead went function by function asking it to port each one using the Python as a reference.  He would give Claude the general plan and context as to what the function does, and then iterate with Claude for a bit, sometimes making manual changes.  He also used Claude to write the initial test suite by porting over the Python test suite.  *Claude/AI is really good at porting existing code to a new language*.\n\n- Others are using it for code review.  They will plug their code into AI after writing it and ask for a code review.  Sometimes it comes up with some useful suggestions, which they will implement themselves before submitting for human code review.\n\nOverall my team members say that it's increased their productivity 2-3x.\n\n*How my friends use it*\n\nhttps://github.com/adrianco/meGPT\n\nHe built an entire MCP server to replicate himself, and it was 100% coded in AI.  He also has another project where he wrote a Swift app, also 100% coded in AI.  He's doing this work in the open on his GitHub so people can follow along.  He's retired now, so he just does this for a couple hours a week, but he's outputting as many results as he used to when he was working full time.\n\nAnother friend set up an \"AI coding team\", where they gave each AI a personality (\"you are a principal engineer and believe in test driven development\", \"you are a curmudgeon, you poke holes in everyone else's code\").  Then they give the task to the \"team\" with a detailed design document, which iterates and comes up with a solution.",

I'm leaving.  \n  \nI know any tool should do the job and the editor you use shouldn't affect your ability to do your tasks as much, but I'm doing this full time and it's becoming a daily inconvenience.\n\nI'm mandated to use VS code and Sourcetree. Both great tools, but *I* *live* inside the shell. Their workflow is good, but not for me. I have asked for a reason and they gave the following:\n\n\\- They want to prevent mistakes from happening --> So instead of responsibility, they introduced a seatbelt  \n\\- They want me to be able to help others, as well as have them help me. If I use different tools, that becomes harder --> We can just open GitLab, or, I don't know, open a different editor when someone is looking at my screen :)\n\nI've already addressed this multiple times and it starts to gnaw at me. I proposed the idea of instead of mandating a tool, mandating key features of said tool. For example, instead of \"You should use VSCode\", they could say \"You should use an editor with LSP support and a linter as well as basic highlighting features\". They then told me that they don't feel like managing multiple types of software and they don't want everyone to download whatever they feel like (I should mention, we are concerned with information security and therefore comply to ISO/IEC 27001 standard.)\n\nI seem to be alone in this, because I'm the only dev at my workplace that seems to have a problem with this. This makes it very hard to have a credible opinion. Most other devs already used VS code along with Sourcetree (or Fork) and others have started their careers at this place with said tools.\n\nI feels like I'm at a dead end with this. I'm not planning to leave for this, but the fact that we're being micro managed like this does give me the ick. Do you think it's feasible to try and convince management? And if so, what do you recommend?",

People aren't standard.  The implication is that they're not interested in getting the best you have to offer, they just want what you can give without tailoring your role to you because customizing your company laptop undermines the ability to pass it along to drone 53 and they pick up where you left off.  \n\nAnd again, I get why; they development to be a solid bedrock on which they can build.  They want it to be dependable engine so it can manage itself and they can make more interesting and profitable manoeuvres with marketing, and sales strategy.\n\nBut the thing is: as a developer, it sucks to be forgotten and ignored.

It does not have anything in common with an assembly line, and managers acting as if it does is not simply insulting, but deeply wrong.

You'll look amazing and responsible and the organization will grind to a half under a sea of red tape.  Make everything a management decision that requires sign off.\n\n- Suck it up.

          "text": "You’re not wrong to feel the ick. What you’re reacting to isn’t Cursor or VS Code. It’s a shift in how trust and responsibility are being handled.\n\nMandating a tool instead of mandating outcomes is a common management move under uncertainty. It feels safer because it’s legible. “Everyone uses the same thing” is easier to reason about than “everyone understands what they’re doing.” But that safety is mostly cosmetic.\n\nA few hard truths that may help you decide how much energy to spend here:\n\nFirst, this isn’t really about editors. It’s about governability. Management is optimizing for predictability and supportability. Tool standardization lowers coordination cost and makes oversight feel simpler. That’s true even when there is no regulatory requirement driving it.\n\nIf there is a regulatory or compliance requirement, the mistake is the same one you already identified: confusing controls with brands. Standards almost never require a specific editor. They require capabilities, auditability, and accountability. Mandating a tool is an implementation shortcut, not a compliance necessity.\n\nSecond, they’re conflating guardrails with judgment. Seatbelts don’t replace drivers. Linters don’t replace understanding. “AI-first” doesn’t prevent mistakes. It changes where and how mistakes surface. If the organization can’t explain why a system behaves the way it does without pointing at a tool, they’ve traded responsibility for comfort.\n\nThird, you’re likely outnumbered because most people don’t feel the cost yet. Standard tools are usually a net positive for juniors and generalists. The friction shows up for people who are deeply fluent and already operate with strong internal discipline. That doesn’t make your concern invalid. It just makes it invisible to the majority.\n\nIf you try to convince management, don’t argue preference or philosophy. Argue failure modes.\n\nA productive framing sounds like:\n“I’m aligned with the goals: fewer incidents, better collaboration, and lower risk. My concern is that we’re treating tools as controls instead of requiring specific behaviors and capabilities. That works until something goes wrong, and then nobody can explain why.”\n\nThen offer concrete alternatives that still satisfy oversight needs:\n\t•\tDefine required capabilities, not brands.\n\t•\tDefine review, ownership, and rollback expectations explicitly.\n\t•\tAllow tool variance with a clear support boundary: if you choose a non-standard tool, you own first-line support.\n\t•\tMake AI usage explicit and reviewable, not assumed safe by default.\n\nThat last point matters. “AI-first” without clear expectations around review and ownership doesn’t reduce risk. It redistributes it. Speed without comprehension is deferred outage.\n\nNow the uncomfortable part.\n\nEven if you’re right, this may still be a losing argument. Some organizations choose uniformity over judgment on purpose. Not because they’re incompetent, but because they’re optimizing for scale, not craft. That’s a valid choice. It’s just not a neutral one.\n\nYou’re not unreasonable for pushing back. You’re also not obligated to stay if the direction continues toward tool-enforced conformity and away from judgment-based trust.\n\nThe craft was never meant to be duct tape and YAML. The craft is building systems that behave under pressure, and being able to explain why.\n\nIf that’s no longer what’s being rewarded, believe the signal.",

It’s _much_ easier to simply train everyone on a consistent set of tools, so that any developer can be productive on any project, and if there is investment in common infrastructure that impact is maximized because the support surface is minimized.\n\nAlso you’re not considering other issues:\n* Security and Compliance review. Every tool that touches the source code needs to be validated to ensure it’s not leaking your company’s IP or customer data. Particularly if you deal with GDPR stuff, you have to be *super careful* around compliance for any tool that might interact with any customer data. \n* Liability issues in the event of a defect. This is usually only relevant to safety critical software, but if it turns out a defect is introduced into the source due to a defect in the tool used to modify the source, this can open up the company to liability. Therefore all of the tools must be explicitly certified. Certifying tools is very expensive and time consuming. Your individual velocity is not worth that effort.\n\nIt’s fine to think a workplace isn’t for you if their workflow doesn’t suit your needs. That’s a mature decision to make. But there are a _lot_ of very good reasons a company, especially a large company where no single developer actually has that much impact in the end, may want to restrict the set of tools their employees use, even if those tools are “free” from a license standpoint.",

Relying exclusively on CI as your only line of defense for software quality is a poor choice. It certainly should make change *easier to validate*, but all testing has oracle issues. Plus, CI does nothing to validate your random editor/extension is not leaking your IP to a third party, or customer data. (To be clear, extensive CI is wonderful. “If CI passes, it ships to main” should be the goal for every org. The repo I work in day to day sweeps well over 80 permutations of compiler/C++ standard/OS/stdlib combinations, plus another 20 or so sanitizers and static analysis tools).\n\nIn addition, for safety critical software development, it’s not really an option, it’s *required* to qualify every single tool that could impact the bits that wind up executing on the safety critical system. For example, read [this](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/m/61793_CMR10-16.pdf ) paper from MathWorks on the process for ISO26262.

The team is working well and we're optimistic to get QA operational by the end of Q3'26. \n\nMy next big task is assembling a team to migrate the stored procedure nightmare that basically runs the entire company. There's 4 or 5 databases each with \\~500 stored procedures running on a single Microsoft SQL instance. As you can imagine, costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers. \n\nThe system is slightly decoupled, HTTP requests ping back and forth between 3 main components, and there's an in-house ORM orchestrating all of the magic. There's nothing inherently wrong with the ORM, and I'd like to keep it place, but it is responsible for calling all the stored procedures.  \n\nThe final component/layer is responsible for receiving the HTTP requests and executing the query/insert/stored procedure (It's basically SQL over HTTP, the payload contains the statement to be executed). \n\n  \nWhile some of the functions are appropriately locked in the database, a very large percentage of them would be simplified as code. This would remove load from the database, expand the pool of developers that are able to work on them, and sweet sweet unit testing.\n\nI'm thinking of \"intercepting\" the stored procedure requests, and more-or-less building a switch statement/dictionary with feature flags (procedure, tenant, percentage) that would call native code opposed to the stored proc.  \n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with this?\n\n  \n",

This gets a bit tricky with mutable state paths, but you can work out how to handle those on an individual basis.\n\nOnce you have enough runs where there is no differential in outputs for both paths (stored proc & code), you have a *bit* more certainty that you can switch over. As a bonus: if you collect the input/outputs for each run, you now have a solid compendium of data to derive your first tests from :)",

Furthermore, you should be able to easily create stored procedures on the cloud without any issues if you choose the right infra. So, if the only goal is to move your service to the cloud, then you don't have to eliminate the stored procedures at all.\n\nHow important is it to the project for you to improve the performance of the system? If it is important, then I would try to determine what the ideal state of the system would be, and then move iteratively towards that solution. If it is not important to improve the performance, and moving to the cloud is the primary goal, then I would try to avoid making any changes to the stored procedures unless necessary. You might see some significant performance improvements if you just optimize the SQL in the existing stored procedures.\n\nRegarding the solution you proposed...IMO the idea of a \"SQL over HTTP\" service sounds like an unnecessary abstraction in the first place. The database itself is SQL over HTTP -- why do you need an additional layer? Furthermore, having the SQL over HTTP service rewrite the queries sounds extremely confusing and error-prone. It's not hard to imagine a situation in which the service breaks a query by rewriting it incorrectly, and then the upstream clients can't figure out why it's not working because they sent the correct SQL to the downstream service.",

          "text": "Let's get back to basics: Are you sure that the stored procedures are the performance problem?\n\nStored procedures aren't imbued with any intrinsic performance detriments that are - in and of themselves - going to compromise your workload.\n\nOn the contrary, well-written stored procedures tend to perform better in a lot of scenarios.\n\nFor example: Suppose you have a transaction comprising two statements, where the result set (comprising an arbitrary number of rows) of the first statement informs the second statement.\n\nIf you were to write the equivalent in application-tier code, the results from the first statement would need to traverse the network so that the application-tier code could then run the second statement. Locks end up being held longer, increasing the occurrence of blocking - thus reducing concurrency, and increasing latencies - in a busy enough database, because SQL Server needs to wait on the client (the application-tier code) to consume the first result set, then run the second query, and ultimately commit the transaction. There are of course other factors such as the use of RCSI (read committed snapshot isolation) which complicate the matter, but you can probably see what I'm driving at.\n\nIf the application-tier code is egregious enough (e.g.: it loops through each row received and, in each iteration, does something relatively slow like appending data to a file or making a HTTP request over the network to another service) then the likelihood of blocking other concurrent database queries is very high.\n\nOn the other hand, no such network traversal would happen if the transaction comprising the two statements happens within a stored procedure.\n\nBut moving on.\n\nSQL Server is a sophisticated piece of software in which ultimately everything boils down to queueing (i.e., 'wait stats' for the topic of interest) and sharing. It's essentially one big zero-sum game of contention management where any one query in the workload runs in contention with - and to the detriment of - the others (unless you're overprovisioned, in which case the server will be quite bored).\n\nThe challenges are manifold. You need to identify your actual bottleneck. It'll be CPU, memory, disk IO, or network IO - or perhaps something more exotic. Analysing your wait stats are the way to accomplish this.\n\nYou might well find that there are a small handful of problematic queries that are overwhelmingly responsible for dominating the server's resources (CPU, RAM, IO), and in doing so marginalising the rest of the workload. If your databases are multi-tenanted, it might even be more specific than that: It might be the case that it's a small number of queries run in context of a specific tenant's data (i.e., perhaps you have 99th percentile tenants who absolutely dwarf all of your other tenants in terms of how many rows of data they have).\n\nYou might well find that some well-meaning developer has written a query that uses a TVF (table-valued function), and that this TVF is running hundreds or thousands of times per second (or worse). It's unfortunate, but a lot of developers fall into the trap of trying to modularise T-SQL code as they would C# code or Java code due to ideals like DRY (don't repeat yourself). But doing so in T-SQL can oftentimes compromise the query planner's ability to produce performant query plans.\n\nYou also need to consider the prospect that known challenges in SQL Server - such as parameter sniffing, or inaccurate estimates - are introducing inconsistency in your workloads. Perhaps queries are sometimes fast and sometimes slow depending on the order in which queries are executed and for which parameters (which might lead to a query plan cached for 'small' volumes of data being applied for 'large' volumes of data, or vice versa).\n\nThere is a whole body of knowledge - performance tuning - which is far too extensive to cover in a single Reddit comment.\n\nAnyway, suffice it to say that my gut feeling is that if you make a concerted effort to understand your current performance characteristics, you might find that a small amount of index or query tuning can actually change your fortunes and get you to a much happier place.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to take what amounts to presumably years of accumulated intellectual property and essentially dispose of it, which might itself take years of effort.\n\nIf these 2000 to 2500 stored procedures are even moderately complex, what you're describing is tantamount to a rewrite. As fun as it is to daydream about 'getting it right', these efforts tend to burn the political capital of those who pursue them and - frankly - can cripple otherwise healthy businesses (because the rewrites aren't without cost - they divert effort from other initiatives).\n\nI sympathise with the remarks about testability, but I'd put it to you that T-SQL isn't inherently untestable. There's an actual unit test library out there - tSQLt - if you fancy that. But you could just as easily write bespoke test scripts that establish a baseline (i.e., schema and data content) and then assert a number of preconditions and postconditions with respect to a procedure executed under test.\n\nI also sympathise with the view that SQL code is not 'democratised', as it were. I'm a Data Reliability Engineer, and I spend a lot of time helping engineers in product teams with the T-SQL and database aspects of their systems because - as you imply - the pool of application developers who are adept at working closely with databases is quite small (it's a niche area, and many developers are quite avoidant when it comes to working with complicated SQL).\n\nBut the main reason - I think - for an eagerness to avoid stored procedures is that they're simply out of fashion, and the software development industry is very fashion-driven.\n\nI'm not saying that's the case here, but I do think that - more often than not - it really does boil down to them being unsexy and unfashionable.",

So when data is changed it's easy to track who did it and when, as well as easy to revert.\n\n4) Destroying items in the database doesn't really delete (usually).

With migrations and cqrs it basically means x3.🤣 Most of the time tho, dev access was nowhere near any critical table, and most of the restrictions come out of least privilege access principles.\n\nAs soon as we created a read only slave and a read only user for web crawlers, it was inevitable.

Even when you cannot wait for a full feature, forcing the query to live as a reviewed artifact tends to change behavior in a good way.

In theory, high enough fanout of read traffic could also cause production issues, but we didn’t have a lot of work of that sort. I took over both projects that could trigger these problems, I didn’t go out of my way to advertise that the whole CD pipeline could be run from a dev machine using a service account I had Ops set up for it.\n\nWhen I took over the project, it was causing alerts and open circuit breakers in production if you ran it at during peak traffic, or while someone else was running a batch process. By the time I was done the warnings page said, “check if there’s an active incident happening and don’t run it” which really could be used to describe any CD task. \n\nI broke a few eggs in the process, but I only worked on it when I was in the on call rotation so I could own or dismiss any alerts that fired. And I made one of them run >3x faster and the other 20x faster while also making them behave. \n\nI’m also of the minority opinion that every process run by CD should also be able to be run by individuals in case your build servers are down, which did happen once there. They should have a run book, only be run by a pair of very senior developers, and only with a quorum of engineers assenting to the operation. Which is to say you should be able to fake every step of CD in a war room if everything has gone to hell in a hand basket. War Rooms, in any mature org, are the confluence of two errors working together to take out production. In a very mature org, that can grow to three. And one of those three can be Atlassian or GitHub shitting the bed. \n\nAs a side benefit, that sort of process transparency makes it easier for new engineers to suggest improvements to the process. Which can be opaque especially in Bamboo, which loves Information Hiding, which is an unconscionable behavior in CI/CD. Bamboo is the devil.\n\nEdit to add: one of the very first things I did with the batch processing is change the user agent so people could figure out that an own goal was going on and who to ping about it. Previously it looked like one of our production services due to using the same service discovery library and that’s a no-no.",

      "text": "So fifteen to rwenty years ago some engineers provisioned some servers and then were allowed to retire without passing on administration roles or knowledge.  By the time we got management on the \"succession planning is important\" page the horses had already left the barn.\n\nOne of the servers hosts SVN source control used by all our projects as well as the license server for some embedded compilers we use, and the other runs a web app used nationwide.  Government work, I'm being vague not because it's secret but just to keep things at a non-details level.\n\nIn government work, teams do not own our own IT and maintaining it is a pure cost for the internal team or external company contracted to do that, and the benefit of what is running on it is not known or a fuck given by the ones hosting.  This year, that IT org was like, \"your servers are on a really old version of windows; we're gonna turn em off.  k thx bye.\"\n\nWe had to beg for extensions.  Ironically I had been trying to find out where those servers were physically located and who pays their electric bill for several years, but somehow my attempts to find someone who could tell me that never connected with the attempts of the people where the servers lived to find out who depends on what's on them.\n\nTo me, from the moment I understood the situation this was slowly escalating from concerning to this is an emergency, but like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Many other engineers I work with are either not programmers or embedded programmers who came up pre-internet or at least pre-Github, and not in the web tech or servers world.\n\nAnyway on the plus side I haven't gotten push back against moving the repos to Git (our agency has an internal hosted git provider), but on the other hand I have gotten a strange lack of reaction at all.  I have at least gotten management carte blanche now to spend my own time on making this migration happen, but I have asked for management support in getting affected engineers to devote some time to telling me how they want their projects to come through, and I never get a response.\n\nThe reason I need their responses is engineers were using the full flexibility of SVN both to create complex branching relationships and also misusing it out of ignorance, and one project in particular where every time they did a site they checked in another copy of the entire trunk and build folders (and trunk itself is GBs) produces a repo that really needs to be carved up.  Basically they were (are) using SVN like a cross between a monorepo and a share drive.\n\nI and a colleague are over here busting ass to make a nearly-technically-impossible transition happen smoothly but when we find something we can't \"magic\" our way out of if we ask, \"do you want the repo in Git to end up like option A or like option, because we can't bring it through unchanged?\" none of the affected individuals bothers to respond.  Even when I send emails with high importance and all caps, \"ATTN: either you will lose records of 20 years of work if this migration goes wrong or at the very least if you do not respond I will have to pick for you and if you don't like what I picked it won't be changeable later\" - no one responds/cares/expresses an opinion.\n\nThis is strange right?

That said, the increased scope and expectations are well known internally.\n\nI think my main question is: is it normal to be expected to outperform peers and **first** demonstrate \"visible impact\" before moving to the next level, even when your day-to-day responsibilities already go beyond what other L4 engineers are doing?",

To be comfortable at CurrentLevel+1 you are expected to be able meet your CurrentLevel responsibilities without having it take up all your time. So if you're able to do CurrentLevel + 80% of CurrentLevel+1 for a year or so, you should have a good case for promo into CurrentLevel+1. \n\nThat being said, your manager should know when particularly time consuming responsibilities (eg crunch or oncall for CurrentLevel, or a bunch of allday meetings for CurrentLevel+1) get in the way for short periods of time. And if it's been 2-3 years of this as you say, either your manager's expectations of what you need to show don't align with reality, or they are stringing you along.

      "text": "Long story short, I'm a dev at a FAANG level company with 4.5YoE. Every \"feature\" is basically the same. I build some sort of CRUD API, build out some frontend based on our designers figma mock ups using our internal UI libraries, figure out how to structure the schema to support the new data structure, do business logic with the data that got submitted, display the said data in an existing table, new table, whatever, rinse and repeat.\n\nI've been getting an itch that I'm not learning all too much so I want to start reading some books or take some external courses. It also doesn't help that I'm a self taught developer (Math major) so while I'm extremely happy that I'm kicking it in the \"big leagues\", I want to start challenging myself once again because it genuinely feels like everything I'm doing on a day to day basis are things that I taught myself via some random \"Full stack\" udemy course from 2020.\n\nSo with that said I wanted to ask you all the same question I've been wondering. What books or courses helped you on your journey to become a better developer? For what it's worth, I have the Udemy/Coursera subscriptions as well.\n\nMy initial thought was to read \"designing data-intensive applications\" but I heard that it's a thick book and a new volume is coming out because some info is dated. My next idea was to do Andrew Ngs machine leaning course and while I'd love to start learning some math and going into that rabbit hole, it really feels like a waste since I'll never get a job in that space and I'll never really use those skills again. Then finally, I landed on a course where I'll learn about Dev Ops (Docker, Kubernetes, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, etc) because that actually seems relevant if I were to ever do my own startup and dev ops is an area where I'm not knowledgeable (but tbh I'm not excited to learn about dev ops).\n\nAnyone want to share what books or courses that they genuinely found interesting apart from \"How to create a CRUD app\"?",

The value isn’t specific tech, it’s how it changes how you think about systems, tradeoffs, and failure modes. You don’t need to read it cover to cover either. Skimming chapters that map to things you actually touch can already sharpen your instincts.\n\nOne thing that helped me more than random courses was deliberately studying things adjacent to my job but not required by it. System design, distributed systems concepts, scalability tradeoffs, and even reading good postmortems. Those connect directly to senior level thinking without forcing you into a totally different domain like ML if you’re not going to use it.\n\nIf you ever want to stress test your understanding, practicing system design interviews is oddly effective even if you’re not actively interviewing. It forces you to reason end to end instead of living inside one service. I’ve used StealthCoder for that to keep structure when walking through designs, and it helped surface gaps I didn’t notice in day to day work.\n\nI’d avoid chasing courses just to feel productive.

I even got badges like \"Daily Heavy User\" and \"Top 10% Performer.\" The most cringe part is the text at the top: *\"There is no room for complacency.\"* Like, wtf?\n\nI've been a dev for a long time and this is the first time I'm being measured by *how* I use a tool instead of the actual value or quality of my code. They even have a \"Daily Use\" percentage (97% for me) based on my working days. Does anyone else feel like this is a massive red flag? It feels like they're prepping to replace us or at least treat us like prompt-monkeys. Is this happening in other big tech companies too or is MELI just going full dystopia mode?\n\nSorry for te rant, just had to share this bc it feels wrong on so many levels.\n\nThis here the image:   \n[https://ibb.co/MkyWcBRp](https://ibb.co/MkyWcBRp)  \n  \n",

Whatever is at the top of the queue takes priority in the moment and that's what is worked on\n\nAt first, this actually worked very very well for me. I was able to thrive because the most important thing was always clear to me. Until I went up a few engineering levels and then it wasn't. Because no other team was driven by a queue\n\nThis made things hard, it made things stressful... Hell, I even nearly left because of how inflexible I always felt\n\nBut point being, in the beginning, we were small. We had one product. Other teams drove our product, and as a result, drove the tooling we used\n\nSo we had capacity to only focus on the queue, knock items that existed in the queue out, and move on to the next thing. Easy.\n\nThen we were bigger. Now we have multiple products. Other teams began working on those. We were left to support existing and proven product. We were asked to take on tooling, escalations, etc that other teams had been working on. We did not have capacity. All we knew was the queue. To some people, the queue was the most important thing. To other people, speeding up our team through better tooling was the important thing. And to others, grand standing was the most important thing\n\nSenior engineers hated this. Senior engineers switched teams. Team was left with inexperienced engineers. Quality of product produced by team has significantly depreciated\n\nMe not at company anymore. Me at different company\n\nMe not know why start talking like this. Me weird sometimes, but me happy that my work isn't driven by a queue that's all important meanwhile having other priorities that me told are equally important by stupid management cross teams\n\nThank you",

              "text": "Strong disagree. I’ve worked on teams that do this and also a team with much less process (no kanban, no jira, just PRs and project level syncs). Velocity was far far higher (for me personally probs 2-3x) on the low process team than the 3 other high process teams I worked on. And it wasn’t due to team size or company size, the low process team was the biggest team I’ve been on (8 engineers). \n\nThe reason is that I spent hours every day on process before, be it daily standup, point estimation, jira wrangling, triage meetings, prioritization meetings etc.. it often took more time deciding to work on something small than just doing it. \n\nMy last team (the low process team) eliminated most of that. We had our main projects, which were loosely determined by PMs and then given to us, a weekly standup, a weekly project sync and that was more or less that. When it came time to work on a project, we’d scope it out and design it within a small group and then just go. \n\nI can’t tell you how liberating it is to start coding days after starting the project instead of being bogged down on scope and design meetings for weeks. Occasionally our process meant we’d have to redo some work if our design was flawed, and for more complex projects we’d jump into prototypes in the beginning, but its still vastly faster than trying to perfect everything at the beginning. And all the pointless bike shedding is gone. \n\nThe best part of this is that I had all this time cleared out and we had the autonomy to just do things when we wanted to. Have some tech debt you want to clean up? Just spend a few hours, get a review and get it merged. The burden is unfathomably lower when you don’t have to justify it, track it, estimate it, triage it, and schedule it. \n\nLike I’m telling you we had the cleanest code base I’d ever seen. We had helper tools for days because people cared to do it and we had the autonomy to make it happen. Some of my most impactful changes happened on a whim when I’d be debugging something and decided to spend a few hours adding some diagnostics or whatever. \n\nI had this one project that I suspected would save us a good bit of money, but turned out we have no good way to get an accurate picture of team infrastructure cost. No worries, napkin math was enough, but I snooped further and saw we had all the raw cost event tables covering our team’s infrastructure in our data warehouse. So on a whim I spent a couple of days creating some team specific tables to make cost easier to calculate and a nice dashboard with various aggregations and charts.\n\nWell lo and behold I get a slack a few weeks later from higher up asking why we had a cost spike with X service. Turns out someone had shared the dashboard and they added it to their cost review resources. \n\nI didnt tell anyone I was making this, I just presented it to the team when it was done (then I think one of our PMs spread it around). At my old companies I doubt this would’ve been prioritized over project work, and we’d spend time discussing the rights aggregations and charts and what tables to make and blah blah blah and it would never happen.\n\nAnyways, sorry for my rant. I’m sure this won’t work on every team but it’s been such a breath of fresh air to “just do things” and I really don’t want to go back.",

What we do is create tasks when technical (invisible) work is needed and use it to make it visible for other stakeholders (product manager). It does not equate to having a heavyweight process around that, and honestly, it helps a lot: every dev is assigned a task, everyone can see what's being worked on, etc. And the best part is that rarely anyone outside of the dev team argues that those tasks are not needed.\n\nBefore, we had a horrible way of trying to squeeze that technical work into existing feature tickets, and it was painful because it did not give a real picture of what's happening. Now we can have a refactoring task that must be done before a feature can be delivered, and everyone is OK with that.",

Like, some literal examples I've used internally are jira tickets with titles like \"Make (Redacted Feature Name) More Usable\" and \"Build Integration With (Redacted Third Party Service)\", and no body.  The kanban process worked for us because we just adapted to it and when the ticket is that vague the developer's action item is to get on a zoom call with the product manager and babysit them through writing some actual tickets (then put those in the backlog for somebody to work on).  It wasn't perfect, because obviously developers would prefer not to do that, but over time some of the product managers learned how to just write reasonable requirements in the first place (and then regressed when upper management forced a different process across the whole company).  \n\nSAFe's a terrible fit for that because it assumes you've already got that \"Twitter, but for Dogs\" feature broken down into actionable/estimable tickets before the quarter starts, when in actuality you're forced to figure that shit out on the fly.",

That is to say, it's better to keep focused dev work going and people on task than it is to give KTLO people a break. In the long run it makes little difference and we found longer rotations were better for continuity, on both sides. We even got it to a point where it fell outside of our product capacity. We hired so product had at least the capacity we saw and then hired more to make sure we had this capacity as well. Yes, it got to a point where everything not on their radar fell into KTLO but we similarly planned and projected and hired accordingly. At times it was bad and we didn't have capacity and it kept being underfunded, but right now we're at a health size for this to work.\n\nMy two cents is that you have to plan for it. There will always be unexpected things that come up and the worst you can do is try to scramble to figure it out.

The worst thing you can do is be afraid to clarify so that you do understand, and then become a problem for everyone else when it's clear you don't. In my role, that's my biggest pet peeve. It seems like folks often don't ask questions because it might make them look stupid or whatever. I don't give a shit about having to explain things multiple times in multiple ways. I actually view that as at least partially my fault for not communicating things effectively. The worst thing folks do in that situation is not speak up, because then when the misunderstanding becomes obvious, and it always does, it is at a time when it costs more time and patience to resolve than if they'd just asked repeatedly until they understood it. \n\nNow, there's always the chance that you just don't understand because of some shortcoming on your part. Again, this is something you'd be best figuring out sooner rather than later.

If I didn’t get it the first or second or third time, the problem is usually that I’ve made a bad assumption, or there’s a logical leap or conclusion that I didn’t follow, and going through step by step - basically debugging the design or conclusion - is the way to figure out where the disconnect happened.\n\nBecoming the go-to person for something is a lagging signal of expertise and social proof. For building the expertise, there’s no substitute for curiosity. For instance, in our system, any time someone describes something the system does - like in on-call review or as part of an incident response - if I didn’t already know it, I dig into the code until I can trace for myself exactly how that works. Any time I hear about a feature that we want to write, I do a mini design myself to see where it aligns with our system and where it’s mismatched, and then I think of good ways to resolve the mismatch. Whenever I answer a question on Slack, I don’t just answer the question, I also try to think about the context of the question and understand that - why did this person ask this question? How did they end up coming to ME with it? Etc. and if appropriate I offer feedback on that. Do this enough, and you’ll become an expert naturally.\n\nThen the social proof - when discussions are happening, offer your knowledge. And the critical thinking you’re doing will lead you to develop opinions - offer them, too. Eventually people will remember that you helped them out or clarified something for them, and they’ll start going to you directly. And when they start recommending you to their peers, then you’re literally the go-to person.",

I'm talking about actual networking, like traffic flows, protocols, etc. \n\nFor reference I pursued my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering so I technically don't have the most traditional CS background and I have about 7+ years in the industry now focused on devops/SRE roles. I'm fine when it comes to writing code, best practices, observability, operations, IAC, troubleshooting, etc. I've designed and developed many microservices in my career since that's a big chunk of what I do but I barely know what DHCP is, or the fact that everything is \"dns\". \n\nI know how to make requests to api's and could maybe tell you it uses the tcp protocol, but I don't actually know what that protocol entails or how it works under the hood. I ssh into remote machines all the time, but I can't tell you what exactly is happening. Something about a tunnel being formed? Or tls? I just know that it's more secure, but I don't truly know how or why. Something something certificates. \n\nI just feel that in my career thus far, I've never had the reason, or opportunity to NEED to dive deeper into how networking actually works because many issues I've had to troubleshoot end up being at a much higher level.\n\nI recently had a recruiter reach out about a role and naturally I decided to give the interview a shot and the first technical screen came with alot of rapid fire questions about networking topics. I honestly couldn't answer a majority of them and it was quite embarrassing given I'm at least a mid-level engineer. \n\nso I was wondering if anyone had any resources for getting a better grasp on all of this? Because I'm sure if anything it will just be nice to read on something in my down time.\n\nEdit: thank you all for providing some great pointers for expanding my networking knowledge. I just want to point out again that I'm in devops/SRE and though I've been lucky to not have to dive deep into more networking topics, I'm sure one day I will so learning about the OSI layer at the very least seems valuable in the long run.

I don't have any good resources handy, as that was back before the web really had many of these things. What I will say is focus particularly on the \"layers\" concept when you do stumble upon the documentation. It all starts with the ethernet layer (MAC addresses and wires), then goes to the IP layer (connecting to physical machines) and then TCP/UDP on top of that (one has reliable delivery, the other does not (a gross oversimplification)), and then application-specific protocols build on top of that (HTTP). \n\nIt is one of the concepts that has served me well in ways you might not expect. Networking is more about streams of data, and that can be useful knowledge in other areas than just networking, for example writing binary file formats. They both have the same problem: serializing and deserializing data. Just think of it as sending nothing but a series of bits. It could be written to a socket, or it could be written to a file. but it's a stream nonetheless.\n\nThings like DNS try to make all this easier. Instead of memorizing IP addresses, it's like a phone book, where you can look people up by name. Everything like DNS builds on the fundamentals I laid out above.\n\nThis is why the \"layers\" concept is so important to get started here.",

You can learn a lot just by monitoring your network traffic while some services (like dhcp) are running, and investigating the packets you see with wireshark or tcpdump. Some of the RFCs are pretty short.\n\nLinux has and usually comes with all sorts of tools for dealing with networking stuff from the command line. rarp/arp, netstat, route, ufw and iptables, traceroute, tcpdump. You can combine those with grep, less, etc to analyze network activity.\n\nIf you want to try configuring some Cisco routers, we used a program in one of my classes called Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate networks and devices.\n\nIt's hard to know how far you are. Do you know the tcp 3-way handshake? Can you read and write a routing table? Do you understand the differences between TCP and UDP?  Can you read and write CIDR notation subnets? Do you know ARP and RARP and how they relate to MAC addresses? Can you successfully make SSH tunnels? Configure routing protocols? Configure a firewall? Create VLANs? Set up a DHCP server? Set up a cisco router? Know how to use wireshark? Coming from a sysadmin background, that might all be basic to intermediate stuff for some people. Or not.",

The truth is that most of us learn what we need to solve the problems in front of us, and if your day-to-day hasn't required deep protocol knowledge, there's no reason you would have developed that expertise. That interviewer hit you with questions that weren't relevant to your experience, and that says more about their interview process than your competence as a mid-level engineer. The good news is that networking fundamentals are totally learnable - start with \"Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach\" by Kurose and Ross if you want the textbook route, or check out Practical Networking's YouTube channel for more digestible content that connects theory to real-world scenarios you actually encounter.\n\nThe real lesson here is that you need to be ready for interviewers who ask these curveball questions that don't match your background or the role itself. Some companies just have lazy interview processes that throw everything at candidates without thinking about what's actually relevant. For getting better at handling these situations and knowing how to navigate tricky technical questions you're not prepared for, I've found [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to be really helpful - full disclosure, I'm on the team that built it, but we specifically designed it to handle unexpected interview scenarios and provide real-time support when you're facing questions outside your comfort zone.",

Anyway ...\n\nWhat would anti-AI mean exactly and why would doing it mean you get huge upside because everyone ends up crashing and burning ? Why would everyone else crash and burn in the first place ? It's not black and white, 0 and 1. It's not don't use AI at all or go balls deep. There are various degrees of AI integration into your processes and products and not everyone is doing the same thing. There are checks and balances - internal QA, customer feedback, market share changes, ... - that will tell companies to reconsider way before they have a chance to crash (at least the sane ones, not the 3 MBAs in a trench coat ones - but those were doomed to fail anyway).\n\nCase in point.\n\nI work for a decently sized multinational. Software is an essential part of the service we provide to our customers. Due to the specifics of the industry we have to deal with sensitive data, and have quite strict SLAs. We cannot just go crazy and vibe code shit because it's the new hot thing. At the same time the data isn't super sensitive to the point we couldn't use AI due to strict security policies, and the management would very much like to see if the output of programmers could be improved through magic. So we move ahead, evaluate models, compare pricing between providers, decide which ones to keep and which ones to cut, etc. We encourage people to run internal experiments, share the results. We integrate external models where it makes sense. We track spending and reevaluate.\n\nI suspect the reality is that a large portion of the landscape does the same. We're the boring ones you don't read about anywhere because there's nothing controversial or particularly smart in that. Just boring business as usual - try new stuff, see if the ROI is good, keep or throw away, repeat.",

      "text": "I like Junior devs. Most of them are a passionate bunch with the spark still in their eyes. I want to help them chase their passion, and be better as Software Engineers. However, patience and energy to deal with people aren't exactly my strong suites.\n\nSo, here I am. Spill the team devs! What worked for you when training junior devs?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks all for the advices! For future reference, I have summarized the discussion here;​\n\n**Work Assignment & Hands-On Approach:**\n\n* Give junior devs appropriately scoped work that's challenging enough to be interesting but not so hard they get frustrated\n* Treat juniors like any other engineer—give them tasks and let them work; provide rough guidance if they flounder\n* Have them fix bugs as a way to contribute early on\n* Let them drive on tasks while you observe, ask questions, and provide feedback\n\n**Teaching Problem-Solving:**\n\n* Don't just answer their questions; walk them through solving problems themselves\n* Ask them \"Why did you choose that option?\" to understand their thought process\n* Use the \"give a man a fish\" vs \"teach a man to fish\" approach—focus on teaching the process, not just solutions\n* Use pair programming with juniors driving while you watch and resist the urge to grab the keyboard\n* Use Test-Driven Development (TDD): write test cases together, have them make tests pass, then have them write tests for you to make pass\n\n**Pair Programming & Mentoring:**\n\n* Implement a gradual pair programming progression: you drive with commentary → they drive with your commentary → they drive with their own commentary → they work independently\n* Pair program on tasks where they struggle to move forward\n* This approach can significantly accelerate their productivity (potentially reaching SE0.5-1 level in days for good candidates)\n\n**Code Reviews & Feedback:**\n\n* Explain the \"why\" behind code review feedback, not just what to fix\n* Use specific examples: \"this works but it'll bite you when X happens\" sticks better than \"change this\"\n\n**Managing Shy/Quiet Juniors:**\n\n* Build connection through non-work-related conversations and team building\n* Normalize asking \"stupid\" questions by sharing your own past mistakes\n* Set up regular one-on-ones to discuss what they're working on in an informal setting\n* Make it clear you want them to ask more questions than they think they should\n* Emphasize that asking for help benefits you too—it gives you a break from your own work\n\n**Building Confidence & Reducing Fear:**\n\n* Encourage them genuinely without being judgmental\n* Stress that asking for help is valued; spending 10 minutes helping is better than them spending 8 hours stuck\n* When they say \"this is probably a stupid question,\" normalize it and connect it to something you've done\n* Think of juniors as \"big toddlers\" who don't know anything yet—this helps with patience and empathy\n* Remember you were also an idiot once—this helps build patience\n\n**Self-Learning & Independence:**\n\n* Teach them how to use search bars (wiki, Google, Reddit) to find answers themselves\n* Have them contribute to documentation with their own notes\n* The goal is to minimize the time they need from you for things they can figure out themselves\n* Be patient when there's intent but not understanding; less so when there's neither\n* Distinguish between being a \"teacher\" and a \"mentor\"\n\n**Domain Knowledge & Onboarding:**\n\n* Give proper training in domain knowledge—this is underrated\n* Use onboarding tasks as teaching opportunities (ensure feedback is constructive, not judgmental)\n* Have them fix and review code during the onboarding phase\n* Set expectations early through one-on-ones\n* Embrace that they bring fresh perspectives and see opportunities for improvement\n\n**Managing Difficult Situations:**\n\n* Handle juniors who get frustrated; help them understand that imperfection is normal in software development\n* Don't micromanage—let them figure things out; they might come up with something better than your idea\n* Be clear that as a senior, you have final authority on decisions, even if they disagree with the approach\n* Work on your own patience and energy to deal with people if you want to effectively mentor\n\n**Key Mindset:**\n\n* Good juniors don't require much handholding—focus on the talented ones\n* Different people have different learning processes; customize your approach\n* If they have aptitude, you'll gradually hear from them less often or get tougher/more complex questions over time\n* Not everyone can be mentored equally; some have more potential than others",

It was all fine, took ages but the result was good.  However going through it (after tons of initial changes including a near 1 hr argument over letting users upload all images types and not lock it to only pngs as the junior wanted) they finally insisted that we ONLY use it in two places and have all the other image uploaders the old style.  I kept saying no, we are doing this to eliminate all of them to take the burden off users needing the pixel perfect image size in order to upload anything.  And the entire thing was my idea to begin with.  But I was told I was wrong and it was only ever meant to be in a few places and the junior refused to do the rest.  That is just one example.\n\nI am getting sick of no, you MUST use X framework, or no, you MUST do it my way for some reason I can't explain, it's just the way.",

Finally you let them loose and make sure they know to talk to you if they have any questions.  The better the intern the more steps you can skip.\n\n\nThe first time I pulled this off the team was shocked at how fast the the intern was self sufficient at something like a SE0.5~1 level.  Most recently the team bought into it and took about a week to get to ~SE1 performance, although that particular one was almost definitely a luck of the draw kind of situation.\n\n\nComing back to juniors, I don't think I would try the intern thing with a junior unless they were either fresh out of college or otherwise having significant problems.  But it might work adapting some of the later stages.  For an intern I want them working on relatively easy problems with known solutions.  But if you want to help a junior level up, maybe give them a problem that's definitely beyond them but normalish for you.  The pair with them where they're driving and you offer commentary whenever they look like they're starting to spin.",

      "text": "Hey Devs,\n\nRecently, I've run a detailed performance tests on my blog, comparing MySQL with Postgres and it basically turns out that Postgres is supperior in almost all scenarios: for the 17 executed test cases in total, Postgres won in 14 and there was 1 draw. Using QPS (queries per second) to measure throughput (the higher the better), mean & 99th percentile for latency (the lower the better), here is a high-level summary of the results:\n\n1. **Inserts**\n   * 1.05 - 4.87x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 3.51 - 11.23x by mean and 4.21 - 10.66x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `21 338 QPS with 4.009 ms at the 99th percentile` for single-row inserts, compared to *4 383 QPS & 42.729 ms* for MySQL; for batch inserts of `100 rows`, it achieves `3535 QPS with 34.779 ms at the 99th percentile`, compared to *1883 QPS & 146.497 ms* for MySQL\n2. **Selects**\n   * 1.04 - 1.67x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 1.67 - 2x by mean and 1.25 - 4.51x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `55 200 QPS with 5.446 ms at the 99th percentile` for single-row selects by id, compared to *33 469 QPS & 12.721 ms* for MySQL; for sorted selects of multiple rows, it achieves `4745 QPS with 9.146 ms at the 99th percentile`, compared to *4559 QPS & 41.294 ms* for MySQL\n3. **Updates**\n   * 4.2 - 4.82x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 6.01 - 10.6x by mean and 7.54 - 8.46x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `18 046 QPS with 4.704 ms at the 99th percentile` for updates by id of multiple columns, compared to *3747 QPS & 39.774 ms* for MySQL\n4. **Deletes**\n   * 3.27 - 4.65x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 10.24x - 10.98x by mean and 9.23x - 10.09x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `18 285 QPS with 4.661 ms at the 99th percentile` for deletes by id, compared to *5596 QPS & 43.039 ms* for MySQL\n5. **Inserts, Updates, Deletes and Selects mixed**\n   * 3.72x higher throughput\n   * latency lower 9.34x by mean and 8.77x by 99th percentile\n   * Postgres delivers `23 441 QPS with 4.634 ms at the 99th percentile` for this mixed in 1:1 writes:reads proportion workload, compared to *6300 QPS & 40.635 ms* for MySQL\n\n  \nThere were only two join cases, where MySQL was slightly better; but nothing compared to the differences cited above.\n\nGiven this gap, when do you use MySQL instead of Postgres and why? Does it have additional features and/or advantages that Postgres does not provide? Or, are there other scenarios that I am not aware of, where it does deliver better performance? Something else entirely?",

The questions I’m about to ask are less about the actual answers and more so to shine light on the question of when to use MySQL over Postgres and the different considerations that are taken into account when enterprises are making decisions like this.\n\nWhat was the size of the dataset compared to cache size? How many cores did a given node have? Clustered/Cluster topology? Query shapes or just CRUDs? Insertion order of records/access patterns? Record size? Cache hit/miss ratios? CPU/memory/disk utilization? IOPs? $/cpu-util? \n\nAn e-commerce company is going to have much different access patterns, query shapes, etc than a household banking company. Databases will perform differently under these different circumstances. \n\nOther considerations to cover include configuration tuning questions, OS tuning, and a variety of other metrics and composite metrics that are taken into consideration when analyzing database performance.\n\nIt has been a long time since I’ve done analysis on MySQL, but I’ve seen investigations that concluded that MySQL has nearly 99% vertical scalability in TPC-C. That alone could be a selling point for large enterprises if Postgres cannot hit that metric.",

First job out of college, good environment to learn and grow, good coworkers, great WLB, well-known company (not a big household name but people know it when i mention it).\n\nBut in the last 2 years, things have slowly gone downhill. Theres 2 things,\n\n1. The compensation is not competitive. I'm pretty underpaid relative to my peers in the same location. However, I'm okay with this given that I'm fully remote and the WLB is extremely good (most days I'm done with my tasks for the day after 5-6 hours).\n\n2. Huge shift to building AI products. This one has made me hate my job. \n\nThere's a huge push to integrate LLMs into everything. Everyone I know, aside from the infra teams, is working on an LLM-related project. I've been working on building an AI product for the last year and it has made me miserable. I hate that I spend hours a day tweaking a prompt for something that is non deterministic, and will still deviate from the prompt, no matter how many adjustments I make. \n\nI hate that product has crazy expectations of how LLMs work, and are not satisfied that it can't do things perfectly,\n\nI used to do Full Stack stuff, but now it's mostly backend because there isnt much frontend to do since everything is a chat interface. Product seems to not want to create designs for anything. Instead of creating nice flows, we just throw in a chat interface now and let the user interact with an LLM to do things.\n\nThe products we're building aren't great either. Sometimes I feel insane because I personally do not want to talk to LLMs when I'm using products, and so I hate the things I'm building, but product seems to think this is what people want.\n\nAnd i hate that, since I'm building chatbots, I have to talk to them to test them. I'm going crazy talking to AI all day. \n\nI miss building actual products and thinking through designs, instead of constantly talking about what models we should upgrade to and what lines of the prompt need to be tweaked.\n\nI've asked for a team transfer but seems like most teams are doing LLM projects.\n\nI'm also worried about layoffs. If everything is a chatbot, what are all the designers and front-end engineers doing?",

Engineers also understood that it takes way more than 8 hours a day initially to achieve excellence.\n\nIt's after several years that engineers used to say, \"okay, I've read a ton of books, studied and learned new technologies, built many side projects just to experiment and learn, and made a serious impact at work. I'm older now and have put in the work, so I can bring significant value to any team/company by working 9-5 and prioritizing life outside of work.\"\n\nThe people these days complain about preparing for interviews, doing take home problems, doing personal studies after hours, and being in situations at work where they have to go above and beyond to fit into a high performing team/company.\n\nThe field is competitive and there are very smart, talented, and hard working people. It's truly a privilege to be part of a world class team, and it takes more than just doing your job. The same is true for sports, law, other engineering fields, etc.\n\nIn my opinion many new software engineers have a warped perception of what it takes to be successful. Things like \"a day in the life\" where they do very little except enjoying perks, get paid a ton, and think that's normal are out of touch with reality. And those days are over.\n\nSo a young person who is new in the field who talks about finishing \"tasks\" in 5-6 hours, and having a good WLB is not a positive to me. Someone saying, \"I spent 20 hours this weekend building a side project in a brand new technology and it was awesome\", is someone I want to work with. That's how I was and the other people in my team as well.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

Sure the code was run, but that doesn't mean anything meaningful was tested. Use mutation testing (stryker.js or similar) for a reality check. Our early test suites were showing about 85% on traditional coverage metrics but about 12% mutation numbers.\n2. Integration tests are \"easy\" because you can stick a wrapper on your infra and just test your UI/API directly for simple behaviors. Actually that's not a bad place to start if you have no tests at all because at least you can quickly test critical paths and throw mission-critical breaks.\n3. First problem is that you get a false sense of confidence \"well CI passed so it must be okay\" when your coverage wasn't really meaningful. Sometimes these integration tests are worse than having no coverage.\n4. Longer-term issue is that you get none of the benefits of TDD: improved encapsulation and predictability of behavior under change. Integration tests bypass both of these. This has required a long-term strangler-fig to overcome and still isn't done.\n5. As you found, running your whole application through each test means the tests run only at application speed, and every micro-behavior you want to test ends up bringing tons of baggage.\n6. To ensure the behaviors you actually care about, you actually end up with far more permutations than if you got unit tests right.\n\nIt sounds like you just have a horribly entangled, tightly coupled app and the leads know that proper testing would require massive refactoring due to undocumented side effects etc.\n\nThe reason they are resistant to unit tests are the exact reasons they would benefit from it.",

The first is good at telling you where the bug are, the second is good at telling you you have them. If all you have is screening you're gonna go insane from the noise. If all you have is the diagnostics you won't find a lot of bugs.

That's means running tests. Generally speaking you should not be introducing bugs with new features.\n\nBug free code doesn't really exists and nobody is looking for that.

You should not be running tests, see a failure, and say run it again because you know it will eventually pass.  If you care about testing then you should treat trusting code just like production code.\n\nEvery places I have worked at in my 15 YOE testing code was held to the same coding standard as production code.  In fact code reviews required all testing to code changes to be part of the review in addition to a result file showing they all tests pass. It was expected for code reviewers to point out missed test cases and block approval until it is updated and shown to pass.\n\n\n\n>very high expense cost, we need 50 VMs to run our 4k+ integration tests that take 2-3 hours to finish (all the tests are distributed evenly on 50 VMs and each runs it synchronously)\n\nUnless this is your company or you are some kind of small start up, money is not really an issue you should care about.   Yes, improve testing to be more reliable and faster, but if you have done that it this is how long it takes to run then it is what it is.\n\nOut side of individual SWEs running a subset of tests to check their code changes during normal development, you should have something like Jenkins running all of your tests every night against mainline or something like that.  It doesn't matter if not changes were made, just getting continuous runtime is a good thing.\n\nYou should be working to get to a point where testing is reliable and 100% passing every night.  Testing is both Unit and Integration.\n\n\n\n>I asked management to let us change our testing approach to include unit tests so we can rely less on integration tests. They disagreed and said the last thing they want is more tests to maintain and that integration tests are more reliable to catch bugs.\n\nI would disagree with you as well based on how you worded it.

You shouldn't want to get rid of this tests but supplement them with other integration and unit tests. End to End tests are great because often SWEs don't actually use the product as a product.  So things can be missed because you don't make the entire journey as a user.\n\nI don't know how your webapp is deigned, but I assume there is some back end API that the Frontend UI calls.  If so then you should be testing the backend separately from the UI.  The backend probably has requirements so tests to that.  \n\nYou use the API of the backend and send it a message and look for the reply that you get is what is expected. This also allows you to now send things like bad data to tests error situations that you probably cannot do easily within end to end tests.  You can do something similar with the UI testing where your tests are now the back end talking to the UI and sending it data.",

Integration tests are useful to catch more obvious bugs, although you can certainly test more exhaustively now and then. The trouble is many projects focus solely on testing as means to gain assurance and that's a very broken model. With unit tests you end up with a lot of indirection and very low actual assurance (due to coupling and due to the fact that some errors span unit boundaries, e.g. a DB query isn't wrong just in your application, it's wrong once you consider how the app and DB interact), as changes inevitably touch tests. With integration tests it takes a very long time and it costs a lot if you try to test everything all the time. The more rational solution is to use unit tests for pure units like algorithms or specific simple functions, integration tests to cover basic functionality, then you rely on other means to gain assurance like code reviews, static safety (type safety, memory-safe languages, abstraction etc.), manual testing and so on. Stop rubber-stamping PRs and relying on the CI exclusively to catch breakage. If you can't stop developers from merging and breaking things arbitrarily, you have bigger problems than a lack of tests.",

Maybe in one or two spots they actually \"locked in\" some logic, but that's about it.\n\nThe best part of the tests was the integration tests part. Big factor is that the whole thing was running in memory with no dependencies. We mocked the database layer (our usage was already abstracted), we also mocked the files system and external dependencies.\n\nThose tests took tops 100ms each, and could run in parallel, so on a dev machine you could easily enable continuous testing and run tests on each save.\n\nThey would catch 99% of the bugs we caught with tests. We had a nice way to for setup, a bit of abstraction for verification - that's where we would also test edge cases.\n\nThe system tests would spin a full VM in the cloud with the whole system installed, and then install our app in that system, trigger some functions and wait until it's done, then query the system to see if the process was executed correctly. That part was easily 20 minutes to an hour, depending on how much resources the VM got from a pool.\n\nI would urge you to go into this process - have tests that run as big part of your system as possible, but with no dependencies (or as few as possible, TestContainers for the win) and have most tests in that form.\n\nUse unit tests to verify some actual business logic (like applying discounts on an invoice or something like that)\n\nUse system test (running as close to prod conditions as possible) only for few scenarios happy path - this can be more if spinning up takes a long time, but tests are relatively short. We were running this part only in CI/CD\n\nBoth unit and integration tests should be runnable on dev machine, preferably on every save (at least dotnet tooling is smart enough to only run tests affected by whatever you changed between saves)",

Even though Shapiro made sure to scrub as much as possible any information on the internet about BitC, some writings are still available, like [this](https://danluu.com/bitc-retrospective/) retrospective.\n\nShapiro seems to be very much against the concept of subtyping and inheritance with the only exception of lifetime subtypes. Truth to be told today's rust neither has subtyping nor inheritance, except for lifetimes, preferring a constructive approach instead.\n\nI'm aware that in the univalent type theory in mathematics the relationship of subtyping across kindred types leads to paradoxes and hence is rejected, but I thought this was more relevant to axiomatic formulations of mathematics and not _real_ computer science. \n\nSo why is subtyping/inheritance bad in Shapiro's eyes?  Does it make automatic formal verification impossible, like in homotopy type theory? Can anyone tell me more about this? \n\nAny sources are more than welcome.\n\n**EDIT:** For future reference, [this](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00073205) provides a satisfactory overview of the problem.",

When we split these problems it gets very abstract.\n\n* As way to share an implementation, and to abstract over this shared implementation. This has nothing to do with types really, it just lets us define some common implementation detail that is shared, and then also work on this shared implementation without caring about the nominal semantics that separate the different uses. You can also think of this as finding ways to abstract implementation details into a domain that is easier to translate into others.\n* As a way to define polymorph over [bijections, surjections and injections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection). Here's where you realize why Liskov Substitution Principle is such an important thing when dealing with inheritance. You need to ensure that either given a injections `A->B` any operation on `B` will result in a value for which there's a `B->A` defined (even if it isn't defined for all possible `B` values, e.g. if we define that squares are a subtype of a rectangle, you can't have operations on rectangles that would convert a square into a rectangle secretly, because we have to recover the subtype). And this is where it gets messy, we want to use a non-bijective function as a bijection, and guaranteeing this is true for all valid operations is really hard.\n* As a way to extend multiple implementations centrally. This is kind of a unique mix of both, but with a pragmatic twist that isn't quite covered by either. Basically we want to be able to abstract over a subset of functionality and cover all it's core agreements in one place, while allowing extension of it at a later time. This is kind of the gap that interface default methods wants to cover in Java. Basically when we want to add functionality to all objects that implement some interface, we'd want some default behavior to satisfy, that then the classes can override if they so wish.\n\nBasically the two extension problems are defined as [The Expression Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem) where we want to two things. One is to add a new implementation of some super-type (add a new supertype) without having to recompile or change the super-type itself. Another is to add functionality to the super-type *without having to recompile the sub-type itself* which is the tricky part. And we'd want all of this to work on a level where we can be confident and use the type 'unboxed', that is that all polymorphism and (subtyping) can be taken away and you create optimal code as if it all had been hand-crafted.\n\nAnd yeah I agree with the author, we are getting interesting work done in this areas, but this isn't a \"solved\" problem with a clear answer(s), at least not as far as I know. As the problem gets better defined, and we understand more the challenges and gotchas we are able to find better simple solutions, but until now things will need some level of hackery or quirkiness on top.",

This can sometimes make sense but it’s a VERY strong coupling. You lose tons of flexibility.\n\nOften, composition is better. If B is used as attribute in A, you decide yourself which parts of B you use, so changing A has often no direct effect (unless you change logic, strictly speaking violating OCP which can be ok but be aware!).\n\nAlso each usage of B within A (against the interface) is very explicit. Some user C of A will never be able to use some B method without a change in A -> good.\n\nWith inheritance C can suddenly do things if B was changed if A wasn’t. This effect proliferates along the hierarchy.\n\nAll this is limited to public inheritance. Private/protected inheritances have different meanings and effects. And I left out performance/memory implications like vtables that are relevant only in C++ as well because, well, they are language-specific. Among them is also that languages like Java only allow inheriting from one class, so it’s anyways a one-line extension way (C++ allows more, and extending interfaces in Java also allow more, yes).\n\nBut yeah in short: Inheritance is VERY strong coupling, the strongest there is out there.

While I approach development from a composition-first approach, I take the things that fit this paradigm clearly and consider them for inheritance. If I find I have many such contracts bound by a mostly unchanging purpose with always shared behavior, it’s a strong contender for inheritance. These are also reasons you might start design out purely compositional until you know enough about the patterns to determine what is better suited for inheritance. We simply might not have enough information to understand what is contractual in this manner when we start out. If ever! As always, it depends! But certainly prefer composition over inheritance. Don’t over engineer with a crystal ball.\n\nEdit to add the other reason, sorry:\nAnother is poorly thought out composition. You can end up with deep composition chains. Or as you need to add functionality, you end up with them. That can suck. But I don’t think it’s a good counter-argument to use inheritance instead.. could just be you needed to go about the compositional solution a bit differently. However, if you KNOW there is a strong contract like I described earlier, it removes this problem from the equation.",

Only approved software allowed on workstations (probably typical in some organizations) but in this case the approval process takes months, including for security patches on already approved software. The duration of the approval process isn't an indication of rigor of the vetting in this case. Automated software is used that takes about 10 mins to run before the stamp of approval is given. The remaining time is due to having multiple people required to check a box and pass it along. Most of the time, the process is stuck with someone in the chain and it needs to be escalated to get it moving. There seems to be a disconnected between the need to control the environment and the ability to quickly react to new vulnerabilities with patched software.\n2. Vulnerability checks on internal software libraries set up in *some* internal software project repositories, but are either: a) never run, b) have builds that are permanently broken, c) only run on 'main', d) are used to merely internally *record* vulnerabilities with no priority to fix, upgrade, or replace the library. Although I think it's a good start to identify these things, it appears that in some cases, without follow up, this starts to look like busy work (e.g., l*ook how much time we spent on 'security processes'*) without actually doing something about it.\n3. Vulnerability checks run on 3rd party software only. However, no security testing done on company generated code, even when a company has a dedicated security team. This includes checks for misconfiguration. \n4. Individuals with 'security' in their role's title (not necessarily C-level) being perpetually absent or unavailable from any real life security discussion. This can be either before, during, or after a very specific security problem. Occasionally, these individuals will even have presentations on the company's security internally which rarely reflects reality.\n\nI'm interested to hear if any of this sounds familiar or if I've just had bad luck. I'm looking for both sides of this though, examples of good and bad in your opinion.",

You have to be SOC2 compliant because your customers' vendors have to be SOC2 compliant (because their customers' vendors have to be etc etc).  So, take the spreadsheet, check the box that says you complied.\n\nYou're going to have to slow down work sometimes to address \"critical\" security issues that are actually BS.  Just gotta live with that.  \n\nAnd honestly, I've seen several cases where a developer just didn't understand a legit security issue and tried to incorrectly argue that it was a false alarm.  There's some merit in just following the rule even if you don't know why the rule is in place and/or don't think it's applicable.  \n\nBut yeah, I think a green flag in an organization is if the person in charge of security seems to be actually trying to balance the impact it has on work, and is willing to take the time to try and explain why a measure is necessary.  The guy who just says \"shut up and check the box\", either because he doesn't understand the rule himself or because he doesn't want to take the time to explain, is a red flag.\n\nI think at the end of the day, a lot of actual security work is being done by people with really niche expertise that can't be scaled, so the only way to effectively make companies across the industry comply is to bring in box-checkers and try to provide them with a reasonable set of guidelines to enforce; so you're pretty much always going to have to deal with this problem.",

I can’t speak for the folks OP refers to or others in this thread but like you said in most cases we’re well intentioned. I don’t take pleasure in slowing folks down, and we’re human like everyone else\n\nWe’re also almost always one of the last people to know that $securityThing is needed. I show up to a meeting and it turns out they need $securityThing next week, but literally everyone else present knew about it for a year+. And now you get a solution thrown into production from procurement, to design, to review (also hastily done), no PoC, and now in production.. likely checking a box that customers care about. \n\nAnother challenge is hiring more experienced security folks. Guys worth their salt that truly understand developers pain cost as much as developers.. but they also don’t make you any money \n\nOn the topic of devs doing insecure stuff… unfortunately they don’t yell at the dev (not that anybody should be yelling).. they yell at me . Trust me, I’d love to leave you to your devices. I think beyond your typical vpn, endpoint monitoring, domain joining, and other network/cloud based tooling, we shouldn’t need to block devs much at the local level. But the dev goes and publishes a password for the umpteenth time, and now I’m getting yelled at for the umpteenth time. I tell them don’t do that, they roll their eyes because security is not in their job description and they’re not the ones whose livelihood is on the line if something happens. So now the annoying scanner is here and it takes longer to deploy. \n\nThe best orgs I’ve seen makes security everyone’s job. Having security champs embedded in dev and OPs teams to help make more secure services together as well as extending the function of security to catch these things early. Shifting left: get security involved early. If you’re adding new infra and other components involving permissions, networking, etc, get them in for a threat model review ASAP whether that’s the champs or the security team themselves. Get your management to buy in as well. Of course this is some pie in the sky stuff. Part of it is also just being in the “right” place. Where I’m at plenty of security are former devs. The scanner isn’t only for main, but for any branch. They provide hardened images for us to pull from for our OSes.  As long as it’s not explicitly black listed or pops the anti-virus, put whatever you want on your local machine… but in my experience in a lot of places, whatever bad things that can be done, will be done if you don’t try to restrict it. It’s all of a talent, management, and collaboration problem",

There are lots of optional specifications with various different interpretations that is ultimately driving developers to add more and more hacks into their implementations, and before you say \"never roll your own auth\", have you considered that the people behind your favorite auth libraries are also adding these hacks? Just because it's abstracted away doesn't mean there aren't hacks in the implementations.\n\nImplicit flow is one of my greatest pet peeves. Everyone says it's bad practice and inherently insecure to pass tokens in the browser URL, but if we were to force auth-code flow in ALL apps tomorrow, there is certainly going to be some major pushback. Furthermore, Some providers provide an `expires_in` and some just rely on the service to poll the token until they get an error before retrieving another token.\n\nThe lack of care given to validating tokens on the client side doesn't bother me as much, but it does concern me. Most will at the very least, check for expiration and issuer. Signing Keys is a hit or miss, some will check it, and some rely on the \"inherent security\" of the auth code flow or  [checks signature validity but not the signing certificate](https://docs.goauthentik.io/sys-mgmt/certificates/#certificate-considerations)\n\nDoes this bother anyone else?\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more widespread breaches just from the lackluster implementation of OAuth as a standard.",

Plus relational dbms are old and lame!\n2. I guess we need to model user profile data in our system too, we probably ought to make a second collection for that...\n3. Now that we have more users in our system, these lookups between our 20 collections are really slow. We keep running into weird concurrency issues and janky manual rollback code bugs since we have to manage our own transactions. Updates are really hard to write too since our data is now denormalized across so many different places, and migration and ETL scripts are a nightmare!\n4. It turns out that now that our app does something functional and interesting, all our data is actually highly relational and users want to query and update it all the time!

I (really learned) ~all of the Neetcode 150 and it was sufficient for all my interviews.

I'm one of those people that are happy when they can be out for a walk and thinking about a problem. You only get that when you actually give a shit about what you're working on. You'll hear the argument of \"they don't give a shit about you, so why should you give a shit about the work,\" and IMO if that's your argument, go be a plumber (pun, jabs intended). \n\nI work on stuff that is interesting to me, and I always try to find things that interest me. I can't see wanting to constantly looking for a job just so I could be judged by some asshole that spends their entire time googling or leaning on AI to solve their problems, but they work for a big company and have a cushy salary, so they must be smarter than me, right? I know what my talent is, and as long as I can put it to use, I'll happily avoid the 90% of judgmental asshats that work for these \"lucrative\" companies. \n\nThis whole leetcode culture never made any sense to me. We don't use it when interviewing. I actually don't really care to ask you to write code. I ask you point blank questions that I expect you to answer right there. I'm not even really looking to see if it's the right answer, I'm instead looking for honesty and passion. If you're the kind of person that is a natural problem solver and humble, you'll admit when you don't know something and it'll be clear how insignificant that is, because you'll figure it out. If I have to go through an experience like college, taking tests to get a job when I've been doing this for 20 years, I don't even want the fucking job. If you're not going to ask me about what I've worked on, which is the most important thing we should be talking about, because then you'll see my passion for my work, then I don't even want to work with you.\n\nSo, long story short, IMO those places that you're failing to join because you didn't pass some arbitrary test are not the kind of place I want to work.

So unless you aren’t finishing take a step back and confirm that speed is actually the issue.

A system design interview isn’t testing that you know that thing it’s testing that you know how to think about that problem. So for example if someone asked why you would use weighted random over round robin or least outstanding requests it’s useful to know a bit about why those algorithms actually work. But you can ask follow up questions to the interviewer to get more info about the edge case to help you determine how to solve for it. \n\nThe one that comes up the most for me personally is dfs and bfs searches. But that might be industry related or just how I solve problems. \n\nWhat I can say is I think that you are likely too focused on the exact right answer and not focused enough on proving you can effectively work with other people. I’ve failed plenty of people who can parrot the textbook to me because they can’t actually talk to me about the problem. I’m not hiring someone to lock in a closet I’m hiring someone to help out the junior engineer that needs to upgrade sqlalchemy. \n\nAlso just a side note. I assume you are just complaining because it’s Reddit. But if you are giving the complaint about the other engineers as the reason you want a job swap it out. Without proof it is not possible to tell if they are the problem or you are, and you don’t want to make an interviewer guess.",

The only thing Anthropic got dinged for was having a small portion of books that were torrented in its digital library that hadn't been used in years. Every other piece of copyrighted training material they paid for. \n\nBut you should consider why you are just now considering this when you're using any number of third party services for processing or storing your code, your customer data, your telemetry, and almost everything else you do. The same exact restrictions and legal agreements apply here. Your enterprise should be engaging with a provider's enterprise unit to get an agreement in place, or just use something like AWS Bedrock if you trust AWS more than say OpenAI or Anthropic. But all the big providers are able to easily set up BAAs for standardized compliance like SOC2 and HIPAA (I've done this for clients before. AWS' process is the easiest because it's all automated). \n\n> Also with building something novel these models might struggle a lot and with enough assistance and multiple back and forth if we do get a novel implementation to work, wouldn't it be easier for the model to implement it next time for someone else??\n\nNo. Models don't learn directly from your conversations, they're frozen in place and in most harnesses your context/memory remains local to your or your account and has to be used as context in calls. Continual learning isn't a thing in LLMs (yet).\n\n> are we just making it easier for claude to automate our jobs away?\n\nYour entire career, whether you admit it to yourself or not, is in automating jobs away.

Management was constantly getting feedback from customers who were leaving due to our service being unreliable. They used to request from the developers to make our system more stable, but somehow could never accept the high cost in their eyes to do the work.\n\nIn my eyes the root cause of technical debt is a communication problem between developers and management. Developers experience the pain of the technical debt directly, but often can't make the decision to prioritise it. Managers choose what to prioritise but to them technical debt is like dark matter - it is not directly visible but only visible through the effects on team velocity down the line. That's why they can't understand the cost and deprioritise it until it becomes too late.\n\nIs this how it feels in your work? How do you manage to successfully show to your managers that technical debt is a real problem?",

Now, it's very unwieldy and does a lot of things shittily.

Technical Debt is meant to be taken on as an explicit decision when, like a home mortgage, the debt is a useful and overall beneficial instrument that facilitates the business goals of the software being implemented.  \n  \nToo many people now think it just means \"slapdash code written by dingdongs who didn't know any better that we have yet to go clean up after because we don't have time right now OMG how is there so much of this spaghetti now?!!!\" That's not Technical Debt that's just crap code and a problem with your team's skill set and/or project management. A buildup of that kind of liability should never be allowed. If that's happening that's a Stop the Line event. Stop everything until it's fixed. That project cannot, by definition, be successfully sustained.\n\nAnd by fixed I mean in the Martin Fowler's \"Refactoring\" sense. Make explicit decisions and a plan. Define change boundaries, contain what can't or shouldn't be changed or changed yet with appropriate test scaffolding (ensure there are some kind of interfaces / contracts defined by those test that the refactored code will interact with only in the same way the legacy piece already expects). Don't just charge in and start changing stuff to improve it. You've already got a fragile system, a patient in ICU on life support. Keeping them stable is critical as you work to save them. Where the most new extensions need to go, stop and make those areas easy to extend. Then you can start extending them in feature developments while continuing to judiciously refactor elsewhere, getting back to a limp and a walk on the way to running again.\n\nREAL Technical Debt isn't a dirty word. It exists because it was useful to our most important goals to create it...and so we actually chose to! Yes, we should have a plan to go back and repay ourselves the loan, but that shouldn't feel bad. It should feel like oh good, I get to have a place to live now, even though I pay a mortgage with an interest rate that was worth it in the end.",

That's a defect.\n* Technical debt is the condition of the code that otherwise works but is difficult to modify or maintain.\n* The root of the problem stems from the fact that the compiler works just as well on shitty code as great code.\n* Developers are usually ultra fixated in getting something working. This is the right thing to do.\n* But even the best developers create code that is difficult to work with.\n* The problem is we tell management: \"It's working, but I need some time to clean it up\", like its an option. Managers just hear: \"It's working\". \n* In Extreme Programming, where the concept of technical debt really came into common use, technical debt doesn't even bubble up to management. You don't tell management you're working on it. It's not their concern. The state of the code is the domain of developers.\n* You also don't approach technical debt as a large re-do. You chip away at it a little at a time as part of your normal, everyday work. Here's the part where it's our fault: Most developers are more comfortable with re-writing something than gradually improving it. That's a skills/experience problem.\n* Addressing technical debt is a boy scout \"leave your campsite a little better than you found it\" thing. \n\n  \nBottom line: Stop talking about technical debt to your managers.

In an idealized world, you're right, but at any point in time the future has some level of unknown.\n\nIf an engineering team chose solution X over solution Y at time T it may have been a reasonable decision with known impact and trade-offs. As complexity rises, at time T+1 solution X may have a greater than expected negative impact on the system (one not known at T).\n\nAs a result as complexity rises, even with a series of well thought out solutions to well specified problems, small debt that doesn't impact users or fall out of requirement scope can compound and become big debt that causes poor performance or instability.

Note: this strategy won't work for really L/XL pieces of debt, but a team with a culture that follows the Boy Scout rule of \"leave every campsite cleaner than you found it\" will have a much easier time of staying on top of debt and preventing problems from festering. \n* Or alternatively, you need to align the debt work with some other big business initiative, e.g. if your customers are demanding a V2 product anyways, then it's probably a good time to argue that \"Oh yes product managers, we agree that your V2 vision is going to be amazing, and because it is so amazing certainly it deserves an amazing upgraded backend architecture too! We wouldn't want to hamstring your new amazing V2 vision by building on top of a subpar V1 foundation, right?\" Note: there is a huge world of difference between, aligning the tech debt work with the product goal, vs the much worse but regrettably common failure mode of communication where an engineering team instead takes the tack of \"no bloody way, there's no fucking way we can build V2, not until we fix all the terrible crimes in the V1 codebase\" (in the former you are perceived as helping the company achieve its goals, and in the latter you are perceived as being a blocker/detractor who is stopping the company from doing what it wants).",

          "text": "When [Ward Cunningham first introduced technical debt](https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html), it was primarily about code quality. Poor architectural and design decisions embodied in the code make working with it harder. Sometimes, you ship with those poor decisions because delivering working software and getting feedback means you know if you've built the right thing before you polish it.\n\n[Martin Fowler has a good write-up about technical debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html), too. I like his phrasing around \"cruft\", \"deficiencies in internal quality\", and working with the system. This broadens the definition beyond just the code, since \"the system\" encompasses other things. However, it still draws a distinction between internal quality (which affects the developing organization and teams) and external quality (which affects customers and users).\n\nIf your system isn't meeting reliability requirements, then you have deficiencies in external quality.\n\nAs far as where technical debt comes from, [Martin Fowler wrote about the concept of technical debt quadrants](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html). To give a few examples:\n\n1. Only automating the happy path test cases could deliver faster, but until the other test cases are automated, you have a higher risk of regression. Maybe it's prudent to get that faster feedback, but the team will be slower to make changes without the safety net of rapid test feedback.\n2. You may have found new technology, but the team doesn't have much experience with it. They are going to learn the right and wrong way by building with it. It could be better for the system in the long run, over using deprecated technology that the team is more familiar with, but they'll also be running into the idea that they should [plan to throw one away](https://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway). If they didn't build a throwaway prototype, the one that gets thrown away and replaced will be the one in production. It's prudent to use this new technology in the long run, but the team will inadvertently make mistakes and poor choices that need to be fixed later.\n3. When schedule pressure forces the team to choose between just-enough architecture and design and throwing something out there, they will make reckless decisions that make it harder to work with the system.\n4. Sometimes, you don't have the knowledge and skills on the team. People are in over their heads. They ship something, but it's not a solid foundation. It's reckless to have a team without the necessary knowledge and skills, and inadvertent in that they don't know the right way to do things.\n\nPaying down technical debt can be done in discrete tasks - small, independent, deliverable units of work. You can capture these units of work just like features and bugs. However, unlike features and bugs, where the stakeholder impacted by their delivery is a downstream customer or user of the system, the stakeholder in the paydown of technical debt would be the development team. You may not be able to identify all technical debt (especially of the inadvertent time, until you know the right thing to do or the right question to ask), but you can keep track of all of the deliberate choices that you made that you know you have to revisit, as well as whenever you learn a better way to address a problem. Once you have these units of work, you can express the value to the team in solving them, often in terms of system characteristics like maintainability, testability, and portability. Being able to associate the technical debt with key features or architectural elements of the system can help surface it when it's appropriate, since you only pay interest on the debt when you work on a part of the system with it.\n\nYou'll see the effects of technical debt in two places. First, when working on a part of the system with technical debt, you'll have a decrease in throughput and an increase in cycle time. It will take longer to complete work as you deal with the debt, either paying it down without planning or by working around it and continuing to build on a shaky foundation. Second, technical debt that isn't addressed may surface as externally visible defects, as you found through your user feedback and customers leaving the service. Being able to tie technical debt to decreased throughput or external quality issues makes it very visible to management.",

It is the incongruity between how things are and how you want them to be.\n\n\"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Or, in our case, shipped off to production with version labels.  And each new version is a potential missed opportunity to improve something.  Because there is always another way to do it.  Be it new standards or frameworks or just ideas.  Because technology is always improving and ideally so are you.  And the code just sits there until we change it.\n\nSimilar to the concept of when should you be done refactoring code, we can continually find things to improve or optimize or update.  There is no official end point when you've fully improved everything.  Just points when it's time to promote the code and move on to the next task.\n\nIt's all subjective.  And so we need to constantly compare and contrast business requirements with hard tech limits versus our personal perspective on how things should be.",

Everytime that I change jobs, I believe a large source of my success has been through my journaling habit.\n\n---\n\nI loathe to sound like an unemotional robot, but when journaling I keep track of two things:\n\n* Situation Task Action Result (Result measured with a \"proper metric\" as you're able to, not everything has a good measure that's worthwhile/easy to obtain)\n* Notable Social Interactions (think situations for behavioral interview questions)\n\nI carve out a few minutes on my work calendar every day to journal, and for the most part I do actually do it. To take my notes about work and make them more formal in my journal. This becomes figurative gold when it comes to:\n\n* End of year self-reviews\n* Requested reviews of peers or bosses\n* Resume writing\n* Future interviews\n\nIt's all a means to an end. Especially in a tough job market, I find that I customize my resume a bit more for job postings because of the plethroa of options that I have to pull from.\n\nFurthermore, During interviews I find that the fact that I even keep a work journal like this is a boon sharing that I do this habit for some hiring managers. It's a way to show introspection in my own career.\n\nLastly, generally describing work issues/achievements for my own personal record hasn't ever turned into an issue. I'm not a lawyer, don't steal code/propriatery stuffs. Usually I message with my manager and HR to have a record of this being approved that I forward to my personal email. And, if they want me to I even offer to send copies of what I'm writing.\n\n---\n\n### Question:\n\nIf you keep a work journal, is there other information that you capture that I didn't touch on?\n\nI keep a seperate `Notes` in which I have code copy pasted and use more of a scratch-pad / reference for my day to day job. For emphasis, those notes stay 100% corporate side. I make a clear distinction between `Notes` and `Journal`. But I don't think there's much more what I can journal than what I described above?",

I want a distinction like that for notes and journaling. It's just coding, the skill set is related, but yet different.\n\nOh, you know what ... STAR. I find that most engineers really focus on the `TA` and not so much the `SR`. But I find that to sell my ideas to leadership for day to day duties, to write a great review of performance for myself/others, or to sell myself during an interview, it's that `SR` that really do it. So maybe my notes are heavy `TA` and light `SR`, and my journal the opposite?\n\nIDK if that makes sense?

On the other hand, I find that to be wildly unreasonable given that it is neither louder nor more disruptive your brain than talking is, and people talk at full volume and take calls from their desks where they talk at full volume without wide spread complaint. In fact, sounds of talking interrupt your brain more than a white noise background sound because your brain can detect that one is a communication and one is not, and it automatically tunes into communications even if you don’t want it to do so. This is why music with lyrics tends to reduce overall focus and music without lyrics has less of an impact. \n\nSo people can complain all they want but it’s positively silly of them.

      "text": "After 8 YoE in industry, and roughly equal amounts preceding that with school and basic dabbling, I'm finding myself in a position I've never really been in before.\n\nI've been fairly focused on backend development for some years now, with the occasional dabbling in UI. My org uses a pretty standard Java backend & React-based frontend. There's nothing special about it, and my team mostly writes a domain-specific app built into the wider company platform using standard (and some custom built) integrations.\n\nAnyway, all that to say, it's good work, and I like it, and I'm happy with my company/org/team (and vice-versa). However, it only offers so much variety in the sorts of technical problems I get to solve, and the tech stack itself is rather pedestrian. I did get into software engineering because it always fascinated me, and I really love the technical side of things. My 40 hours a week is *usually* enough to keep me feeling satisfied. Lately, though, I've had a stronger itch than usual, and been wanting to try out some personal projects, learn some new tech, even dive into more theoretical CS-y things.\n\nUndergrad was great because I could go deep on whatever interested me just through taking classes. I never much had personal side projects then, though, because I got enough out of my coursework and extracurriculars. I've dabbled a *tiny* bit before in trying to learn some new languages with different paradigms, but nothing stuck. Usually it just feels too artificial. I like to have some sort of problem solving to go with it instead of just \"memorize some syntax\" or something, but it's hard to come up with those problems on my own. So I've just never developed the skills needed to learn on my own.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions, or strategies they use? Like, ways to generate ideas for side projects if you want to get hands-on, or resources for teaching yourself something new (including learning about what topics are even out there to explore).\n\nIt feels like such a silly thing to ask, but I think it'd do me well for both my career and my personal satisfaction to work on these tools, to keep the intellectual spark alive.\n\nETA: A little late, but I've read all the replies! Thanks everyone for the suggestions. These are all some helpful pointers, and it's nice to get some insight and direction.",

I think that you are seeing that right now with the AI bubble. LLMs are basically really good at 2 things: generating bullshit, and exploration. Today's companies are averse to the latter, preferring to maintain portfolios of expensive extractive addictive financialized products. \n\nBut beyond that... products are just bad.

Now they are enshittifying to make a profit on it.  For a competitor to arise, they’d have to run at a massive loss too *with a plan to shitty later to make a profit*, but also, YouTube today now has a massive amount of content which has network effects. The amount of money you’d need to lure all that content to you in sufficient quantities is obscene; so the users stay on YouTube because the content is on YouTube, and the creators stay on YouTube because the audience is on YouTube.\n\nIt takes something massive to break that chain and the only example I can truly come up with is maybe Twitter.\n\nI don’t think you can break in to a lot of these fields without running at a massive loss, and you can’t justify that massive loss without plans to make it up later with your own enshittification.\n\n\nWant to build a Netflix competitor? Netflix owns the content. You need massive pockets to build a competitor like Apple TV and to buy equivalent content. Then you need a way to monetize it (Apple does it with hardware sales, most will need to either enshittify or charge a lot).\n\n\nI’m not really sure how we solve this.  Admittedly, I do think there’s a solution, but it’s not one people are going to like-\n\nRoll back to how antitrust laws worked in the 1970’s, before Robert Bork, when selling products at a loss was illegal market manipulation.\n\nThis would shatter most of modern big tech and be ground shaking and unpredictable and scary though.\n\nIf you haven’t read [Lina Khan’s Yale Law Journal paper](https://yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf) on this, I recommend it.

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI am a mid level engineer at a big tech company, around 2.5 to 3 yrs here overall. Recently moved into a new role internally and have been in my current team for under a year.\n\nThe current team is solid, core platform type work, high visibility but also heavy on oncall and operational load. My manager is supportive and says I am on a good path and might get a strong rating next cycle, though promos in the team are generally slow and not many people have moved up recently.\n\nI also have an internal offer from another team in the same company. This one is more greenfield, less ops heavy, and seems more focused on building new systems. They say promo timelines are around 1.5 to 2 years on average there.\n\nI am torn because on one hand staying feels safer since my manager trusts me and I have built context. On the other hand the new team might give better long term growth and learning but it means resetting context and short term uncertainty.\n\nAlso adding that due to personal reasons I need to stay in NCR so external options are limited or would have to be remote.\n\nIf you were in my place what would you optimize for?  \nStability and near term rating or long term growth and ownership?  \nAny advice from people who have made similar calls would really help.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: new team has promo guidelines of 28-32 months tenure as there p50. New one is saying they don't have tenure restrictions and can do in about 20 months. Didn't mentioned earlier since I am already 10 months in my current team so no major distinction.\n\n  \nPS: Used GPT for grammar",

When I had discussed it with others, the consensus I came to was that ideally, switching teams should not affect promotion timelines. Your new manager should still account for your past performance on your previous team. However, the reality is that you might have a worse manager who is harder to work with. Or maybe they are not worse, but you still have to go through the process of proving to them that you deserve the promotion. \n\n\nAnd as you mention, it is easier to be effective when you have all the context of your current team. It will take a lot more effort to perform at the same level if you switch teams. You have to onboard technically and build new relationships. IME, the longer you stay at a team, the easier it is to provide value by just \"knowing how things work\". This can get boring, but makes life really easy.\n\n\nI feel that I made the right decision. Having the promo makes me feel more secure, and now I am much more comfortable with the idea of switching teams to explore something new.",

As developers we can inform management about the latter and possibly push back against unrealistic demands, but my expectation is that the business side also needs to be taken care of and they need to either know what to bet on, directly (management knows this is hot) or indirectly (management gathers smart people around to learn what's hot). That being said, this isn't a problem that we can expect to solve fully on our side (or a problem that we're absolutely right about), although we can make efforts to convince people higher up. And to some degree you cannot fully separate business and technical aspects, if someone wants to sell snake oil and is betting on all the wrong things that's not going to be good business.\n\nAlso, a lot of software development makes scope creep the normal mode of operation. This is somewhat inherent when trying to scale completely horizontally and just pile up features and execute ad-hoc work for whatever customer comes in. It's hard to tell them to stop piling up random stuff and shifting requirements, especially in a \"product\", because that's what they normally do and don't know any better (i.e. little vision beyond sales). (This isn't to say that ad-hoc stuff isn't needed, it's just a feeling that we're way overinvested in that market.)",

If you need quick response, you need slack and you need dedicated resources. This is why support teams sometimes have a reputation for either being a bit cushy and not having a lot to do, or for being overloaded and not being responsive enough. You can't have both and dev teams aren't any different, only that dev teams should be doing anything but firefighting and need protecting from that. If that can be justified as a whole-team thing, then sometimes having own or two developers on a team run \"interference\" and basically be allocated to non-critical work with the intent that they deal with any and all interruptions might be effective...or it might just normalise the practice and invite it to get worse.\n\nSome agile literature says that if a sprint is disrupted, it should end immediately, review and potentially retrospect, and a new one be planned. You might have some people baulk at the amount of overhead that introduces to the team if the interruptions are frequent enough, but it also might passive aggressively suggest that they should only interrupt when it is worth that cost, and there's always the counter-argument that it's none of their business as the team owns their process. You can probably tell, I'm not 100% sold on this approach and I've never seen it function personally, but there is some twisted logic to it.\n\nThe best pushback I've seen in the past is a strong product presence who understand what work is being done and insist on being in the loop to understand how anything might impact what they have planned (and who they might have promised it to and might have to mollify.) They're usually best placed to understand which priorities are being reordered and make that kind of call as long as the developers feed them enough information to understand what they're working with and what choices need to be made.",

I run them as local tests alongside unit tests, and also in the pipeline. I call them \"acceptance tests\", because I write them from the perspective of the user (not from perspective of ui). The ui is being called in tests, but is abstracted.\n\nLast 10 of my applications were like that:  \n\\- 300-600 acceptance tests (parallelized, tests on a running application) around 1-2 minutes for the whole suite  \n\\- 2000-3000 unit tests - for accidental complexity, domain, no mention of 3rd party usage, around 5-10 seconds for the whole suite.\n\n3rd party libraries, like db, ui, etc. are being exercised in acceptance tests; but logic is tested with unit tests just the library is abstracted away; unless the library can be unittestable too, like string helpers.\n\nMy approach is actually 4-layer approach by Dave Farley, author of Continuous Delivery.\n\nPS: As to who owns the tests - tests are owned by people who break them, because they're supposed to fix them. That's developers, so developers own all of those tests.\n\nMy developmental sequence would be like that:\n\n1. A pair needs to understand what work/problem the user has.\n2. A pair decised they'd do an expierment of what might work to solve the problem for the user.\n3. A pair expresses that as an example, and then writes that as a failing acceptance tests, they decide on an assertion that needs to initially fail.\n4. They write the driver for the acceptance test, so that it can click/fill buttons/inputs that don't exist yet. That already constraints a UI, which is a good thing.\n5. They create the ui and the necessary plumbing to go to the core/domain.\n6. They switch to unit tests, they write unit tests for the necessary logic in the domain.\n7. They stich the calls from the domain to the ui.\n8. They run the acceptance tests, if it passes, they're good to go. If it doesn't, they need to update the code so it works.\n9. Given the pair agrees on the acceptance and unit tests, they push it to the main branch, they're fairly confident in their code, because locally unit and acceptance tests work.\n10. The pipieline runs the tests, and if they pass the feature is deployed to production.\n11. The pair needs now to observe a user use that feature in production, and actually see that the feature solves the problem for the user. When they see it, their job is done.\n12. If the user uses the feature, but still didn't solve his issue or there is still some problems or bugs, that means experiment from 2. should count as invalidated, and the process 2.-11. repeats until a user achieves some benefit and the pair can observe it.\n\nIf the cycle 2.-12. takes too long, that means they took too big of a feature at once. They need to split it into smaller feature, and do 2.-12. cycle on something that can be achieved in 1-2 hours (3 hours tops).\n\nCode review was being done throughout the work by the pair, the tests have been executed throught the test. In steps 3., 6. and 8. they gather feedback on their design decisions, so they can correct the design while they're still working. This is very quick.\n\nThe approach can be desicribed as: TBD,CD,TDD,ATDD,CI,XP.",

I expect the secondary index schema to expand over time to encompass more data, so I see backfilling as, potentially, an incremental thing.\n\nIt feels like I keep encountering this problem over and over:\n\n* we want to run some backfill on all existing data\n* we know the backfill itself or the feature it enables is heavyweight enough to be somewhat risky -- there's a possibility we'll have to stop halfway through enablement and reconsider the whole thing\n* it's very important that we keep track of which individual things have and have not been backfilled, so that we can progressively enable new behavior\n* if the whole thing works really well, we'd like to eventually make it a core assumption of the system across all deployments -- deprecate and remove all code that was written without access to the backfilled data\n\nThe intuition in my head here is that we do enough schema migrations that we, like many teams, built a system and process to make them feel easy(-ish) and normal. But data migrations always feel like a one-off.\n\nWe're always building new tasks for our very generic job queue that loosely follow this \"migrate all the things pattern,\" writing new code for tracking the state of things that have and haven't been migrated, creating associated ramp flags as emergency off-ramps for the associated behavior, adding instrumentation that's extremely coupled to the rollout, etc. All easy things to do, individually, but it feels like there's a pattern here and it's driving me nuts that we're not optimized for it. It also feels like such a common need at scale that it ought to be a solved problem.\n\nWhat am I missing here? What do you all use for this, and did you build it yourselves?",

              "text": "Sure. In our primary data model, there's an unstructured blob of user-specified json data. That was originally stored in a json column in mysql. Eventually, we had users supplying blobs that were several mb compressed, and it became unsustainable to query the entire blob whenever a user needed to see some of their data.\n\nWe built a new schema that \"flattened\" these blobs into a table mapping dot-separated keys to values, and moved our writes to a queue so that we could do decoupled dual writing. We wrote a backfill job that would put an individual user's data on the new schema, and enable writes to it, and we picked out some high value customers to test with.\n\nNaturally, once the new schema was tried with real customer data, we found a bunch of inefficiencies. We made several backwards-incompatible revisions -- not a problem since we still had the old schema to fall back on, but every time we rolled out a new version of the new one, we had to temporarily disable it across the board, then trigger a manual backfill of the few customers we'd already onboarded. We also had some incidents where databases got overloaded serving the new schema and we had to ramp off individual customers.\n\nThis was a gigantic project, and two years later, we still don't have the new schema in use for every customer on all of our managed deployments. I have this (admittedly vague) sense that a lack of data migration infrastructure is part of the problem: we spent a lot of time writing elaborate systems to decouple the new and old schemas, performing manual backfills via our clunky in-house job queue, and arguing over the rollout pattern for our managed single tenant deployments, where engineers have less access to the system and where the sheer number of deployments makes manual job creation impractical (the job queue is, in its current form, incapable of operating across multiple deployments, and version lag between multi and single tenant would've made this tricky anyway).\n\nSo all this just feels... off to me. When we have schema migrations, we write and check in code for them, and they get deployed. When that code makes it to single tenant, they're deployed for single tenant. We write a lot of schema migrations, most of them are small and predictable, and if we really don't like something we did, a future schema migration can fix it forward.\n\nI think data migration is inherently a more complicated problem, but there still ought to be some way to build infra around it. We should be able to write a pr that defines a new column/table and a backfill, and just trust that it will make it out to every system. There should be observability tools that tag logs and metrics with the data version, like we tag for the commit SHAs of deploys. We should have a built in emergency stop button we can use if this thing turns out to be too taxing on the databases, just like we can always deploy a rollback version for multi tenant, or release a patch version for single tenant.\n\nWe can build all that stuff, but it seems unlikely to me that there isn't really good prior art in this domain. There must be companies larger than ours who've found a way to make this boring and predictable, right?",

My guess is that your problem is that the people designing it haven't had a migration go wrong on them, so didn't realise the importance of the things you mention (monitoring, the ability to abort, importance of verification). I learnt by fucking it up - now you have too!\n\nDoing a proper job of writing a migration essentially involves creating the tool you want, specific to the needs of your situation. Hopefully it will be applicable to future migrations you might need to do. But it's unlikely it will be applicable to anyone else's migrations, which is why nobody has a tool ready for you to use.",

Do you keep your Kafka events stored in object storage indefinitely? I hadn't considered that, but it does seem like it would be very useful if we could manage it.",

I was offered a role at a large healthcare company helping to implement AI initiatives, vendor selections, build infrastructure, etc. \n\nI’m hitting some serious imposter syndrome because I’m not an \"AI guru.\" I’ve used the tech, but architecting a full stack is a new level for me, and I know I’ll have to do a ton of research to stay ahead. On top of that, I’m a \"solo\" mom aka my husband works a lot. I don’t have the luxury of working 80-hour weeks to grind through the learning curve; I have to be efficient and present for my kid.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who stepped into a Lead/Architect role without being the absolute expert on day one.

There's folks at your company who have been training QLoRA's at home (and capitalize it that way), have strong opinions about MCP servers and langgraph, and can tell you the purpose of QKV matrices in a transformer. Empower them. Don't steal credit, but this is a topic with a lot of passionate hobbyists out there, and as a Principle in AI you can get engineers who care about this topic but are working in FE or whatever a chance to actually meaningfully contribute. Executives love the idea this is super transformative and effects everyone. \"Finding\" talent within an organization is also appreciated. Reading groups, vendor evaluation teams, tiger teams, whatever. Use \"up-leveling\" others as an excuse to learn what you need to learn yourself.\n\nYou can also always fall back on \"this stuff changes so fast. How do we build in flexibility?\" It's a good idea in all software - avoiding vendor lock-in and such - but damn this field has changed over my lifetime. It's fundamentally a good technical direction anyways, but from a selfish perspective it shows you're \"forward looking\". And it gives you cover for mistakes you'll make. Oops, you bet on the wrong standard. That's ok, you were warning about this, you have a somewhat flexible architecture, choose a new horse and pivot.\n\nBeyond that, full time parent & top level technical employee is a beast of a combo. Be organized, use your time wisely, look for out of the box solutions (e.g. \"mentoring\" to learn yourself), look for high value to low effort solutions, lean on others (hackathons are a blast in AI), it's doable but the answer in your case can't ever be \"just grind\". That's good in one way, and there is always another solution in all but the direst circumstances, but that's the easy plan B so you've got to be making smart decisions every step.\n\nHonestly, there's far worse fields to be faking it in then AI, though. It's new, it's changing, there aren't \"right answers\", knowledge decays quickly. Play to your strengths, know and avoid your weaknesses, and you'll be fine.",

You’re standing at the seam where scope increases faster than certainty, and that’s what this role actually is.\n\nAlso, “AI guru” is mostly a marketing costume. The space is too broad, too fast, and too context-dependent for one person to be an expert in all of it. What a company really needs in a principal role is someone who can set boundaries, ask the right questions early, and keep decisions legible when things get weird.\n\nYour background across healthcare, aerospace, education, biotech is an advantage here. Those domains train the muscles that matter for AI work: safety thinking, auditability, consequence awareness, and knowing when “cool demo” is not “production-ready.”\n\nFor the first 90 days, the move is not to grind harder. It’s to control scope so you can learn while building without burning out.\n\nIn the first month, focus on mapping the terrain: what data exists, who owns it, what can be used, what cannot. Where outputs become decisions. Where mistakes are irreversible. Where regulatory and ethical risk concentrates. Where “AI initiative” is actually a proxy for process debt or leadership wishful thinking.\n\nMonth two is putting guardrails in place before momentum makes them politically expensive: define what success means, what failure looks like, what must be measured, what requires human review, and what is simply out of bounds. Set expectations that “we can do this” is not the same as “we can do this safely.”\n\nMonth three is enabling execution inside those constraints: pick one or two narrow, high-leverage projects where you can prove value and also prove governance. You don’t need to personally build everything. You need to make sure what gets built is understandable, testable, and recoverable when it fails.\n\nOn the parenting constraint: you’re right to reject the 80-hour myth. This kind of work is judgment-heavy. Exhaustion destroys judgment. The fastest way to fail is to try to outwork uncertainty instead of structuring it.\n\nOne practical tip that keeps “research” from becoming a second job: choose a small set of questions that actually change risk or architecture decisions, and ignore everything else until it matters. Most reading is not leverage.\n\nAlso, I’m in healthcare too. If you want to trade notes on what’s worked (and what’s bitten), I’m happy to.\n\nAnd if your org is looking at agentic workflows, delegated authority becomes the real hazard line. Once systems can invoke tools and take action, controllability matters more than model cleverness: scoping, gating, auditability, and fast revocation. I’ve been pushing an open spec for that control plane layer (DAS-1) here: https://github.com/forgedculture/das-1\n\nYou don’t need to be an “AI expert.” You need to be the person who makes the system governable while everyone else is trying to ship faster.",

These are usually the ones that start off with 50 students in the intro class and use data structures & algorithms classes to filter out the majority of the students, who won’t make it in the upper level classes.  \n\nThe problem is that CS curriculums have to produce dual graduates: theoretical / applied math types who will go on to graduate school and maybe a PhD, VS people who will go into software engineering.

I don't think that's even remotely uncommon from people who *have* CS/CE/SWE degrees. This field is enormous. No one knows everything.\n\nIf there's anything I've noticed, especially as team members around me have been let go for performance reasons (not illegitimate - I noticed it too) at both jobs I've been at... it's not about specific knowledge beforehand, it's your ability to think through a problem, learn what you need to, dig around and get info you need, work increasingly independently, and learn those around you (by way of constructive criticism, mistakes you or others have made, etc.). I still run into random knowledge gaps that I know I would've learned in CS, and... it hasn't mattered, because I just do a bit of reading online, or just piece it together from looking at the code that's already there, and figure it out.\n\nThat said: The one area that really threw me for a loop was leetcode. I never learned DSA at school, and basically had to teach myself as much as I could as quickly as I could to actually make it through the interview process. I definitely don't think I'm anything close to great at LC problems, but I seem to have been good enough to get a job out of school, and change jobs (with multiple offers) in a tougher market last year. I'd low-key convinced myself that the first job I got out of school was a fluke, and really dreaded having to go through LC again after. I really had to remind myself that I'd been doing the job for a few years already, everyone was happy with my performance, I'd gotten promoted, and I'd worked on some fairly consequential stuff.\n\nUltimately... I'm more than just my ability to crank out an optimal LC solution in a high pressure situation, and it took me a while to internalize that. I had a pretty smooth time with system design interviews, despite being totally new to them, and always seem to ace the behavioural and \"let's chat about your experience\" portions of the interviews.\n\nSo, at this point... I rarely think about the fact that my degree isn't as standard. I don't stress about not knowing X or Y, I just learn as I go, try to stay curious and open to learning new stuff, and just... do it.",

What you need to learn in college is **how to learn**. The struggle to keep up with technology is continual and universal. Tech changes so fast that many patterns and practices learned three years ago will be out of date.\n\nEdit: maybe this goes without saying but soft skills, communication skills, basic organization, and knowing how to read and get along with people are skills in very short supply right now and will take you very far in a professional setting. Tech skills can be learned, soft skills past a certain age are much harder to acquire.",

I later wrote an O’Reilly book on FastAPI + GenAI. \n\nWhen designing the hiring process, I’d look at the degree as a base as I know it contributes to the SE mental models that are needed for the job. But, I’d always would want to see past projects, relevant work experience from past jobs and their abilities doing a take home project. So, I’d always not consider not having a CS degree as much of a drawback. \n\nSo to answer your question, it’s completely fine to not hold a CS degree to progress in a tech career.",

I take every single opportunity to pull out my graphs and reason about the code through both the codebase and the graphs that I have drawn. Every single time I'm reasoning about the codebase as to why X is done this way even if I have figured it out on my own I do ask my team to \"confirm\" if my understanding is correct, then I show them the graph and update it if necessary.

That sounds completely ancillary.\n\n\"Developing new features takes time\" is true of...everything. Every feature takes time to develop, in perfect or imperfect systems (ps: if you have ever seen a perfect system, please let me know). So that won't make a good argument to your leadership either. You'd need to be able to do some math showing the amount of time spent per feature working around the system, multiplied by how many teams/projects that impacts, and you would need to estimate how long it would take to rewrite the current system. My experiential take: rewriting a system takes exactly as long as it took to write the existing system. This is demonstrated multiple times publicly in history, so take that into account. Would the investment be actually worth it?\n\nIf frontend changes put the backend at risk, that seems to be worth a change! However, that doesn't seem to have anything to do with what you outlined originally. That said, is the solution something as simple as rate limiting? If you don't have that today, that would be very much well worth the price of admission!\n\nI'd really tighten up what you're proposing. Figure out the actual business pain, not just those little engineering \"I wish this abstraction was more perfect\" kinda things.\n\nTHAT SAID, I would say that in any healthy engineering organization, 20% of time should be spent on tending to the garden, that is, addressing technical debt (that's my number in general at least). So if you can make a good argument about incrementally improving those features in about 20% of your planning window, that could also work. That is if those are actually the most important technical debt you current have.",

          "text": "**TLDR: How do I make up for 3.5 years of bad work experience? What are some serious steps I can start making today to transition into a role that will actually provided transferable skills?**\n\nI was hired at my current company as a Jr. Software Developer. I completed a month-long full-stack training in their summer new-hire cohort before being matched to a team.  I was placed on a Developer Experience team. From the software engineer’s guidebook, I understand I work in a cost center.\n\nIt didn’t start off so bad. I worked on a React console that allowed developers to manage assets and initiate business workflows and it used git, Jenkins, etc. After about 8-10 months my job changed drastically. We were hit with a strict deadline of moving every “service” away from the React console to a LOW-CODE tool (ServiceNow) that uses JavaScript.\n\nAfter switching to ServiceNow, my career has been very unenjoyable. I stayed because of golden handcuffs, meanwhile I was able to use the low-code tool well and establish a good reputation. After my golden handcuffs were off, the team started to get worse and eventually last year there was a big reorg and my whole team was moved to another team/manager. The reputation I established feels meaningless under the new manager, and my job doesn’t even feel that secure anymore.\n\nIn the technical aspect, I’ve often had no guidance. After moving to ServiceNow, there is no true “PR” equivalent, so code reviews stopped. Management only brought it up when things broke. I made a Teams bot & setup an automatic code review process, but my Lead didn’t ever want to look at the code. People were copying my bad code/patterns from my first year of employment and I still see it some places today. AI has been my only consistent technical mentor throughout my employment. \n\nI think I’ve painted a picture on how bad my experience has been. What I want to know though is how to recover from here? I’m willing to step outside my comfort zone at this stage in my life. I have been taking some steps myself like seeking a mentor through our program at work, and also I’m reading books and trying to push myself to do projects and leetcode despite my burnout. I’ve also been applying to jobs since last year, but I have been getting discouraged lately due to no interviews or calls yet.",

Titles don't really matter when mapping from startups to elsewhere, it's more whether you actually have useful experience at different companies or not. For example, there's a difference in EMs that have had to fire a low performer or coach a low performer, versus just an EM that's cruising along. \n\nI'd recommend (1) making a \"hype doc\" or similar (google it if unfamiliar!) of all your accomplishments so far, then (2) looking at various public company career ladders for both IC and EM positions, then (3) trying to match which of your accomplishments map onto what levels in the career ladder, and finally (4) find a bunch of commonly asked interview questions and see how your accomplishments could answer those questions. This will give you a good sense of how to position yourself or whether you have some more to work on.\n\nIn any case, also remember the titles of the roles in your resume don't actually need to reflect the official title at your job (as long as it's at least properly descriptive of your role). You can always elaborate more on a phone call or in the interview.",

For now, my risk of job loss is minimal - at least until fall.\n\nGiven the market where it is, I want to use my time to get hands-on with something that opens up career opportunities going forward.\n\nDuring the holidays, I was looking at some of the latest buzz-words on AI, and I noticed that there are a lot of things that are happening every other day - new product launches, new AI tools to do something etc.\n\nI'm in my mid 40s, and not to sound ageist myself, but I don't think I can learn and eventually keep up with these current trends while also competing with the 20-year olds who may have a lot of time to learn and explore new stuff coming our way.\n\nOn a techincal front, we're an Azure shop ( _surprise!_ ), but I don't really work with any of the cloud services. I'm comfortable with Oracle PL/SQL, some Python ( _definitely need a week or two to get back up to speed_ ) and of course I'm decent_ish_ with Shell scripts.\n\nWith this background, can you please suggest some tech stack that I can pick up over the next few months which will help me land a job sometime in summer this year? Since I'm practically starting from scratch, I guess I can pick anything that has decent enough job prospects ( _unlikely to become obsolete in the next few months_ )\n\n**TLDR: How do I make myself more employable/marketable? What tools/technologies can I lean on?**",

Rarely those need any follow ups, the other devs LOVE those.\n\nThe BAs we have are great, but they still cannot produce such detailed and actionable user stories because they do not have the technical expertise, they do not code, they do not have a knowledge of how the system at play works inside, etc.\n\nI began to notice (and others in the dev team), that this is a very valuable skill, I basically multiply the productivity of other developers. Otherwise, they have to go through multiple follow ups with the business, or just accept the requirements as is and create a mess.\n\nHowever, how do I apply this skill more in work?\n\nBecome a BA? I do not want to talk to users until they know at least on the high level what they want to do, our BAs are doing that but I would die from boredom doing that. I am good at when they want to actually build something.\n\nBecome a Product Manager/Owner? Gosh no, too high level, I need specific problems to work on. All the user research and theoretical stuff is just maddening to me to work on. Make up your mind and let's build something!\n\nBecome a Tech Lead? Managing a team is of no interest to me.\n\nThe only thing I feel like as if there are very specialized, **technical** BA roles that work on the intersection of users and engineering with more emphasis on making the requirements actionable for developers.",

I think what you do is too far out of the typical BA/PM world and probably should be. PMs shouldn't be telling engineers what the tables are named and the infrastructure to be build. PMs are in charge of \"what\" and \"why\" and engineering is in charge of \"how\".\n\nSo I think you're best to stay in the engineering organization but be seen as something like a \"Business Application Architect\" who architects the business logic, features, how the widgets work, as opposed to a more generic software architect who focuses on how the tech stack works. Doing all the stuff you mentioned in your post, as well as working to make the TPM/BAs do better prep work. Engineers are always complaining and vague and superficial user stories, so any smart head of engineering will see how you \"multiply the productivity of other developers\" and want to have you.",

Sometimes a user story has a single sentence, or even a single word that makes it significantly more effort compared to a solution that gives 80% of the result for 20% of the effort. I compare user stories to the tips of an iceberg, where the invisible underwater part consists of many decisioin that need to be made on how things ACTUALLY work.\n\nThis precision comes only from the experience of having a vague user story and having to code it in precise terms to a computer to execute.",

While the team overall is performing well, there's a lot of tension between the onshore and offshore members of the team. The onshore devs feel threatened and are fearful of losing their jobs due to some of the offshore devs performing at a higher level than them. Communication is also lacking between both onshore and offshore devs due to timezone differences so there's often conflict due to miscommunication.\n\nIs this setup the new normal across the industry and do you have any advice on how to make the best of the situation?",

And to properly source those in dashboards that clients use, we stage data using the medallion architecture. \n\n\nIn hindsight I think this is a good start, since we have multiple consumers and we can backfill data if needed either in a analytics setting, etc. But I am a bit concerned in where we are taking thing to build a good foundation and would like your insights on this, currently I see that it is on the beginning stage of maturity since we focus on:\n\n* Observability -bronze layer does not have a proper way to observe it's outputs so we setup first a layered analytical point to observe the behavior of each source pipelines that populates the bronze layer and send alerts on what problems arise\n* migration - we have an old pipeline that runs on VM which the code is not properly versioned and is repetitive. This is still being migrated and fixed. \n\nIdeally this is good, but I am concerned on the following:\n* Lack of data contracts on each layer - to properly manage expectations on the responsibility of each  layer and to not duplicate responsibility, I believe a formal contract should be in place before proceeding with more alerts and monitoring. While the code tellsthel business logic, it is often overlooked if not all devs have the knowledge or a guiding point totwhat limits each layer should be observing\n* lack of source dataset documentation(business side)  I think the next thing after looking into the responsibility of each set, is to have a document that specifies at least the business metadata we need from it (SLA, Data Owner etc) right now, the sets I am seeing are focused on what the code is doing than this.\n\nGiven those concerns above,do you think given a timeline, it is best to set up at least the data contract first before actually going into monitoring/observability since what we will observe must be dependent onithe responsibility and scope? \n\nCan you suggest ways to figure out what the intention behind a certain velocity of a start-up? came from a big company so starting out on data maturity is a first for me, but I would really like to take into consideration the timeline that has been set and make suggestions that compliment the current state rather them disrupt it. \n",

Sink the raw data into a cheap bucket storage from source in bronze pipelines. Don’t do much else. Use silver for processing and gold to load to dashboards. \n3. Log warnings and errors for now. Only info log core success and attempt messages. \n4. Put a few retries on every await call. Make sure to log all errors. Try catches should only encapsulate a single await call. No more than that. \n5. If you can dictate your thoughts to AI, get AI to document what you need doc wise. \n\nFor every step, focus on what you can get done fast without it being perfect.

I do have a few questions since right now we are heading towards analytics after establishing our observability:\n\n* DQ Checks - each layer has their own quality checks for validation of data (stale data, schema mistmatch etc) \n* Monitoring - each layer has their own monitoring layer where they they check not only the job but the layers inside it that run and alerts that classifies what type of error with the corresponding MTTR. \n\nGiven those, I do want to ask, when do you think is the right time to introduce a data catalog? (alongside the data contract, I was initially planning to introduce this but as a (source based data catalog (operational metadata focused) but I will scratch the contract part first) For starting data maturity, I would like to ask as well if you can also recommend a book/article to get perspectives on what they prioritize given the starting point on data maturity, I want to know if there is a pattern of some sorts on priority if say you are just starting out. \n\nLastly, Do you have any suggested article/book of how to balance out implementing or introducing something to what actually is really needed? I think this is more of a guiding question  or perhaps more experience will tell this overtime? \n\nReally thankful for your feedback and thoughts around these, I want to learn and at the same time get multiple perspective on things so I grow properly as an engineer.",

I've written extensively on this exact topic, but try to keep my own links out of comments.\n\nData Catalog:\nIt very much depends on your use case and number of data sources you are working with. If you are only dealing with a data lakehouse (assuming this since you are using medallion architecture), you can get pretty far with Data Build Tool (dbt) docs. If you only have one database, you can honestly get away with pulling the metadata directly from the database using the standard information schema tables (I have some code in a public repository for this if interested). Where a data catalog really starts making sense is when you have multiple data sources you need to keep track of, and thus need a dedicated tool to constantly update and maintain the captured metadata. Even then, there are some great OSS tools for this.\n\nData Maturity:\nThis is highly dependent on the company. There are startups with high data maturity and enterprises with awful data maturity. For a startup especially, you need to balance best practices and taking on technical debt for good enough. You need to understand what the next major milestone is for the startup (eg raising another round) and only focus on what gets you to that point. There is a huge trap for data leaders to try to do everything \"right\" and end up spending way too much money and time with minimal results to show for. The goal is data maturity for maturity sake, the maturity has to match the current objectives of the business, especially when a startup has more problems than people and time to solve.",

But for a modern CPU to expose a register directly to another CPU (for IPC as they discuss in Fuschia) sounds outlandish. If this is designed to run on consumer x86/ARM hardware then I don't think you are interpreting it correctly. It almost certainly uses regular memory addresses with atomic operations and relies on the hardware cache coherency protocol to ensure the data is transmitted.

The request enters the consumer and we save to the database, via the MS, the payload and some other data syncronously.\n2. The consumer does it's logic.\n3. On the way back upstream we call again the service and add the response.\n\nBecause of my feature, I want to make my new code async. It's unlikely but not impossible that it could cause performance issues if there's a delay in the upstream waiting for step 1. I also think making it async in the consumer is just kicking the bucket down the road.\n\n**What if my DB logging service hasn't finished saving data from step 1 by the time the consumer has finished step 2?**\n\nIt's a java springboot MS using a postgres container and JPA. Im worried about object optimistic locking issues. I was thinking I can wait n seconds and retry m times for step 3 if I encounter these errors. Or if step 1 hasnt finished by the time step 3 executes, I can wait n seconds to retry before giving up and logging some error.\n\nIs this the best way to do it? The database is used for auditing purposes for our tech support so it's not vital to have live, readily accessible data. 4-8 hours is the minimum time it would need to be accessible, but obviously ASAP is better. Is it overkill to push step 3 to a queue if the object locking failure retries exhaust?\n\n**One other way is to wait for step 3 to save to the DB the data from step 1 and 3. Given the data doesn't need to be accessed straight away, we can just push this all to a queue and not worry about performance.**\n\nLet's just assume step 1 or 2 failures are handled for in step 3.\n\nThanks everyone.

          "text": "There is no \"best\" way to do things like this. There are a bunch of different options, and which one is appropriate for your use-case depends on the details of your use case and the trade-offs you're willing to accept.\n\nThe reason why people generally gravitate towards just doing things synchronously is because it avoids having to answer a bunch of awkward questions about partial failure modes and out of order event processing and this generally leads to the simplest implementation at the expense of performance. \n\nIf I asked you what should happen if you're unable to produce an audit trail but the actual underlying services are operational, what would you say? \n\nYou mentioned it's OK for the audit trail to be lagged behind, but is it OK to miss requests and responses entirely? \n\nAnd exactly how far lagged behind is it OK to be? What should your audit trail service say about data being requested when its farther lagged behind than that?\n\nAre you prepared to think through what should happen if the audit trail service receives a response before a request? How long should it wait if it's going to wait? \n\nHow does the audit trail service want to handle requests received with no responses? Are those going to be presented as errors, still in progress (if so, how long do you wait?), or something else?\n\nBefore you think through any of those ask yourself a much simpler question: do I really have a performance bottleneck if I just do things synchronously? Your post begs the question that you *will* have a performance issue, but that's not necessarily true unless you've measured... anything. If you're willing to operate the audit service with high availability and low latency SLAs then you might not have any issue to worry about at all depending on what the needs of your calling services are. At 15k requests per day being audited, we're not exactly talking about massive scale here. Can you *really* not handle, say, 100 milliseconds more latency on all these calls?",

Because in that case I think normalizing writing them independently would solve for your concurrency issue.\n\nWhat's the use case for new feature? If this data isnt required to be served to a consumer facing application, then maybe you can explore writing postgres to a data lake and use something like spark to handle the unpacking offline. \n\nIn your current set up, you could also maybe just add some kind of look up table to trigger the unpacking, I guess that would be simpler",

If you are considering async you seem to be fine with the data being lost, so just committing a response after step 2 and handling saving after the response is already sent to the consumer it's probably the easiest thing you can do without impacting the business process. Haven't used spring boot in years so I can't tell if it's complex to implement. If it's complex just shove it on another thread.",
