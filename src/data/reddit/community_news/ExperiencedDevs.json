      "text": "Biggest difference working with senior devs isn't the technical stuff honestly. It's how they communicate \n\nAsk a junior something and you get like 15 minutes of context, explanations, caveats. Ask a senior and its \"yeah that's broken, I'll fix it by thursday\" or \"no idea, ask Dave he touched that last\"\n\njust direct communication. \n\nAnd when stuff breaks, seniors mostly just own it. \"I fucked up the migration, rolling back now.\" Meanwhile I've watched junior devs write 3 paragraphs in slack explaining why technically it wasn't their fault before even starting to fix anything\n\ni'm obviously not saying all seniors are like this, some never grew out of the excuse phase. But the good ones are simple - you ask a question, you get an answer. You need something done, they tell you when or tell you no. No guessing what they actually mean\n\nMakes everything faster tbh. Less meetings trying to figure out what someone was really saying. Less parsing through defensive language. Just actual communication\n\nTook me a while to realize this is a skill not just a personality thing. Being direct without being a dick. Admitting you broke something without spiraling. Takes practice I guess ",

Some baseline level of communication skill is important, but, at the end of the day, that's easy to teach. Real expertise and judgement isn't.\n\nThere are people who just manifestly have a clearer understanding, intuition and vision for whatever we're doing. I've worked with a number of people like that in my career, starting with my undergrad advisor in college. He was great in *part* because of his social skills and understanding, but there was far more than that. There's a level of skill, insight and experience that has no substitute.\n\nExpertise is hard to evaluate, but you'll know it when you see it. And that sort of tacit knowledge is what makes senior folks—ones who are actually senior, not just those with an inflated title—actually different from non-experts.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating to talk about because the only descriptions I can give are all fuzzy. But, at the same time, that shouldn't be a surprise; the reason tacit knowledge is *tacit* is that it's hard to put into words! Unfortunately that extends not only to the knowledge itself, but also the meta-knowledge *about* the knowledge :P",

Jrs and mids waffle, afraid to make the mistake. I've made more bad decisions and recovered than a lot of folks will make good ones in many years time. I strive to not make the wrong ones, and the more I do, the more I learn what not to do, but there are a lot of cases where a fast bad decision is just as valuable if not more than a slow good one.\n\nLast they know where the dragons are. I've lost count the amount of times I've been on a meeting and just get a sense that a proposal is off. I go code spelunking to confirm my intuition on the call or right afterward and course correct.\n\nBut I also just don't have the time to mull over the options, I have to make dozens of decisions daily, Jrs reaching out, product reaching out, qa reaching out, designers, etc... I don't have time to share a ton of context and give you my entire line of thinking, I'll go nuts.\n\nThat said, if you're newer and you're asking a question, if you already have an answer in mind, tell me where you're leaning and why, maybe you're right and we can both save time, I learn from less experienced people all the time. And it never ceases to be annoying to get asked, give an answer, get asked again the next day with more context. If you got a second opinion, fine, now make a decision, if you disagree, fine you already know what your answer is, you're just lacking the confidence to follow through with it, but you'll gain that by ... Following through with it",

There are *years* of conditioning that go into developing a person who doesn't know how to communicate directly, is defensive, lacks accountability, victim mentality, etc.\n\nThis isn't a senior vs junior thing.  It's a \"good hire\" vs \"bad hire\" thing.  These people should have been filtered out in the behavioral interviews.\n\nYou're right that it's a skill, but you have to want to learn it because you recognize a deficit in yourself.

Developers were not a dime a dozen and if you'd shown that you had skills, they kept you around even when you admitted to fault.\n\nThat's not the case for many (most?) juniors these days. The competition for their positions is FAR hotter today than it was when we started, hell they even have to compete with AI (justified or otherwise). They're scared witless of PIPs, competition for promotion, and just outright copping the blame for something going wrong and the boss hiring someone else to replace them because for every job available there are dozens of applicants (at least).\n\nI see their communication style as a fear response and ours as one from a position of confidence. Confidence I'm sure would get ripped from us the instant we're downsized and find out just how impossibly hard it might be to get a job again if our friends & contacts don't have something available.",

I've never read it.)\n\nOne of the main consultants actually had the gall to call one of my best devs lazy and entitled because she disagreed with him.  He did this publicly, I might add.  I pushed back, because he was ~~stupid~~ / ~~an idiot~~ /  ~~massively unprofessional~~ / wrong.\n\nI found out after I left that he did it again, only this time to the entire dev team.  In an all-hands meeting.\n\nSomehow they convinced management that the fact that I looked out for my team as their manager was a bad thing.  A VP, so far as I can tell, later tried to get me fired by massively misconstruing an email I sent.  I failed to rise to the bait, so I got laid off.\n\nI was an IS major in college.  We trained to be consultants.  By never being one, I dodged a huge bullet.  \n\nI always thought the cliche was just a cliche.  Now that I've worked at a company that went so far in with one that we were constantly asking \"Who hired who here?\" I have a very different view of them as a whole.",

They basically want to be able to throw money at problems and have good outcomes appear overnight with them barely having to be a part of the process. They view it as being like a utility - gas, water, electricity.\n\nOutsourcing, AI, cloud and even Agile methodology are in large part about selling the fragile delusion that tech as a domain can be put in a nice, neat little box with obvious boundaries and predictable output. But the fact is that your technical choices make or break your organisation and putting that in the hands of the lowest bidder without being a genuinely engaged part of the process is a horrific decision.\n\nCompetent non-technical leadership still needs to steward the technology side of the business. If they just try to treat it as a dumb cost, like the office electricity bill, it leads to terrible results that can crater the whole organisation. You cannot run a modern company without senior leadership that has its head screwed on with a sane tech strategy.\n\nMy point here is really just to say that when idiots get in charge of a business and make bad, bad decisions around tech it's not some trivial thing, it can and does routinely end companies.",

They found a CTO, a very convincing person, 30+ years as Ca TO. He pretty much killed the company as he ousted all consultants, brought his not-so-bright son as lead developer, and brought his son's friends as lead for frontend, etc. \n\nAs I checked, the guy was really CTO for 30+ years, but only in his own company, where only his wife and son, and son's friends worked, and every year they jumped to another country and another project, because they ruined every single one.  That CTO worked really well with german managers, who were ... questionable at minimum (no professionalism, quite hedonists, but super large ego). So the manager and the CTO got rid of all the seniors and consultants, then started to rewrite everything with Symfony (PHP), instead of something minimal and good, so they failed miserably. Then the investors hired a consultant firm to evaluate things, and they fired on the spot this CTO, the entire HR department, and got rid of the managers and one of the owners too, because everything was in ruins. The investors weren't happy to lose 5+ million EUR at that time. Then they bought into that consultancy and rewrote everything in Ruby, which failed (obviously), then they sold the company, then the next consultancy rewrote everything in Python, then the last owner, before shutting the entire stuff down, rewrote everything in PHP again. 3 years, many workers, iterations, and loss of money.",

We noticed this gap with our post-2020 hires despite our best efforts, they weren't picking up the tacit knowledge that comes from sitting next to senior engineers.\nThe solution was surprisingly simple: Open Audio Rooms.\n\nWe shifted from private 1-on-1 calls to public voice channels. If I’m pairing on a feature, I hop into an open room instead of sending a private invite. If we need a third opinion, a teammate can see we’re talking and join us without the friction of calendar invites or missed DMs. Even if you’re working solo, sitting in an open channel recreates the office \"buzz.\" You can listen in on problem-solving in the background or just feel less isolated. The best part is that unlike a real office, you have the ability to cut the audio and leave when you need deep focus.\n\nOur new grad picked up a ton of knowledge this year and our ~2022 hire vastly improved their knowledge over the last year after we switched to working this way.",

As someone that's worked in-office and remote for quite a few years in both, I vastly prefer remote for all it's benefits over in-office for it's few benefits. In-office is just a constant barrage of interruptions from loud coworkers, chatty neighbors and people just \"stopping by with a quick question\". There are countless tools to assist in remote whiteboarding, it just seems like most companies don't feel like adopting them. When it comes to straight up collaboration on something like rubber ducking or over the shoulder debugging, remote largely feels the same minus someone staring over your shoulder. When it comes to roadmapping and planning, you tend to capture more in documents than on a whiteboard when doing it remote.\n\nAt the companies I've worked remotely, we've done in-person offsites and remote planning sessions. The entire benefit the in-person is the social aspect after the meetings. The actual meetings feel largely the same.\n\n> In 10 years I think we'll look back at how we do remote today...\n\nAssuming it's not gone because of all the RTO mandates. I agree tools SHOULD improve but I'd be curious how hard it is for a company to get funded with remote work tech as their basis in this wave of calls for RTO.",

Remote is phenomenal for collaboration at large group sizes, but it requires you to be a lot more intentional for collaboration in small groups.\n\nThe ceiling for remote collaboration in small groups might be technically lower, but I think the ceiling is still dramatically higher than most in-person groups actually achieve in practice.

There’s so much they pick up just by being in the room with seniors little habits, ways of approaching problems, even how to ask for help. When you’re remote you have to be intentional about creating those moments.\n\nOne thing that’s helped my team is pairing sessions with cameras on and a running slack channel where anyone can chime in. We also encourage juniors to check in with a couple of peers or a senior after they wrap a task: not just on the code, but on how they communicated and collaborated. It’s surprising how different those perspectives can be from how you see yourself. A few honest conversations can bridge the gap that physical proximity used to provide.",

The breadth feels endless. One interview focuses on frontend performance trivia, another on SQL optimizers, another on system design depth, another on algorithms I may never touch day to day. Even with prep, it feels impossible to predict what angle I’ll be evaluated on.\n\nAfter enough of these, it starts to feel like a numbers game plus interviewer fit rather than a signal of real-world competence, and that’s honestly pretty demoralizing.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through this at the senior level, how do you mentally frame interviews so they don’t erode your confidence? Do you narrow company types, take breaks, or just accept the randomness? Have any of you seriously questioned staying in software during these phases, and what helped?\n\nI’m not looking to rant.

You never really know what the director is looking for. They may have someone in mind already and the whole audition is a courtesy / box-check on some grant program they're operating the theater under. You do your best, you take rejection, you suit up and do it again. She does some additional work: she researches the theaters, keeps her ear to the ground, talks to other actors in the area about their experience (that's easier with actors, where the gigs are one-offs; software engineers aren't moving as fast through industry so you have to build a larger contact web to get a richer picture of who's hiring in your area).\n\nBut the *biggest* thing that controls whether you get a role is if you keep showing up. The role finds you; your control over getting the role (unless you're a big enough name that people recognize it) is minimal.\n\nI know it's not the most comforting feedback, but: interviewing in software is similar. The spectrum of what is asked is so broad because companies *barely* know what they want and *barely* know how to find it in the talent pool. And companies are also dealing with people who just straight-up lie about their capabilities and use every tool they can get their hands on to ace the interview, whether or not those tools would translate into being able to do good day-to-day work. So it's a mess out there.\n\nYou can research the companies to get a sense of what they're looking for, talk to other engineers, and try to tune your approach to who you're talking to... But the biggest control you have over finding a gig is *still* to keep showing up to the interviews.",

          "text": "I'm going through this right now. My theory is hiring managers are telling interviewers to \"be tougher\", but the interviewers don't know how to do this in a way that actually produces more signal.\n\nYes, a senior fullstack developer should have familiarity with most parts of the stack. However, I don't think they should be required to have *an equal level of depth* in all parts of the stack. And this is the biggest change I've seen. Previously, in a system design interview, it was enough to just say, \"I would use a queue for this.\" Maybe they'd ask you, \"What queue technology would you use?\" and that would be the end of it. Now if you say, \"I would use lambdas\" they want to drill down and ask you extremely specific implementation questions about lambdas. And they do that with everything! And if there's one single area where you don't have that level of depth, you fail the interview. You're literally expected to be perfect at everything. I was in an interview recently where I felt like I was being treated like the suspect in a murder case. The adversarial nature of these interviews has gotten out of hand.\n\nPersonally, I don't think this is fair. I think it's natural to have varying levels of strength in different areas. If someone's a whiz at databases but hasn't touched lambdas in a few years, should that person be a no-hire? Not in my opinion. Because if you've got advanced database knowledge, what is the likelihood you coudn't come up to speed with lambdas in the space of a day? Especially now that we have the best learning tools known to man at our disposal. But sadly, this is where we are.\n\nMy answer was to work on a side project that involved the technologies I wanted to get stronger on. In a couple cases, I even picked up some old projects and grafted on some new technologies because I wanted to learn them. Can you do this with everything? Probably not. But you can probably pick out the technologies you're most likely to be asked about and study up on them. And then you can walk into the interview room more confident, and as long as they ask you *reasonable* questions, you'll have decent responses.",

For personal reasons he had to move to Canada, got interviewed and was asked idiotic questions. Instead of asking him to show what he's built, they gave him brainteasers and algorithm questions. But the guy was self taught and absolutely uninterested and unaware of all that.\n\nSo I'd say, there's little to do to avoid these types of questions, the only thing you can do is try to study them like you'd study for a driving exam, i.e. don't worry about how useful it is, or how relevant these questions are, just try to get familiar with the types of questions asked just to be able to get to the next round.\n\nAlso, during interviews, try bringing the interview to a higher playing field, by relating their questions (even the most academic ones) to real life experiences (however relevant) just to show you've solved actual problems, not just algorithms.",

It'd be like revising for a pub quiz.\n\nInstead, the best approach I've found is to chase tech that interests me to keep sharp, and to bring that enthusiasm into the interview room.  The times when I've just hit my marks, virtue signalled my strengths and insincerely flagged some \"personal failing\" that actually translates into being a perfect employee...  eh, not great record in actually landing the job.\n\nWhereas going in like a shambolic dork weathered by two decades in the field, and getting into a personable, interested conversation about their tech stack, even when it involves saying several times \"Nah, I've never heard of that, but it sounds fascinating... what does it do?\" - pretty good track record.\n\nI guess you kind of want to come across like John Wick, not Andy McNabb.

          "text": "honestly given the span of what FS can cover, i have to adjust the way i approach the interviews, because you can't possibly memorize everything you could potentially be asked\n\nand so what i generally practice is smaller tasks that are within my skillset that i know i can hook up from start to finish\n\ne.g. if you were asked to make something like a simple form, can you throw a few fields together, add simple FE validation, submit the form  data, and do something with the successful response. You don't even have to set up the API or DB (but you should practice that separately)  - you can just emulate that with Promises\n\nthis might be a hot take and i guess its hard to explain but its all about being comfortable and thorough with what you already know how to. With senior level interviews, mostly what they're looking for is \"does this candidate know what they're doing\" aka, can you look at the problem, and come up with a possible solution, and code that fr start to finish. \n\nI've gotten technical assessments where i didn't hit all the requirements, or  messed up with syntax, or got the answer wrong, but the way I work through the problem - but despite that I'm the one who's driving the convo. It's like, you just have to convince them you've done this a million times before, and you do that throw\n\nOne time i had 90 min to build a small app - when i saw the requirements i just thought in my head \"yeah no one can build this in 90 min\" and so that helped me relax - that one i hit less than half the requirements, and after I had another 90 min session to discuss my solution. So despite not hitting the requirements, i could have sold that app to you in an elevator. I had the solution in my head, and so when we discussed what I had coded I could explain it thoroughly how I would have coded this or that given appropriate amount of time. I got the job",

              "text": "TLDR - hot take: whatever the task you're given in an assessment, your ability to break it down, come up with an approach, and execute that approach - that should _look_ effortless, and for the most part it should be more or less THAT, because you do in fact have 8+ yrs at the keyboard. \n\nNot saying that this is what they evaluate you on, not saying 'effortless' means perfect. But being able to communicate a thorough technical understanding, through narration and what you actually type - it's just a positive signal. The opposite is someone fumbling with the language and logic that they claim to have X yrs of exp with.\n\ne.g. I had a recent assessment where the interviewer provided a web app coding env, basically it ran React and I was to code out some solution, i forget the question. But as I'm working through it and running it there's random errors; but totally valid code. In this case I've kinda shown that I understand the task and can get my ideas out into the editor, and so he kinda brushes it off and just moves me onto the final round. At a high level he could see that I knew what I was doing, I am what my resume says I am, and he'd rather not waste time just debugging env issues. \n\nI got that job, I currently work there.",

Your average interviewer sucks at it, in your 8 years working, how often have you seen people being actually taught how to interview well rather than just being shadowed a few times and then just winging it?\n\nThe interview process is just a cheap method to estimate competency and we do it this way pretty much because we don't know any better way that people agree is effective.\n\nThe only cheat code is straight up asking in advance what the interviews will be about roughly. In many places they will tell you. And that might help with the nerves at least. At my company, for a backend position we do the same system design exercise for everyone. The solution is even spelled out in our company's white paper. In practice, statistically it doesn't really matter whether the candidates know the problem or even one potential solution in advance. \n\nI've done technical interviews for years now and coached many other engineers for it. The bottom line is that interviewing is highly subjective and making it less subjective doesn't really result in better hires overall.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nGood luck!",

No SWE2s at the time (we did pick one up thankfully within a couple weeks).  That first week though I was chatting with the SWE1s and found out they were all industry hires and probably should be close to being promoted.  However when I asked them about career plans what I got back was \"I'm just happy to have a job right now.\"\n\nMorale is not great right now.  The team lost a significant number of people due to regional changes, then layoffs, and then finally PIPs.\n\nThe lower level ICs in general seem to work a bit shorter than a full day compared to most, and when WFH they don't always focus on work stuff (let's be honest I'm guilty of this myself after being off for so long) showing I guess a lack of motivation for the work itself and maybe wanting to get some of their time back on the commute (vs WFH never having a commute).\n\nThey also just seem to show a lack of motivation for learning.  Probably not helped with what feels like lots of rubber stamping of PRs and not truly diving into the underlying issues in code, and just asking AI \"how do I fix this?\".  That being said they do show passion for learning how to get AI to do stuff but to me that feels like the easy way out in a sort of way?\n\nLike, once you know how to do something yourself it's easy to tell if AI has done it correctly or incorrectly.  Asking AI to just do it for you and making sure it builds and the issue is fixed just taught you nothing, and may have introduced another bug that's even harder to find.  Maybe how to better prompt AI to do stuff but even then maybe not because there isn't necessarily a correlation between your prompt working once and it working every time.",

Could have just been the non-tech companies in non-tech cities that I have worked at in my career, but I found it rare to to find people that would actually sit down and teach rather than give you the answer and walk away.\n\nI make sure to always teach when I help people and give you context without them even having to ask.  Though saying that I have found a small set of SWEs that got annoyed with the context and just wanted answers.  Some even got annoyed you didn't let them know the context prior to that point.\n\nLike they just want you to tell them random information that you think they may need to know.  I actually tried that one time and told one of theses SWEs that I just got out a meeting with upper management and they are looking to do X long them.  This SWEs turned it back around on me and was like \"why are you telling me this?\". lol.\n\n> Someone would notice you were stuck and offer a perspective without you having to schedule a meeting.\n\nI find many SWEs don't want unsolicited help today.  It's like they think it makes them look bad or something.  I just look to understand the personalities involved and help the people that want help and shrug when others scoff at me for the unsolicited thoughts.\n\nThis is also harder when working in a remote environment.  You can't exactly tell when somebody is stuck like when everybody is in the office.  I'm not saying everybody needs to RTO, but it's a side effect of working remotely.  If you need help you need to be proactive about it and ask.\n\nI don't know, maybe it's different at tech companies as I have never worked at one.

The leader would read out the ticket, there'd be a little discussion and the floor would be open for anyone to question any aspect of the ticket.  Then we'd do a quick round of Planning Poker.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Planning Poker is a tool in which every \"player\" has a selection of cards marked with the first few Fibonacci numbers: 0,1,3,5,8,13,21.  And they select a card that represents the complexity of the task; changing a word, that's a zero.  Adding more fields to a form might be a three or five, fleshing out some API endpoints, thirteen.  When everyone has bid, they all show their cards - and the leader asks, in a spirit of curiosity not challenge, the lowest and the highest number to justify their bid.\n\nThis would usually result in something like unanimous agreement, and the ticket would be estimated and entered into the backlog for the forthcoming sprint.  But occasionally, there'd be a twinkle in the eye of the most senior coder and we'd find they'd bid extremely high or low and on asking why, they'd explain that they either did something heinous six years ago that would need rewriting or the form autobuilt and just needed an array extending or whatever, and the task would be harder or easier than expected.\n\nOr maybe a junior coder had come up with some new trinket they'd like to incorporate or whatever.\n\nAnd on the occasion the bidder just said \"I think I may have misunderstood\" or \"my attention went\" then everyone takes ten minutes to get coffee and wash their face or whatever brightened them up for the rest of the two hour meeting.\n\nOh, and if the consensus was 21, the leader would generally take the ticket away and chop it up smaller because the complexity was too great for one sprint to easily digest.",

If someone asks me for help and is respectful, I'll gladly talk shop with them all day.

As an experienced engineer I tried to help by letting you know why it's impossible to help some of the current younger engineers due to their attitude..... Aaaaaand the response to that is downvote, name-call, point fingers and basically act entitled.

I mainly use AI to automate the toil I don't enjoy like writing Jira descriptions, generating commit messages, that kind of thing. It's been great for offloading the tedious stuff.\n\nThe issue is leadership wants us using AI/BMAD for everything. Cradle to grave. They want AI mapping out epics, creating subtasks, working those subtasks, then having agents review, approve, merge the code, close the ticket, and iterate. Full loop, minimal human involvement.\n\nI'm all for eliminating toil, but this feels like overcorrection. I already complete a substantial amount of tickets each sprint and get praised for my productivity so it's not like the current approach isn't working. But I'm genuinely worried about my brain starting to atrophy.

Has anyone else run into this kind of pressure? How are you navigating it?\n\nedit: remove the em dashes so people stop calling this AI-generated",

The latter owns a roadmap/wish list that lives in a separate system, and tech leads work with them to decide what gets done, but it doesn't get linked to the tickets, by design, so no one feels the urge to use tickets as a progression mechanism.\n\nThis all stems from the fact that I worked at a _lot_ of companies in hundreds of teams and organizations over the year (yes, that many), and there's literally no correlation between how tickets are handled, and the success of projects. But there IS a correlation between micromanagement from leadership or Product managers, and the _failure_ of projects. We separate the two so that doesn't happen.

The story points were weighted such that one could reasonably close 8-10 1-point tickets/day with no issue, but you might spend a week on a single 3.

Not to mention they didn’t risk their career to save someone’s life if the risk wasn’t worth it.\n\nIt’s been shown over and over again that measuring tickets in development environments always affects user behavior if the company does not invest in the time and resources to have accurate story points or some other measurement of effort assigned to the ticket. Someone changing one line in in the deployment script may have to do way more work testing the new configuration than someone who can push AI to refactor thousands of lines of unit tests.\n\nIf management aren’t willing to measure it or they don’t provides studies or past experiences where produced a positive outcome in their specific scenario then your managers are bad at their job. ",

Officially it was about productivity and standardization, but in practice it felt more like insecurity—trying to make people replaceable, even though everyone knew the systems were not.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, this approach usually does produce short-term efficiency and clean dashboards. The tradeoff shows up later. For personal adjustment, it helps to go along with the process without letting it explode in your own hands. Let AI handle the mechanical work, but deliberately keep ownership of design decisions, edge cases, and the “why” behind the system. That tends to keep people both comfortable now and relevant later.",

      "text": "Context: I (\\~5yoe) have been working on a project, and a colleague is working on another project that is very similar (Python, ML, greenfield) at the same time. They are using AI a lot (90% AI generated probably) while I'm using it a lot less. I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to almost 1 to 1 compare and see where AI is still lacking. In the AI-generated one:\n\n1. Straight up 80% of the input models/dtos have issues.Things are nullable where they shouldn't be, not nullable where they should be, and so many other things. Not very surprising as AI agents lack the broad picture.\n2. There are **a lot** of tests. However, most tests are things like testing that the endpoint fails when some required field is null. Given that the input models have so many issues this means that there are a lot of green tests that are just.. pointless\n3. From the test cases I've read, only 10% or so have left me thinking \"yeah this is a good test case\". IDK if I'm right in feeling that this is a very negative thing, but I feel like the noise level of the tests and the fact that they are asserting the wrong behavior from the start makes me think they have literally negative value for the long term health of this project.\n4. The comment to code ratio of different parts of the project is very funny. Parts dealing with simple CRUD (e.g. receive thing, check saved version, update) have more comments than code, but dense parts containing a lot of maths barely have any. Basically the exact opposite of comment to code ratio I'd expect\n5. Another cliche thing, reinventing wheels. There's a custom implementation for a common thing (imagine in memory caching) that I found an library for after 2mins of googling. Claude likes inventing wheels, not sure I trust what it invents though\n6. It has this weird, defensive coding style. It obsessively type and null checks things, while if it just managed to backtrack the flow a bit it would've realized it didn't need to (pydantic). So many casts and assertions\n7. There's this hard to describe lack of narrative and intent all throughout. When coding myself, or reading code, I expect to see the steps in order, and abstracted in a way that makes sense (for example, router starts with step 1, passes the rest to a well named service, service further breaks down and delegates steps in groups of operations that makes sense. An example would be persistence operations which I'd expect to find grouped together). With AI code there's no sense or rhyme as to why anything is in the place it is, making it very hard to track the flow. Asking claude why it put one thing in the router and why it randomly put another thing in another file seems akin to asking a cloud why it's blowing a certain way.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I'm not the one responsible for fixing or maintaining this project. On the plus side the happy path works, I guess.",

It loves over complicating things and, while it can write a lot of tests it also writes a lot of identical tests that don't actually positively assert the thing they say they're checking.  (It's really bad for this...  Even with careful prompting!)\n\nJust yesterday I had an islands problem in some data, and hoo boy did it screw that one up.  The only good it did was point out that it's just the island problem, and I cracked out the actually good sql statement quick enough.\n\nToday I was trying to run some performance analysis, and it couldn't even do a simple convert from json to csv using powershell.  I mean really?  That's a one-liner.\n\nIt has its uses.  It's good for mundane repetitive things, and when trying to figure out a new-to-me problem it's like search engines before marketing figured out SEO.  Actually useful - a while back I needed to re-project some gis geometry into our coordinates and it got it right away, then when asked it gave me a dozen different well document algorithms to reduce the point density. It was great that day.\n\nFor comments, yup.  It over comments obvious stuff, but some real weird logic?  Nothing.  It's 50/50 on detecting magic numbers when asked to do a comments check, and never adds them on its own.\n\nAlthough for your negative assertions, that is often still worth checking.  You never know what someone else will do in the future, and a call succeeding when it should have failed can lead to bad data states.  Think of an api endpoint that needs, say, an id, but it saves without one.  You now have orphaned data that the integration thinks saved correctly.  I'd test that, because I've seen a lot of people writing integrations that really shouldn't be.",

Sometimes, I've got a really clear understanding of the implementation, its pretty simple, but involves a lot of boiler plate, and I feel comfortable just explaining it all to the agents and then reviewing their work. Other stuff, I'm much more hands on because I'm more mentally engaged with it and/or figuring it out in an exploratory mode.\n\nI also just don't get these weirdos who are so excited to \"code in natural language\" anyways. For a lot of the stuff that I work on, the requirements are very specific, and they are honestly easier to \"explain\" in code than to try to summarize in natural language anyways.

I have a less senior colleague who has been on our team for about 3 years now.\n\nWhile he's generally progressing well on his career path, he seems to have trouble improving on one particular area of his work; specifically, as the title says, he jumps to conclusions quite quickly, and that ends up getting in his own way a lot.\n\nFrequently, he'll start to tackle a task, run into a problem, and then make a bunch of assumptions about the nature of that problem and its solution space, sometimes leading him on hours-long side quests trying to solve an XY problem, when simply taking a bit more time to understand the original problem would have overall have saved him (and sometimes his coworkers) a lot of time.\n\nHe has received feedback on this point repeatedly over multiple years, and I think in theory he knows that he should \"stop and think\" a bit more often, but he's really had trouble building intuition about when the right moments for that are vs. \"just\" trying to solve a problem.\n\nHe's otherwise a solid engineer, has pretty good technical depth and breath, is great at focusing on our customer's needs, etc., so I really want him to be able to make more career progress instead of getting stuck because of this \"one little thing\".\n\nSo ... any ideas? Anybody have had similar coworkers and had success guiding them? Maybe a type of project where they could practice these skills better? Or any resources that talk about this type of problem? I'm grateful for anything!",

          "text": " The big difference I see is in whether or not the developer can name the assumptions they are making. A senior engineer still makes lots and lots of assumptions but we can list them if we take the time to think about it. More junior engineers are making assumptions and they don't even realize it because they don't know what they don't know. They might be tracing a function and see a line of code and their brain just skips it because it looks like garbage to them. \n\nI'd say when you're helping them with a specific issue that they've come to you because they're stuck on, first think about how well they actually understand the fundamentals of what they're looking through. If their understanding is less than 50%, then it's not an assumption problem; it's an understanding problem. Then you can put yourself in their shoes. If you didn't understand how this works, how would you go about building your understanding? Encourage them to do that. It's time-consuming but it was probably time-consuming when you did it too for the first time. \n\nIf their foundational understanding is solid, are they correctly identifying the problem here? You can ask leading questions if they're identifying a second-order problem as the route. There's an assumption that you can challenge for them and help them challenge. The important thing here would probably be to follow up with 'Why do you think you didn't challenge that assumption for yourself in the future? What could you do differently to make sure that you challenge assumptions like these?' \n\nAnd lastly if they're identifying an incorrect solution because of an assumption that they have and the solution has consequences that they've missed. Sometimes it's as simple as forcing them to ask themselves the question. I would phrase this as: How are you thinking through what downstream and upstream effects this solution might have? How might it impact the next time this object is hit or how is the state of this object different than what it was previously? And then of course once they have the solution, closing the loop for them by asking, \"Why do you think you didn't check for the downstream assumptions once you had a solution? What could you do differently next time to make sure that the solution you propose doesn't have other negative effects in the system?\" ",

If you're more like a peer and are genuinely attempting to coach them then I'd try to ask them if they've ever been assessed for ADHD. They may already know be diagnosed but not recognize this pattern. Or you might be putting them on a wild journey of self discovery that they don't even know they need.\n\nBut this sounds like hyper focus gone wrong and if I am right that's why he keeps doing it in spite of coaching.

Other than that if I don’t have any task at the moment, then I lose money off of my salary because I don’t fulfill my hours this month. \n\nNow they are forcing us to work through an app called “Jump” where you connect to a remote machine and they can screen monitor everything. I would be glad to hear opinions on whether I should quit or bear with it (everyone knows its hard to find other job rn), or any opinion about screen monitor dev employees. \n\n",

I still wouldn’t quit without another job lined up though, the market is rough and having a paycheck while you look matters. If it were me, I’d put up with it for now and quietly apply elsewhere. Just sharing, not a silver bullet, but I’ve seen a [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) try a different application route and get some responses, could be worth testing while you’re still employed.",

He told me to wait I ended up waiting for him for the rest of the day.

( I’m not a QA, but I hate doing nothing ) If i was monitored, I wouldn’t be paid, even though this wasn’t my fault and this is not an hourly job.\n\nif you’ve worked enough in this field, you know there are days where you spend most of it waiting for a PM to approve tickets, QA to finish testing, a ticket to be added to the backlog, in meetings or actually doing research on how to use a third party API in reddit but for a non tech person reddit , google seem like you are not actually working\n\ni actually have experienced monitored work before. In my first job, I was paid only for the hours I spent in VS Code. If I was on Google, or anything else ( even Stackoverflow ) , I was considered not working because the person monitoring wasn’t a tech person ( I stayed in that job mainly because I’m from Algeria, a third-world country, and the company was based in Saudi Arabia. The pay was in dollars, so even though it wasnt fair, I was still earning more than the average salary in my country )",

      "text": "Been doing this for 13 years. Wanted to get into because videogames, ended up doing \"boring\" software, but actually enjoying the craft.\n\nI notice (now) that I've been slowly burning up these last years. While some personal issues (which will be finally solved during the vacation I mention on the title) have made things harder, I've been feeling more and jaded of the industry as time has passed and I've come to know the new trends on making software that \"modern companies\" have embraced.\n\nI fucking hate agile. Yeah, yeah, \"how agile is implemented in the places that are doing it wrong.\" Whatever. \"Dailies\" that take half an hour because everyone else is competing to say more things, \"Retros\" that never really lead to actionable changes. Cargo culture meetings where no one listens.\n\nI'm sick and tired of SAFE and their PI plannings. Hours lost on endless discussions over abstract requirements, \"playing poker\", \"selecting t-shirt sizes\" and other stupid ways to basically make the team do what I've always seen as the Team Leader's job of planning something, all to end up with the requirements being slightly wrong, but the blame if we don't get on the bullshit time we made up falling on us.\n\nAlso, I can't bear how all this nonsense (agile-ish and SAFE) only caters to the more extrovert personalities and how most of these meetings where \"collaboration\" is expected are dominated by one or two guys that never. stop. talking.\n\nA few years ago, reaching a similar point to this would have been a signal for jumping ship, but I'm *dreading* start doing interviews again. I can't bring myself to tell a recruiter that \"the current direction the company wants me to move does not align with my interests\", nor trying to show myself as someone interested in technology. Oh, a new Docker version. Groovy. Oh, you use this architecture instead of this other, how interesting. Oh, how could have I lived without the new Java version. Let me take a fucking seat because I'm dizzy.\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that jumping ship, on this economy, will lead me to lower wages and worse conditions.\n\nI don't know. I see other colleagues and they gleefuly engage on all this bullshit, but I feel that I can't keep up with the more \"extroverted\" types discussing that new abstract feature because I lost track of what a \"McGuffingRequestEngager\" is, and before I could ask, they have moved on to something different. What is worse, I feel like I don't give a fuck anymore, that I need to be handheld for most tasks because I don't remember that the McGuffingBO is used to hold orders not processed but also wishlist items. I don't remember when was the last time I could concentrate on something for more than 10 minutes, let alone \"being in the zone\" (our local development environments being awfully slow and hanging continuously doesn't help). I don't remember when was the last time I was confident on a task assigned to me. I don't remember when was the last time I gave a fuck about anything that happened in my company.\n\nSo yeah, besides going to therapy, which is something I'm going back shortly, what the fuck can I do. As I said, I'm on a short vacation to get some other type of shit done. I can't take more vacations shortly, and I need to turn around this and get my shit together, either to look something else or to start giving a shit at my current company.\n\nAny ideas?",

When I don't engage in hobbies or plan out things with my family, not looking forward to anything in particular, I don't even notice how my work becomes the biggest part of my attention: first thing to think about in the morning, then 9 hours of work (lunch time my ass, just an excuse to pay us less), then after work, then before bed. It's awful, especially seeing how my highs are ignored and are not enough, but my lows are always noticed and exemplified.\n\nBut when I can barely think of this shit because I'm excited with my actual life? Fuck me, these corporate drones can tell me anything they want, cry about my performance or speed or how the stupid deadline they should not have set in the first place failed -- anything.\n\nFinances is tough, though. If you're already spending most of what you earn (if not all or more), I can only hope you can sort this out quick and start interviewing. You don't even have to quit, but doing good at interviews and knowing you can quit this company and enjoy a honeymoon with some other does wonders.\n\nAs others said, try coasting if you can. Not sure if you can, though, because dealing with management expectations is probably even harder at your kind of seniority (\"hurr-durr do the thing, nobody else can, pleeeeeeeeease\").\n\nGet on some ARC Raiders. Read a book. Do some art at work for breaks. And good luck. You're more than your job.",

      "text": "Context: we are a WordPress development agency. We build WordPress websites for clients, nothing special.\n\nYesterday, we had a presentation covering all changes being made for 2026. As of this year, we are mandated to use Cursor. Not just that, they also introduced a Figma + Cursor workflow demo and expect us to adopt this workflow as soon as possible. They forecasted that we would be able to cut development cost in half. \n\nEvery single person in the room was on board, except for me. I rarely use AI, apart from maybe writing simple, pure functions, or debugging stuff I don't really care about and just need a pragmatic solution for. Personally, I don't see using AI as something necessarily beneficial. It has its uses, but I just see it as a different way of writing code, which is only 10% of my job. This new workflow however, is really something else. I don't even know what to think about it.\n\nOn the one hand, I hate it. It goes against everything I stand for and everything I think is critical for writing quality software. But on the other hand, we're not *really* writing software, we're just building crappy websites. I'm the only one in my team who is actually an experienced programmer with a passion for it. I do open source in my free time, just not as a profession (mainly because writing good software is generally not important to businesses).\n\nFor this reason, I'm starting to think this way of working might actually be (economically) viable for the company. The Figma demo showed one of our developers building a section of a website in 3 minutes, something that takes an average dev about 4 hours. Yes, it will probably break and be a nightmare to maintain, but I feel the time saved might *actually* make it worthwhile, because our websites really are very simple.\n\nSafe to say, I'm leaving this place as soon as I find something. Pay is good though. I'm just wondering if somebody else is using this exact workflow and can give me some insight on how this will most likely unfold in the long run. I'm genuinely curious, because I believe it might work as much as I don't.",

It's also not clear that time-to-PR is the right thing to measure. After all, you might have a very large project where the total is not the sum of its parts. It could be more, it could be less. But tickets could just be LOC all over again. Depends a lot on the project, and there's a lot of subjectivity involved.\n\nNow of course, I don't want to be moving the goalposts to some unachievable level of expertise, that wouldn't be fair. But I'm also not sure what experimental design would satisfy me, so might as well be honest about that.\n\nYou also gotta ask whether you it is even reasonable to expect a speedup. How many of these 16 RCT devs were actually proficient with the new tools before starting to use them? I wouldn't expect someone new to the tool to immediately see gains.\n\nFor now, I've only got personal experience to go by, from a variety of devs. AI is great for taking the mental load off.

Hire more goons. The goon in step 2 gets promoted\n\n6a. after throwing more money / devs at the problem, we reach \"maturity\" where we have the same useability as before and we get back to step 2.\n\n6b: project gets transferred to a different manager, also interested in empire building by increasing ops. This manager protects this pos project because it guarantees headcount.\n\nEveryone knows this and everyone follows along. Is it like this for other folks in larger tech companies?",

I'm not talking about marketing, sales, legal, design or whatever but rather POs / PMs / TPMs / \"Agile Coaches\" and the like who do not have any engineering background.\n\nIf there isn't sound technical knowledge, which doesn't have to be perfect but should be solid, that person should not be considered for these roles. And people will say that's \"gate keeping\" and yes, it is. I believe teams will be worse and less effective for having low technical excellence and it's a gate you should keep if you want a lean and functional organisation.\n\nI see so much in my current role how team leads can be undermined and put into incredibly awkward situations because of people who don't know their fundamentals and who aren't a clear part of the same reporting line so common expectations can be set from above. It creates far more political game playing and way worse software.",

However, I realize I’m new here and no one really knows me yet. Also I want the senior engineers to drive and own this. \n\nThe current implementation of one of these apps uses a rather niche set of tech. One of the desired goals is to get off that and onto something more widely supported. Another is to address a bunch of shortcomings in logic and observability, consolidate logic spread across several applications. \n\nIn some initial talks with the most knowledgeable senior engineer, they wanted to keep using that stack so that development could go faster, by ostensibly being able to reuse already developed code. This team has been under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things fast, so I get that, but those shortcomings got in there by not being thoughtful about adding features.\n\n  \nSo all this is set up to get some advice on how to convince the team to move to a more supported platform. It will take longer, but if there is an opportunity to improve things, why stick with an already subpar experience?",

It's a mental model from writer G.K. Chesterton, emphasizing that hasty reform without understanding the why behind existing structures can lead to worse outcomes, urging reformers to first discover the original logic before suggesting removal.\n\nDespite the hit or miss mature, this is why I follow this sub. I'm not a stodgy luddite dinosaur, but it is exhausting trying to explain 90% of the problem space, and 90% of the solution space, to someone who is in the process of learning both, while their learning style consists of demanding to switch to the shiny new thing.\n\n(PS: Use postgres, avoid distributed systems, build deterministic software until you can't, prefer libraries over frameworks, when necessary use frameworks that are proven, and use libraries and frameworks in the ways that are intended and solidified by popularity.)",

Looked at the features implemented vs the basics available in newer stacks. Money talks, so it's just a matter of what the money looks like and where it is being wasted.\n\nWhether you're getting the stacks swapped or not, there's usually lots of room for automation and CI/CD.

Maybe see if there's a way to slowly convert it (with language bindings, IPC, whatever it's hard to say from the lack of details) and demonstrate why and how it's better.

However, it comes with one major challenge: you have no power. You are not a manager, you can't dictate what a team should do. If the team lead says no, then the team is not going to follow you. It is something that many people moving beyond the senior engineer don't fully appreciate. \"But, but, I'm even more senior now?\" - \"Sure, but you have no power.\"\n\nYour impact is achieved through influencing. There are broadly two ways you can achieve this:\n\nThe first one is to gain respect. You actually deliver substantial value, contribute impactful ideas and change, make things better, tackle low hanging fruits, roll up your sleeves and ship some code together with a team, etc. You need to build credibility, before people will accept you as a leader. \n\nOr, you can go complain to the VP or CTO, play the political game, convince them that your idea is the right one. They may (or may not) accept it and then mandate it and tell everyone to effin do it what you are saying. \n\nBut landing a new role in a new company and just assuming that people will do what you tell them because you says so (and who says that you are not the one that is wrong?), that is going to burn you out. \n\nAs a side note: many people have died on the hill of tech stack changes and rewrites. Make sure you learn the lessons from decades of software engineering. Worst thing you can do as a new senior joiner, is spending 9 months rewriting a tech stack, and the team has no business value to show for (i.e. shipping a new revenue generating thing), to (from the business point of view) end up in the same place as you were before.

Don’t tell them they are wrong, but explain what change you want to bring about and what the value would be.  Then use examples like ‘if it was like this that situation from last week would have been different and here’s why’.  Encourage them to feed back why they support their architecture or see if they can suggest changes to your ideas that will make them more acceptable.  I find tech people are a lot more likely to buy into an architecture they had a hand in creating.\n\nFor existing projects your senior engineer might be right though!  I find that it’s very often better to stick with what you have and iterate rather than starting again.

It took about two years, and extended beyond my time there (I was one of the drafted-in engineers to expand capacity).  Fortunately the business was privately owned, understanding and had a high revenue burst to support this as well as a market glut of developers - it was basically a perfect storm.\n\nIf your team's already being pushed to get things done \"fast\" (IE, not necessarily with code quality as top priority) and it's resulting in bad code, then adding renovation to the workload is *not* going to improve things.  It's not going to make you popular either.  You might say you aren't there for a popularity contest but that's bravado - unless you have illicit photography or a firearm, \"popularity\" goes with \"political capital\".\n\nYou can probably get it done if it's really important, but you *have* to have to resource to get it done, at the time it's getting done.

But in this case it helps to counteract the bad taste that comes with telling them that you have authority to put things on their priority list.\n\nLearning how to navigate this isn't easy. Sometimes it will result in rising tensions. It helps if your manager backs you up. It really helps to make sure you are surfacing any wins from making the necessary changes. Maybe systems are easier to maintain. A certain project took way less time because the team was able to use the modern stack. Some incidents were quickly resolved due to the improved observability. Try not to be obnoxious, but be very loud with your wins so people don't just question whether any of it matters.",

      "text": "I joined an early-stage startup as a senior/principal-leaning IC. The initial expectation was that I’d take over from another experienced engineer and bring ownership to a chaotic system area (unclear ownership, multiple migrations, overlapping initiatives, no tech leadership set).\n\nMy first ~3 months were spent understanding the system, identifying risks, and writing proposals / vision docs to align the team on its purpose. This was deliberate - alignment felt necessary. I saw this as the way to enable team because I felt they were dependent on senior engineers little too much. \nRecently, the founder gave feedback that this approach was “consultant mode”: the analysis made sense, but execution and customer-facing impact were lacking. Since then, expectations have shifted sharply to fast execution, tight timelines, PoCs, and visible momentum.\n\nI’m now on what I feel is a short PIP (~2 weeks) and being implicitly compared to engineers who have been in the org for a while. I was told to come with a project I want to own and deliver by myself. And It feels like I’m suddenly being evaluated more like a mid-level execution IC than a senior/principal owner, with very little room for mistakes or ramp-up. My ramp tends to be deliberate rather than reactive. I spend time upfront understanding the system and constraints - I do not consider hacking up quickly to be my strongest traits (something I called out during hiring) \n\nI feel the company has only seen people who have been in the org for a while rise to this position. They have not onboarded engineers from outside in this position and they seem to be of the assumption that senior folks should be able to enable themselves quickly on their own.\n\nAnother observation of mine is expectations have increased with the availability of AI. \n\nMy questions:\n- Is this a normal expectation shift in early-stage startups?\n- Is calling alignment/vision work “consultant mode” fair feedback or a red flag?\n- How do you tell the difference between underperformance vs role mismatch when goalposts move this fast?

Yes, the strategic direction is important especially over the long term. But IMO the undertone of this “consultant” feedback is that you are doing a lot of talking and no action. Most people don’t like being told what to do, let alone by the new guy, especially the one who hasn’t actually shipped anything.\n\nI like to do the “junior to staff speedrun” on new teams. Just fix a bug (junior task) on day 1. Then try and take on a feature (mid), then start steering a medium sized project as an IC/project lead (senior). Then you have more credibility to start making strategic calls. Show them you can walk the walk, not just talk.",

You need to be able to adjust, and 3 months is enough for a full rewrite at most startups at that size. \n\n> is “consultant mode” fair feedback or a red flag\n\nBeing honest - it’s fair feedback. It’s a little too slow (and their response is a bit too quick) but remember that they hired you and it’s expensive for them lose you and rehire - 2 weeks is a short period of time, but in a startup it’s enough to make a difference.

Give your manager what they want to see, performative theatrics and all, just to buy yourself some time.

Early startups usually reward shipping and survival over long-term narrative clarity. Vision work tends to matter more once the company has product-market fit or real scale. Before that, impact is often measured by what actually ships, not how well it’s articulated.\n\nAs for underperformance versus role mismatch, from their perspective, role mismatch is just one cause of underperformance. Both can be true at the same time.\n\nThe key takeaway is mindset. In early startups, you’re expected to own outcomes and ensure important work actually ships, whether you do it yourself or delegate it. If that expectation doesn’t match how you work best, it doesn’t mean you’re bad, it means this startup may not be the right fit.

Everything is a tradeoff, what you want to understand is what kind of tradeoffs they want you to be taking (and why).\n\nDiscuss \\*WHY\\* they hired you specifically and how is this relevant to the current situations.

      "text": "I (6 YOE) have joined a company which has recently decided to bring some software development in-house, myself and three others. They also have a R&D team which includes one person who has been writing Python code, including some tools that have made it into production. Please understand that I have nothing against this person when I say that it is impressive how bad their code is considering they have access to ChatGPT. The first tool of theirs that I refactored had whole chunks of code that were never actually executed (unbeknownst to them) and I would place it at a level below a junior dev, more someone who has just started learning Python.\n\nRefactoring their code has been super time consuming, because it involves a full re-write. To try and minimise how painful this is, I have tried to implement some standards that I have asked them to stick to for new projects. Originally these were\n\n1. Use GitLab for version control.  \n\n2. Use our repository templates which enforce ruff chucks (we’re using uv) and a minimum pytest coverage of 70%.\n\nFor context, they have some GitHub experience but only pushing to a repository, not anything to do with branches and code reviews. I have created documents with the exact commands and explanations for concepts such as branching plus taken them through it on multiple calls. \n\nAnyway, to cut a long story short, they continue to develop code locally to extremely poor standards. I have escalated this up to the CTO who is completely on my side, and he has spoken to this R&D person’s manager. Unfortunately, their manager wasn’t happy we were brought in as he feels like we’re stepping on his toes, so he does not enforce the new standards at all. \n\nMy question is, has anyone got any advice at all about how I can win these people over? I am very willing to put in the time to up-skill people, but it is just flat out resistance at every turn. The worst bit is in a call they agree with me, but then they don’t do anything. \n\nApologies slight rant but really would love suggestions. ",

Software engineers do software engineering things. Writing, deploying, maintaining, and being responsible for production systems is a software engineering thing, not an R&D thing.\n\nWhen marking out boundaries, it's very tempting to focus only on the harm others are doing, but you cannot do this. You need to start this conversation by sitting with your manager and possibly the CTO and developing a full understanding of the value of R&D to the org, and in particular the value that this individual brings. Because there's already been friction, you need to lay this on pretty thick. (I mean, in all likelihood, this person actually is invaluable to the business, otherwise they wouldn't be paying him and giving him this kind of leeway in the first place.)\n\nThe goal here is not to limit what any individual or department can do, it's to maximize what the org as a whole can do, and that begins by understanding what everyone's bringing to the table and how best to leverage it. Frankly, this is work your manager and CTO should be doing, but since they seem unable to manage it, you can get the ball rolling.\n\nIn this conversation, you need to explain your own team's value as well, and how you need ownership of your area of responsibility just as R&D requires ownership of the realm they play in. That means you need to control production quality if you're responsible for it. If you can't do that, then you cannot own it either, and you're unwilling to carry the pager for any part of the system R&D is pushing code to. Again, this isn't territorial pissings, you're justifying this by pointing out that it's literally your job description and expertise to maintain these systems, and the org shouldn't *want* R&D doing this work.\n\nAgain, you can't focus the discussion entirely on what's wrong, but you need to also create a happy path. Explain how things should ideally work. Maybe you create a playground env where R&D can do whatever they want and once they've proven out a concept, they can push requirements into your dev process where you'll write code, make sure it's fully tested, deployed in a standard way, etc.\n\nClearly, R&D is hearing your objection as unreasonable, which means they think you are trying to limit what they can do, or you are trying to do their job yourself. You have to really listen to these objections and take them seriously so you can figure out where the disconnect is and assuage those fears. You need to work with them to understand how your teams can work together so you're both able to do your jobs within your own areas and everyone is clear on what the boundaries are and happy with it.",

So when you make an update, their standard was you comment out the line or section you are changing and put your initials and date. If you're making a really big change, you append your initials and date to the file name and make a copy with the new code.\n\nAs an aside, the entire codebase, separate for every customer, lived on a network share that we collaboratively modified, and when thunderstorms rolled through, the director would come out into the bullpen to remind us to \"save often!\"\n\nI know this is entirely unhelpful for your situation, but I ended up starting a competitor and doing sane things. They eventually started using git. And, being in a small industry, we had to integrate with them at one point.\n\nThe developer on their side for the integration effort, when meeting me said, \"I've seen your initials a lot!\"\n\nETA: I could actually start a blog about this company.

It should be zero. The point of R&D is R&D, not Q&A. \n\nSecond, a lot of people who arent experienced devs use things like commented out code for version control (sounds dumb, but that was me too. More people than not are like this.). Let's say the data is backed up. Why should they move to using git? \n\nThird, why does ruff even matter at this point? Ruff is a formatter/linter and does static type checking. Code quality is something you should worry about, not them. \n\nI was that R&D dude that you're talking about and I moved fast. I also created a ton of value. I had a good relationship with the developers and I had strong ties in leadership so I had a lot of leeway. Nothing catastrophic happened. \n\nAt that stage in my life I never used git, I never typed my code, and I didn't care about code quality. I do now. But I dont think I could have said anything to change my mind about it unless I was really convinced that someone was out to help me and not in my hair to enforce some broader organizational principles that I thought were bureaucratic. \n\n\nYour motivations are well meaning, but really, he doesn't care about how to save you time. You need to offer him a value prop about how you can save him time.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, all that matters is the outcomes. That's all leadership sees, that's all the board sees, that's all your customers see. Getting distressed about the process of a different division is only causing yourself needless distress. Also, why aren't you using LLMs to do the code cleanups and basic refactors for you?",

The responsibilities change, but generally speaking, it means that I tend to be assigned to a specific team, but the expectation is that I’m doing IC work that’s broader than the scope of that team. I help with team projects… but I also step out and take a few weeks (or months) to do something to improve things for all engineers at my company. This type of role is usually something that appears at larger companies, because smaller companies don’t need random engineers who wander around making things better.\n\nThere’s a great “4 archetypes of staff Eng” article floating around, and the four are: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand. I’ve done all four, but typically, I tend to be most comfortable as a Solver/Architect — someone who sees arbitrarily large problems that no one else is/can work on, that fall in the gaps between teams. I find them, document them, make the case for why we should solve them, and then get other ICs or even teams moving as I need so that I can solve them.\n\nThere’s “senior” staff engineers, and I have generally realized that I’m not interested in that promotion. The companies I’ve worked at, that step tends to be a much bigger jump into leadership and soft touch, and away from being an IC. I pursued it pretty hard for a few years, but spending time working as a Right Hand / Lead Eng for an org with 50 engineers showed me that I _can_ do it, but don’t really find it very satisfying. I like to stay where the expectation is that I’m coding, but also that I’m doing my own thing.",

Even Meta has those \"coding machines\" ie. people who just develop software, who don't really manage anyone but just churn out a lot of good code in their systems, fixing problems.\n\nI went from a senior quite rapidly into an architect role, and then I took a step back and worked kinda in the senior / staff engineer role in various customer teams and now I'm back to working as an architect. Overall it kinda blurs together. Doesn't matter what the role is. The description and responsibilities also vary quite a lot from company to company.\n\nAfter working around 8 months in this role, I really wish I had less responsibility. I kinda miss just being a programmer, working on the code, not having to deal with user stories, how the team is progressing, communicating our progress to the customer, attending every damn meeting and ceremony, blargh it's exhausting at times.

Some get into Director roles, VP of engineering etc. \n\nCompanies that are larger and are primarily product focused often do have IC ladders that aren’t the management track of manager, senior manager, director, VP etc. \n\nYou as an individual have to be proactively thinking and planning your career if you want to progress beyond Senior dev. and what you want that to look like. For many places, that level is terminal and you never need to promote beyond that again and won’t be expected to. You can just perform at level and won’t get laid off for that.",

Edit, actually all the original members left\n\nSo a team was made to fix everything and for a lot of it, I set up many items from the ground up. Added code to a bunch of different services. Assisted test teams and bunch of other stuff. Slowly, other people were added to the team that used me as a subject matter expert to build more and more. Delivered on time, everything documented a lot better, no big issues. Was in line for a lead position.\n\nSo now that things are bustin and booming with the project completed, a bunch more people came back cause it’s bustin and boomin, some prior subject matter experts and other new people. And then prior experts became leads of the new project because the core system hasn’t changed, it’s just fixed.\n\nAnd for me, it feels like I’ve been little bro’d back into a corner. My responsibilities whittled away and away cause of the new team structure. Now I’m effectively just copy and pasting code from one language to another in one specific area of code.\n\nNot that I’m complaining, it’s just boring.\n\nWent from being able to constantly doing new stuff and learn to just code monkey. Like core member to background character. I’m not considered a subject matter expert anymore either even though I think I know a lot (not off the dome tho, I can figure it out relatively quickly). I have lots of experience with the current system.\n\nIdk, is this normal? Wat I do now\n\nTalks with my manager is all praise so idk why it feels this way",
