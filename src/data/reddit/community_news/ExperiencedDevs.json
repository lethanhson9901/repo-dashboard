      "text": "EM with 10+ years of experience as both an IC/senior engineer and a team lead. This and the other programming and AI subs are making me feel like _either_ the rest of the world is losing its grip on reality, or I already have. Please help me figure out which.\n\nMy team fully adopted Claude Code last year, after some unstructured experimenting with Claude, Cursor, and Copilot. We all agreed having a single \"target environment\" for any \"agent instructions\" we might want to share team wide. We've set about building a shared repo of standalone skills (i.e., skills that aren't coupled to implementation details in our repos), as well as committing skills and \"always-on\" context for our production repositories. We've had Claude generate skills based on our existing runbooks in Confluence, which has also produced some nice scripted solutions to manual runbooks that we probably wouldn't have had time to address in our day-to-day. We've also built, through a combination of AI-generated and human-written effort, documentation on our stack/codebase/architecture, so at this point Claude is able to reliably generate plans and code changes for our mature codebases that are at an acceptable level (roughly that of an upper mid-level engineer) in one shot, allowing us to refine them and think more about architectural improvements instead of patching.\n\nBeyond that, we've started using OpenSpec to steer Claude more deliberately, and when paired with narrowly-focused tickets, we're generating PRs that are a good, human-reviewable length and complexity, and iterating on that quickly. This has allowed us to build a new set of services around our MCP offering in half the time we normally experience. As we encounter new behavior, have new ideas, learn new techniques, etc., we share them with the team in a new weekly meeting just to refine workflows using AI.\n\nMost of our tickets are now (initially) generated using Claude + the Atlassian MCP, and that's allowed us to capture missed requirements up-front. We're using Gemini notes for all our tech meetings, and those are being pulled in as context for this process as well, which takes the mental load of manually taking a note to create a ticket and then remembering to do it with appropriate context off the table entirely. We can focus on the conversation fully instead of splitting focus between Jira-wrangling and the topic at hand. When a conversation goes off the rails, processing the Gemini notes in Claude against the ACs and prior meetings helps steer us back immediately, instead of when we might later have realized our mistake.\n\nThis isn't perfect, as we occasionally get some whacky output, and it occasionally sneaks into PRs. From my perspective as a manager, this is no worse, if it better, than human-generated whacky output, and because our PR review process hasn't had to change, this hasn't been a problem. Most of the team is finding some excitement in automating away long-held annoyances and addressing tech debt that we were never going to be allowed to handle the old-fashioned way. We've also got one teammate who just _does not appreciate_ in AI in general which... I'm not sure what to tell anyone with that attitude at this point. I get that feeling, and it's my job as a manager to coach people through that, but I can't _make_ someone take an interest in a new tool. I'm still working on that.\n\nBut, while it's not perfect, it is _good enough_, in the sense that it's at least as good as the results we got in a pre-AI world (and yes, I hand-wrote this bulleted list):\n\n- Crappy notes if any got taken at all, because dividing your attention is hard\n- Crappy tickets because engineers would rather write code than futz with Jira. See also: defective PM behavior\n- Manually integrating documentation in 15 different systems because engineers want to use Markdown files in GitHub, managers want to use Confluence, some people want to create multiple versions of the same Google Doc even though versioning and tabs are natively supported, and PMs are using a still additional platform that's not even integrated with Jira\n- Documentation or runbooks that didn't get updated until after the incident where they'd have been relevant\n\nBuilding workflows and content with Claude around all this has sped things up to the point that an otherwise overwhelmed team can actually keep up with all of the _words words words_ around the code itself that contribute to making long-term maintenance and big projects a success. You just have to be judicious about how you're building these workflows.\n\n...Meanwhile, half of what I see here is \"slop slop slop\", complaints about managers pushing AI for no good reason, concerns about brain rot, predictions of AI's imminent demise and a utopian future where AI idolaters are run out of the industry because they can't remember how to code by hand and the graybeards are restored to the throne, etc. I hesitate to just say \"skill issue\", but the complaints and concerns here just don't reflect the reality I'm seeing on my team, or peer teams that are similarly engaging with the tools. And we're not even a good company! Leadership sucks and doesn't have any interest in empowering Engineering as a department to improve itself.\n\nAm I missing something? I'm not suggesting this is sustainable, because I can't help but feel like we'll get too good at this and upper management will decide the \"team in a box\" we've built out of skills/context/scripts is all they need, but that's a leadership problem, not an AI problem. But aside from that... maybe you're doing it wrong. Or maybe I'm doing it wrong?\n\nNo AI was involved in this post, except for the time I saved by importing/summarizing my EU colleagues meeting transcripts from before I woke up.",

People on this end are easily convinced by the confident language the models produced.

But I'm willing to trust OP that it's not detrimental to them at least, and the morale boost (even if it is a wash on time) is probably still worth it. \n\nWhat OP is missing is that... Most teams aren't well ran and functional. A few days ago I got out of an all-hands where one of our leaders was trying to convince us to go all in on AI for coding, design, planning, and everything because it'll 10x our velocity. Literally said that - \"10x our velocity\". As the meeting went on it became uncomfortably clear that they're pushing AI in hopes it'll manage to compensate for not having a defined product strategy. AI will not fix that, making us move 10x faster in a random direction isn't going to actually improve things. \n\nThat's what most of us are dealing with.",

That's software design questions like how do we handle migrating to an event based architecture. The vast majority of Devs do not engage with this theoretical discussion, they just want to progress their own work which has a much smaller scope, and they just want to know enough to do that.\n\nHaving AI able to structure my thoughts and translate them into something understandable for those junior Devs is an absolute game changer. I can monologue my mental model and thoughts into a text file with no paragraph breaks or punctuation, get copilot to structure it, and then get copilot to *re*structure it for specific purposes.\n\nFor instance, someone working on data layer fixes needs to know how we handle transactions and concurrency. I can now query my own thoughts, have an LLM read through the documentation I've generated, have it translate it into a form this specific individual will understand, and only share the information they need. All I do is scan through for accuracy and clarity, tweak it a bit, and send off. A project manager needs a ELI5 of some component for the steering committee? I can do that in seconds.\n\nThis only works because I have such an in-depth understanding in the first place, it doesn't replace that. But it means I can very quickly answer very complex questions with almost no thought required, because checking an output is much faster than writing it myself. It also means I can work on more projects at once without burning out, because I just add everything to that monologue and have the LLM load it back into my brain when needed",

Granted, ours is connected to VCS MCPs so it can query code from multiple different repos. It does a reasonable job of understanding how your services interact with each other. If there's holes in its understanding, like with event queues or whatever, they can be plugged with a brief explanation in a CLAUDE.md file that you can commit to your repo.\n\n\nIt's also pretty capable of inferring how to use custom component libraries just by looking at other usages of the components.\n\n\nObviously, you need to check its work. As programmers, we should be used to the garbage-in-garbage-out nature of computers and LLMs are no exception.\n\n\nAnother thing we should know well as programmers is that you shouldn't be doing things manually when a computer can do it better. For example, you should be using (rip)grep effectively instead of randomly browsing files and looking for text. LLMs are terrific for debugging. You can download thousands of log events into a CSV file, and just ask questions about what's going on. Then, you can ask it to show you the specific log events it looked at to corroborate its answers.\n\n\nIt's a powerful tool and engineers at many large companies, including myself, are having success with LLMs. As with any tool, it will take time to figure out how to use it effectively.",

We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. \n\nOdds are, you aren’t creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementation. That makes a feedback loop to the customer. Those edge cases (where a substantial proportion of the work comes from) often don’t get discovered ahead of time.\n\nLLMs are sycophants. They won’t be watching, skeptically, for assumptions that are excluded in coded  conditionals and api calls. They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- it’ll be lgtm’d and shipped. You’re shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write. \n\nAnd that’s not even getting to consider that the requirements no one’s bothered to digest are well written.\n\nI’ve gotten into the habit of tacking “-ai” into google because when I read that top blurb, I’m already influenced to think a certain answer. I can’t imagine how getting flooded with LLM- generated requirements would steer a software project over time. \n\nSlowly, no one will own the requirements, and no one will own the development, but that won’t change that it’s your job on the line when the product is in customers’ hands.",

Caching is the best example: if you don't explicitly tell it to cache something, it won't, and it shouldn't, because there's a _huge_ amount of requirements relating to cache management that can't be figured out without human input.\n\nI recently used AI to build a service that implemented a tiered caching strategy (local disk, then NoSql DB) but the data was sensitive and needed to be client side encrypted before writing to the DB. The data to be cached was also very expensive to generate, so distributed locking was needed for cache population as well. It took a LOT of iterating to get to the final result. \n\nWas that my fault? Absolutely! Because I didn't originally write the gory details of caching into the spec. I just said \"the response should be cached for 24 hours\" and it just generated code for a thread-unsafe in-memory cache. It did what I asked it to do, but it didn't stop to think about how that code would function in a high volume, highly concurrent, distributed environment. Is that also my fault? Probably, because I forgot to include that information in the specs.\n\nAI code is only as good as the requirements you give it, and if you can't think of _all_ of your requirements up front, it'll never generate the code you want.",

Both horizontally scale on K8s.\n\nOkay... I prompted Claude and used my engineering expertise to guide it. Nobody without engineering chops could've done this. But whatever. I directed for about 6 hours and eventually we had a working end to end system that did what I needed it to do.\n\nI created a draft PR and then decided to try rewrite the same feature by hand.\n\nIt took me roughly the same time (actually a little bit less). \n\nThe results was kinda insane to me and has made me a much bigger AI skeptic than I already was.\n\nWhat I thought was \"decent AI\" code was absolute slop. It was creating custom types everywhere rather than reusing them. It had missed endless error checks (it's Golang. It's a best practice to return an error and check the error). I had no real idea of the underlying codebase. When I first checked the draft PR... it kinda looked okay on paper. But once I compared it to the code I wrote myself... it was abundantly obvious how many edge cases you just don't think about when you're not building a mental model by writing a feature up yourself. Prompting does not build the same model and you're relying on AI to try do everything for you: it's not going to happen.\n\nMy takeaway from it was... ALWAYS write the code myself first. And only once completed... use AI as a fresh grad to look over my PR for obvious mistakes. I won't be handing any features to AI in the foreseeable after this experiment.

The cost of inference probably won’t drop fast enough. It might not drop at all given the short lifespan of GPUs. The cost of just keeping things going would exceed the current revenues until new entrants or new factories are spun up to meet demand and that’s like a decades long process due to the proprietary tech behind GPUs and the complexity of manufacturing.\n\nI use AI in parts of my workflow.

Most people will give an afternoon's attempt at a naive implementation and then say it's worthless because they were pretty much ready to drop it from the start \n3. People do not understand that this process requires harnesses and frameworks and processes in place. It's not fire and forget and no one leveraging it successfully is claiming it is. We are not taking about vibe coders. We're talking companies with actual products and architectures using it. Of course you weren't just going to plop the thing in and say \"do a magic!\" And watch beautiful code roll out. \n4. There are legitimate problems with using AI or low-health codebases or codebases that have real limitations on the ability to reduce complexity or produce reliable documentation.  These people have identified a very real boundary of AI\n\nAI gains are not free. Making your AI platform is as much of a product as anything else. \n\nUsing AI is a skill as complex as using any other dev tool. This is a little counterintuitive because it used natural language as an input, but that is not the extent of the depth of interaction there.\n\nNot all codebases are healthy enough to support it realistically. If the cyclomatic complexity is dog crap, if there are no feedback mechanisms (tests, code scans, security gates, etc) for AI to use to see if it is done or not, AI will go off the rails. If dependencies are super non-standard to the point the AI has to load everything in context to reason about it, you have blown your efficient context window just trying to figure out how to use a dependency. Etc etc etc\n\n\nThose projects have no hope of using AI in any substantial way beyond a helper tool, at best. \n\n\n\n\nAnd some people just hate change. Especially java engineers. They will fight against this until Oracle puts AI in the compiler... Then they will talk about how AI was always a best practice. If it's not in java it's a violation of God's will, and then when it finally is, it was always a best practice and java supports it as well as it needs to (despite it looking like a baby mangled by a pitbull in its implementation).",

On a related note, why is that one engineer not adapting? Have you heard their concerns and thoughts, are they completely invalid? Are engineers fully onboard except for that one or are people not free to voice their concerns? The narrative just paints them as rhe annoying dev that refuses to adapt \n3. Many things here just do not match my experience. Gemini meeting transcripts are very hit or miss in my experience, I've found that Claude consistently produces sub-junior level code if used without heavy handholding.\n4. Just the documentation step you've described would've taken months for us. Is the project a greenfield one? \n\n\nEven though I'm skeptical due to the reasons above, if it actually works for you, great!

His company decided to mandate the use of AI by all developers, so everyone was forced to use it. \n\nOne guy was struggling before AI, but now a ticket that might have taken him a week or more would be completed in less than a day. His productivity was seriously accelerated by the addition of AI to his workflow. It's been a force multiplier, and he was able to close five tickets a week where he previously would barely complete a single ticket. \n\nAnother guy, before AI came along, it was hard to keep him busy. He'd close 15-20 tickets a week and still have time free to help others. His code was always flawless and he left everything he touched better than he found it.\n\nAfter developers were required to generate code using AI, his productivity *fell*. It cut his productivity in half. He complained nonstop about the requirement to use AI for everything. He still managed to complete more tickets than the first guy, but it absolutely slowed him down. \n\nI'm pretty sure this is the real divide we're seeing: There is a tremendous range of skill of professional developers. At the low skill end of the spectrum, AI is a strict win. They didn't really understand what they were doing to begin with, and so having an AI that also doesn't understand anything do all their work is an improvement. At the other end of the spectrum, developers know how everything should work, and when AI gets it wrong, which it does frequently, they need to keep massaging the results until it's correct, or they need to just write the code by hand.\n\nThe two guys above are extremes, and most of us are in the middle somewhere. But developers at a company often cluster around similar skill levels: Companies that don't screen for high skill at all will be like OP's company where mostly everyone agrees the code is perfect except for the one guy who is objecting, who might turn out to be the highest skill developer on their team. Other companies have a stricter hiring process and have mostly developers who are already higher productivity than the AI can sustain.\n\nSo we get two kinds of contradictory reports about the effectiveness of AI because AI helps some of us much more than it helps others.",

We have basically unlimited funds for tooling and we're big into data collection for everything possible. We have quarterly dev surveys for all kinds of topics, purely so the tooling teams can get a sense of what people are feeling. I'd say 70% of the engineers answer these surveys, with a large percentage of them giving very detailed feedback since we actually use the surveys to push for new tooling and technologies, so a lot of people are quite vocal.\n\nIt's a large org with many types of people from all walks of life, all working on very different things, so there's a diverse set of opinions always.\n\nThe latest one about 2 weeks ago had a section about AI tooling, specifically agentic coding, IDE tooling, PR/MR bots like CodeRabbit, summarization and note taking tooling, and other categories I'm forgetting. The feedback has been overwhelmingly \"meh\" for pretty much every single category. \n\nI wish I could post the full thing because it's illuminating me on the reality vs what the online hype would lead you to believe, but from where I'm standing it's *at best* a moderately useful tool in some niches, specifically for handling tiny tasks that are not complex, but are annoying to handle manually while being easy to verify.\n\nAnything outside of that window, it hasn't really improved efficiency for anyone all that much. *None* of the teams are getting more done, at least nothing appreciable anyways. We can see from the number of MRs that it's basically as steady as ever. Tickets get closed in the same amount of days as before, projects and epics aren't progressing any faster. The only real noticeable difference is an uptick in documentation like READMEs, ADRs and other things like that which, sure can be nice, but does that really justify the valuations and the crazy bubble we're in?\n\nThat's the gist of many people's problems with LLMs. I think they are undeniably useful for certain applications, and hell from a pure nerd POV it's kind of insane that we can use plain language to talk to our computers, but all of that coolness and semi-usefulness is being propped up by an INSANE hype bubble, all built on lies and deceptive practices, and often outright theft.  \n\nWe're at the point where OpenAI is buying out 40% of *the world's supply of RAM* in order to feed the infinite data centers they want to build. All for a technology that, AT BEST, makes work mildly more convenient in some circumstances. All in exchange for massively increased energy and electricity usage, a MASSIVE financial bubble that will be devastating once popped, bot farms and scammers having the times of their lives, and so much more crap.",

It is not aware of the distinctions and nuances of the individual languages any more than the sample code used to train it, and it would need new training every time a new language version drops.  That second part is what leads to issues as building on a prior model means the prior learning is still there, and eventually if there are many possibilities to the same pseudo code it causes hallucinations, where it can muddle the answer.  \n\nAnd if the AI learns something wrong, well now we really have a problem don't we?",

I build for big enterprises, early startups, traditional data engineering, backend dev, and building agents, work with Claude Code for all of it, and it works very well.\n\nSome reasons I think it works for me:\n\n- Most of my career I've been in small startups (or founded them) and owned everything I did end to end. I was dev, manager, and PM, met with customers (usually internal) to clarify and deliver on their needs. These skillsets are really necessary.\n- Architecture and design >>> keypecking. While I enjoy writing code in flow, more than anything I like to design the major systems and produce an outcome even more.\n- I always have done a lot of upfront work before working on code. My existing workflow fits really well into working with coding agents.\n- It's a tool. You can't (and shouldn't) one-shot most things, ignore the outputs, shirk responsibility for code you push, or think of it as a magical machine god and get good output from it.\n- Communication skills are important. I'm also a writer, and in my days of having to PM and wield all sorts of communication skills to get my work done, so this method of interaction is really aligned with that.\n\nWhy I think people here don't like it?\n\n- A lot of people in the industry and here are used to receiving tickets, coming up with good solutions, and implementing them. There's less interest or experience in bigger-picture work.\n- Didn't take the time to learn the tools. These still have a learning curve, and a lot of people don't have the time or desire to spend time on a tool when they have other deadlines and life stuff. There are techniques, workflows, and more to learn to get the most out of these tools.\n- Had a bad experience with other tools & models. Copilot is hot garbage and always has been, as far as coding models go, Opus 4.5 only came out in the last few months and blows even Sonnet 4.5 out of the water. Non-Anthropic models can barely touch either.\n- Had bad experience with older models. The rate of change happening is mind-boggling. Even just 1 year ago I wouldn't trust an LLM beyond 1-4 lines autocomplete (justifiably). Now? Working on massive codebases is nothing and I can one-shot simple stuff from my phone.\n- Feel threatened. This is entirely natural. I don't think our industry will disappear, but it's going through another sea change, and this is terrifying.",

The test usually gets the shape right but the details wrong, so I take the time to fix this up which saves me time on boilerplate.\n- I ask it to then fix the test. Half the time it spins for a few minutes and figures it out, and the other half the time it gets distracted by some detail so I need to give it my expert input to get it on the right track.\n- I asked it to do some profiling and optimization yesterday and it kept focusing on loading, which was not making any difference. After prodding it to look elsewhere it found a couple of other recursion optimizations which didn't do much for overall time but were technically better. Then it also found a serialization check that when turned off saved 25% of test time. So I guess I'm more confident now that there's no low hanging fruit for optimization.\n- Completely rewrote the documentation for the repo - taking a sloppy human mess and making it organized, and then adding 2x more info on top of that. However, I did need to comb through this because there's a ton of details that are more generic wording than correct in context.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the point of using skills or openspec, but in a few weeks in my spare time I've been able to fix a ton of stuff in this repo that has been neglected for years and years and was never going to get done.

I personally have been a professional dev for twenty-five years. So we have a ton of learned experience from a career of mistakes and lessons learned, changing paradigms, other great devs to learn from, terrible devs to also learn from, etc. So we feel we have a clear idea of what good code smells like and can guide the AIs (mostly Claude) to good outcomes. I personally use it constantly all day now for almost every task. It’s still necessary to roll up our sleeves and hand code things sometimes, but that is getting less and less frequent. \n\nThe real concern is for new devs who don’t have the experience to know what is good and what is slop. What a good decision looks like vs “idk gpt said this”. How do you teach someone what that is, without going through years and years of making mistakes in the trenches, breaking prod, fixing it, etc? How do you teach the average person to guide the models through their iterations, course correct them etc? I don’t have a good answer. \n\nTLDR, I use Claude constantly now and get incredible results because I ~have fine tuned~ am constantly fine-tuning my instructions and know when it’s going off the rails. How do you teach someone how to do this without decades of experience?",

      "text": "You sure have heard it, it has been repeated countless times in the last few weeks, even from some luminaries of the developers world: \"AI coding makes you 10x more productive and if you don't use it you will be left behind\". Sounds ominous right? Well, one of the biggest promoters of AI assisted coding has just put a stop to the hype and FOMO. Anthropic has published a paper that concludes:\n\n\\* There is no significant speed up in development by using AI assisted coding. This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.\n\n\\* AI assisted coding significantly lowers the comprehension of the codebase and impairs developers grow. Developers who rely more on AI perform worst at debugging, conceptual understanding and code reading.\n\nThis seems to contradict the massive push that has occurred in the last weeks, where people are saying that AI speeds them up massively(some claiming a 100x boost) and that there is no downsides to this. Some even claim that they don't read the generated code and that software engineering is dead. Other people advocating this type of AI assisted development says \"You just have to review the generated code\" but it appears that just reviewing the code gives you at best a \"flimsy understanding\" of the codebase, which significantly reduces your ability to debug any problem that arises in the future, and stunts your abilities as a developer and problem solver, without delivering significant efficiency gains.\n\nLink to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245)",

          "text": "Interesting study, thanks for posting. This seems to be a key passage:\n\n>Motivated by the salient setting of AI and software skills, we design a coding task and evaluation around a **relatively new asynchronous Python library** and conduct randomized experiments to understand the impact of AI assistance on task completion time and skill development. We find that using AI assistance to complete tasks that involve this new library resulted in a reduction in the evaluation score by 17% or two grade points (Cohen’s d = 0.738, p = 0.010). Meanwhile, we did not find a statistically significant acceleration incompletion time with AI assistance...\n\n>Through an in-depth qualitative analysis where we watch the screen recordings of every participant in our main study, we explain the lack of AI productivity improvement through the additional time some participants invested in interacting with the AI assistant. Some participants asked up to 15 questions or spent more than 30% of the total available task time on composing queries... We attribute the gains in  skill development of the control group to the process of encountering and subsequently resolving errors independently. We categorize AI interaction behavior into six common patterns and find three AI interaction patterns that best preserve skill development... These three patterns of interaction with AI, which resulted in higher scores in our skill evaluation, involve more cognitive effort and independent thinking (for example, asking for explanations or asking conceptual questions only).\n\nThis study isn't so broad based as to say \"AI is useless\" (other studies find mixed results). But with a new library that's probably not in the LLM's training data, it may not help much. The study does seem to confirm that using an AI means you don't learn as much.\n\nSo it seems to confirm what we already knew: AI is best at re-solving problems that are already solved in its training data, and not so good at solving original problems. If you rely on AI, you don't learn as much as if you did it yourself.",

There is no contradiction between some tasks moving faster and, at the same time, reduction in people's understanding of the corresponding codebase. That's exactly the experience people have been reporting: they're able to jump into unfamiliar codebases and make changes that weren't possible before LLMs. Now, do they actually understand what exactly they're doing? Often not really, unless they're motivated to achieve that and use LLMs for studying the details. But that's exactly what many employers want (or believes that they want) in so many contexts! They don't want people to sink tons of time into understanding each obscure issue, they want people to move fast and cut corners. That's quite against my personal preferences, but that's the reality we can't ignore. \n\nThe big question to me is this: when a lot of your time is spent this way, what is it that you actually become good at and what are some abilities that you're losing over time as some of your neural paths don't get exercised the way they were before? And if that results in an increase in velocity for some tasks, while leaving you less involved, is that what you actually want?\n\nFWIW I think many people are vastly underestimating the value of LLMs as education/co-learning tools and focus on codegen too much. Making a few queries to understand how certain pieces of the codebase are connected without having to go through 5 layers yourself is so fucking brilliant. But again, when you're not doing it yourself, your brain changes and the longer term effects are hard to predict.",

The differences in this AI adoption style correlate with completion time. In Figure 13, we isolate the task completion time and compare how the method of AI adoption affects task completion time and quiz score. Participants in the AI group who directly pasted (n=9) AI code finished the tasks the fastest while participants who manually copied (n=9) AI generated code or used a hybrid of both methods (n=4) finished the task at a speed similar to the control condition (No AI). There was a smaller group of participants in the AI condition who mostly wrote their own code without copying or pasting the generated code (n=4); these participants were relatively fast and demonstrated high proficiency by only asking AI assistant clarification questions. These results demonstrate that only a subset of AI-assisted interactions yielded productivity improvements.\n\n...\n\n> For skill formation, measured by quiz score, there was no notable difference between groups that typed vs directly pasted AI output. This suggests that spending more time manually typing may not yield better conceptual understanding. Cognitive effort may be more important than the raw time spent on completing the task.\n\nLol at the participants who manually typed the AI generated code and did the same (worst) on the Quiz Score metric, as the group who just copy and pasted the code. They also were almost as slow as the no AI control group.\n\nThe group AI (Manual Coding) were the last group mentioned above, who used AI to clarify questions (e.g. documentation). They were almost as fast as the copy and paste AI group, while also having the second best quiz score. That group seems like a more realistic use case, in my experience / domain.",

I wanted to know exactly what they meant by 'competency'.  \n\nWhat they did was they got some novice programmers on a timed webapp that presents leetcode looking interface to solve their programming tasks.  You use python and they provide a library that they created, so you are forced to learn how to use the new library to implement the tasks they set out.  It looks like a simple asyncio wrapper and the questions are like, run some async functions in the correct order that print out \"Hello World\".\n\nThen afterwards they quiz the participants on different types of questions, multiple choice questions about how the library works, code reading questions where they have to answer what the code will do and debugging questions where they ask them to identify a bug in example code.\n\nI can totally see how someone coming into a task like this with AI could come out less competent and I think it's actually a pretty good test.  The most interesting graph to me in the abstract was where they graphed 'ways to use ai' on competency/time axis.  You can see that people using AI iteratively to solve debugging problems scored very low on competency and low on time (took longer).  Whereas people who used it to generate code and then they took time to read it scored still lower on time but the highest on competency.  \n\nSo basically there are different approaches to using AI that offer tradeoffs for competency and time.  All of this is pretty much obvious I think to what experienced people who've used AI would expect but it's nice to see it demonstrated.\n\nAlso I don't put much weight on their findings for negligible speed improvements.  This sort of task is not a good demonstration of speed benefits of AI imo.  Even they point out a significant amount of time wasted just writing the prompts over and over.  Keep in mind, these are novice's that don't even know what async programming is, they are going to suck at prompting because they don't know what to tell the AI to do until they spend time learning.  I bet I spend way more time prompting AI to generate me some CSS than a professional webdev who already knows CSS would.\n\n**TLDR** There are good ways and bad ways to use AI.  Be sure to use the good ways, if you feel like it saves you a bunch of time it probably does.  This test wasn't a great way to gauge professional developer time savings but the competency pitfalls are there and IMO professionals can easily fall for those.",

And when the code base becomes so spaghettified that the agent creates a bug for each fix it produces, and the human has to chip in and understand, shit hits the fan. Also I wouldn't trust that person in design meetings because he has no awareness of the \"nitty gritty\" so he can only talk in high level concepts out of his ass that ignore the reality he isn't aware of. \nPersonally I see more and more code in my company that doesn't align with the design that the people who \"wrote\" claim it follows.\n\nI guess part of the problem is that people equate ai assistants to how high level languages replaced c. You don't need to know c when you work with python, right. But with python, your product is the python code, alongside with your knowledge of the product requirements. With ai assistants, your product is still the python code.

It increased the rate at which teams build MVPs and dramatically slowed down real production grade development, it’s creating a lot of “fatigue” for engineers to review hundreds of lines of spaghetti code and adopt whatever hyped up tool is out there.\n\nObviously if you’re building a “personal project”, now developing APIs and websites has become trivial in the context of a personal project that likely will never make 1 dollar of revenue.

I've been working on it for 2 years already—not a big service. 2 other guys wrote it in 7 months 4 years ago, then it was handed over to my team for maintenance and further development.   \nB: the related UI written in react. It is handcrafted as well, but in a bad way, quite messy..\n\nA few months ago a contractor came to help out. He did some vibe coding, and managers were amazed.. That left me with no choice—I had to pick it up as well. I am using Cursor, licensed from the company.\n\nAnd it does have a multiplier effect, but I think it's because I had time to understand the codebase deeply. In the contractor's PRs, I had to reject a lot of changes because he just wasn't as familiar with the code and took the AI's advice and it would have break other features.\n\nWe actively integrated vibe coding into our workflow, BUT quality and maintenance come first.\n\nIf we have a new feature, we start to vibe code the happy path - usually done in one day and it is great. We use it for getting early feedback (like we figured out that it looks good on the design, but it's hard to use for the user).\n\nAfter this is ready, we still break it into small actionable items and go through it the kinda \"traditional\" way. Because the vibe coded version does work... but the amount of junk it creates is terrible.\n\nSo for me it's funny when I see this \"done in one day\" post on Twitter. I know that the code behind it is an unmaintainable mess.\n\nwent of topic, sorry, my point is: You have to have a good understanding otherwise you just making random changes",

Often we will have a tester that can't test so I will travel a 3-5 hour round trip in a car to our test-field to go test things as well when needed. There isn't a single job I do not do (this is not a startup).\n\nI am finding that trying to find a new job with all this responsibility is extremely difficult.\n\nI had an interview the other day and I basically had to spend two days doing nothing at work so I could try and cram for a system design interview covering things I've never done in my professional career. I don't think the interview went well needless to say and nothing on my team got done as a result of me not being \"on\".\n\nBeyond just not enough time to study (beyond weekends and after work), scheduling interviews is very hard. Even when I think I have free time on my schedule, I will be in an interview and my phone will start ringing with calls to my personal number from team members.\n\nThe amount of noise that I have to filter through on any given day is extraneous and I actually sometimes feel like I might snap but I haven't yet.\n\nAnyone else that has been through this, how did you manage your time and how did you get out?",

Don't try to cram everything, just nail the fundamentals\n\n  \nThe key realization for me was that I was never gonna have perfect conditions to interview, so I had to just accept that some days would be messy and push through it.

OP, you need to realize you actually bear some of the responsibility here for your mental well being. You're letting the company walk over you by picking up all the falling knives. If you're successful at that, why would they change anything?\n\nI've seen it over and over, and I've done it. At first it feels good to \"be the hero\", get accolades.. as time goes on, your work/life balance disappears, your stress skyrockets, it's not sustainable. Then you rage quit, or bring that stress and negativity into work and interactions with others. \n\nUltimately it's not your job to set your priorities, it's your management chain. Your job is to make them understand if they want X then Y will slip. You need a list of what you do, the time it takes, and let them prioritize. If they don't, just let stuff drop and prioritize looking for a new gig. That's what I'd do anyhow. Build up a nice robust emergency fund first, to cover a year+ of expenses, maybe 2 years given the market and the need to decompress after toxic gigs.",

As much as you can don’t answer calls, insist on using your companies chat program for all communication.  Drag your boss into any testing failure or p0, p1 channels for “visibility”.  Use the status to set yourself as “away” with interesting titles like “driving to test area to test vx.y”. FORCE the testers to go to the testing location with you and be there “for the duration”.  Cancel the test if they cannot/will not attend, etc, etc.\n\nAs far as getting a new job use the interviews to figure out what you need to bone up on.  If you don’t know say so. I have hired people who did not know things but who could explain a logical path to getting to the answer. If the company is being “hr lazy” and only depending on automated test suites then consider it as dodging a bullet. \n\nLast time I interviewed I got one of those and when I tried to run it on my home machine with 6 monitors it complained because it only allowed 1 monitor. I ended up with a “manual” person to person interview when I pinged them that their testing suite did not work with my home system.  Now I ended up not pursuing that because their JD said AWS/Google Cloud and what they really meant was Google Cloud and are you aware AWS has something similar? (I was looking for AWS where I could start doing some google cloud or oracle cloud or dreamhost cloud or….)\n\nAs others have said block out time “for heads down work”.

You're stretched so thin that there's no hidden reserve of time or energy to tap into, so something has to give. Block off calendar time under vague meeting titles, turn off your phone during interviews, and accept that deliverables might slip. Your company created this unsustainable situation by letting your team shrink to nothing and piling every role onto you, so they'll have to deal with the consequences when you're less available. The guilt you're feeling is misplaced - this isn't your emergency to solve anymore.",

It's like eating plain white rice and broccoli every meal, but it's not supposed to last forever.\n\nI ended up getting a new role through connections; prioritize your search that way first because employers are still austere in hiring and very picky. Be strategic around juggling your # limit of loops you can handle at a time, and schedule breaks in before you're forced to take one.\n\nI would suggest not to cram everything in all at once: dedicate 10-15 hours of study a week, 5 hours of interviewing/job searching a week, stop most if not all your hobbies, ensure you get 8 hours of sleep a night and buckle in for maybe 5-7 months.\n\nSince interview formats are shifting a lot these days, you're probably going to get your studying in by failing interviews and learning from them. Get lots of rest and keep getting back up!",

This is a pivot from what you usually do, so your team is a bit perplexed. Your direct manager and skip level try to reassure you and sell this as an exciting opportunity.\n\nYou start the work, and your team is not happy. This new project is tedious and out of your wheelhouse in a bad way (think working on outdated or proprietary tech). Everything you were working on before is left to rot in maintenance mode. But boy those higher ups are excited!\n\nHowever despite their excitement, the VPs and C levels don’t actually know what they \\*want\\* beyond the buzzwords and biz-speak. It’s as if they wanted to build a house without the slightest idea of the location or size. \n\nIt’s hard to start building if you don’t know where to lay the foundation, so your team asks questions. A lot of them. The product team is just as confused as you are, and they say they’ll take the questions up the chain. It’s hard to get clear answers from anyone, and sometimes the answers contradict each other based on who you ask.\n\nYou’re going at a normal sprint cadence at this point. Until one day your manager announces that a higher up is actually expecting this done by the end of the quarter. Which is well before the current sprint ends. They apologize, and say that a VP has made a promise to their boss and some info was lost in, basically, a game of telephone.\n\nDozens of non tech folks and management sat around in meetings for months before this, trying to make decisions about this project. When they fail to make meaningful decisions, they pass that ambiguity down to the devs, with a side of time pressure. \n\nSo your team is left doing all the work (on tech that is brand new to you). AND you are chasing people around to get answers, which are all different depending on who you ask.",

When do we need to release this, do we have time to do a sprint 0 and create a roadmap to define the project?\n3. Do we need to accomplish this goal in the specific way that you're asking, or is this a business level goal that could be approached at an architecture level?\n4. Who is owning this project, the delivery, and the maintenance of it for the long term?\n\nIf they cant answer all of these questions at a minimum, or designate someone to figure it out, I'd say there's a bit of a process problem. Usually there's someone that works with leadership to translate what they're asking for into actual defineable and doable work. If thats a product manager, an eng manager, a principal/staff/senior eng, an architect etc, someone needs to be engaged there.

Then a rinky-dink whatever is thrown together, sold a “phase one” of the project, and they get to go back to making vague promises about how incredible phase two will be.\n\nI once explained this to an executive director at a company I worked for. He said, “Yes. Yes, that’s exactly what this project is.”",

Had a house built in the rurals on a budget, went fully remote, and living comfortably. I’m in my early 40s and on track to have my house paid off in the next year or two (by year 5 or 6 on a 30 year mortgage) and will probably be on track to retire by or before 55 barring any unforeseen incidents. I save around 40% of my income or more every month. This is from feeling like I might never be able to retire prior to 2020.\n\nI wouldn’t say I’ve “made it,” but I’m on track and doing better than I ever thought possible, especially given the state of the economy over the course of my career the last 20 years.",

I like to make products successful. I love to make software solutions work. I love to harvest the fruits of year-long efforts that I am able to bring from start to finish. From a small idea to the big thing that changes the lives of many people. It makes me smile on the inside when I'm sitting on the train and see the person next to me use stuff that I've been responsible for. Because I like to make a difference.\n\nThe same goes for leadership. In the early parts of my career, I had terrible bosses (like most people have). Some of them were tyrants. Others were people pleasers. I regard both as wrong. So I went more and more into leadership to give engineers a place that is great to work at. Where people don't burn out but at the same time, it's not about the work itself but about results. Where people who love to learn feel most welcome, while people who want to be stars get continously pushed to the sidelines. Building such an environment and seeing it all work out is again something that motivates me - because like above, it makes a difference to quite some people.\n\nSo what makes me enjoy my job? Mainly that I have the autonomy to do these things as well as the trust from the owners. That I get appreciation for what I do and that it's not taken for granted. And that the products are something that actually matter and are not something immoral or borderline criminal.\n\nIt's all I could have ever asked for.",

Especially with hard problems, my brain wouldn't shut down at night and kept solving the issue. It was exhausting.\n\nDo I enjoy talking? Hell no. I just got more and more accustomed to it up to a point in which I just do what needs to be done and don't think about it anymore\n\nSame goes with leading - I never felt that I should do it, but it became harder to overlook that people were listening to me and following me. That I was able to inspire people\n\nI never was like this stereotypical leader that gives these huge rally speeches where everyone cheers. But more like a translator that is able to give people a sense of purpose, a clarity, an understanding of the world around them. Why sales is doing stuff that they hated. Why nobody ever appeared to listen to their suggestions. Why certain decisions were made.\n\nSo, it just kind of clicked together and even when I tried to stay in engineering roles, within a few months I'd always end up in some kind of leadership position again, either with or without a title. And with time and maturity I accepted it that this was apparently where I would bring more value to an organisation than I ever could as an individual contributor.\n\nSo, as for the 200 people - I'm lucky that I have a good memory - one of the perks of being neuro diverse. And I care about each and every one of them. Think about it: if you are a football fan, how many footballers do you know by name? If you care, would you be able to know at what club they're at? What successes they've had? What they're good and bad at? It's like that. I'm the biggest fan of each and every of our employees. I genuinely believe that most people in management give a rat's arse about people.\n\nOne final thing that just came to mind, where I have the feeling you may have a wrong picture: it's not su much about your own talking. It's about the listening. Everyone can and does talk, but it's harder to just actively listen without thinking of what to reply.",

I should be ecstatic about LLMs doing most of the work these days as it kinda solves my one big weakness, but really I'm just hoping to hold on long enough to hit my FIRE number.  My partner makes more than me and together we have enough to last for a long while (our net worth is probably \\~2 mill or so), but not quite enough to fully retire in a HCOL city (which is a requirement for my wife; I could go fuck off in the mountains forever).\n\nWhat I do now is struggle with figuring out where the puck is going.  Paying rent and financial independece was my number 1 priority in life until my early 30s when even the worst anxiety I could ever have wouldn't convince me that I'm not safe.  I don't really care about tech at all, but it's all I know how to do.  If I were to be laid off, I'd probably take a long break to figure out what I would like to do for the rest of my working life.  It most likely would not be tech-related.",

          "text": "I am from south american country, so we are at a certain disadvantage in terms of income with folks from US or access to companies with huge salaries like FAANG or similar. Still, I worked for several years in my local country. On 2018 I started reading about remote work, it wasn't a thing in my country. I even got a remote offer from an argentinian outsourcing company which at that time I just used to get a salary increase of like $300 extra per month :D . On 2020 I made the decision and accepted an offer from the same company. COVID hit, I got unemployed 4 months later, after being in my local job for more than 4 years and good salary (for my country).\n\nI started studying more other techs (worked with Java at that time), and learned about NodeJS, got certified, got another remote job with a startup as a contractor. Since then I have been hopping a bit between jobs, staying like 2 years in average on each job. Also I have been overemployed a couple of times. That helped me maximize my income a lot. First time I took a second job, I paid off a very small house we were living ($100K of debt off) with my family.\n\nAfter that I became more ambitious and wanted to have a nice home for my kids, with a garden (our \"garden\" in our previous house was a 2mt2 concrete square), a garage where something more than a compact car would fit, bedroom for visitors, etc. So I found a house for a quarter of million USD which here is kind of a luxury, nice neighborhood, etc. That was 3 years ago. Currently I have been overemployed for more than2 years, and I'm striving for getting that second mortage paid off by EOY.\n\nAt the same time I just bought an apartment for investment of $200K which I will start renting, as well as my first house. My goal is to buy another property in a couple of years and strive for paying those mortgages quick by using their rental income plus money I'm generating right now, that would give me around $1M in properties.\n\nI'm not smart engineer, I struggle having kids and family and 2 jobs, juggling everything, but I'm pushing to pull the plug of a second job by EOY, and then relax and enjoy life while building our future. So I can say we have made a lot, thanks to making an extra effort these las 6 years.",

And it's not like they're telling me the work isn't good enough or anything like that, in fact the past two years they secured me $35k in additional bonuses (on top of the 10%/yr we are mostly guaranteed).\n\n\nBut with the pandemic and oh boy the current administration even the fortune 400 company I work for is pretty afraid to increase costs. So now even fewer promotions are given. And the scope of my responsibilities has increased of course, I'm effectively working 2 levels above my pay grade. But I did at least leverage that to offload some responsibility to the more personable developers so I can focus less on hunting people down for meetings and more on the technicals. \n\n\nThe job is too good to give up though. This is the only \"unlimited vacation\" place I've seen that actually honors that, I've been able to take ~6 weeks per year plus the odd day here and there. Permanent work from home, too, since they sold the office space in the state I live in. I've continued to make it clear that it feels pointless to deliver more than I'm expected if I'm never going to either see a real push from my manager to promote me or at least tell me why he isn't. ",

I don’t blame all of them, some have tried to be the one to rock the boat but middle management is all about compliance and being the “collaborative” guy, not the holds his peers accountable adult convos type of guy or gal.\n\nI bring this up because it took me a while to realize it, I was relentlessly trying to look inwards at my work, my projects, my personal life. I was happy with coding, I love what AI brings to the table, the SDLC still feels rewarding. I just cannot unsee the poor decisions that lead to us doing re-work, using poor tools, rebuilding the wheel to not buy a wheel, type activity.",

For context, this is a 'rising-star' project across the entire department and as a result I've received excellent performance reviews. I have been working on this with a junior engineer and another senior engineer for \\~10 months without any issues.\n\nRecently I've had a problem with a new engineer assigned to my team who is 1 level senior to me. They keep doing odd things like:\n\n* Pasting vague one-liner error messages in the group chat, tagging me, and sitting idle until I step in to fix it, then acting like they \"managed\" my contributions (jumping the gun to update my boss, fake-updating comments on my tickets, asking me for updates, etc.)\n* Tagging me about errors emerging from other libraries I don't even own and acting like it's on me to fix them while adding absolutely nothing in terms of diagnostics or a resolution\n* Suggesting tasks on my own project in front of my boss, even though I've already shared my priorities with everyone and manage day to day tasks for the team\n* Refusing to complete any task I request for them to work on, claiming they're busy or that it's out of their scope\n* Publicly faulting me for \"breaking\" code and assigning someone to \"fix\" it for routine coding tasks (e.g. compatibility upgrades with other libraries)\n\nWhen they joined, my boss made it clear that they're only here to assist with additional engineering work as the scope of the project has grown. However I also feel that this is repeatedly being challenged in a way that's not assessed by the engineering merit of this other engineer - but rather their ability to constantly breathe down my neck while i'm elbow deep in real engineering work.\n\nTo clarify, while they contribute some code, none of their code has been significant enough to improve the baseline of the project (code quality, metrics, etc.).\n\nHowever, this engineers song and dance seems to work on my boss, whose concern for my work has genuinely increased since the engineer began their performative management charade. I feel like this senior is undermining the trust my boss has in my ability to perform.\n\nFor those who've been in this situation: how did you handle it? what should I do?",

You already see the signs, and what is happening, if you do nothing you already know what is going to happen.

Being the one that did all the work just leaves you as the person doing all the work if that is all you do.\n\nYou need to shift things back into your favor immediately.  \n- Steer things in the direction that benefits you and the project, you should be meeting with your boss very regularly.  When they see your face they should show very genuine happiness because seeing you equals money and problems getting pulled off their plate!\n- When you see this person make a post, you instantly say where is the required ticket for this, what have you done to fix this, why do we have to keep going over this, please schedule some time on my calendar for coaching and do that in public. It sets the appropriate stage that the person is not actually contributing and wasting time and needs help (yes, you too can play the game too).\n- Random tasks popping up after you have already set priorities and alignment, cut it out right there.  That will need to go into their backlog, and be sure to assign everything they blurt out directly to them with a prompt deadline and add a space on the calendar for review time.\n- You need to work on your dog and pony show skills, the shinny object is you, let's keep it that way.  Make sure you are scheduling regular, and I mean regular meetings and impromptu in-person hey hows it going let's go over such and such thing and let me show you what is coming.  \n- Every time you create and finish something you need to have a very obvious you did this work and make sure everyone knows about this to include your boss and their skip. As you want to be the one their manager talks about as the one getting that cashflow moving.\n- If you do not see the other person performing and staying active call it out, hey so and so you get that code commit in, we are waiting for your feature integration.  Send out the project management email showing their items as past due and red.  Put in your are coaching them, and keep your manager updated on their progress good and bad and add in all concerns you are seeing.\n\nDo the above and you can flip this boat back over, some of it is harsh but you have to play the game or you get screwed.  Don't believe me, come back in 3-6 months and tell us things are now being led by this guy and their new promotion. Never let a random take your drivers seat especially when you have built 80% of the product. They are actively sabotaging you and wanting to claim your work for their fame and use it to get bonuses, promotions, and other kudos irregardless of how sickening their behavior is.  You will need to intervene professionally as I have listed above or your project and work becomes their work.  Staying passive, and nice will only hurt you in the end. You need to be active and kind to win in your situation.\n\nIf you need further help with this mess ask away, control your narrative or someone else will.",

Then engage in mentoring existing large projects owners like this and do meaningful contributions that move the needle.  Then when you do this successfully those that you help, especially at the senior will normally return the favor to help you with you're even larger projects that will help both of you succeed.\n\nAlso note just because someone shows very passionate, and experienced thoughtful replies to real world issues based on actual experience doesn't mean it's coming from a bot, but an actual person that has experience in the subject matter.

Here is my high level summary and take on this paper.\n\nTLDR: Nothing surprising, learning through struggle without AI is best way to learn. Asking AI probing question the next best way. Copy pasting error message and asking AI to fix it is the worst and slowest way to learn new things.\n\nSample size - **52**  \nLanguage - Python - [**Trio**](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (async programming library)  \nNature of study - **Randomized Control Trial** \\- Treatment group and Control group  \nNature of task: Asynchronous programming, Error handling, Co-routines, asynchronous context managers, Sequential vs concurrent execution\n\nLow scoring groups:\n\n* **AI delegation** (*n*=4): Used AI for everything They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process. Faster group but performed the worst in quiz\n* **Progressive AI reliance** (*n*=4): Asked one or two questions but eventually used AI for everything. They scored poorly on the quiz.\n* **Iterative AI debugging** (*n*=4): Use AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly and were also slowest.\n\nHigh scoring groups:\n\n* **Generation-then-comprehension** (*n*=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. Then asked the AI follow-up questions to improve understanding. They were slow but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. **Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.**\n* **Hybrid code-explanation** (*n*=3): Asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.\n* **Conceptual inquiry** (*n*=7): Only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Encountered many errors, but resolved them independently. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.",

You cannot use AI effectively. You will be stuck in a blind leading a blind situation. You will have to accept whatever AI give you because you don't know any better.",

Directing AI implement some CRUD APIs or add some new pages to a react app is probably going to be quite a bit faster than just typing it all out.  I doubt you'd have to spend much time fighting the prompt either when you already know what you're trying to do anyways.\n\nBasically, if you don't know what you're doing, VIBE coding your way to a product is a bad idea because your competency will be low and productivity will suck because you spend a lot of time re-prompting to get the AI to do what you want.  \n\nThis has been my experience too having AI do some react and CSS work for me when I have to google every single CSS property because I have almost no idea what any of them mean.  I spent a lot of time copy/pasting the final result and telling it how it's wrong, having AI try again and then re-prompting.  I imagine someone who actually knew CSS or what they were doing could just fix it themselves or more precisely direct the AI to implement the correct solution.",

The products are designed to make reviewing and learning harder than they should and could be, even though the companies making them will admit these are the responsible ways of using their products. Somewhat similar to petroleum companies funding plastic recycling programs which don't work, but absolutely shift the responsibility to the public while earning them green-washing credits.\n\nSo we're left with semi-usable hyped-up products of a much more interesting underlying technology with good use-cases. Causing actual harm on many aspects of life. Changing the way we learn and know things by the corporate agenda of creating dependency over usefulness. With rising costs even before the big \"switch\" happens from the \"bait-and-switch\" these companies are basing their business model on. With us left to use said products with discipline which most humans do not possess, especially not over time. With the best case scenario being these products succeed in being integrated everywhere to be too big to fail while so we can create another social class of have-nots.\n\nTL;DR - the technology is very different from the products. The conflation of the two serves the corporations invested in it. While the technology is interesting and has use-cases, the products' use-cases are incidental and temporary while they are designed to achieve a different set of goals.",

      "text": "I have a long-time coworker who can be difficult.  Very smart guy, but when stressed he gets angry and often lashes out by being overly critical, nitpicking, and bitching about coworkers.  He expects others to \"just know\" things they could not possibly have known and to remember everything they've ever been told.\n\nMost mornings I come in to 5-10 Slack messages on a variety of topics.  Some are actually important.  Others are pointing out some super minor thing which could've been done better.  It's as if he has no ability to decide *not* to point out some minor flaw or sub-optimal code when it doesn't matter.  I then get more of these messages throughout the day.\n\nFor example, he recently chatted me complaining that a coworker had refactored something to `if (x > y || x === y)`, complaining that they could've just done `if (x >= y)`.  This is of course true, but in my opinion it warrants zero attention.  If it bothers you that much, just clean it up later.\n\nHe just can't help but get in jabs and snark at every opportunity.  It's much worse when he's stressed, and that is often.  I think he has a need to prove how smart he is despite being like fifty years old.  He is important to the company.  If he weren't, I think he might've been let go a long time ago.\n\n**How do you guys deal with someone like this?**  I don't want to make waves, but this guy is negatively affecting my quality of life and enjoyment of the job.  I realize this isn't strictly related to software engineering, but I imagine this isn't exactly uncommon in our field.  Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n**EDIT:** Many thanks to those of you who gave thoughtful replies.  To the rest of you, please decide amongst yourselves what color to paint the new bike shed.",

Only reply to things you want to engage with and conveniently fail to notice the other parts. If you care about this coworker and want to help them, then I recommend trying to have a direct conversation about it.\n\nI was doing it because I cared about the job and wanted things to be better and found it frustrating that the things I wanted to prioritize weren't important to management. I thought other people felt the same way and sought validation. Some people responded with validation and their own remarks. Others did initially while others did not at all. I kept sending those things to the people who did engage and stopped sending them to the ones who didn't.\n\nYears later I finally noticed the pattern of people getting weirdly not responsive and bosses criticizing my demeanor and made the connection, but too late for my reputation and relationships.\n\nWhat would have helped me is someone pulling me aside and explaining that no matter how I felt about it or what I meant by it, the way people perceive it is as you describe. It's unwelcome negativity that they don't want to engage with. Finding ways to channel those thoughts and turn them into something people want to hear is the best way forward from an office politics perspective. If they can't be reached on that or say they don't care then they aren't ready to learn (and may never be).",

Other times, he will ping me hours later and ask for a followup.  \"Any opinion on this?\" or similar.  It feels confrontational or critical to say, \"I agree/disagree, but I don't think this is a big enough deal to warrant any attention.\"\n\nI'm not sure I feel it's my place to pull him aside and tell him that his negativity is unwelcome.

I.e., if you validate him, will he then go and comment on whatever it is and ask for changes? Or will he do that anyway, regardless of your validation? \n\nThe non-confrontational/critical response is, imo, tell him \"pick your battles.\" 50s is a late time for him to learn that lesson but maybe if he hears it straight out...\n\n> I'm not sure I feel it's my place to pull him aside and tell him that his negativity is unwelcome. That seems like my boss's job.\n\neh, I mean. It's your ears. What he's complaining about doesn't seem integral to the company or anyone's job function or anything actually getting done, he's using you as a vent-box. Worse, a vent-box for inconsequential nitpicking. \n\nYou don't have to tolerate that and it is entirely your place to put your foot down and say (in nicer words, probably) that this is negatively affecting you and you need space. \n\nAnd if that doesn't work... then it is very much your boss's problem if you are leaving this job due to the negative nancy. Maybe the company will learn (or maybe not) if it loses several engineers in a row and holds onto the important-but-tough-to-tolerate human. Personally I have seen at least one instance where someone who completely tanked team morale with lack of empathy coupled with negative charisma was let go, it's a possibility.\n\nYou have infinite patience, seems. I would have stopped responding a long time ago and \"Any opinion on this?\" would've gotten a flat \"no\" a couple times, followed by \"no, I am ambivalent, go away\" (nicer words, but same sentiment).",

Do you mean you don’t have the authority to do this, or do you think that it should be someone else’s responsibility?\n\nBecause truth be told at the end of the day it’s your life, your peace, and your relationship with the person. I doubt anyone is going to manage it for you, and the first step in resolving that work relationship is being direct. I personally wouldn’t hope to wait for someone to fight my battles for me so to speak. \n\nIt’s possible he responds to it negatively. But to be honest the idea of him responding to it negatively is probably worse than it would be in reality. If you are simply direct, there is no ambiguity about how you’re interpreting his intent, and to be frank it simplifies how you interact with him in the future. Once you’ve tried a genuine attempt to address it, if his outlook is negative it becomes quite literally your boss’s job. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries for communication around your job. If it’s negatively impacting you, it’s bad for the company. There’s nothing wrong with expressing that sentiment. And if you cannot get support from your boss after expressing that respectfully, then the company is failing you at that point. \n\nI don’t want to be reductive but it really is as simple as “hey man, I’ve gotta be honest - sometimes you ask my opinions on details that I’m super not invested in. I get you are passionate and care about the details, but sometimes it comes off as a little negative. I have a lot on my plate and it can be a little overwhelming. If you could, give me a little space if it’s not critical to the sprint or easily resolved without my input. Thanks for trying to be open with me on how you feel, though”.",

Let's address these issues at a later time\" then immediately disengage.\n\nI have people like this in my family: the emotion, the fear and feeling of losing control, then the lashing out at whoever around them they think will take it. It's toxic, but you can't fight back like most bullying: you need to stay calm, not get give them the reaction they are looking, and disengage when you risk elevating. When you engage emotionally, or fire back that brilliant zinger you could only have thought of 5 mins later, it gives them the justification that rewards the behavior: \"see? this is a problem\" and continues the loop.\n\nYou never, ever, want to let an idiot drag you into the mud. They beat you with experience and then you're covered in mud. For instance, if you get 5 slack message when you turn on slack, only respond to the ones you actually need to respond to. Let the unimportant ones go without a response.\n\nFinally, and this is the trickiest/hardest thing, you need to consider bringing in a manager to curtail the worst of the behavior. Document instances where your co-worker is making people uncomfortable, where they are acting in a way that goes against team interests, when they are degrading teammates to multiple people, et cetera. Then, bring it up softly with a manager in a 1v1, \"the project is going well, but I'm having difficulties dealing with X, I was wondering if you could help me navigate the situation\". If/when they bite, hit 'em with the receipts, but frame it as \"I'm having difficulty dealing with this, here's what I did, what do you think?\".\n\nBringing problems to management works best not as a complaint, but when it's a problem that threatens the productivity or good management of the team only they can solve.\n\nFinally, if you have the instinct to \"fix this guy\", my experience with that is very, very poor. This is an issue of emotional processing, regulation, and impulse. That's a therapy \"examine your life\" and \"learn coping strategies\", but it's also way outside the corporate bounds for a teammate. **Treat them like they'll never change, contain the blast radius, and build the case for management to solve.**",

It takes twice the effort to understand every single fucking minor thing and I'm running out of fucks to give.\n\nAnother shit it does all the time is `let x; if (y) { x = z }`. And then `x` ends up mutating 700 lines later so anything you do in that function potentially breaks everything, not to mention you really don't need to see the actual glyphs performing the condition and whatever in that random scope. Just fucking make a function, holy shit. And use guard clauses (aka early returns).\n\nAnyway, I wish I worked with people with a culture of self-improvement like your coworker instead of a culture of incompetence like most places I've been.",

I think software development culture can be a bit emotionally mute at times, or attracts those sorts of personalities (you can see it in this comment section even), but someone being a snarky asshole, even if they're a correct asshole, is just pain miserable to deal with. It's not necessarily to create the change they want, and it has serious morale cost.\n\nI can tell you how I usually handle this OP. This assumes the individual is very snarky, talking bad about other devs to me regularly, **they have real power while I am disposable**, and most importantly **I absolutely do not trust them with a direct adult conversation on it**. Oh, and also I feel like I've built up some rapport/good will with this person. These are the types of things I'd say to them, usually using humor/suggestion to indirectly say something to them:  \n  \n**1)** If I think I can sort of \"solve their problem\" and thus get them to shut up about it, I will half suggest it innocently, while validating their frustrations. Ex:\n\n*\"You ever thought about using a linter? We had one at another job, it'd often flag stuff like this, could save us the headache\".* Maybe something else like *\"I know we use contractors so it feels like we can't trust their code either... seriously, this is what linters are made for, haha.\"*\n\nBonus points if you act unsure about it, they'll convince themselves it was their idea to actually lock it in, which will make them more likely to go for it.\n\n**2)** If I don't like the disrespectful way they're talking about our mutual coworkers, especially behind their back:\n\n*\"What's this? Another roasting of \\[coworker\\]'s code for breakfast?* 👀*sometimes I wonder who you go to about my mistakes\"*  (Gameplan: Imply that I see him fundamentally as someone who talks crap about people behind their backs)\n\n*\"Lol I feel like the editor to your pull request feedback\"* (a) You should be putting these in a PR, not to me. b) You do this a lot and I'm calling out the pattern.)\n\n*\"Maybe we should be calling this stuff out in the dev channel? It could be useful feedback for the other devs to see\"* (Gameplan: trick him into openly showing his hostility to where upper management can see it and turn others against him. Or get him to basically admit he's not willing to say things like this in front of others because he knows he's being a jerk)\n\n**3)** I find it annoying/tiring:  \nVery limited responses/disengage. Just responding with 👀 or 🪦 to each of their DMs they send me.",

      "text": "I’m a relatively new tech lead (2 years). I’ve been programming \\~14 years, professionally \\~9. On past projects I’ve led small teams successfully and had good relationships with clients and stakeholders.\n\nI’m now leading a new project for a large client. Team is 5 devs (including me). I’m running into a pattern with two developers that is making delivery and team coordination difficult:\n\n* Dev A (\\~10 YOE) is very strict about process and refuses to pick up work unless the task is documented to a certain standard, even for small changes. He debates most requests and decisions, and frequently escalates disagreements to our CDO instead of discussing with me first.\n* Dev B (\\~4 YOE) initially collaborated well, but over the last \\~5 months has started mirroring Dev A’s behavior: pushing back on many decisions and also escalating to the CDO/PM without raising concerns with me first.\n\nA few concrete examples:\n\n1. **CI quality push / fixing backlog** I added additional automated checks to CI and it surfaced \\~100 minor issues on main (small style/typing/lint-level problems). I asked the team to spend \\~1 hour at the start of the day to clear them so we can keep main clean.\n\n* Dev A refused.\n* Dev B said “ok” but didn’t participate, then complained to PM/CDO that it was wasted time. The rest of us cleared it in \\~1 hour.\n\n1. **TypeScript organization convention** Coming from C++ I suggested we keep types/interfaces in dedicated files separate from runtime logic (types-only file + logic file). I thought it was a small convention preference. Dev B escalated to the CDO saying this approach is “bad” and makes the codebase hard for others to understand. He didn’t raise it with me first.\n2. **Delivery crunch / visibility** During a sensitive delivery period, Dev A and Dev B didn’t push WIP or give end-of-day status updates. I needed to assemble a demo/status for the PM and asked for EOD updates + more frequent progress updates given the timeline. This also got escalated, and turned into a larger meeting with the CDO.\n3. **Constant debate slows delegation** With Dev A, nearly every task or PR comment becomes a debate, to the point where I’ve started avoiding delegating to him and end up fixing issues myself to keep momentum (not sustainable). This pattern was discussed in a recent team + CDO conversation, but I’m not confident it will change.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand / get advice on:\n\n* Is this level of skip-level escalation and refusal to execute reasonable lead direction “normal,” or is it a clear team/process problem?\n* What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n* What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n* In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n* Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nContext: Dev A has \\~10 YOE, Dev B has \\~4. We’re under delivery pressure, and the repeated escalation is creating thrash and eroding trust.\n\nHow would you handle this, both short-term (deliver) and long-term (team norms)?",

But most things aren't an emergency. In those cases he takes the time to solicit opinions from people who are likely to have a valid opinion. He might change his own opinion based on the feedback from others and consistently makes excellent, collaborative and well-informed decisions. His team always feels like they were included, consulted and considered, even if the decision ultimately doesn't go their way.\n\nIt sounds strange but ST:TNG gives a subtle masterclass in effective leadership.\n\nWhat you're on the brink of encountering is \"strategic silence\". Strategic silence is when your top contributors realize that their opinions are never heard or considered, their ideas are discarded.  Rather than being rewarded for their independent genius and experience, they will come to understand that they will be rewarded and succeed at the company by just doing whatever they are told. You will end up with a team of code monkeys who will never go out of their way to do anything proactive, and the top people who are actual geniuses will leave.\n\nEdit: my entire professional leadership life has been guided by WWPD: What would Picard do?",

When I change things, they often go through a review process, which required participation from the team. To avoid my juniors rubber stamping my changes assuming that I know better, I would often book some time to do mob reviews/knowledge sharing to explain my rationale. It helped a lot that we had a dynamic where everyone felt comfortable to speak up, and raise concerns to my face.

In my first job I had a coworker who used a linter to detect style issues then left 100 comments like \"please fix indentation\", \"please remove this blank line\", \"please fix whitespace\".  Can you imagine my frustration?  \n\nIf something can be automatically linted, it can be automatically corrected.  Instead of forcing your team to manually fix these issues, you should have gotten team buy-in on an automatic, in-editor linter.\n\nFor the other issues, it's harder to tell who's the one being difficult. If you're just going in and changing someone's PRs because you don't agree with coding style or something, that's asshole behavior. But constantly debating your PR comments is also not good behavior.  You should have, early on, when this behavior first started, opened up a conversation about Code Review conventions that you could all agree to follow. There's lots of good writing about this online. Solicit your team's input about code review processes. Make them part of the decision making. Share some reading. Consider your own tone in the comments - are you telling people they're wrong, or starting a conversation about the best approach?  Etc. \n\nShort summary, you're leading a team, not driving a fleet of computers.  Treat it like a team. Don't force top down decisions unless you absolutely have to, and if you do have to, find ways to soften the impact (like introducing an automated linter instead of making them clean things up manually)",

This is an ask from me. Not a mandate. If they give the extra effort - i will reward them. But i will not speak as if it’s expected. \n\nOften, crunch time exists due to bad management. How would you know if it’s bad management? - if it happens often. The fact that it happens often and you still have not figured out how to manage it is bad management \n\n> * What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n\nIt’s already a power struggle whether you like it or not. But you need a way for them to speak out their concerns. That happens in retrospectives and 1on1s. Without a safe space to do so, minor annoyances can build up to resentments. What starts out as professional differences can end up very personal\n\n> * In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n\nAll of those you mentioned works. But for this case, i feel 1on1s are the best move for you because i dont think you know where they are coming from. What are their goals and motivations? What do they not like and avoid? Can you work with those and align them to the company goals? Or do you need to manage them out?\n\n> * Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nThey sound reasonable. But given enough context, they may not be. \n\nBut i think the issue is more than that. If i’d have to guess given the limited info, i’d say you’re a boss not a leader. \n\n> How would you handle this, both short-term (deliver) and long-term (team norms)?\n\nKnow your people. Know why they’re pushing back. \n\nThis is political. By default, you have authority over them. But for whatever reason, you lost it fast. Now, you have to regain it.\n\nBut dont worry, politics is not as bad as most people think. It just starts as actually caring about your people and not being an asshole. If you can do that, you need to align their goals with the company. If you can do that, people will thank you for it and you’d have an easier life.",

No. It’s not. But you are new, and as others pointed out, you’re trying to do “little minor wins” when the aren’t the priority. Document the issues for when it is not crunch time. Encourage linting the files that are changed in a PR. Great that you got a bunch of developers to focus on busy work for your little win - but that’s not a win for your team, it’s a win for you. \n\n_Pick your battles._ it reads a lot like you are trying to establish yourself and not recognize you are (potentially) pissing people off instead of listening to them (we are forced to make assumptions here, in regards to your attitude/presentation, to your coworkers, so it’s absolutely possible I am off-base!)\n\n•\t⁠What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n\nIf my lead is an asshole - I would have zero concern escalating. Especially if they argue minor technical fixes being a big enough priority of other work during a technical time crunch. Again - fix what you can on your current task (running a linter), or add it to the backlog for when your team has a slow period in the year to hit some maintenance (usually around the holidays, at most places I have worked, YMMV)\n\n•\t⁠What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n\nThis goes back into not knowing you/your team. We have one-side of this. I’d take this to your CDO and ask them how you can improve yourself and your relationship, and seek some critical feedback, and NOT take it personal. Listen, reflect, plan with your CDO and/or team until you all are on the same page. \n\n\n•\t⁠In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n\nI’m torn on this, because it feels like “I’m trying to build my fiefdom” and less “trying to make business impact.” Again, the problem _may be you_ so throwing more meetings on a calendar will not make your devs more likely to understand you or not be irritated. \n\n•\t⁠Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nA lot of these are _nice to haves_ and also can be incredibly productive. BUT there is a time and a place, and you’re coming in late. You said “we knocked it off in an hour” without those two devs. That’s still a win, so instead of “I wanted EVERYONE to focus on this” you could’ve presented “I would like to hammer this out soon, if anyone had a moment” and get a group that is interested in doing the work. \n\nThen those devs that want to focus on their work? They can focus on it. Devs that want to focus on linting/maybe learning something? They can volunteer for it. \n\nMaybe you knock it out in an hour, maybe a couple days of one hour morning lint sessions. But this way, it’s less abrasive. \n\nI feel like you WANT to be a leader, but you’re still figuring out how to lead _the team you have._ You want them to be a certain way, instead of playing the hand you are dealt. Welcome to leadership - you need to work on compromise, communication, and recognizing that if people have a problem with you, it’s a learning moment for you to either “be more firm” or recognize “time and a place, focus on battles you can.”\n\nJust my two cents.",

Also, you randomly time-boxed the exercise ? It sounds like you got in the way there more than you helped. You could have done this far better by saying \"Hey folks, I've managed to strap together a little CI improvement so next week I want us all to carve out the morning on Thursday to address some of the issues. Some of them you will think are non-issues, which is fine, I just want to adjust our linter to follow some more idiomatic practices. I'll of course be helping and I've already fixed some of the issues. It lives in this branch which I've made a draft PR of here if you want to see it before Thursday.\"  In my example, I don't assign work to anyone that I am not willing to do myself. I didn't say you have 60 minutes I said something more vague, the morning. If someone asked how long I would have said \"well, I'm willing to spend an hour or two on it, do what you are comfortable with\".    \n     \n - The organising types into files thing is small potatoes and from the sounds of it you did not pick up on the team resenting you for putting crap on their plate, so they just saw that as yet another fuck you / my way or the highway from the team lead. The fact that he didn't raise it with you in my head, it's probably your fault. You should be going out of your way to make yourself approachable and it doesn't sound like you have done much to win over the hearts and minds of your team members.\n     \n - Regarding the delivery crunch, you should have pushed back against that. EOD updates is unreasonable if there is already a standup. It can help but again, judging by the communication style you have put across here I would not be surprised if you messed that up.\n     \n - The constant debate from Dev A is just him rejecting you based on demonstrably poor leadership skills. You are acting more like a boss than a leader based on your examples.    \n    \n\nTo answer your questions:    \n     \n - Escalation to skip level is normal when the regular is failing    \n - The skip level should be the one instructing the team to raise it with you first    \n - Try to truly understand where people are coming from, and don't try and smear your way of doing things over everything. Find items that are provably upgrades from the status quo and do those first. Thank your team for their efforts, shower them with praise. Doing so will build up capital that you can expend when you find a hill worth dying on.    \n - If you are supposed to be managing these people, you should be having one to one meetings regularly, you should try to understand them as people first and from there you try to insert yourself as a mentor.    \n - Honestly none of the things you want to do are bad. You have just wrapped them in an attitude that does not jive with your team. You should have spent your first few months figuring out who those fiery personalities are, setting expectations with your manager, and then after you have some wins under your belt, you start influencing the direction. Technical orgs are not a democracy but if you don't include people more you end up where you are.",

You want the devs to do all this productive work without assigning points to it...You'll make devs look bad for taking 10-20% longer to complete all the tickets that actually do exist.\n\nWhy would they discuss it with you when you're the one skipping the processes that let other people (eg CDO) know about what you're asking and how long it will take to complete?\n\nIf there were a ticket they could at least raise issues with the work formally and in the open, but instead you want them to do it all privately directly with you?

QA env (whatever they do, it's a mystery!)\n4. staging mirrored as closely as possible to prod, for testing non-code things as well (network/infra upgrades etc)\n5. prod A+B ideally with ability to upgrade one side, test it without making live, then flip to it\n6. If required a dedicated UAT, otherwise it just gets stuffed into other envs and causes friction\n\nIt's also beneficial to have other on-demand envs like stress testing, regression test testing, a process to anonymize prod data for replicating issues outside of prod.\n\nIn reality most shops I've been at just have dev and prod and it's a nightmare.",

This is a company that has doubled or tripled in size in the past year. Is that a red flag for my job stability if I join this company? Or is there a chance their process actually was too lenient before and they were just letting a lot of incompetent people in during a hyper growth phase.\n\nEdit: Updating to add more context. I don't know exactly how fast they fired, it might have been 3-6 months not 1-3 months, I was just guesstimating. The person did say that the managers would ask them all what's going on and try to work with them first. Also, this company didn't even have an engineering department at all a year ago, they went to like 100 engineers in like a year, and it sounds like they have since made their interview process tougher and more thorough and it's not as much of a problem as it used to be.",

They hired new ICs at various levels, tech leads, new managers, new head of engineering, plus probably new PMs, designers, etc. Building everything from the ground up, which means working out ways of working, company coding standards & practices, common tooling, technologies, patterns, building internal tooling and setting up infrastructure, CI/CD, project setup etc all without much of a roadmap - before they even get to identifying & breaking down priority features of what needs to be built by who.\n\nIn all that mess, how did they decide who was and wasn’t performing? Was it cutting a whole team that didn’t seem to be delivering (maybe they put more time into getting their foundations in place first; or maybe it was the tech lead or an individual that undermined performance) while keeping the team that smashed something out that impressed the founders (that may actually be crap AI generated code that is absolutely not production level quality, will be difficult to maintain, is not following any shared company technology or patterns); or did they trust a manager to make the decision even though that manager might be shit themselves and just playing politics, throwing others under the bus?\n\nMy last job I joined a team that was newly forming, they didn’t hire a tech lead or delivery PM until 2 months past my hiring (more like 6 months from first IC joining), and there was no clear direction until after that point. I did what I could as a mid level to improve team ways of working and identify work priorities, had to step up to act more like a senior in the absence of any seniors, however it was the worst way to start a new job and had absolutely the slowest ramp up speed - which was not determined by the quality of the people hired. Multiply that by 10-15 teams in a newly formed department!\n\nExpect that you are walking into a hot mess, that will have terrible morale, and you may be fired for “underperformance” even if you give it everything you’ve got.",

Obviously they'll pay you, but I don't think you can assume **any** long-term stability right now.\n\n\nOther than that, firing in a month suggests they're unicorn hunting for the best engineers they can hire at the salary band they can pay. ",

Sprinkle in buzzwords like \"design for xyz from the ground up\" or whatever\n\n4. create a silly MVP in record time\n\n5. realize you over-promised and under-delivered when \"everything else\" is not going in the same velocity as the silly MVP. Hire more goons. The goon in step 2 gets promoted\n\n6a. after throwing more money / devs at the problem, we reach \"maturity\" where we have the same useability as before and we get back to step 2.\n\n6b: project gets transferred to a different manager, also interested in empire building by increasing ops. This manager protects this pos project because it guarantees headcount.\n\nEveryone knows this and everyone follows along. Is it like this for other folks in larger tech companies?",

Seeing that even someone with senior experience needed 150 applications and still ended up with a 1% offer rate honestly feels terrifying, and it says a lot about how tight the market is right now. Your note about Wellfound and startups stood out to me too, I’ve noticed similar patterns with remote and remote-friendly roles. At this point I’m relying less on standard applications and keeping my resume circulating more aggressively, like in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/), because debts are breathing down my neck. I’m constantly open to new projects and roles, just trying to keep my line in the water while things feel increasingly urgent. Posts like this don’t give hope so much as they give a reality check.",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nWe've seen a lot of confusion (and some complaints) about Rules 3 and 9, specifically what counts as \"general career advice\" vs. stuff that belongs here, and what makes a post \"low effort.\"\n\nSo we updated the wiki with some actual explanations and examples. If you're wondering why a post got removed, check there first: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/wiki/index/)\n\nThe short version:\n\n**Rule 3:** If you remove yourself from the post and the question becomes meaningless, it's a personal advice request, not a discussion. We're not an advice desk. Also, if your question would work just as well on r/ExperiencedAccountants it's probably not dev-specific.\n\n**Rule 9:** \"Does anyone else...?\" posts, venting disguised as questions, single-line prompts, and stuff with no real discussion hook. Also: a post getting hundreds of comments doesn't mean it belongs here. Generic relatable content is exactly what we're trying to avoid.\n\nThe wiki has a table with good/bad post examples if you want specifics. These rules do have a moderator discretion disclaimer, so keep that in mind when you're posting.\n\nThe rules have not changed but we hope this provides a guide for posting and encouraging thoughtful discussion in this community. \n\nQuestions? Drop them here or PM the mod team. ",

      "text": "I (6 YOE) have joined a company which has recently decided to bring some software development in-house, myself and three others. They also have a R&D team which includes one person who has been writing Python code, including some tools that have made it into production. Please understand that I have nothing against this person when I say that it is impressive how bad their code is considering they have access to ChatGPT. The first tool of theirs that I refactored had whole chunks of code that were never actually executed (unbeknownst to them) and I would place it at a level below a junior dev, more someone who has just started learning Python.\n\nRefactoring their code has been super time consuming, because it involves a full re-write. To try and minimise how painful this is, I have tried to implement some standards that I have asked them to stick to for new projects. Originally these were\n\n1. Use GitLab for version control.  \n\n2. Use our repository templates which enforce ruff chucks (we’re using uv) and a minimum pytest coverage of 70%.\n\nFor context, they have some GitHub experience but only pushing to a repository, not anything to do with branches and code reviews. I have created documents with the exact commands and explanations for concepts such as branching plus taken them through it on multiple calls. \n\nAnyway, to cut a long story short, they continue to develop code locally to extremely poor standards. I have escalated this up to the CTO who is completely on my side, and he has spoken to this R&D person’s manager. Unfortunately, their manager wasn’t happy we were brought in as he feels like we’re stepping on his toes, so he does not enforce the new standards at all. \n\nMy question is, has anyone got any advice at all about how I can win these people over? I am very willing to put in the time to up-skill people, but it is just flat out resistance at every turn. The worst bit is in a call they agree with me, but then they don’t do anything. \n\nApologies slight rant but really would love suggestions. ",

Software engineers do software engineering things. Writing, deploying, maintaining, and being responsible for production systems is a software engineering thing, not an R&D thing.\n\nWhen marking out boundaries, it's very tempting to focus only on the harm others are doing, but you cannot do this. You need to start this conversation by sitting with your manager and possibly the CTO and developing a full understanding of the value of R&D to the org, and in particular the value that this individual brings. Because there's already been friction, you need to lay this on pretty thick. (I mean, in all likelihood, this person actually is invaluable to the business, otherwise they wouldn't be paying him and giving him this kind of leeway in the first place.)\n\nThe goal here is not to limit what any individual or department can do, it's to maximize what the org as a whole can do, and that begins by understanding what everyone's bringing to the table and how best to leverage it. Frankly, this is work your manager and CTO should be doing, but since they seem unable to manage it, you can get the ball rolling.\n\nIn this conversation, you need to explain your own team's value as well, and how you need ownership of your area of responsibility just as R&D requires ownership of the realm they play in. That means you need to control production quality if you're responsible for it. If you can't do that, then you cannot own it either, and you're unwilling to carry the pager for any part of the system R&D is pushing code to. Again, this isn't territorial pissings, you're justifying this by pointing out that it's literally your job description and expertise to maintain these systems, and the org shouldn't *want* R&D doing this work.\n\nAgain, you can't focus the discussion entirely on what's wrong, but you need to also create a happy path. Explain how things should ideally work. Maybe you create a playground env where R&D can do whatever they want and once they've proven out a concept, they can push requirements into your dev process where you'll write code, make sure it's fully tested, deployed in a standard way, etc.\n\nClearly, R&D is hearing your objection as unreasonable, which means they think you are trying to limit what they can do, or you are trying to do their job yourself. You have to really listen to these objections and take them seriously so you can figure out where the disconnect is and assuage those fears. You need to work with them to understand how your teams can work together so you're both able to do your jobs within your own areas and everyone is clear on what the boundaries are and happy with it.",

I think the code coverage percentage might be way too high for an opening move, convincing people to test their shit requires more carrots than sticks. You'd probably have more luck setting that as a really crappy low level, and focus on trying to get people to make it part of their workflow by going down the education, arm around the shoulder route, though it's a challenge because of the automatic defensiveness people like that get.",

Our afchitecture and hard skill topics are being alternatief with more and more softer topics.\n\nOne of which I would appreciate some perspectives from others in Staff+ roles. The discussion is about how do we coach your Senior engineers be ready, possibly even joyful about the years to come. In our group we agree that management/company expectations will be to vastly increase productivity/efficiency by X times. At the same time they'd ideally do that without an X time growth in headcount. We all know the typical magic bullets that will solve this.\n\nAnd it is not just efficiency. In general we feel change is changing exponentially. And we wonder what our Staff+ role is this storm of change. Change, which for some translates to excitement, for others it translates to a bit of anxiety. Both seem healthy options.\n\nAs Staff+ we want to make sure that \"our\" engineers will stay the great people they are under the stress of all this change. And coach them, provide psychological safety. Which is a bit daunting as Staff engineers are not necessarily in the chain of management, sometimes don't have any real authority at all.\n\nMy question to this group of peers is how you are approaching this topics. Do you have meetings with your seniors about the softer side of work? Do you do it in groups or one-on-one only with your mentees? What are the traits you aim to empower? How do you leverage your influence to make sure your engineers are ready for what's to come? Are there key discussions I should be having with leadership sooner rather than later?\n\nThanks for seeing this somewhat messy post through. I hope this resonates with some of you.",

I focus a lot on helping them build that \"learning how to learn\" muscle since that's what's gonna matter most when everything keeps shifting\n\n  \nAs for leadership convos - definitely push for more clarity on what \"X times productivity\" actually means in concrete terms, because right now everyone's just stressed about this vague expectation",

We have our primary focus area but are expected to float between adjacent domains a lot to glue properly. We started doing some group things, because only 1:1 is mentally draining as well at this group size. And you don't want to leave out the non-mentee seniors from some of these discussions.

          "text": "\\>  In our group we agree that management/company expectations will be to vastly increase productivity/efficiency by X times\n\nI think all management and majority of developers live in a bubble. My understanding is that efficiency gains are going to be more difficult to get and that implementing AI without a strategy can easily lead to productivity decrease, not gains.\n\nAt the same time I recognize the same cycles have been happening in the past. Management probably thought microservices, cloud, Agile each separately will also improve development performance by X times and yet the result are usually much more modest or even a detriment to total productivity. The biggest factor in whether the there are positive results seem to not be what kind of change is being introduced but whether people have a coherent strategy around it.\n\nMy solution is to just keep level head. I try to understand what niche, as an engineer, I am trying to occupy and what kind of skills I need to be effective in my niche. My niche is dealing with failing projects (I join projects that have huge trouble with delivering, application reliability or performance or all of above). Therefore, I decided to avoid using AI tools altogether (to confusion of my bosses) and keep my development skills sharp. At the same time I am observing how others are dealing with AI and also trying to find good, productive ways to deal with increasing use of AI within my immediate team.\n\n\\> As Staff+ we want to make sure that \"our\" engineers will stay the great people they are under the stress of all this change. And coach them, provide psychological safety. (...) My question to this group of peers is how you are approaching this topics. Do you have meetings with your seniors about the softer side of work?\n\nI think there are different sides to \"safety\".\n\nOn the most basic level, people want to know they are not in trouble and will not be jobless tomorrow. The most important tool to assure them of it is to provide them with continuous, honest feedback and to figure out a way to make sure people understand the feedback is honest. I also make sure they understand if there were problems to show up, there is various layers of help and escalation so it is not possible for them to get into too much trouble quickly or without being aware of it. We also do a lot of training so that people understand what kind of things are truly firing offenses so that they know how to steer clear of really dangerous things.\n\nSome things are outside of my control. My company could technically close our department at any time. Here, my company tries to make sure they don't do such stuff without giving plenty of heads up. For now it seems to work.\n\nSo now that you have people who are safe knowing they will have the job tomorrow, there are further levels of safety. I think what I do with my bosses is to identify those and try to figure out our strategy at each level.",

Not only this has been documented to saturation, but this is similar to what has been happening in other fields for years (automation of jobs), and even in this field (nocode or similar techs). As explained in another comment, if a senior adds no value and \"just codes\", yes, they may get \"replaced\". That's the nature of automation.\n\nThe best thing you can do as a staff is stop propagating doom honestly. Even if you don't see it, your post is full of it (for the reasons commented on the first paragraph). If you fear it that much, how could you help others with it?

In the past getting to staff was more about seniority and \"ticket punching\" and now it's based more on how you improve your team(s).  I think most people got it but some of those that had been in the org for a while were still looking for the proverbial checklist.\n\nWe have a coaching practice within our org that helped me build out these kinds of skills amazingly well.  I spent 2 years in a coaching roll that forced me to learn how to wield \"soft power\" as I put it or being able to convince teams to do what I needed without being in their chain of command.  I wasn't even under the same sr. director as them so it was even more challenging than if I was under the same director as the teams I was trying to help improve at something.\n\nIf you want people to learn this type of skill my feeling is that you have to do way more than meeting with them.  They need opportunities to learn and practice the skill.  It's such a different skill than building things.  There has to be real leadership buy-in as well where they get feedback about it and they can see it's tied to their review/compensation.  If the latter isn't the case they'll never do it.  And if it's not tied to their compensation is it really a priority?\n\nOh, and assume this will take 1-2 years to see this change happen.  Big changes like this never happen quickly.",

Only had a few seniors and juniors in the org so we tended to rely on the seniors for about 90% coding of the hard stuff with overseeing juniors doing lower level work like CRUD, tests, etc.\n\nI would say, regarding the question.. in all honesty, assuming we figure out the stupidly fast rising needs of energy to run more and more AI.. and AI doesnt bubble \"badly\" and is here to stay (which I do firmly believe).. that there are two avenues for seniors. Either embrace AI more and more to essentially gear up to replace the need of junior/mid engineers or.. frankly.. and this wont sit well with someone in a company.. but prepare to figure out how to do your own project (ideally startup) with AI/tooling. \n\nThis is FAR from a great answer for OPs question. I think it could go several ways.. will your company keep all of the senior+ devs as AI gets better and better? You sure they are loyal to you all as well? That is partly why I gear towards learning how to try to build something for yourself so as not to help others be rich and then get shit canned cause we're all just numbers to them.

          "text": "There are three aspects to a promotion in a healthy organization.\n\n1. Does the employee demonstrate sustained performance against the job ladder at the next level? The purpose of this is to make sure that we don't promote someone on the basis of a unusually strong performance and then discover that they cannot sustain that. Common organizational failures around this include the lack of a published and consistently used job ladder, and turning the sustained performance into a \"time in grade\" requirement, rather than \"do we think we'll have to manage someone out for not performing at the promoted level\".\n\n2. Is there a business need for someone at that level on this team? Often, this is handled with the first question (after all, how were they performing at L+1 if there wasn't a need for it), but sometimes the project that demonstrated their actual performance level was a one off and there won't be a sustained need. Common organizational failures here revolve around not planning to help the employee move to a team where their skills are needed. Common management failure here involves not telling someone that their growth is capped on this team, even if that means they need to leave the company.\n\n3. Promotion budgets. There is after all, a limited pool of money, so sometimes the question turns into \"who cleared the bar by the largest margin\". The biggest organizational failure I've seen involves trying to hide this fact and blaming the employee, and the second biggest is going by \"time in grade\" rather than by performance.\n\nNote that none of these involve how many years of experience someone has. If they did, we could avoid all sorts of work by just going by that number. If people have that expectation, it needs to be something they are taught isn't real. If by some chance it is real in the organization, you should be interviewing around to get out.\n\nThe best time to have had these conversations was at last year's performance review cycle. The next best time is now. And again, it isn't \"Do this and get promoted\", because that isn't in your power. It is \"you need to clearly demonstrate these ladder attributes for L+1, let's sit down and see which ones we can show that you have met, and which ones we still need to show you can do\".",

What’s something you built in your spare time that made you think, “yeah, this is good”?\n\nFor me, it was a website for my mum’s beauty salon. It has an integrated booking calendar, user accounts with Google and Facebook login, and profiles for customers. Apple login exists too, but apparently requires sacrificing three newborns to get approved.\n\nThere’s a contact form that sends properly formatted emails to her inbox, a custom admin panel where she can create and manage blog posts, Stripe integration for payments, and a small local e-commerce setup.\n\nTotal cost: zero. Everything runs on Firebase, and I don’t expect to ever pay a cent for it.",

Was a big joy when I got the concept working as I never expected the wild idea I had to actually work out the way it did! It works by slightly moving the camera and taking multiple images and blending the resulting images in such a way that the area that should be in focus, which is present in all images, is placed on top of each other. This solves the big problem screenspace depth of field effects/shaders have in that near plane blur (so something that's out of focus and in front of the subject that is in focus) in real life is transparent and basically shows what's behind the out of focus element around the edges, however in a rendered frame that data isn't available (as it's occluded by the near plane element). For instance: <https://cdn.myportfolio.com/babf9577def101884554d0d345fd30e2/65621a17-586e-47a8-93d5-dda8e700070f.PNG?h=57b216308fb69fa0aa24123ebcae395e> where you see the sword's edges are transparent and show what's behind it as that's in focus. that's not possible in screenspace depth of fields\n\nCode: https://github.com/FransBouma/IgcsConnector\nExample images and docs: https://opm.fransbouma.com/igcsdof.htm",

Often the manager will attempt to \"look under the hood\" and then they have to confront the fact that they themselves don't know everything and haven't done any real work in their life, and the narcissism self preservation takes over as they cope and posture themselves out of the situation and back into their office where they forget that anything ever challenged their ego.
