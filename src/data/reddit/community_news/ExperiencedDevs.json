Below it there was a GREAT discussion with \\~500 comments where other people shared their experience. I copypasted link to this post to two of my friends that are also programmers like me. Today I entered the link and I saw that post was deleted because of \"Low Effort\" without any other explanation. I don't understand why they are doing this,  what's the point?\n\n",

If that ain’t the point of Reddit idk what is. Yes that can apply to other careers but it’s dumb to take down a thread like that. Why? Because lawyers or other professionals can do this too? I don’t get it. Developers have different options and considerations than other careers. Where else can you get through to from other experienced developers?\n\nI like this sub and the thoughtful discussion even when the post at hand is the “same” as others in the past. But everyone and their situation is different so it’s really false to say these are repeated threads. All of this is to say I think the mods take down way too many posts that have interesting discussion \n",

In this sub the content that gets upvoted most are posts against AI. It would be awesome if we as technical people could adapt. \n\nFor example I’ll say the thing that will get me downvoted I’ve been partially vibe coding with an astonishing amount of success. I’m more than a decade and a half in too. I built out the bulk of a basic MVC, multitenant, subscription app with go just by carving out the bones and architecture of the app, documenting the coding standards of the app (two docs) and then giving a prompt for a CRUD action at a time and it’s been doing great. Things that took me a week now take an hour. The longest thing for me to do is code review. Truthfully it’s even fun again because I got in this to create. \n\nSome people absolutely hate that I said the above. They’ll chalk it up to either me being a shill, me being previously bad at my job, or all sorts of things. The reality is there’s a lot of jobs that took a lot of talent that could be moved to India. There’s a path for Western devs and it’s build more innovative stuff and extend what can be done. But it seems the limitation is insecurity leading to inaccurate criticism, being forced to use AI for everything, and a lack of capital to fund the new innovation.\n\nIt’s left the sub to be one of the worst technical subs on Reddit.",

The mods start lumping in good posts with bad posts because there is just so much to moderate, so anything remotely helpful likely will get removed.\n\nI still scroll and read this sub on occasion, and occasionally you find a gem of a post or a comment.

I skip most of the AI topics posted here too, as I don't use LLM based tools, but this particular one OP refers at I read and I found it an interesting PoV, one which **is a reality for many**, even if you don't like AI/use AI tools; if you have an OSS repo on github, chances are you will be confronted with this precise problem: people do drive-by PRs generated by LLMs and it's then up to you to wade through the mud to see what's useful (oh of course, you won't even look at them, and then you will be confronted by angry people who blame you for being lazy and/or asking you why you haven't merged their PR. It all increases time spent on irrelevant things). \n\nSo yeah, it's relevant, even for people who don't use AI tools (of which I'm one).",

          "text": "Here's what irks me about all subreddits that have a heavy hand for moderation regarding general content directionality: you're literally working against the core primitives of Reddit at the platform level. It's a fool's errand and the outcome is entirely predictable: user frustration across the board because the platform doesn't work as expected, the people who disagree with the moderation are going to be very well equipped to complain about it, and the people who agree with the moderation probably don't even know the moderation happened *and probably didn't need the moderation to happen in the first place*. So you're giving some users marginal to no benefit, some users a hugely visible negative experience, and *everybody* is getting treated like a child who can't be trusted to have nice things. There's barely any upside and very obvious much larger downsides.\n\nReddit is *literally* designed to be self policed, at least in terms of content direction. The core platform mechanisms of upvoting, downvoting, commenting, and time-based score decay are designed to algorithmically elevate the visibility of content people are *actually* engaged with, and to quickly bury content that people aren't engaged with. That is how Reddit as a platform intends to steer content directionality. Fighting against that as moderators can have no outcome other than annoying users. Yes, more than the annoyance users would see from observing an actual industry trend being repeated in their feed. \n\nHere's the simplest way I can put it: who should be in charge of determining what experienced devs talk about: experienced devs! It really is that simple. Let people talk about what they want to talk about. A moderator's job shouldn't be to gatekeep conversation topics. Trust me, commenters are more than willing to do that job for you and tell OP that their content sucks if it sucks. And sometimes there's good conversations to be had in the meta discussion about people agreeing or disagreeing about whether content sucks or not.\n\nModerator actions specifically in the dimension of content directionality should be exceedingly rare and the bar should be very high for such actions. It's not only a practical impossibility, but it's downright stupid to presume that you *should* stop developers, experienced or not, from talking about AI right now.\n\nI can not stress this enough: this is a pivotal moment for this subreddit. Continuing down this foolish path of trying to play conversation police via moderation will decimate this subreddit's engagement and stymie its future growth, especially once you get to the point of trying to enforce ridiculous policies like putting things in weekly threads. Again, Reddit is *literally designed not to work this way*. Over time, heavy moderation leads to fewer threads (whether strictly forced into weekly threads or not), which leads to the platform itself promoting the subreddit less often to existing members and less often to potential new members.",

          "text": "I can't speak for what the moderators thought.\n\nHowever, regarding AI, what kind of money do you think is currently circulating in this field, and what threat does this pose to those who are responsible for it? They still have budgets for huge advertising campaigns, and right now, as we speak, there's a gradual understanding that AI can't replace humans in complex development tasks.\n\nBut it's very well suited for deception, because even an experienced developer can't discern how well everything is done in thousands of lines of beautifully formatted code?\n\nIncidentally, a historical aside: When a bubble inflates, it first begins to grow in secret meetings and discreet discussions. Then it reaches the masses and usually turns into widespread hysteria before bursting, because it's necessary to reach even wider audiences with the smallest amount of money that can still be obtained.\n\nHowever, we use AI ourselves and can say that it's very good for some non-critical tasks. But only for non-critical ones, where the cost of error is low. This doesn't apply to development. In development, it's good for searching for certain information and, for example, viewing logs.\n\nI believe that critical discussions of AI are currently harming those who still hope to gain something from this market, and they are making efforts to suppress these discussions. These are temporary attempts to slow down the understanding that is already brewing. So much for the conspiracy theory. True, I think they're solving this through an incredibly large amount of AI advertising of all kinds. They've literally clogged the entire information space with it.\n\np.s.\n\nA scam (from the English word \"scam\" meaning \"fraud\") is a type of fraud based on the abuse of trust to obtain money, valuables, or personal information. Unlike hacking, which exploits technical vulnerabilities, a scam relies on social engineering.\n\n\\- So, if you were promised that by paying for a subscription to some AI client you'd receive fully working code or a real solution as a product, and you received something that doesn't meet your expectations, something that just doesn't work as expected, that means you were deceived and cheated out of your money. Now imagine that almost every day people come to me offering me work for $5 an hour, about 10 times less than I usually ask. They do this, believing that the work of fixing the code that was generated for them is cheap. But no. They've already spent their budget on a product that is very difficult to fix. And it really is better to rebuild it from scratch, simply because it's cheaper. So I have reason to believe they were deceived.",

Ironically, a post about passing responsibility without understanding the work gets removed by mods who didn't read the discussion it generated. The engagement showed it wasn't low effort. This happens across tech subs. Mods choose what they think should be valued, not what members find valuable. A post with 500 comments from experienced devs sharing war stories is perfect for ExperiencedDevs, but it was removed for not fitting someone's idea of \"high effort.' The AI/vibe coding topic often triggers removals because it's seen as controversial, already discussed, or low-effort. These topics resurface because they reflect real industry shifts. The frustrating part: those comments are gone. Genuine dev experiences are deleted because someone decided the post didn't meet an unstated standard. Subreddits decline from over-moderation, not spam or trolls, killing organic discussions. Members stop posting after many good threads vanish. What remains is sanitized and dull. Save valuable screenshots, as the good discussions are increasingly temporary.",

A bunch of out of touch devs who don't want to learn a new tool complaining about it in the saddest ways possible, blaming everything bad that has happened since 2023 on it, while everyone who tries to discuss it seriously or points out that times have changed gets blindly downvoted.\n\nThe problem with discussions like that is that they are pointless. They are full of the same people refusing to learn in every thread. The same arguments, the same biases, the same refusal to learn. It's really stupid to have the same \"WAAAH I have to use AI at my company woe is me\" thread at the top of the subreddit _every single day_.\n\nThe post you linked is honestly about as stupid as could possibly be. Of course using AIs shifts dev time away from writing and towards review. If people would just shut up about \"REEE AI\" for a second and actually consider what is going on they'd find it wildly obvious why AI creates more review for people to go over. _It's because there's being more code produced_ and produced code needs to be reviewed. Why do you need a different thread every single day to go over this?\n\nThe \"Waah they deleted my waah\" posts are getting old too",

Company (stupidly) took on a contracting company 6 months ago to do some work on a platform upgrade and the delivered code is clearly AI-generated by the juniors and they gave us at a reduced rate. Now I'm spending most of my time cleaning it up and (in some cases) rebuilding entire features because the AI built it in such a way that it's totally unmaintainable and broken in production due to edge cases that are a product of that bad design.\n\nFun fact: I got a glowing performance review from my boss the other week off the back of this work and that I'm ahead of most of the rest of my team for bonuses this year. Needless to say the contractors in question are actively being off-boarded and we're not using them again. \n\nThere's going to be a lot of work in remediating AI generated code, especially in critical services so I don't foresee senior devs having any job security issues in future.\n\nLooking forward though, AI will (eventually and undeniably) become the mainstream way of generating code. The question will be does the generated code move from being AI Slop that takes the effort of a full time emplyeee to maintain or does it become good enough to replace those jobs. The former of those 2 is preferable and IMO the likely outcome. \n\n",

Juniors need to learn how everything works and why it's done so that if anything happens, there is someone capable of handling it. Don't tell me about the AI slop replacing them because it can't run systems on the daily basis as well as be present each and everytime. That is the purpose of the juniors from my pov. Watching companies neglect them just creates a new problem which they will face later on. ",

Companies may think they're 'saving money' now by AI, but there's a bigger cost for long-term growth and sustainability. Hopefully though this starts to change, even just gradually, to open the market for more junior roles.",

Because this project is so sensitive to upward stakeholders, it means they want the highest fidelity executors they can get. It's not all bad for me, I've carved out a pretty interesting project that uses AI in a high leverage way, but it's certainly a level of company wide visibility that compresses the talent gradient.\n\nI'm still hopeful, because the model of how we're using AI is new, and could be the direction we take the entire org.

However, this, again, the equation shifts towards AI, which ends up being much cheaper.\n\nI think we have a real issue with how we’re going to form and develop more juniors into seniors, and it will take stronger investment from companies.\n\nBut the little guys can’t do this, or they will be outpriced. So to me, it must be the big guys that have to be willing to do this, because they _can_ afford to put in the extra money to form people.\n\nI do think the little guys are getting the shaft, unless they find juniors who are very good.

These are exactly the kind of things it might be very well positioned to do with the right setup. It is tougher on legacy codebases, but not impossible. However, sometimes the upfront setup of making it Claude-friendly repo might be not worth it.\n\nBut as far as lack of juniors - I get it. I exited the corporate a year ago (laid off, now doing my own thing) and I cannot imagine why I would hire juniors, at least not the \"caliber\" I worked with. I already saw this in 2024 - AI slop PRs, AI rising early in their career meant most of them will never actually learn to program by themselves. At my non-FAANG company the median junior was kind of terrible *before* AI and I can confidently say that Claude Code with Opus 4.6 simply produces better code. Yes, it needs more hand holding, yes, sometimes it will do absolutely stupid things, but on average it's better and it's also superhumanly fast.\n\nWith the things other commenters mentioned - the AI aided cheating, the massive AI slop resumes, etc. WHY in the world would you try to hire juniors when you can pick up experienced seniors, that presumably learnt to code without AI and due to wage compression you can probably pick them up for lower salary than a couple of years ago?",

When you have no juniors, you also have no-one to mentor, which means seniors stop having to articulate and defend their mental models out loud. The process of explaining why you made a system decision is actually how those decisions stay sharp. Without it, you get architecture by tribal memory, and tribal memory degrades fast especially when the team is already at capacity just keeping the lights on.\n\n\n\nWe went through something similar a few years back at a place I was at — not an AI story, just a round of layoffs that took out almost all the mid-level folks. The seniors were fine, technically, but within about 18 months the codebase had drifted in ways that were hard to explain. Not wrong exactly, just... internally inconsistent. Nobody had been asking \"why\" enough. The juniors who ask annoying questions are actually providing a service.\n\n\n\nThe AI angle makes it worse because the implicit promise is that the productivity gap will be covered by tooling, so you don't need the human pipeline anymore. But AI doesn't challenge assumptions. It just executes on them. So if your assumptions are quietly degrading, nothing catches it.",

      "text": "I don't usually talk about this but I've been writing about process and organizational dysfunction lately and people keep asking what actually happened to me so here it is.\n\nAbout five years ago I was working as an IT architect at a bank. Except I didn't really get \"hired\" in the normal sense. I was part of a corporate transition from Brazil, my previous project got killed and because I was already in the US on a work visa they absorbed me into the bank's team. And I mean absorbed, not hired. Everyone knew the difference. The guy running the org never wanted us there, we were basically imposed on him through a decision made three levels above.\n\nThe tech was a mess. Classic ASP, manual IIS deployments, someone remoting into a box at midnight and praying. Everything ran on tribal knowledge from people who'd been doing it that way for a decade and didn't want to change. There was this one senior dev, longest tenured guy on the team, and every single thing I proposed got the same answer: \"that won't work here.\" Not because he had a counterproposal, just because changing anything meant admitting the current way wasn't great and that wasn't something people wanted to deal with.\n\nI ended up shipping three major projects. Real-time payments integration because the bank was falling behind every competitor. Live account balances in the mobile app so customers didn't have to wait hours for batch processing to catch up. And the big one, I rebuilt the entire deployment infrastructure from manual IIS to K8S with actual CI/CD pipelines. All three went to production, all three still running as far as I know.\n\nSo the politics. The infra project was under this manager who was genuinely awful, narcissistic and territorial, the type who sees your competence as a threat to them personally. Midway through I got pulled to another team to do the payments and real-time stuff which honestly felt like being rescued. Different manager, could actually breathe for once.\n\nThen that manager got fired and I got sent right back to the original guy.\n\nHe didn't blow up or do anything obvious. He just started slowly erasing me. First I'm not on the architecture review invite anymore. Then someone else is presenting designs I made. Then my responsibilities get redistributed and nobody even sends an email about it. If you've never experienced this it sounds paranoid but if you have you know exactly what I'm talking about. \"You're still on the team\" yeah I was still on the team, I just wasn't on anything.\n\nThey called me into a room eventually. Contract ending, standard language, very professional and here's the part that most people in this industry will never have to think about: I was on an L1 visa. That meant I had 60 days to leave the country. Not 60 days to find a new job, 60 days to leave the country where my wife and I had been building a life.\n\nI drove home with the termination letter in a dark blue envelope. My wife saw it when I walked through the door and she didn't even ask, she just hugged me. Her green card process was already advanced enough that we didn't have to actually leave but for about a week I genuinely didn't know if the timing was going to work out.\n\nThe thing that messes with me more than the firing itself is that this wasn't even the first time. I've been the technical firefighter at multiple companies now. I walk in, the systems are broken, I fix what nobody else can or wants to fix, and then once the fire is out I somehow end up being the one who's vulnerable. Not because the work was bad but because I never build any political protection around the work. I just ship and assume shipping is enough.\n\nIt's not. 25 years in and I'm still learning this apparently.\n\nOrganizations love the firefighter when the building is burning. They don't love him after because he's walking around knowing where all the structural damage is and that makes people uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not posting this for sympathy. I'm posting it because I think this pattern is way more common than anyone talks about, especially among the more technical people who just want to build things and don't really care about office politics until office politics cares about them.   \n  \nCurious if others have been through something similar and what if anything you did differently.",

Since then I was in one corporate which on reflection was great, they did value competency but also idiots got promoted too, which made me angry enough to leave, I regret that. Now at my current company ONLY idiots get promoted. In the past 6 months alone I have seen 6 of the best people just quit (our QA lead left today actually, she was great).

I did actually end up finding something about this on your book page (maybe you just added this), but if this was the case, seems like something you'd want more front & center, *especially* in the GenAI era. A few years ago this wouldn't have been suspicious, but now people have a lot more reasons to be skeptical. I think it could even play into your marketing better *(the secret agent/whistleblower working on the inside and leaking data out)*. Just my $0.02.\n\n>The headshot is AI generated, yeah. Couldn't use my real photo for the same reason.\n\nIt's kind of the whole package; the GenAI headshot, the Tailwind NextJS site that looks like every other Loveable site (that's the dark side of vibe coding; nothing appears legitimate when everything looks the same), the *very* strange name (I never knew Benjamim was a real name; must be an outside the US thing) and the GenAI book cover.\n\n>But I want to point something out here.

We're all hustling in some way or another and there's nothing wrong with being helpful & engaging while also being able to promote your work.

If anything, this is constructive feedback for you, as I'm just telling you that after looking it over, **everything** about your profile, your website, and your book, feel completely generated end-to-end.

I don't think anonymity and agenda set those alarms off by themselves; like you said that's just the internet. Maybe AI generation is part of the new normal for the internet now...we're all certainly adjusting. I know it's off-putting to me to read anything carrying an LLM tone, there's just so much of it and so much of it is insincere.\n\nI agree with you (as you say in another comment) that there is more substantial conversation to be had here, and AI investigation takes away from that. At the same time we know that low-effort, karma-farming, promotional, and disinformation accounts fueled by AI *do* exist - and I do think that's something important for users to be vigilant about. I think there's an important conversation to be had about that which is creeping in here.\n\nI appreciate that you do understand the skepticism; that due to the environment the \"bar for suspicion has gotten so low,\" as you say - which I agree with too - mistrust is almost default. Although I do disagree that having a website by itself is used as evidence of deception; it's an innocuous data point which could look suspicious in a particular, larger context.\n\n>I'm saying the culture of accusation we've built around AI is starting to cost us more than the AI slop it's trying to filter out.\n\nI'm not sure we have measured the impacts of the accusations vs. the \"slop\" well enough to compare the real costs yet.",

First, that you are capable. Second, that the people who built or tolerated those broken systems were not. The second part is the one nobody forgives you for. Every working pipeline you ship is a silent indictment of the person who was remoting into IIS at midnight for ten years. They know it. Their manager knows it. And the organization would rather lose the person who exposed the problem than deal with the discomfort of acknowledging it existed.\n\nThe other thing that happens is the value of your work becomes invisible the moment it succeeds. Nobody calls you at 2am anymore. Deployments just work. Payments just flow. The people who benefit from your work start to believe that things were always this way or that it was a team effort. Meanwhile you are standing there with all the context of how bad it was before and that context is now a liability because nobody wants to be reminded.\n\nWhat I learned after going through something similar: shipping is necessary but not sufficient. You also have to make the right people feel like they were part of the win. Not in a fake political way but in a genuine way where you bring your manager and your stakeholders into the narrative as collaborators not spectators. If they feel ownership over the success they will protect it and by extension protect you.\n\nThe hardest version of this lesson is that technical excellence without organizational awareness has a ceiling. And that ceiling is not about your skill. It is about whether the people who decide your fate see themselves in your success story or outside of it.",

It is about recognizing that when you ship alone you also succeed alone and that creates a vacuum where nobody else has a stake in protecting what you built.\n\nOne tactical thing that helped me: whenever I start a project now I identify one person above me whose success can be partially tied to the outcome. Not in a manipulative way but in a genuine way, like keeping them in the loop early so they can give input that actually shapes the direction. When they contribute even a small decision they become invested. And invested people do not let the thing they helped build get quietly killed or reassigned.\n\nThe firefighter to overhead transition you described is also worth thinking about structurally. Once the fire is out, the smartest move is to redefine your role around what comes next, not what you just finished. If you are still the guy who fixed the old system you are attached to the past. If you are the guy proposing what the next system should look like you are attached to the future. Organizations protect people they associate with where they are going, not where they have been.",

Do they align with yours? If you don't know those, find out. If it cannot be found out, you are going in blind. I do not think banks value technology. They may make bets on it through loans, but that's just how they profit. And if you were expecting me to make a generalization that they only value profit, my view is nuanced. Every org is different.

That's not a people skills problem, that's an organizational and political situation that people skills alone wouldn't have fixed.\n\nThat said yeah, if people genuinely like having you around you can survive being mediocre at the job for years. I've seen it happen plenty of times. And if people don't care whether you stay or go, being great at the job just means you built nice things on your way out the door. I get that now. Took me longer than it should have.\n\nBut it's also really easy to read someone's story on Reddit and say \"the problem is you don't have people skills.\" You're analyzing a situation from the outside with all the clarity and distance that comes with not being the one living it. When you're inside it, on a visa, watching your responsibilities disappear week by week, trying to deliver what the org asked you to deliver while your manager is working against you, it doesn't feel like a people skills problem. It feels like survival. The diagnosis is always cleaner when you're not the patient.",

The guy was a Software Development Manager who had never actually worked in software development before, so imagine that level of insecurity. You're managing a team doing work you don't fully understand and then someone shows up who clearly does, that's threatening regardless of anyone's nationality. The visa leverage thing is real though, he knew I couldn't just walk away and find another job the next week. When your employee can leave whenever they want you think twice before playing games with them. When they're tied to you by a visa you don't have to think at all.",

You will not be giving full pizza fix freely.\n\nAnd the most important,  keep manager + 1 informed about your work and impact (quantifiable) you are creating.\nKeep a journal for daily or weekly logs for your work and impact.

                  "text": "You can’t compare MoviePass to Uber and Lyft. MoviePass failed because they had no leverage and no moat. The idea made total sense, but it was genuinely one of the dumbest business ideas I’ve ever heard.\n\nTheir idea was essentially to subsidize movie costs long enough to grow to large enough user base that they could then threaten to take theatre chains off their service and use that threat as leverage to negotiate lower ticket prices or a percent of concessions. They also planned to sell analytics data to studios to help them understand trends.\n\nThe problem was that the movie industry is dominated by just a few, massive chains who could replicate their idea in an afternoon once MoviePass proved the demand was there and MoviePass would have no leverage to do anything about it.\n\nFor customers, the only advantage MoviePass had was their pricing model. Whether you’re buying through MoviePass or the theater directly you’re still going to see the same movie, buying the same snacks, and sitting in the same seat. That meant that as long as MoviePass was still losing money all someone like AMC would need to do is match their price and wait for them to go broke. Since AMC is much bigger and could run at a loss for a lot longer than MoviePass it was never going to work out.\n\nI get why the Uber comparison seems to make sense at first glance. They both kind of fit the “we’re just going run at a loss and burn VC money until we have the leverage to raise prices”. The critical difference is that when Uber was starting up they were competing with much smaller, highly local companies who couldn’t just lower prices indefinitely and build a dispatch app over night. Also, the pricing dynamic is reversed. If you’re an Uber driver and Uber says they’re reducing driver pay, you can’t really go do your own Uber. You can quit, but that won’t meaningfully affect Uber. If MoviePass demands a better deal from AMC and AMC says no, so MoviePass removes AMC from their service, like I said before, AMC could just copy them and run at a loss until MP went broke which is essentially what happened",

The thing that OpenAI and Gemini will get from free-tier users is their sweet sweet human-generated input.\n\nI expect that some point they'll en-crapify their services, like we've seen happen with every other platform, but there's still incentive for them to keep a free tier, because they'll be gaining something from it they want. It's just that the user experience will BARELY be good enough to keep people using it; which will incentivize people to switch to a less-crappy paid account (where there will still be ads).",

Reality disagrees. While I agree that this is likely the viewpoint of some at the top of the chain pushing AI so hard... this isn't the ground level reality. Many companies using AI are already openly admitting they gain little to no benefit from AI, while pushback is already increasing.\n\nYour average business on a day to day are currently spending $0 on AI - most of the spend is highly concentrated near the top. This won't improve any if these companies were going to start charging. There are specific more targeted fields such as developers where AI has shown real gains. I don't want to make it sound like I think AI is useless... it's a legitimate technology with a lot of room to grow, but currently the primary value is in very targeted applications, and in many of those applications consumers are pushing against the use even when it may be useful (think AI in videogames etc.)\n\nAs of now at least, there are still a huge amount of jobs that require minimal computer use at best... while requiring effectively 0 AI use. If my plumber started bragging to me about using AI on his work... honestly I'd probably change plumbers. \n\nUntil we have high-end robotics with a functional near-AGI, many of these jobs will never adopt AI, because it does nothing for them. We are nowhere near a functional AGI or the necessary level of robotics, and there is a lot of research and evidence indicating that this current path of LLM's will likely never achieve true AGI. \n\nSo while use might expand out as they make AI versions more targeted at different areas other than development... this isn't a simple, or quick, or cheap thing for these companies to do. \n\nSo while I agree this might have been the intention here... we aren't actually seeing it succeed, and they are already starting to run out of \"runway\" of blowing a lot of money for little to no gain. Which leads me to your other comment...\n\n>And since it's all funny money (an A gives to B gives to C gives back to A circle jerk), they can keep this train on track, no matter how absurd it seems.\n\nFor a while they can... they absolutely cannot keep doing this indefinitely. All it takes is 1 piece to fail and the entire structure starts to crumble. Once that happens the entire circle jerk collapses.",

Having a negative ROI caused by the most expensive model's training doesn't meant that actual inference is that expensive in general.\n\nThe world doesn't really need 3, 4 full fledged, top of the line foundation models, and it's in training those that all the outrageous costs are. In a world where there's fewer, the people inference is still going to be making money, and we'll just see a slowdown of the training of the foundation models. The risk of a distiller is too high to not try to keep prices close-ish to cost there.",

That doesn't mean I can't use coding agents. That means that instead of Cursor + Opus 4.6, I use Kilo Code + MiniMax 2.5. Not great for vibe coding, but works perfectly fine if you are a somewhat competent software engineer that knows how to guide an LLM. Keep in mind, those cheap models are not overpriced.

Right now, I’d say the open weight models are about one, maybe two, generations behind the SOTAs from the big labs.\n\nYou gotta remember that this time last year, we had just seen the release of Sonnet 3.7, which I’d say was one of the first models to be somewhat useable for real code. Today, the open weight models are easily exceeding what was possible with Sonnet 3.7, with most of them within spitting distance of Sonnet 4.5/4.6. Hell, some even challenge Opus 4.5/4.6 in some tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to open weight models, what you see happening is people applying the well known pattern of any other form of hosting to inference. Calculate amortized CapEx and OpEx, and charge accordingly. Even if the closed weight SOTA models disappeared tomorrow, we’d be ok with the open weight ones.",

I can just leave this guy to himself for a week and he will eventually produce a high quality merge request. Idiomatic code that fits within the established standards, good UX, good commenting and factoring practices, etc etc. \n\nHe has asked for my help maybe twice in the couple of months since he started. I will ask for corrections and modifications here and there but *at least* 95% of what he makes is perfect on the first try. \n\nWe're not really an AI shop (I personally use it for minor boilerplate and to ask questions when documentation or search engines fail me) and as far as I know he doesn't have AI redact code for him either. If he does, then he has the sense to prompt correctly or make the proper adjustments so that it's not slop. \n\nI still wonder if I'm failing to do my job as a team lead by not offering to help or pair program more. It's like the situation is too good to be true.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure why I'm writing this.

You set up good standards, good architecture, and a codebase that communicates its own expectations. He is productive because the environment you built makes productivity the path of least resistance. That is leadership even if it does not feel like it day to day.\n\nOne thing I would suggest: invest in his growth beyond the current codebase. He is clearly capable of executing within known boundaries. The real question is what happens when he hits a problem where there are no established patterns to follow. Architectural tradeoffs, ambiguous requirements, situations where two valid approaches exist and someone has to make a judgment call. Those are the moments where your 11 years of experience become genuinely valuable to him.\n\nYou do not need to manufacture pairing sessions. But next time a task comes in that has real ambiguity or requires a design decision with long term consequences, work through it together. Not because he cannot do it alone but because watching how a senior thinks through those decisions is the thing that turns a strong junior into a strong senior five years faster.\n\nThe other thing worth doing: tell him directly that his work is excellent. Juniors who are this self sufficient sometimes interpret silence as indifference. A short message saying your code quality is consistently strong and I trust your judgment goes further than you might expect.",

I use AI to generate my code all the time. I used to try and hide it (20 YoE btw), now I just leave the extra information that it often comes with alone. MD files. Summarizations. Slightly excessive comments. Scripts it wrote that do a very simple thing but that I'll probably use in the future. \n\nSlop has become a buzzword.

I know that everybody has talked about this already and that’s not my point.\n\nMy point is, since we’re not the ones actually doing the dirty work, it gets much easier to create more microservices than you have users, or adding 10 layers of abstraction to anything.\n\nI think that, for me, at least, I have to be careful not to become that astronaut architect, designing that “perfect” white marble tower",

          "text": "The problem with complexity, as I see it, is that we focus it on the code alone in a vacuum.\n\nLet's start first with what I claim is true: \n\n* Developers will solve problems as complex as they can and no more. If a problem seems too complex/hard to solve developers will make software that over simplifies or scopes to a simpler subset of the problem. \n* Developers will create solutions as complicated as they can handle. If a problem is easy they'll take on extra tech debt, over engineer it, or use ridiculous platform tools (e.g. electron) to make it.\n   * Note that most of these solutions make it easier to develop, or at least the developer will think that's the case. Such as using a myriad of npm deps for every trivial thing. \n* We can decrease apparent complexity with tools/frameworks/tests/etc which handle and solve that complexity for us (it converts the complex problem to a simpler one, even if it is harder!). We should note this isn't guaranteed to decrease dev time, and may even increase it, but the perception is generally of it making things faster. LLMs are a tool that reduce a lot of the complexity in making ambiguous specs into code, though it needs the other to be clear and has other limitations. \n* We can increase complexity by accruing tech debt, making dogmatic decisions (e.g. I want to make a very fast grep tool using only pure functional code, or I'll rewrite my blog host entirely in Rust), increasing the scope of the task, tackling more ambiguity directly (ie started l software that can do everything), it reframing the problem. \n* Complexity compounds. If I take modules foo and bar and use them together, the solution is going to be far more complex that either module alone. \n \nFrom this we can reach some interesting conclusions. Fire example: as we add more modules/features to our software, all the previous code needs to become simpler so that our software stays at the right limit of complexity. You can't do this preventively because we need the same level of complexity, so you'll end up with an el over-engineered solution that doesn't solve the problem that comes up. Similarly if you can't reduce the complexity of existing software it'll be impossible to add new features/modules as the complexity will grow to large and old features will have to be dropped. \n\nSimilarly it's easy for complexity to get out of hand. Because the complexity LLMs are hiding is the complexity of managing complexity. You still have to do it, but it's easy to be blindsided if you don't understand how to best use the tool. LLMs are this tool that seems like it could do anything, but many times there's a better tool already.\n\nNow this seems to keep us doomed, because any progress we do to improve our software will simply result in us becoming lazier (the wrong way) until the problem gets as hard, it even harder than before.\n\nSo what to do? Do we just force ourselves to code with old limitations? (Keep RAM usage to 10MB max, and binary system under 2MB?) I mean in some contexts that can totally work, but what about when we want to explore and be creative? Those limitations are against, but once we're done we can't just rewrite. I guess that's another solution, restart again, lose all progress and hope you get somewhere interesting, but even with hindsight it almost never works. Another solution is to go as fast as possible and manage tech debt with speed as the target, and that works well enough (though paradoxically it generally ends up being but the fastest possible, but it is consistently fast). But this is an issue with LLMs because it becomes really hard to manage and track tech debt if you misuse LLMs, and not only so we but know a lot about how to best use them, but it's very easy to misuse them and many times they push you towards the misuse, instead of solving and fixing things effectively. Thing is that the focus on speed misguides us on how to use LLMs and it easily leads to excessive complexity which means the program will start to crash and have issues until we drop features, abilities or slow down, none of what we want to do. \n\nSo this leads me to my final alternative. I reframe the problem as one of having to consider the many contexts in which the code exists. And this includes other developers. So when I write code I think of all the different reasons a programmer would interact with it, also ask the different things they may choose to do, and not only that I think of the different ways a programmer can think: what if they're more junior? What if they're not as familiar with the paradigm I use? What if their area of expertise is different (and once in but even familiar with), what if the strategy I used to approach the problem is one that they don't like? What if they're neurodivergent? What if they're an SRE, or a UX engineer who has to deal with my code? What if they're someone who knows the language conventions from 10 years in the future but not the ones now (that would be seen as bad habits by then)? And then I do the same for the clients.\n\nThe complexity of dealing with different human minds very quickly becomes overwhelming and it forces me to make the simplest, most straightforward code possible, because that's the limit of complexity at that point. It gets messy, because other coders will not use that strategy and will not understand the reason for the simplicity, making the code complex again either way, but the beauty of this is that I force myself to account for that too.\n\nAnd that has been leading more on how I use LLMs. I find that they are really good at parroting how other people would look at my code. I just need the stimulation of another viewpoint to help me see what I normally don't think like. And it works, a few passes on documentation, tests that consider edge cases I haven't, guidance on how to make the code guide the reader towards understanding better. I get to be lazier on the chores that take time, which lets me move faster, but still keeping my code simple enough.",

Sometimes someone's spreadsheet solutions stick around far longer than they should.\n\nWith all the debate around vibe coding, I’m starting to think EVERYONE is right, but only in context. The arguments talk past each other because we don’t have precise language for why each position makes sense in different situations. The software contexts differ in ways we rarely interrogate deeply.\n\nWhat we actually need is a clearer distinction between:\na messy, one-off solution (yesterday’s Excel sheet), and\na core, durable business capability.\n\nHistorically, we handled this vaguely by saying:\n“Just use Excel”\n“Write a macro”\n“Throw together a one-off script”\nNow that role is increasingly filled by AI-generated, semi-disposable code. The definition of disposable has expanded. \n\nAnd just like one off scripts and proof of concept code that shouldn't, that code will inevitably leak into systems that were meant to be clean, stable, and engineered.\n\nSo the real question isn’t whether vibe code belongs—it’s when it’s acceptable to plan for it, and how to with the trade-offs. \n\nWhen is it reasonable for the business to intentionally rely on an Excel-level (or vibe-coded) solution? What differentiates:\n“Use Excel, then import the data” from “This no longer fits in Excel”?\n\nThose boundaries used to be fuzzy even with spreadsheets and macros. They’re fuzzier now with AI-generated scripts (slop) that feel oddly powerful but remain fragile and disposable. \n\nI shake my head at a critical business process running on Excel… while admitting it’s been “working” for years.\n\nOne critical thing though: a challenging problem with Excel was macros and security... and now vibe code.",

In the past, the friction of writing a new microservice or adding yet another abstraction layer provided a natural 'laziness filter' -- if it was too much work, you'd find a simpler way. Now that the work of 'writing' is subsidized, we have to develop a much stronger internal 'simplicity muscle.'\n\n  \nI find that the best way to combat this is to strictly enforce a 'value-first' architecture. If a new service or abstraction doesn't directly solve a known scalability wall or a massive developer experience friction, it doesn't get built. We should be 'lazy' about maintenance, not just 'lazy' about typing. A simpler system with fewer moving parts is the ultimate gift to your future self who has to debug it at 3 AM.",

Company leadership on the other hand doesn't care about it. They need to solve business problems and deliver features/revenue. A manager/lead job is to quite literally be a bridge in between. You have to figure out how to motivate some of the smartest people you know to solve the problem the company cares about.\n\n\nWhat you're describing is pretty much a byproduct of this friction. It shows up differently in different companies. Some have strong processes, others have strong engineering culture. Sometimes your leadership can let some red tape slide, other times they won't. Sometimes the team you lead cares about the processes other times they're least bothered. Your job is the coach the team and manage up so these two sides of the coin gel together to produce results.",

If you close one as \"I'm not doing this,\" at most places, at least some of the time, someone will come to you and tell you to open it back up and pretend you're going to do it. If you explain that you're not going to do it, they're fine with this, they just want the appearance that it's \"being worked on.\" So soon you accumulate a bunch of tickets that don't reflect reality. Or else you try to reassign work that doesn't belong to you, and it comes back along with someone telling you that it's politically sensitive and you just need to keep it in your queue for now.\n\nNow multiply this across every tool in the org that a SWE deals with on a daily basis. You end up with a bunch of noise, and since you can't rely on the tools to tell you what actually needs doing vs. what merely needs to be maintained as the appearance of work that will be done, you start to ignore updating the real work because it's too much effort to separate it from the fake work.\n\nThe place I worked where this was not allowed, it was very transparent what everyone was doing at all times. You could just look at the issue tracker and see someone's actual work queue with the prioritizations. We didn't bother making predictions more than a week or two out because the org had found that the error bars were so large on those plans that it wasn't worth wasting time on, so we just put things in order instead.\n\nAlso, everything was tracked in the issue tracker. If you're working on something, then it's documented in a ticket, even if it's not code-related. Status reports pretty much went away because your status was always available for anyone that wanted to look. Doing a weekly sync was simply pulling up everyone's queue to see what their next couple of weeks looked like, and no one had to do any prep for it except scan their tickets to make sure everything was up to date.",

They believe they are just getting people to be accountable to their commitments, but in reality, they are the link between individual contributors and the decision makers.

Everyone posts blockers and progress in a channel by 10am. If someone does not post, the team notices before I do. Peer accountability is way more effective than manager reminders.\n\n2. PRs got a 24-hour SLA. Not enforced by me, enforced by the team agreement. If a PR sat for more than a day without review, it became the top priority for the next available person. We tracked it for two weeks and review times dropped by 60%.\n\n3. I stopped being the router for information. If two engineers needed to coordinate, I would connect them directly instead of relaying messages. Took about a month for people to default to talking to each other first.\n\nThe underlying issue is usually that the team treats coordination as the manager's job instead of everyone's job.

Nothing outrageously beyond the pale, mind you. But there is so much bait to make horrible decisions during this AI adoption cycle which is basically blasting marketing into their heads that they should have rando employees vibe code apps for production. The outcome will be mostly no measurable benefit, while incurring massive security and privacy risks and diverting engineering resources.\n\nIt's their decision to make, so I'm rolling with it, plus it does present some interesting/fun engineering problems to solve, but it's really making me realize how rare it is for senior leadership to not be idiots, and to realize how so much of the recent former status quo was niceties, lip service, and pseudo respect for engineering, all of which evaporates when they see a vibe coded mvp and basically admit they only pretended to understand the importance of maintainability, simplicity, and security because the experts wouldn't stfu about it.\n\nIt really seems like leadership handling this paradigm shift gracefully is going to be an absolute rarity.\n\nEdit: does this sub have mods anymore? Can we block commenters that have been redditors for like 10 minutes with absurd karma stats? They're easy to spot, they say `fr` incessantly, like, fr dude",

Sure, this doesn't fix the problems we had in the old market, but it's putting them on a forward footing towards regarding what will become an AI transformation. In other words, in their position, I'd do the same thing, because it's rationale.\n\nSecond, it seems like narrative really bothers you, but in many organizations, doing stuff like pay lip service is the silent power best left unsaid. For companies, the signal is alignment with the greater goals, and that's what all this language and other stuff is designed to do.\n\nSo do you believe senior leadership are idiots? Because they are playing a different game than you, with different values than your own, and the results are going to mean compromising your technical values. I'd say: \"that's okay, just accept it and play the game yourself\", but that's my solution. You can do whatever you want, but at least spend the time to understand something before you criticize!",

I have worked at such places and gone through such disillusionment before. But I'm pleased to say I'm quite enjoying things at my current job. I'm not here to gloat. I just thought it might be nice to share something positive.\n\nWe are a pretty small scale-up that's working towards profitability. There's a lot to do and it gets a bit chaotic, but communication is generally no-nonsense and travels fast. It's a fast-paced work environment so it kind of has to be that way.\n\nI work in a platform team with just one other guy. We have two development teams and every one (except one or two) is friendly, talented and dependable. If I need something, I feel comfortable just reaching out to them directly.\n\nI don't feel people are obstructed from innovating and bringing new ideas to the table. For example, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement with the branching strategy that teams were using. It was kind of like a half-baked GitFlow. There was general agreement that it was painful to keep branches organised and it was slowing down our release cadence. So I organised a workshop on trunk-based development and it was a big success. There were lots of good questions, great conversations were had and proper action items were taken to migrate all of our branches to it.\n\nThere is no on-call and work-life balance is great. Everything just runs pretty smoothly in Kubernetes or on Lambda functions. Incidents have happened but they are few and far between. The boss has said that we just don't have enough people to have a fair on-call rotation, so we simply accept the risk that comes with that.\n\nRecently there's been gentle encouragement from both leads and some engineers themselves for people to be less remote. That doesn't necessarily mean being in the office more (some of our engineers work remotely in other countries), but it does mean talking to each other, putting heads together to solve problems, knowledge sharing and interactive sessions where needed. So far I feel we've been very good at keeping these concise without them descending into spiralling soul-crushing meetings. It's very satisfying and I see it creating a noticeable bond. I've observed that it's getting more common for us to finish our office day (usually Thursday) with drinks together. Even some of our more reserved devs seem more willing to come in and join in later for a drink and a nice chat.\n\nIt's not all rose-tinted. The company are very stingy about hiring people and will only do so if they absolutely have to. There have been numerous painful lay-offs in the last few years that have left a very bitter taste in people's mouths. The AI adoption is very real across the company and it's led to some horrible results on our website which have had to be scaled back. But the perfect place doesn't exist of course. And in regards to AI, there is definitely agreement from us in engineering that it needs to be used as a tool and we really have to be mindful of its potential misuse.\n\nThat's it! Hope it gives you some semblance of positivity in these trying times. If anyone else has some recent success stories, feel free to share.",

Every conversation about programming turns to asking an AI agent.\n\nI no longer have solitude, there's no longer really a part of the job I like. The juniors are gone. Most of my time is reviewing slop PRs that I just thumbs up. Even if I press people on decisions they just say claude did it.\n\nI have looked at other jobs and many of them have, \"ability to use agentic AI\" in their job description.

We got into a refinement meeting yesterday, which went from a 20 minute meeting to a 90 minute meeting because I had to explain all kinds of things they're missing from the tickets. We've built *one* new feature in the past 2 years, with none in the pipeline. They're largely focused on rebuilding the old system instead of creating features that drive revenue.

Not that I'm convinced it's transformative so far, but I'm more concerned about management deciding it is and making changes based on that.\n\nI work at a consultancy and juggle anywhere from 3 to 20 projects at a time. The CEO likes to sell jobs with little pre planning, so deadlines are often short with extremely fuzzy guidelines. I have an entire new system integration due in a little over a month, but I still don't have the documentation or credentials to get started ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIt's a pretty shitty job though, so I'm considering looking anyway. Thankfully the pay isn't bad and the benefits are mid. Short list of more recent bullshit issues:\n\n* My vacation this year is contingent on the aforementioned project being done in time, despite not having any of the resources I need to complete it.\n\n* To have PTO approved, I need to provide a personal emergency contact and their phone number so they can be called if I'm unreachable, and the specific location of where I'm going.\n\n* We're considered on-call 24/7. If a client needs me to work at 8 pm on Friday and lets me know at 4 pm, I'm expected to do it without compensation. This includes PTO and holidays.\n\n* The majority of my co-workers are MAGA, so almost every stand up is political or conspiratorial after any major event.\n\n* I have to track every minute of work in an Excel sheet that gets sent to the CEO at the end of the month because he refuses to pay for time tracking software.\n\n* Code needs to be written how our CEO does (i.e, from the earlier 2000s), so he can work on it as well. He doesn't use an IDE or understand package managers if that helps you understand how bad it may be. Luckily, for a lot of projects I can get away with writing it in a more modern way.",

It's so boring and I have to do a ton of context switching almost every day which takes it's toll.\n\nTo me it's a new language and a platform (or somewhat new because last time I used it was back in school), but .NET is just so well designed for everything enterprise that I have this internal loathing for it that I can't explain. Everything in me tells me it's a great platform with tons of features etc. but it's just so verbose and everyone around me is a Microsoft fanboy, thinking you need a SQL server and Azure cloud and VIsual Studio with a Windows machine to develop everything..

I spent most of my time context switching and hated that I never felt like I was accomplishing anything. Projects were reshuffled a bit and I more or less run one project solo and also maintain the shared components used by multiple projects on the team. My boss lets me do whatever I feel should be done and only checks in enough to be able to report to their boss.\n\nPros: great benefits, pay is generally good, 10 minute commute, spacious cubicle with 3.5 walls, meaningful impact on projects, AI is banned\n\nCons: Need to integrate with multiple other customer systems each deployment which could be1 - 40+ years old so legacy code, legacy data, and legacy protocols everywhere. Some products are considered critical systems which means the team is technically on call 24 hours a day and on a team of 1 that means just me though this only happens 2-3 times a year.",

I like business travel and the food budget is pretty good, so I don't mind that so much. The late night remote stuff is usually about 8-12 days per year.\n\nNo required in-office days for us, but the nature of working with hardware means a lot of people need to physically be in the lab to do their work. I still work from home 1-2 days a week if I don't have anything that needs to be physically moved around.

Before you downvote just know I'm also sick of AI posts about everything, but I'm really interested in hearing other experienced devs perspective on this.\n\nI just don't see engineers being completely replaced actually happening (other than maybe the bottom 15%-20%), I have 11 years of experience working as a data engineer across most verticals like DOD, finance, logistics, media companies, etc.. I keep seeing nonstop doom and gloom about how software engineering is over, but there's so much more to engineering than just coding. Like architecture, networking, security, having an awareness of all of those systems, awareness of every single public interface of every single application that runs your business, preserving all of the business logic that has kept companies afloat for 30 years etc. Giving AI full superuser access to all of those things seems like a really easy way to fuck up and bankrupt your company overnight when it hallucinates something someone from the LOB wants and it goes wrong. I see engineers shifting jobs into using prompting to help accelerate coding, but there's still a fundamental understanding that's needed of all of those systems and how to reason about technology as a whole.\n\nAnd not only that, but understanding how to translate what executives think they want vs what they actually need. I'll give you an example, I spent 6 weeks doing a discovery and framing for a branch of the DOD. We spoke with very high up folks in this branch and they were very pie in the sky about this issue they've having and how it hinders the capabilities of the warfighter etc etc. We spent 6 WEEKS literally just trying to figure out what their actual problem was, and turns out that folks were emailing spreadsheets back and forth around certain resource allocation and people would send what they think the most current one was when it wasn't actually the case. So when resources were needed they thought they were available when they really weren't.\n\nIt took 6 fucking weeks of user interviews, whiteboarding, going to bases, etc just to figure out they need a CRUD app to manage what they were doing in spreadsheets. And the line of business who thought their problems were much grander had no fucking clue and the problem went away overnight. Imagine if these people had access to a LLM to fix their problems, god knows what they'd end up with.\n\nPoint being is that coding is a small part of the job (or perhaps will be a small part of everyones job). I'm curious if others agree/disagree, I think a lot of what I'm seeing online is juniors/new grads death spiraling in fear from all of the headlines they're constantly reading.\n\nWould love to hear others thoughts",

When I was in the throes of it and leaning into the tools hard, I noticed a distinct difference of the \"origination point\", where when I sat down to solve a problem, I was drawing a blank on where to start, and that's not typical for me.\n\nI've seen reduced my usage and when I go to solve a problem, I start by writing out what I need to solve for and what I *think* could be the answer. I really spend time cogitating on it, and then try a few things. When I feel like I have a decent understanding, I might reach for an LLM to assist, but I tend to quality under my \"three Rs\" (rote, refactor, or research). I haven't really used them much lately to do large implementations that I'm not really connected to the process, because that feeling was fairly terrifying. They key is really *\"brain first, AI second\"*, instead of these dangerous \"AI first\" initiatives that are being pushed. There's no free lunch.\n\nIs it not as important? I guess I am doubling-down on that it is going to be **very** important. The way I see it, society ran a full experiment on itself with smartphones and social media, and ended up with a whole generation suffering from attention deficit. I think we're running another experiment, but this time is likely to lead to a cognitive debt for many people. I'm largely opting out of that.\n\nIf that means I end up not staying in the field, well...if staying in the field means losing my critical thinking skills, then I don't really want to stay in it, anyway. But, I don't think that's where were headed and I think the dust is going to settle and there's going to be a bit of a \"cognitive hangover\" for many people.",

As it learns from those using it now.. it will continually get MUCH Better.. even at design, ideas, etc. Though the real issue is that of \"ideas\". AI that isn't sentient, with real world experience.. just LLM prediction engines is never going to say \"I have an idea.. if we build this.. this way.. with these things.. we'll help the world\". That is something AI wont replace until we have sentient AI that can dissect problems in the world (such as how we use the worse \"chemical\" crap for power.. and how to find better ways like fusion, thermal induction, etc). Until then.. you're going to need for the next 10, 15+ years those of us that are still capable, have learned a lot.. and can direct/review/etc the AI LLMs as they get better. The next generation of AI (neural + llm + other stuff that we dont know about yet) will likely make LLMs look like child toys.. and advance the capabilities so much further that anyone will soon be able to say \"I have an idea.. \" and code it up start to finish. I think that is 10+ years out though.. but the shit is moving so fast who knows.\n\n",

Rather than compiling machine code you're now compiling natural language. We've seen so far, that despite levels of abstraction added to software, we still get paid a lot and there are still lots of roles.\n\nNow, it's totally possible that the overall amount of software that needs to be written is finite, we will run out of solvable problems and there will be a scarcity of jobs.\n\nIt's also possible that human beings just enjoy the creation of technology for the sake of it, that there will always be software to make and people to guide that, even with a sufficiently advanced AI you still need people to imprint domain knowledge and human values. Software developers can still exist, just that the utility is shifting towards \"entertainers\" rather than \"utilitarians\".\n\nTruth is, we don't know how valuable code will be in the future, but we do know that historically, just because code becomes easy to manufacture doesn't mean it becomes a cheap commodity.",

Organizations don't want to build and maintain competency in systems that fall outside their core business, and that constraint does not disappear just because AI accelerates the rate of delivery. SAP is the clearest example. The economics of a rewrite may appear compelling given its cost, but organizations will not pursue it regardless of how long it takes, because it is not their business to do so. In many cases the org has also spent decades molding its processes around the software, making migration risk alone a company threatening proposition. There are exceptions. Amazon built AWS internally before it became a product, but these cases tend to involve organizations where the strategic value of owning the capability is unusually high. For most, that threshold is never reached. Smaller, more narrowly scoped tools are a different story. These are ripe for disruption, whether through in house rewrites that AI has made newly practical, or through significant downward pricing pressure as vendors are forced to compete with good enough internal builds.",

Today, I tried hypothesizing what this would look like if I was just our best dev on the team + AI.\n\nFirst, they’d be on call for this system 24/7. Immediately they aren’t getting any work done. They won’t be able to fit the entire system in their head so every niche page and support problem will require a lengthy conversation with AI to figure out exactly what to do.\n\nSecond, they’d need to be the point of contact on everything happening with that system. That’s not practical. And you can’t have an engineer in the middle of a meeting be asking AI the answers to tons of random questions, assuming it even knows them.\n\nThen, ignoring no time for development since they’re on call 24/7, they would need to make architectural decisions that make sense in the context of our business. AI is good at general answers, not specifics. I don’t see 1 person + AI making great decisions. We could assume we’d still do RFCs but just with the 1 engineer from each other team that’s a stakeholder, but then you’re getting away from replacing all devs.\n\nAnd even if all this works, you’d have one person designing like 5 complex features in parallel while fully understanding all of it, AB testing, rolling it out, etc? That is a huge mental burden, even assuming AI writes all of the code perfectly.\n\nI think overall, AI is good at speeding me up as an IC. And *maybe* 1 engineer + AI can begin owning multiple legacy systems that are very reliable and not being actively developed anymore. But I honestly don’t see a realistic path where it replaces more than 1-2 people on my team. My theory is that people don’t really understand what software engineering is and think because a nontechnical user can use AI to spin up a greenfield project, that this will somehow extend linearly. I think they just don’t understand the realities of the field. It’s just another “silver bullet.”",

          "text": "So, since being laid off I've been trying to learn as much as possible about LLMs. I'm doing this for the sake of my mental health. I find myself on a rollercoaster of emotions listening to the various \"thought leaders\" and influencers, so I would rather just have a solid foundation of understanding so I can sort the signal from the noise. I'd encourage everyone to do this. Instead of getting caught up in the hype of new models or new tools, learn the fundamentals so you can tell who is bullshitting you.\n\nSo first off, \"reasoning\" models aren't a fundamentally different architecture from other LLMs. The reason I mention this is whenever I point out these things are just stochastic parrots, people like to say \"but reasoning!!\". Basically, the training inputs are somewhat different (answers tend to include a \"chain of thought\"), and then they have various (interesting!) hacks to try to create a situation where more tokens = closer approximation to a good answer. One hack, for instance, is having it generate multiple answers in parallel, score them based on various heuristics (self consistency, for instance. Self consistency means that if it produces three answers, A, B, and C, are answers A and B the same but C is different? Probably go with A or B.)\n\nThe important point here though is these things are still just approximating an answer, not \"thinking\" or building world models.\n\nUltimately \"reasoning\" is a useful capability but not AGI. Also, these things tend to fail when asked to do things outside of their training, because again, they're stochastic parrots. Yes, there are some mitigations around this (RAG and tools), but it's pretty clear that transformer architectures aren't going to scale into AGI. They're just going to be really good at answering things contained in their dataset. To me, they're like a very fancy search engine. \n\nOne question I asked ChatGPT this morning was how LLMs handle structured text like JSON. The answer was pretty illuminating. ChatGPT does not fundamentally understand JSON, it just has such an inconceviably large dataset of JSON documents that it tends to get the syntax right through approximation. It also does interesting things like \"constrained decoding\", where the model is forbidden to emit syntactically incorrect tokens (ie, if it emits a token that results in bad syntax, it's forced to try again, until it produces correct syntax). This answer is straight from ChatGPT itself, not my characterization.\n\nAnyway, I think AI will make the job market much worse and basically make \\*everything\\* worse, like they kinda are already doing, but I don't think being able to think is going to stop being an economically important thing and that's ultimately what software devs are doing all day, thinking. The code is just one output of that. (And you still have to watch the stochastic parrots when they generate that)",

I do think it will radically change the nature of our jobs, and you will get left behind if you don't learn to use these tools, but those who adapt will have no problem finding jobs.\n\nI thought of an analogy when discussing this recently - remember what office work was like in the 50's/60's/70's?  Admin work specifically.  Any office had a whole department of people whose job it was to make copies, organize files into rooms of file cabinets, fetch files that people needed, send files where they needed to go, just manage the mountains of paper an office produced.  \n\nAfter computers and the internet, that job ceased to exist per se, but there are still armies of admin jobs in a lot of places.  Think medical coders, compliance people, any number of people at an insurance company.  Basically anything in the book \"Bullshit Jobs.\"  When we created technology to push paper more efficiently, paper pushers didn't go away.  Instead, the volume of paper to push exploded and the job of a \"paper pusher\" changed to look radically different, but it still exists at a similar skill level, if a slightly different skill set.\n\nSo that's what I think is coming to software development.  The skill set will be related, but a little different.  And I maybe the demand won't quite increase to match the inflated supply, but maybe it will.  Reality will probably be somewhere in the middle.",

At most companies, it's less than 50%, even when they're in a head-down implementation phase of their project. So a coding bot isn't going to do whatever it is SWEs are doing the rest of the time, even if AI is perfect at coding.\n\nHowever, think about what that time is spent doing: interacting with project managers, business analysts, managers, etc. All of this is aimed at understanding and refining product and technical requirements, working with other teams, etc. So I don't think that AI can completely replace engineers simply by coding.\n\nIn order to replace SWEs entirely, a good portion of all of those other roles would also have to be replaced. The AI would need to understand the problem domain, the proper modeling of it, the space of feasible solutions given the business context, and so on.\n\nThe conclusion I come to is not that AI cannot replace SWEs, it's that AI cannot replace SWEs without also replacing a lot of other job functions too. But we already see the germination of this. If you sit down now with the latest AI coding platforms, you can magic up a website front end to a CRUD backend. It will be prosaic, it won't scale, but think about all of the jobs that a few prompts can do now: UI designer, front end, back end, API, database. What it produces is very limited, sure, but if the business-design-product loop can be closed for tight iteration, that does dramatically change things.\n\nBut I guess we can take solace in the fact that we definitely won't be alone. If AI does take engineering jobs, it will take all of the roles we interface with and most of middle management with it.",

Does it even makes sense to quibble about the specifics of whether this role absorbs that one or vice versa? At that point it's all six months or a year or maybe three years or whatever away from all being subsumed.\n\nPeople are already talking about this. VC troll Marc Andreessen has already said he's looking forward to the day that an entire tech organization can be populated entirely by AI in every role from CEO on down. (At that point, it wouldn't make much sense to even disambiguate the roles.)\n\nThe bigger question is how reasonable or likely this is. I am of two minds. At the moment, if you look at the areas AI has been populating the longest, we still haven't made great strides forward. Look at self-driving cars. Yes, there are Waymos roaming around, and that is impressive, but if you step back and ask yourself why they haven't scaled, it's simply because AI isn't good enough. In order to work reliably, these cars have to rely on a sub-centimeter resolution scan of the environment they operate in so they have a baseline from which deviations can be detected. This is one of the major reasons they're slow to roll out, and the economics have to be in place to warrant that much effort, the liability, etc. If AI were truly as capable as humans as Waymos seem, then there would be no professional human drivers by now.\n\nThat's not to say it won't eventually happen. If I had to bet, I'd say it probably will happen, but I'm not sure about the timeline. I tend to think that this is going to be an evolution more than a revolution, and that's simply by observing how long it's taken so far to go from the self-driving DARPA challenge to today in spite of the transformer AI architecture being published in 2017.\n\nHaving said all that, I'm not sure many people in the industry will like the changes it introduces regardless. I kind of like coding. I like solving problems like that. I don't like managing people. I'm not sure juggling the output of a half a dozen agents is sufficiently like coding and unlike managing people that I want to do it.",

At the same time there’s a big “what’s more important, reality or perception” thing going on and companies regularly survive huge lapses of judgment. Even if we focus on reality there’s fewer new devs who learn to troubleshoot manually, etc.\n\nThere’s like a meta for AI discourse now here it comes up so frequently.

In most teams I've worked with or closely observed, institutional knowledge is fragmented across:\n\n\n\n\\- Slack threads where a decision was made but the reasoning was never written down\n\n\\- A Notion doc that was updated once and hasn't been touched since the team restructured\n\n\\- A call where the PM explained why a constraint exists, but no one captured it\n\n\\- The senior engineer's head who has been there 4 years\n\n\n\nAI can write the CRUD app in an afternoon. But it can't tell you \\*why\\* the data model is structured the way it is, what regulatory constraint shaped that weird API decision, or that the \"resource availability\" field actually means something different in Q4 because of how budget cycles work. That context is the actual product of 6 weeks of discovery work.\n\n\n\nThe engineers who are hardest to replace aren't the ones who write the most code — they're the ones who hold enough cross-system, cross-organizational context that they can evaluate whether a proposed solution will actually work in the real environment the company operates in.\n\n\n\nAI coding productivity compounds on top of that judgment. It doesn't replace it. And ironically, the more code gets generated faster, the \\*more\\* valuable the person who understands what shouldn't be built becomes.",

From startups 4 people to sme 8-14 people to 60+ people dev team to department. \n\nWe rarely code. Most of the time we're deciding what to build instead of coding. And for products that has many state holders like Linear for example. Although there are many user request some certain features, but it might be at a cost of sacrificing other stake holders experience, there are trades off that AI just cant evaluat. \n\nMicrosoft is probably the best example. They have many many many atake holders. Their products has been shitting by people for decades for being complex, unnecessary features, and so much more. But they didnt started that way, it was over the years of user requesting features, and they kept saying yes, until today only enterprise people are \"forced\" to use it, otherwise nobody would ever want to use Microsoft Word or suite. \n\nBy stake holders I meant there are \"users\", \"buyers\", \"managers\" and more depends on the situation. And each of then has their own need. If one of them decided not to engage. Then the whole product might collapse. Making the manager workflow easier at a cost of sacrificing users experience.

I did not make a single job application. That same week I had \\~10 phone calls and over the following week, 5 interviews. That seems like a healthy job market from a candidate perspective.\n\nSome reasons I don't see developer jobs being replaced, or even necessarily reduced:\n\n1. ***Inertia***. Humans resist change. Most businesses are run by groups of humans. So hiring decisions won't immediately influenced by AI considerations because so many people simply have not mentally caught up yet.\n2. ***Switching costs***. Businesses cannot, or are unwilling to, take the risk of immediately decommissioning legacy systems and switching to AI. As long as legacy systems stay in place, legacy engineers are needed to maintain them. Banks are still known to run on old versions of Java and Oracle.\n3. ***Complexity of AI tools***. Everyone focuses on consumer AI tools like ChatGPT, which are simple enough for a child to use. But businesses-oriented AI tools of all stripes (not only coding assistants) are more complex and require careful, structured, specific prompts and/or other context to be provided. The complexity level is on a similar order to software development.\n4. ***Limitations of AI***. There are certain things AI still cannot really do. Anything involving fine-motor physical activities, such as swiping at the security gates and selecting an elevator floor, is not yet widely available at a cheap price as a robot. Some businesses still require these manual, physical processes, and as such, need a human to be on-site. Yes, this is still the case in 2026. If you question why, see \"1. Intertia\". ",

          "text": "I read something interesting on here the other day and it’s had me thinking. \n\nRight now, the fight for AI dominance is tough. You got all these firms burning VC money just to get market share and eventually when a few of them die, one will come out victorious and become what Google became for search. You will have your bings, opera etc but what Google was for search is what they’re all fighting for. (Listen to the Google episode on Acquired to learn about how they got there- very similar to what’s going on right now in AI) \n\nNow, when the dust has settled and we have our winner - devs will be relying on this platform very heavily. It’s not just as simple as model inference that people can just spin up local models for but it will have a moat that i can’t even think of right now. Either it’s so ingrained into a normal developer workflow or not using it puts you at a disadvantage so your firm will lose competitive edge. I.e your LOB will say “no we have to use that service because our competitors use that service”. At which point, the owner of the service will jack up prices to the point where businesses will have to pay. At some point, I think it will be a setup like Bloomberg terminals in finance. Firms pay a yearly subscription of like 20k or something, but they NEED it to stay competitive - no one’s putting booomberg out of business anytime soon. \n\nWhat did the introduction of Bloomberg terminals do to finance? Changed the whole game! A whole industry of people had to retrain, get skilled on it, Bloomberg introduced new features to the point where finance companies are kind of stuck now - if you don’t have a Bloomberg then what the hell is your firm doing. \n\nBut it becomes more nuanced than that becomes of how agentic these models are becoming. The LOB no longer have to employ as many X employees for Y output as they rely heavily on their “terminal” to do more work. It’s a hefty price which gets priced into the market rate of devs. What happened in finance? Companies assume that devs will be more valuable using this terminal that they’re willing to pay a new market rate for the productivity. Will we all lose our jobs? No. Because sometimes firms are not thinking about productivity of their own company but rather the relative productivity. “Am I more productive than my competitor”. Let’s say your competitor just hired a bunch of top tier devs AND has the terminal, you’re going to lose. \n\nAnd so the cycle will keep cycling. We will keep getting hired and fired until we reach an equilibrium of dev to terminal ratio where it’s economically viable. \n\nCool, so what am I doing to prepare for this? Stronger fundamentals. Just look at the finance world. Even with the Bloomberg terminals and “unlimited knowledge at their fingertips” it’s still the veterans that see signal and monetise it. Give 10 juniors and 1 senior trader the same information, the senior trader will probably make more than all the juniors combined. Same with tech. The seniors will become insanely productive and the juniors will be treading water. For anyone junior reading this, hurry the f up and get senior. Read your books on system design, data intensive apps, networking, comp arch and become cracked to the point where you’re the senior that can beat 10 juniors. If you get fired, you’re at peace because you know you can still get by.…\n\nOr maybe I’m just coping and we’re all fucked. Good day 👋🏽",

This company is planning to hit $100mil in ARR this year. \n\nI don’t really understand the numbers of how that could possibly be the case for regular devs that have a small stake in the company to get paid out that much even if a qualifying event happens like an acquisition. \n\nCan anyone shed light on the calculations for determining this?",

Only once has my equity been worth more than $1m. almost always buyouts end up with primarily equity in whoever is acquiring you and almost always that is worth basically nothing.\n\nI can't complain. I am very well off. But even for people at the very top of the org chart for even big dollar acquisitions are often non events.\n\nAfter 28 years the people I know who have made big money all went to big tech and just moved up into director level roles. Money has never really been my goal (beyond what I need for a comfortable life) and startups have provided that along with a version of work I intensely enjoy. But it's not lost on me that I have mostly labored to make other people very wealthy.\n\nTo bring this back to OP: that CEO is full of shit. He has no idea what the worth of the thing will be. The far and away most likely outcome is the whole thing fails and is sold for parts in three years. The second most likely outcome (by a lot) is that it truly succeeds and the CEO gets paid along with the investors while everyone else is given equity in yet another company that almost for sure fails to return on its employee equity.\n\nEvery other outcome is usually bad.\n\nIt's why Ycombinator has increased its class size so much. They need stakes in hundreds of companies per year to find the ones that matter.",

Selling electrons.  Capital expenditure vs. revenue, cost of production of each unit vs. revenue for each sale.  Google/Yahoo did similar for the value of \"the internet\".\n\nSo modest investments from venture capital turned into huge revenues, which skyrocketed the valuations.  That let the janitor with 100 pre-any-splits shares of Apple/MS/etc. be really rich because of that.\n\nBut that just won't happen anymore, outside some completely new industry that nobody else sees coming.\n\nNot only are things like ideas and intellectual property easier to value, now (within several orders of magnitude, at least), but the investment class is careful to keep much more of the profit for themselves.\n\nBasically, unless you literally got a stake in the company *before* any sort of VC got involved, the stock options are almost certainly designed to leave your payout pretty modest.  If you're very, very early in the company (in the first 10 or 100 employees) and it does very, very well, then you might get a can-buy-a-house-in-Silicon-Valley chunk of change.\n\nStock options at a company with good management and a good idea can yield you a very nice, comfortable bonus.  It's not going to bump you up a social class.  Never take stock option in lieu of decent pay.",

          "text": "Never trust anyone that makes specific assertions about payouts for equity comp in a private company.\n\nThey are either financially incompetent or dishonest. Unless they are currently finalizing a deal to sell, they can't know. And even then, deals fall through all of the time, so it would STILL be reckless to assert a number even if they had the term sheet in front of them.\n\nThey do not know what company will buy them, what their own financials will be then, what the macro environment will be then, what multiples their kind of business will get at sale or how their business will be slotted into that range, how much leverage they will have in the negotiation, how much flexibility the buyer will have, how long in the future that will be and how much dilution there will have been by then from additional fundraising in funding environments that they can't predict. They can't know basically anything, really. \n\nThat said:\n\nThe math is that you are either paid in rsus (stock) or options (the right to buy stock at a specific price).\n\nThe company overall has a number of shares it is divided into overall, some valuation, and a number of shares you are given.\n\nIf you are given shares rather than options, the present value is the price of the company times the percentage of the company you own, aka your shares over total shares.\n\nIf you are given options their value is far more complicated (usually the exercise price is the current value when you're given them so naively they're worth $0 [convenient for taxes]), but assume they're worth somewhere between a quarter and a half of the share value above. That is roughly what a financial model would say. No normal financial model would say they are worth more than half a share. Anyone who tells you otherwise is incompetent or lying. That is a common lie, pretending options are worth 1:1 with shares. There are tax advantages, but they have massive downside risk that shares don't have because they are worth $0 if the company doesn't grow.\n\nThat is the present value of the equity, which is the only thing you can know at all, and even still that is not super real because you can't sell the shares. They are illiquid. Even in a sale there are liquidation preferences and people in front of you in line might eat before you can get fed.\n\nThat said, if you really believe in the specific team and their company, and you have a decent slice as calculated above, where they have a real chance at winning a big market, the future value can be extreme and worth betting on.\n\nGenerally though, someone asserting a particular exit value when communicating about comp is either not sophisticated enough to be that guy, or thinks their team is stupid, and in either case they probably won't be the winner.\n\nIn terms of future value, basically the future value of the business is a multiple of how much money the company holds plus how much money people believe it will make over time, with the strongest evidence being how much money it currently makes, and with a very strong preference to making money sooner. If you have a clear path to the company making a lot more money than it currently does, probably it will be worth more. Although, sometimes the market is wrong about predicting how much money a company will make in the future in both directions, or the market is just not buying. So even that's hard for a full time professional investor to model to turn it into predictions about share price in the future, even if they somehow knew how much money it will make.\n\nBut yeah, evaluate the equity at the last round value, or shift it up by the amount they've grown since they last raised, maybe some leeway if growth accelerated and product market fit really seems obvious now and wasn't before. Do not value it based on some absurd claim about a specific future value. The investors in the VC that bought in aren't dumb. They are better at valuing the business than you. And they shouldn't get a better price than employees. So what they pay is what you should consider yourself to be paying, as in that's the value of that comp.\n\nSource: I have gone through acquisition from joining a small startup and have fought for, defined, and then educated people about the employee equity program at a decently large company.",

And, you know, literally $0 several times. \n\nThat $1.5MM was *painful*, because the transaction was a stock-only exchange with a six-month lockup, and we got acquired just in time for the acquiring company to lose 96% of its value in the  dot-com crash. That $1.5 million turned into $50k, which ain't NOTHING, but it ain't no $2.5 million, either.\n\nIn the end, you can only value them at $0, because the stock pool can get diluted at any time, not even counting shenanigans with different stock classes, reverse acquisitions, etc.",

Did he mention that too? :) Company might do not well in the future, gets forced to sell and only ones with the special class stock might get a payout (founders, investors) and none for employees.\n\nCalculation is simple: you get stock options. ISO likely but NSO too. Companies does external valuation called 409A and sets the FMV (fair market value). It's \"external\" because company isn't public yet. Initial FMV is the strike price (the price you pay to buy the stock). Once a company goes IPO, you can sell your options after 6 month. Your gain is sell price - strike price.\n\nRemember that it's all \"high risk, high gain\".\n\nLet's just say company does make $100M ARR, and, for the sake of simplicity, the valuation is 10x of that so $1B. Also lets assume you join at $1B valuation and your grant is stock option that's worth $100k.\n\nIn order for that $100k to go $1M, you need company to grow 11x. 100k\\*11 (appreciated) - 100k (strike price) = 1M.\n\nWould it trivial for $1B company to grow $11B in N years? Depends. I'd say it's pretty hard.\n\nI've been at many failed startups and their story is about the same. \"We are valuated at D dollars, ARR growing mega fast, our customers are fortune 500s, picked as top K Deloitte ABC, etc, etc\". If I had a secret formula that could tell which ones will succeed and which won't, I'd be an angel investor making a fortune :)\n\nIt's very likely you won't exit with $1-10M. Startups are a lot more fun than FAANG though, but with a lot less pay.",

          "text": "The math is pretty simple to value a given amount of equity. Take the share price, and multiply it by the number of shares you have (minus the strike price if they’re ISOs rather than RSUs).\n\nThe question is “what is the value of a share.” If the company is actually close to an IPO or an acquisition, they will have a 409a valuation calculated by a bank. This represents what they are *actually worth,* given their cash and capital assets, revenue, and intellectual property value. It’s still made up, but it’s at least made up based on standard accounting practices. ISOs generally have to be issued with a strike price near the 409a valuation (it’s the whole reason it was invented after the Enron debacle).\n\nThey will also have a “fare market value.” This is what investors paid at their last fund raising round. The further away the startup is from IPO’ing or being acquired, the further away this number will be from the 409a. This is usually the number that recruiters will use to make claims on what the value of equity is, and it’s usually the number that equity grants themselves are valued against: a company will give you, for example, a $1.2mil grant, and this will be converted into a number of shares by dividing that value by the FMV on a given date.\n\nOnce a company is public, the stock price is the FMV is the 409a, so all these same calculations are just done off the public stock price.\n\nBut as for the feasibility of the claim: a $1mil payout would require you to own 1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $100mil, or 0.1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $1bil. 1% of a company may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually quite a large ownership stake, so I would not expect a company with more than 10-15 employees to be giving grants that large. Even founding engineers generally only get in the 2-3% range if their VCs are generous with the cap table.\n\nBasically, for this person’s statement to be true, it would probably mean they’re expecting an acquisition/IPO in the $10bil+ range. That’s a lot of money. You would know if this company actually has a chance to do that.\n\nBut it can never hurt to ask how they came to that valuation. \n",

The things that complicate it are dilution and stock preferences. I'm happy to explain the mechanics of both if you're interested (TLDR: dilution means that your percentage decreases every time they raise VC funding, preference means that at sale time investors can choose to take their money back and squeeze everyone else out), but it almost certainly doesn't really change how you should think about equity. \n\nIf you're early enough to have a significant number of shares, you don't have enough information to predict how all of the fundraising and sale details will shake out. If you're late enough to have useful information about all of that, you won't get enough shares to be worth anything. I just mentally ballpark startup equity as having an expected value around $10K and move on. Maybe it will go out of business and be worth nothing, maybe it will exit for way higher and pleasantly surprise me, I have no idea.

You need to know the number of options/shares in the pool. \n\nIt’s hard to get that number out of some companies, and it obviously grows with every round of funding. \n\nOn average say there is 100 million options (or maybe 150 million) in the pool by the time the company IPOs. \n\n$100m is the magic number companies use to IPO at, early 2010s it was $50m ARR. Now, $200m ARR? Wallstreet moves the goal posts. \n\n$100m revenue / number shares at IPO gives the price per share simply put. \n\nThen you have the multiplier that recurring revenue SaaS companies earn because their revenue can be predicted forward some years. \n\nIt use to see crazy multiples, 35x 50x revenue. These days I hear it’s mostly 6-8x revenue. \n\nSo if your company is making $100m revenue a year, times the 6x multiplier, divided by number options in the pool, you get the rough share price at IPO. Then it goes crazy up or down from there. \n\nMost companies will aim to IPO at $20 a share, no idea why I have just always heard it’s a magic number for NASDAQ IPOs. \n\nSo you can work out if you will have share splits/reverse splits and what your equity is possibly going to be if at $20 a share at IPO the company needs to reduce the number in the pool to make “$100m ARR * multiplier / pool size = $20” revenue math to work out. \n\n\nI wrote this pretty quickly but if anything doesn’t make sense ask follow ups. \n\nIf anyone has anything to add I got wrong let me know, at the end of the day I am much more an engineer than I am a business guy.",

The company consisted of only 3 people, and the deal was structured primarily around the 3 of us getting jobs in the acquiring company. We also received a cash payout of $25k each, plus a bunch of stock options. The stock options vest at the end of this year, and I'll be granted close to 20k options, with an exercise price of about $8 per option. That means that I have to pay $8 per option in order to own the stock, so it would cost me $160k to obtain my stock.\n\nThe thing is, this company is not yet public, so any stock options are completely worthless right now. When they do go public, I have to pray that the stock price is a decent amount higher than $8 per share in order to actually make any money from the stock options. There hasn't been any talk of going public lately, but I'm sure that they'll do an IPO sooner or later.\n\nSo until the company goes public, my payout from the sale of the company was $25k cash and a job that pays $140k salary (fully remote with good benefits and PTO).",

That’s not the issue.\n\nThe issue is I’m tired of always being the one who fixes things that should be designed better from start.

Looking at it another way - if someone introduced a high availability architecture with scalability from the get go and it scales incorrectly with the problems of today then not only is the program bad and costly when load isn’t there, it may actively make fixing things worse.\n\nIn the end, we’re all making decisions without full context - no one has a crystal ball that tells them if a project will succeed and hindsight is easy because it means we’re able to make decisions with more context.\n\nThe question may be “what is the role of the senior+ engineer outside of immediate firefighting?”\n\nI think the answers are:\n\n* Put tools in place (tests, CI, observability, reviews, etc.) to ensure that the fix is applied consistently and has the same effects over time.\n* Convince the culture to build things with more reliability - get things hooked up to observability and get the right notifications firing\n\nBasically - now that the fire has been put out or at least put into a manageable state, how do we implement processes technical or otherwise to stop firefighting?\n\nNot every manager or culture will be receptive to approaching things like this but in those cases it’s best to vote with your feet. There are good engineering cultures in the world and it’s possible the one you’re in won’t let you make the necessary changes to get out of firefighting due to any number of reasons - The software isn’t perceived to be critical to the success of the business, leadership doesn’t value engineering, the rate of business to keep the company alive requires a pace of development that requires more/better people and the investment budget isn’t there, etc.",

The team is refusing to be a team by making one person the backstop for every architectural shortcut.\n\nThe real question isn't \"how do I say no,\" it's \"what am I getting for saying yes.\" Because right now the answer is: more yes. If the fixing led somewhere—a principal title, an architecture role, a mandate to actually prevent this stuff—that's a different calculation. If it's just an infinite loop of fires, you're not building a career, you're maintaining someone else's.\n\nStart making the cost visible.

This is causing me a serious identity crisis as I feel like any skill I had at anything is constantly just withering away due to lack of use. 1 more year of this job and I'll be totally irrelevant.\n\nNow, the good part is that I can pretty much self-define what the role is and what I do. I've been trying to leverage it into an AI/service design job, but... it seems like any promotions from here (like CPO/CTO) are even more filled with this crappy manager stuff.\n\nDamn, do I miss coding.

Ackoff who's a big time author and speaker in the systems thinking space, and in one of his talks he goes through the age of industrial revolution and how many companies in the 1900s did studies just to discover that people get bored really quickly doing the same things over and over. It's just a thing you can't escape.\n\nI've often reflected on this as I've also noticed that every project I've been on, after around two years, I get bored of it. You already understand the problem space, the solutions, and it doesn't excite you in the least. Even now I'm struggling with boredom as the application I'm working with is just so simple, and the biggest problems there are just in communication and the customer being difficult. Even now the biggest challenge is putting this app in the cloud to run on one VM, with one database, and somehow I'm constantly having to wait because I don't have permission to set up access to resources, or I have to figure out why someone thought it was a good idea to put three applications inside one VM.. It's just so boring.",

Equally weighted across all nations would skew this significantly if 99% of users are just in South Africa for example\"\n\nHow would you feel if a senior engineer / staff engineer / EM answered in this way? Rather than jumping straight to technical solutions.\n\nE: re all the people talking about \"do we want users in Africa?\" my point is, not all businesses need to serve all regions. A regional newspaper, a cable company that only services some states, or a boot strapped B2B company should probably not spend any money investing in Africa. It just doesn't have a good ROI.

          "text": "This, to me, is one of the most frustrating parts of interviewing at modern tech companies.  The questions you're asking are the real life correct questions to ask.  They are also the types of questions most engineers don't think to ask until they hit staff level or higher, but -havent- gone up the management ladder yet (which atrophies this a bit, i speak from experience).\n\nWhat this all means, is delending on your interviewer, these questions are very likely correct, but -above- the interviewing person's skill level to see the value of.\n\nIf I'm being asked this interview question by a senior dev, theres a huge chance they would assume a response like \"how is this 700ms being calculated\" as a delay tactic because you don't know a good answer.  Because if they were the type of person to realize that africa is too big of a place to fix with \"add more cdns\" and that a single 700ms latency doesn't make sense for an entire continent, then they wouldn't still be a senior engineer.  \n\nThat said, part of being a staff eng is knowing how to talk to people with kess experience than you.  So you could, and probably should say, something like \"well there are a lot of ways to fix a latency issue like this.  We would probably investigate geocaching and regional cdns for example.  I could list some strategies like these if you're talking about fixing geographic katency im the general sense.  But if you're asking specifically about the example you've given, then I'd want to dive in a but deeper, because a 700ms latency fir the entire continent of africa seems a little suspect.  Do you know what the geographical distribution that elad to that number is?\"\n\nI would think in most situations that would impress the senior and be the right answer.  If the senior is open minded to it it would work.\n\nBut if you do this to every question, then they are never going to get to the point of testing your technical chops either.\n\nWhere this gets really bad, though, is when you get senior engineers asking leetcode style questions, which is what a lot of them do nowadays.  The hardest part i have with leetcode is how, if you actually think about the question for a few minutes, many (most?) of the questions completely fall apart with the type of analysis you're talking about.\n\nThe last time i opened a leetcode study book, which was admittedly a decade ago, I couldn't get passed the first question.  Because while it was obvious the question was looking for some sort of fancy breadth first search algorithm, i knew the actual domain the question was supposed to be about, and realized that 95% of the traffic was going to come from one point, meaning that any generic search algorithm would be irl wrong.  But good luck explaining that to someone reciting from a leetcode question sheet.\n\nSo i guess the answer is, know your audience, i suppose.  And chalk this up as yet another reason why modern tech interviewing is broken.  You need to show your ability to ask these questions because this is what separates you from younger devs, but chances are, you are soeaking to a younger dev and have to speak their language as well.",

Good interviewers are looking for people who challenge assumptions and ask clarifying questions before throwing solutions at poorly defined problems. The \"outside the box\" answers you listed aren't outside the box at all - they're the fundamentals of engineering leadership. Anyone can regurgitate CDN and regional servers, but understanding business context, validating the problem scope, and questioning data quality shows you've been burned by jumping to solutions too quickly in the past. That said, you do need to eventually provide technical solutions after establishing context, so the sweet spot is asking 2-3 clarifying questions that expose your thought process, then walking through potential solutions based on different scenarios.\n\nThe catch is that not all interviewers are good at their jobs, and some will mark you down for not immediately diving into technical details because they're reading from a rubric. You can usually gauge this in the first few minutes - if they seem annoyed by your questions or try to rush you past them, pivot faster to the technical stuff. If they engage with your questions and seem interested in the discussion, you've found someone who gets it. I'm on the team that built [AI copilot for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and from what job seekers tell me, practicing this balance of strategic questioning before technical deep-dives is what helped them land senior roles.",

With every year that passed in my career I was excited to be learning something new. FrontEnd, BackEndnd, to FullStack. Every year I felt like I leveled up a developer. It was like a game: each promotion provided me with new year, every job change was a new level to learn.  Now, almost 8 years later I feel like I've plateaued at the senior engineering level. I don't even know if i love coding anymore, but the money's good and as things are getting more expensive I want to position myself for a promotion.\n\nWith the advent of AI, I feel like i've become more of a prompt engineer than anything. I feel like I can't even take the time out to learn new languages or frameworks because the demand for pumping out work has become so high. Even architecture diagrams are design nowadays with AI. Now, it's just a job like any other. \n\nFor those of you who've been developing for some time, what did it take for you to make the move from senior to staff? And for those of you who've done it more recently did that look any different than your older peers? Should I just grind Leetcode and pray I end up at a MANGA that doesn't lay me off,  just learn a sub-domain really well instead, or just suck it up and be thankful I have a job? ",

I was reading code in the browser debug window and tracing how it worked. Other peoples' code. And I had no idea what it did or was supposed to do. So doing this really taught me a lot, but the feedback loop was slow and research was tricky. \n\nYou aren't barred from reading code. You absolutely should understand all of the code you commit and how it works. AI doesn't excuse you from that responsibility. You really have a great chance now to learn quite a few languages. I've become much more adept at python, go and rust since incorporating LLMs into my workflow. In fact, it's really nice because if there's some aspect I don't understand, I copy and paste it into the context and get a brief explainer. I double check it against the docs and boom, whole new concept learned. \n\nAnyway, this part isn't the part of LLMs that bothers me. It's the part where people don't double check their work, and companies force it down our throats.",

It’s not an engineering book, it’s a negotiation book written by a former FBI hostage negotiator turned consultant. In it, he talks about incentives and understanding what people want from a conversation and using that to create non-zero sum outcomes, and even when you deal with someone who might be getting a rawer deal, explaining to them respectfully why their desired outcome lost out. It’s the biggest tool in my arsenal every day.",

          "text": "Grinding leetcode won't help, unless you mean just for the sake of getting into a bigger company and (re-) starting the progression to Staff there. Getting to staff is mostly about understanding how to overcome organizational challenges (convincing engineers to do the right thing (spoiler: it is not always going to be the best technical thing), and convincing leadership to agree to let engineers spend time doing the right thing (which is not usually going to be the fastest or easiest thing)), and then using that ability to actually get useful things done. That is a two way street since you need to understand what matters both to fellow (particularly less experienced) engineers, and what matters to management, figure out a solution that actually satisfies both, and then actually convince everyone to do that. IMO it is much easier to do that in a company and space you are very familiar with than in a new one.\n\nAI is nice because the above is usually so time consuming that you are not going to find time to actually code anything significant yourself, unless there are other Staff you can split responsibilities with. If you get familiar with AI tooling, you can still get quite a bit of actual code out the door by giving it quick instructions between meetings and reviewing its work. IMO this is a lot less satisfying than coding yourself, but it's like having you own personal intern that you don't have to feel bad about not responding to immediately.\n\nedit: there is a tendency in engineering forums to call all of this \"politics\", but it isn't. While there definitely is more politics at higher levels, the vast majority of the above is just paying attention to who you're talking to and trying to speak to them in a way they will understand and be reassured by. I have had to step into so many escalations where two teams have been disagreeing over something for days/weeks and I can't understand why - then I listen in on a call and there isn't actually an disagreement on technical grounds. One of them is just saying describing the solution in one way highlighting what is important to them, and not understanding what the other one wants from it, and my contribution ends up being just repeating what the first one said, but explaining how it will satisfy the second party too. It is stupid, I don't know how these otherwise intelligent and rational people can have spent a week on this issue without figuring it out, but here we are.",

I then pad out my time by staying work-focused, but doing things like; taking a training course to improve my skillset; reading through the latest tech news to stay on top of things; or browse some some relevant social media. \n\nAs I've gotten better with my internal time estimations, I've had to put in less long days. \n\nI've set myself these priorities:\n-Advance the stories everyday (no slacking)\n-Meet deadlines (if you missed them, you've mismanaged your time, and any time spent on the priorities below will reflect poorly)\n-Increase local knowledge (keep up on incoming PRs, read through an unfamiliar section of code)\n-Increase professional knowledge (training courses, professional articles)\n-Find knowledge gaps (social media: reddit, linkedin, relevant substack, etc)",

When I finish a ticket early, I force myself to immediately pick up the next thing before the laziness kicks in - even if it's just reading the requirements or sketching out an approach. The momentum matters more than the output in that moment.\n\n\n\nThe other thing that worked: I started using those slack periods for the stuff I always wish I had time for - writing better tests, refactoring that gnarly module, updating docs, or doing a deeper code review for a teammate. These don't feel as pressured as sprint work but they keep me engaged and they're genuinely valuable.\n\n\n\nHonestly though, I think some of this is just how our brains work with deadlines.

Ok close out the project\n\nSo obviously while I obviously end up moving on to the next thing, 6 months from now when a cert expires, a  cloud resource SKU retires, or we need to scale (and didnt expect it? ) thats when the very unproductive: \"remember and repeat\" rework happens. \n\nMy advice is not to focus so much on \"trying to get ahead\" but doing as much bare minimum / POC needed for the acceptance criteria. Even if its a large task? Define some milestones at which you can gather feedback from your app owner. \n\nThe idea is to \"give them the opportunity to shift priorities on you\" before you've commited too much of your 4 hour day to it. There is no magic formula for this ( for example: I was recently given a POC implementation with a product I had never used before. So I:  \n\\- allocated time for learning, discovery  \n\\- went to my PO with \"feedback so far'   \n\\- as it turns out, the first few smoke test/POC's i did had a hefty usage fee (based on how WE were utilizing it  \n\\- So the rest of the project got scrapped and we effectivbely went back to the drawing board looking at other options\n\nI dont think im exagerating when I say this happens 7 / 10 for most project efforts.   \nBut does this make sense? by strategically positioning yourself and your time, you dont exactly \"get ahead\" .... but helps prevent you from falling behind  \n\n\n\n\n",

In 8 hours, a person writes 5000 lines of code—do you have 5000 lines written today?\n\n**P 2/27/2026 5:35 PM** • Go ahead and commit what you’ve done today for me so I can see\n\n13 YOE FE dev, 3.5+ years in current company, my boss bang ONLY me and one more BE dev to the office, 5 days per week, from a remote only position. The other dev didn't go to the office so he got disciplinary warnings and was forced to quit. I am going every day. My boss has never set foot in the office. He was forcing more and more work on me and I worked more and more and now he wants me to do a quite complex 8 story points ticket in 3 hours. My 3 other BE devs write about 50 lines of code per day average. I write about 200-300, excluding tests. Obviously lines of code is NOT a good metric for effectiveness. Besides that, during the first half of the day I was communicating with other teams about various different FE issues and other concerns.\n\nMy boss is popular for having done similar stuff to every other dev under his wing as well, but now it seems he really wants to do everything within his powers to get rid of me, because as he last stated, I am 30% higher paid than the other FE devs, but in reality I'm 20% less paid than all other BE devs and there's lots of FE work and not that much BE work.\n\nI tried talking with HR but they are completely on his side and I am powerless. I can only think of talking with his manager who is a friend of mine but I doubt it will be successful because I've heard he is on his side as well.\n\nObviously I've just started to prep my CV but is there something else I can do about it?\n\nThanks heaps!",

But none of them were true. \"His machine was down.\" OK, tell me and I'll have someone else do it. But the real excuse was he was having issues with his spouse.\n\nI understand he didn't want to share that but coming up with contradicting stories is not what I wanted to hear. Especially inviting him on a project where there were high stakes -- direct oversight by CxOs on their pet work. High visibility. So he knew the stakes. The guy kept on missing simple deadlines. I would throw him softballs because I had 4 other guys who were highly productive, busy and delivering.  \nSoftballs are basically 10-15 minute tasks I could do myself or anyone else. But since it was in the backlog, he could pick them up. So I didn't want to deal with a guy with marital issues.

OP.. you need to leave. Period. What I would do.. and this job market sucks REALLYB AD right now.. but I'd just keep on gas lighting this guy.. hell I'd put in 5000 lines of AI generated slop.. show him you did it, etc.. and last as long as you can while you find another job and/or cut costs to survive, etc. This will NEVER EVER 100% of the time EVER work in your favor. If the boss above him is friend/loves the dude.. you will never get THEM fired and win. They always win. It's better to leave and then have more people UNDER that dude leave/quit/fired.. so it will hopefully wake up his bosses as to how bad of a manager he/she is. \n\n",

But we also had a large home for the family of 7... and in a very good area with K-12 in the top 1% of the state year after year so we didnt pay for private schools. Even with 200K+ salary.. mortgage, 2 cars, food for 5 teenagers, energy 2.5x in 5 years price.. etc.. that shit easily eats 10K+ a month.. which was our take home after taxes.

          "text": "Based on your responses, it seems like you and your manager are both frustrated with each other and being passive aggressive and communicating badly. This snipping back and forth is not good. Realistically without context it’s hard to know who to blame, and honestly both of you should be acting more professionally. But humans do get frustrated and stuff, so it’s understandable that things can go south like this. \n\nIf your boss really is a toxic micromanager, the advice to find a new job is correct. Don’t quit without a job unless your wellbeing is really suffering (and make sure you have a safety net even then). I would also consider using ai to churn out more code in the meantime (bit of malicious compliance, but make sure it’s defensible if someone calls you on it.)\n\nAs far as fixing this, you need to be communicating status, challenges and progress more proactively. You mentioned in your comments you’re doing support work on top of this stuff and that the acs keep changing. Does your boss know about the support work and do they think it’s valuable for you to spend time on? I’ve seen many instances of developers doing glue work that either was not very valuable or not their job. If that’s you, you might have to stop. If the team suffers as a result, that is your managers problem, and the team can work together to find a fair solution. \n\nIf the acs are changing and it’s preventing you from shipping, you should’ve mentioned that to your boss, ideally before they come knocking. TBH it’s possible you’re being inflexible, but it’s also possible the business doesn’t know what it wants and they’re wasting your time as a result. You should mention that proactively and possibly even tell people you’re going to switch to a different task until the acs are figured out (this can be seen as an escalation and uncooperative though, so be careful.)",

          "text": "How is your manager measuring lines of code?  Is he looking at statistics from commits to a source code management system? \n\nDoes your manager have a boss? \n\nOpen up an anonymous email account and email everyone in the company, including yourself, the following.   \n\nGoogle: industry standard paper on LOC per day\n\nIndustry standard estimates suggest professional developers produce roughly **10 to 12 lines of finished, debugged, and documented code per day**. While developers may type thousands of lines, the net, merged, and tested output is much lower due to debugging, meetings, and planning. This figure applies to large projects, though smaller projects may have higher rates. \n\n* **Average Daily Output:** Often quoted around 10 lines (LOC) per day per developer.\n* **Alternative Perspective:** Some sources suggest 50–100 lines per day can be committed, but the long-term, high-quality average remains closer to 10–12.\n* **Context Matters:** This, or the related metric of \\~2,000–4,000 lines per year, often includes design, testing, and debugging, not just writing new code.\n* **Industry Context:** This rate is relatively language-independent, often used in embedded software and large-scale system development, rather than rapid prototyping.\n* **Limitations:** Lines of Code (LOC) is considered a poor measure of productivity, as it focuses on quantity rather than quality or functionality.  Skeptics Stack Exchange +4\n\nAdd this as well: \n\nWhile there is no official industry standard, a common, rough rule of thumb used for planning is that **1 story point equals roughly 0.5 to 1 day of effort** per team member, assuming a 5-6 hour productive workday. A 3-point story is often equated to 3 days of work. \n\n**Key Considerations for Story Points:**\n\n* **Relative, Not Time-Based:** Story points measure complexity, effort, and risk (using Fibonacci sequences like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), not hours.\n* **Team Velocity:** The \"standard\" depends entirely on your team's historical speed (velocity).\n* **Common Mapping:** Some teams adopt a 1 point = 1 day (or half-day) convention for simplicity in tracking.\n* **Overhead:** A 1-point story rarely takes 8 full hours due to meetings, distractions, and breaks, usually equating closer to 4–6 hours of actual work.  Medium +5\n\n\n\nSubsequently Start some back channel conversations with other managers, HR, etc.    Do this under the guise of being \"confused\".  Given the industry statistics that were sent around - does that mean that my boss doesn't understand what s/he is doing?   TBC - I don't know and I don't believe it.   I'm just confused. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe other thing to do is to commit code more often. \n\nYou get a ticket - it requires fixing three subroutines in three places each.  \n\nThe first thing is to create 9 tickets and/or subtickets.  \n\nOriginal ticket:   Form doesn't validate that currency has the correct number of digits after the decimal point. \n\nThat an be anywhere from 1 commit to 9 commits.    You can even inflate it more by \"forgetting to put conditional compiler statements\" around your debugging code.  \n\nticket 1:  form should restrict input to appropriate number of decimal places based on currency. \n\nticket 2: system needs standard definition of currencies including allowable formats specifying units separator character & decimal digits allowed. \n\nYou should also invent and track your own statistics.  \n\nExtracts per day: \n\nCommits per day: \n\nCompiles per day: \n\nUnit Tests executed per day: \n\nNew tickets opened per day after commits: \n\nTickets closed per day: \n\nMake a point of using the ticket system in your favor: \n\nRequirements unclear: ticket closed.  Ticket opened for requirements correction. Assigned to user or analyst.    \n\nTicket subdivided:   there are nine places where this issue can occur.  Doesn't matter if you can close them all the same way.   Took you an hour to figure that out implies you're now closing nine tickets per hour rather than one. \n\nBasically drown them in paperwork while using the statistics that you generate to emphasize their lack of knowledge and make your self look good. \n\n",

That advice may be a bit outdated given the reality of the present job market.\n\nAssuming you want to keep your job here’s what I recommend. Approach the problem as an engineer would understand the constraints the requirements document the problems and provide a solution.\n\nUnderstand the business drivers, for example, is your company’s cash burn going to be eaten up in the six months it takes you to deliver. Do you need the product launched three months ahead of that burn so that the company can continue without a RIF.\n\nCollect evidence. Management loves numbers and objectivity. Track tickets, how frequently they change. The timing of the changes if it was closer to the end of the project, this adds credibility to your claim that product requirements are changing all the time.\n\nDocument the issues you see. \n\nProvide an alternative solution you feel will work\n\nCreate a narrative, executives have limited attention and respond well to stories\n\nSchedule a call with your supervisors and your supervisor supervisor\n\nPresent your findings. Keep your presentation short 10 minutes absolute max five minutes more desirable.",
