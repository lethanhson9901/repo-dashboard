      "text": "I’m a senior software engineer at a large company with a structured promotion and calibration process. I’ve been at the company since May 2021, so I’m approaching 5 years, and I’ve never been promoted, despite my scope, responsibilities, and level of impact changing significantly over time.\n\nRecently, I was denied a promotion again. My manager said he took my case to the calibration committee, but the final decision was not to promote me now, with the justification being “lack of consistency.” What makes this harder to reconcile is that another engineer at the same level, within the same BU but on a different team, was promoted with around 6 months on the team, while I’ve been on my current team for over a year and at the company for almost five years.\n\nDuring our conversation, my manager used an analogy: someone digging with a pickaxe, very close to finding a treasure, and being encouraged not to give up now. I understand the intention behind it, but I’m struggling to trust that framing. Given my history here, it increasingly feels less like “almost reaching the treasure” and more like the classic donkey-and-the-carrot situation — where the reward is always just a bit further away, keeping you moving without real certainty that it will ever arrive.\n\nAfter that, I started considering a lateral transfer. I communicated this transparently to my manager. He said he understands, but speaking as a mentor, he believes my best chance of promotion would be to wait another 6 months and try again. He was clear that he can’t promise anything, only that he “intends to bring the case again.”\n\nI also spoke with the manager of a potential lateral transfer role and heard something similar: that if my primary goal is promotion, waiting a few more months in my current context might be my best chance.\n\nThe core issue is that I no longer trust the process. Not because I think anyone is lying or acting in bad faith, but because it feels like if there were enough real interest in promoting me now, a criterion like this wouldn’t have been the blocker. The rules seem flexible and dependent on context and people.\n\nThis has started to affect me outside of work: difficulty sleeping, constant rumination, and the feeling that I’m betting my emotional health on a vague promise.\n\nRight now, I’m torn between:\n\n\t•\tstaying where I am and “waiting” for something I no longer believe in;\n\n\t•\tpushing for a lateral transfer to change context;\n\n\t•\tor starting to plan an exit from the company altogether.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\n\nDoes it ever make sense to wait when you no longer believe in the process?\n\nHow would you approach this decision?",

There’s also a quality of years of experience.

When I started ny career at some software company, I wanted to be in development, not \"implementation.\"   They asked me to give them two years, and then put in for a transfer, which I did.   In the 4.5 years I worked at this company, I got a small raise every year, but seriously the money and the title both sucked.\n\nAfter 2 years, by that time a new manager had come in, and my old manager had transfered away.   I was stuck in the same position in Implementation instead of Development.   I also saw people of less ability easily transfer to Development while my manager sat on me and gave me excuse after excuse on why I couldn't transfer.  I was made promises that were later broken.   I saw this same manager do this to other people on my team.\n\nThis is absolutely a fucking horrible situation, and is a clear indication that although your manager may like you, often times their hands are tied by upper management who ... do NOY ... give a shit .. about YOU!!!!!\n\nI'm all with giving a new company a fair shot, but when a promise is broken the first time, then I'm done ... it's too late.   When I get shafted, it's time to move on ... transferring to a new part of the company doesn't work when the company is rotten at it's core.\n\nMy advice is update your resume, and move on.   For years, and years, and years this was often seen as the BEST way to get a better title, a better job, and certainly more money.   I understand the market sucks right now, and it's an EMPLOYERS market.   You have a job, and that's great, use this as an opportunity to find a new job.

It's not an injury people can see, but it's a harm that degrades your ability to operate with high degrees of trust and faith in the process.\n\nYou gotta start the process of a lateral transfer, at a minimum. Once you get passed over twice with no actionable reason, it's impossible to tell if waiting 6 months (again) will ever help, or you're not the guy they'll ever promote past senior. You could simply be out of the trust zone, and the longer you stay the higher the risk of burnout or stalling out your personal growth.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for lateral transfer, and I'm in the process of that now. You can't thrive in an environment you're not aligned with. You can dig in and soldier through, but the moral injury only accumulates when reality and expectations constantly conflict. It's okay to both believe in the process and company, and accept your local position is sub-optimal, and the other path is just to accept it and lower expectations (also valid).\n\nWhen it comes to senior promotions, what you are experiencing is very close to what I'm going through: 2 years a team lead, lead a project with big numerical impact and clear cross team influence, but instead of getting the nod after I pushed to cancel a losing project early, I'm shuffled into a high visibility role on a stacked team and used to de-risk execution. I've done everything I can for a Staff level promotion, and that leadership does not feel rewarded.\n\nIn the corporate game, we must make our own luck. You've executed well, but you can't control if management will recognize it or ever pick you for the next level. Amongst those who go beyond senior, switching teams when sidelined is basically a rite of passage, and a very common story in those who clibh higher. Keep your head up, and good luck!",

It's more of a long term strategy. \n\nI don't trust my company process because we don't have money, so it's really hard to get promoted. My em just find excuses. Knowing this, I know that a changing team will not help me, and the only path is to change company or wait for a lead to leave. \n\nGood luck!",

What would happen then?\n\nWill you seek another promotion? Can you reasonably expect that you won’t face a moving goalpost again? \n\nOtherwise, will you stay for compensation? It takes a few years to get to the next level’s full compensation after a promo.\n\nDo you enjoy the environment and your work so much that you would overlook the others aspects? Then why are you so concerned about the promo in the first place?\n\nThen, I’d lean on the “lacks consistency” motivation. What does that mean, it’s vague and non actionable? Did your manager elaborate? Did he give you actionable feedback to overcome this perception? Do you find this feedback justified?\n\nIf not, how would this perception change over 6 months if it is not being addressed?\n\nThese questions may help you understand your situation better.\n\nMy opinion is that you’re being led on and credible retention risk will likely be the only reason that will change the management’s perception around your promo. Even if you get it after the next 6 months, you already have bad feelings about it and likely won’t enjoy your time then. However, you have the reputation of someone who “lacks consistency”, it will linger and be used against you whenever it is convenient. \n\nThe analogy they made about mining betrays your manager’s gaslighting. I’ll give you a better analogy for your situation: 99% of gamblers quit gambling before winning the great jackpot. If they cared about retaining you long term, they would have promo’d you.\n\nMoving laterally may help you ease the mental cost of doing the full transition. I’d recommend it before leaving the company as interviewing while stressed and desperate is not ideal and may give the interviewers some bad vibes that they will avoid. You will also have it better personal life without all the stress in the current position which is more rewarding than any work reward.\n\nNow, my personal experience is that people who management wants promoted get promoted with weak correlation to gow outstanding they are in their job. I was in the same situation, telling management about my departure plans was the biggest mistake. The narrative around my performance restrospectively turned from positive key-person to “lacks consistency and bad networking”. I moved laterally but the old (adjusted) feedback still haunted me afterwards. Yet I made new friends, contributed to very cool projects and my new management was a lor more considerate and grateful for my efforts.\n\nMy advice is to get out of this bad situation, either by fortifying mentally to endure the current environment without it slipping into your personal life or by leaving to another team or company. Secondly, never expect promotions, you signed a contact to be paid X for work at a given Y level that outlines expectations and responsibilities. The company may need more work and they need to offer you the rewards for doing more, not otherwise. If you think you can perform at a higher level, go interview and take what’s yours.\n\nI hope we’ll hear from you in the next few months and that you’ll be in a better emotional and material position.",

If your org doesn’t have a business justification to have two L6s, it doesn’t matter how well you perform, you will *never* be promoted. This also is up to your manager or your manager’s manager: they have to both argue that there should be an L6 at all, and that you should be that L6.

It's a constant pain managing upwards because I'm doing 2x-3x the work for 0.5x the pay. \n\nAll of this along with doing days and days of unpaid overtime to deliver on goals has left a bad taste in my mouth for some time. On top of this my 2nd line manager decided to obliterate any remaining good will by calling me insubordinate, because I dared questioned his almighty power because because due to backlogs of work he doesn't seem to understand we have to do, I hadn't managed to deal with his frankly ridiculous demand by email that I do yet more of his job for him for the nth time. \n\nDo what I've done, the time is now to use your zeal and frustration with the situation and put it to good use. Don't waste it on the useless management you have in front of you blocking the way, use it to impress new managers and get the job and position you deserve.\n\nI've just accepted a new position at a new company being paid more money and with a defined fixed pay scale of what I'll earn in future years (just the nature of the business I'm applying to but it's a nice perk to know where I'll stand for the time I'm there). I'll be better off, with clearer defined responsibilities, management above me who from speaking to their staff have nothing but good things to say about the leadership and importantly a business with a direction I agree with is the right way forwards. \n\nAs others have said, keep it to yourself, plan your exit and when the change comes it will hurt them more than you. It's going to cost a lot of time and money to get someone to replace you and do what you're doing as it's not just the costs of recruitment, but they need to get that new person upskilled on whatever you've been working on. \n\nFor where I am currently, we have a huge back catalogue of things that just work and require little by way of attention. When they do require attention, I'm the only person on the team who has the knowledge of how to maintain them. All I've got are brand new juniors (see point about poor managers) that for good reason the decision is that they don't want them tinkering with old code without them being up to speed yet and it's a slow process as they are all very green.\n\nUnfortunately for the management team, they have never bothered to acknowledge and protect the business against this current bus factor problem (it's just me) after repeatedly being told they should have a formal plan for how they want things documented should anything happen. Case in point I was off sick for a couple of days recently and incidents came in, but no one dealt with them until I did when I returned from my sick leave. \n\nCurrently they don't know I'm about to hand my notice in, and when I do, there's some leave to be taken as well. So my tenure with them will be shorter than their first expect and I cannot wait to watch them scrabbling to get what they can out of me before it's too late.\n\nIt's a bed of their own making, and it's the same for you OP. If you feel you're ready for it and your manager is being serious they believe you deserve it too, then it's time to quietly plan your exit for new pastures and know leaving is the right choice. Do it on your terms (I took 6 months to get to this point) so put those feelers out to see if it's worth it for you too!",

Suggest a monthly check-in where you can look ahead together at the types of projects, behaviors, or other elements that you can take on to help exhibit what they're looking for. Keep a doc where you write down what you've visibly done in the past month during that conversation, capture it in the moment with their collaboration. Approach it from a \"I'm arming you to make the best case possible, I appreciate you continuing to take this back to them\".

          "text": "I had a similar situation last year. Year after year of stellar reviews, a verbal promise of the promotion from my direct manager, and a pretty good vote of confidence from my skip level. Everything looked good. And then the calibration committee shot it down. The reason I got was that I wasn’t impacting the org as a whole — only my team. This was only half true. On the one hand, I’d never been told that was an expectation. On the other, I’d done several things that impacted the entire org. \n\nSo I did what you did. Tried to push for a lateral move (into architecture) only to be told basically the same thing. However, that manger was in the calibration meetings, whereas my manager and my skip level were not. And he told me flat out that the reason I wasn’t promoted was because not enough of the people in that room knew who I was. \n\nI work remote, but we have options for both hybrid and remote depending on location. The fact of the matter is that I’d need to go into the office and run shoulders and play politics with the right people if I wanted the title. I won’t do that. I made the mistake of getting a little too emotional about it with my boss and my skip level both. Fortunately we’re all close, so they kept it to themselves, commiserated with me and accepted I was going to have to leave to get the title and raise. I haven’t left yet, but that’s mostly out of a lack of urgency. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can be great at your job, but it’s a popularity contest at the higher levels. It sucks, but that’s the corporate world. I was already pulling sixty-plus hour weeks trying to get promoted. I wasn’t going to work any harder for no reward. I decided to tone it down and focus more on my work-life balance. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made. Yeah, I didn’t get a “stellar” review this year, but I did fine, and I got to keep my sanity and dignity while I was at it. And when I find a gig worth jumping for, I’m gone.",

You don’t want to have 10 engineering managers that each have their own definition of junior, mid-level, senior, and so on.  That’s a recipe for variability in performance expectations that can lead to other issues like compensation inequality.  It’s also important because once you get to staff level and beyond there’s just not as many spots open because only a limited number of people are doing that work.  So you have to have some way of coordinating who moves into an open staff or principal role, which requires everyone to be on the same page about what each level entails.",

      "text": "How are y'all dealing with Chesterton's Fence when reading code?\n\nPre-AI, there used to be some signal from code being there that it had some value. By that I mean that if there's an easy way and a hard way to do something, and you see the hard way being done, it's because someone thought they needed to put in the effort to do the hard way. And there was some insight to be gained in thinking about why that was the case. Sure occasionally it was because the author didn't have the simple thing cross their mind, but with knowledge of the author's past code I could anticipate that too.\n\nWith AI generated code that feels less true. An AI has no laziness keeping it from doing the fancy thing. That means that sometimes the fancy thing isn't there for any particular reason. It works so it's there.\n\nThis naturally poses a problem with Chesterton's Fence: If I spend a bunch of time looking for the reason that a particular piece of complexity is there but 75% of the time it's never there, I feel like I'm just wasting time. What do you do to avoid this time/energy sink?",

This was true before AI, and it's still true now.\n\nHowever, let's assume the mess has already been made and snuck into the repo, despite not having a reason to be there.  Assuming the original (human) author is still around, treat it the same way you would have prior to AI --- go to them and ask them what motivated the complexity.  Honestly, if I suspect the code was made with AI, I push the \"why\" questions even if it becomes a little uncomfortable for the person I'm asking, since people *must* be responsible for the code they commit, even if an AI generated it.\n\nIf the author *isn't* present, the next step is your test suites.  If you can rip out the complex code and it fails a test case, then that identifies why it's there.  If you rip out the complex code and it still passes... that could just mean your tests are inadequate.  Time to look at tickets, commit history, and/or chat threads. If there's still no reason for why it's there, my inclination is to leave things be unless it's actually causing problems.",

But if its just \"implement feature X\" with no context and the code has that AI smell then I assume its probably safe to simplify.

For instance, property names we have complete control over, that have no legacy versions, and no edge case exists where the property would be stored as a different name, yet someone will submit a PR with code checking for a first name in first_name (correct) OR fname, firstName, f_name, given_name, GivenName, and so on and so forth (all incorrect). \n\nThen you have situations where we really did used to call it fname, so we really do need to check for an old schema format being submitted etc. Coming along and ripping out the check for that legacy naming and declaring you found AI is obviously not a good scenario. \n\nCode comments should explain things exactly like this, and if not, traceability through jira tasks and PRs is a fallback. Obviously the above scenario is made up and other approaches, like versioning, could be used, but in this day in age when something doesn't SEEM right, you need to explain why it is actually right any way you can as a developer, with the goal being someone whos never seen the code should understand why you did a thing.

And this should happen anywhere in the code they make a decision, even small ones.  \n\nIf some code doesn't have good comments like that, it's not really 'valuable', and the default assumption should be that any added complexity is a mistake\n\nAI very much does not do this well.  It adds a lot of comments, but they're always what, not why, and they occur randomly instead of in places where a significant decision was made\n\nOf course, even among devs that actually comment correctly, most of them make very few decisions and just copy/paste existing code that already made those decisions.  And devs don't get to decide business requirements, so the why of those is never in comments.  And if grooming is done correctly, devs should be making very few decisions at the time of writing code, and they're probably not going to copy notes from the story into the code's comments\n\nSo basically, uncommented code is human-written, but they didn't make any real decisions and probably didn't really think through their approach (or are an inexperienced dev), so it can probably be improved.  Badly commented code is always considered bad code, even if they happened to use a good approach, and usually written by AI.

Design Patterns can come into the picture once we get to this being a library fixture and API contracts start getting affected. Until then, modular easy to refactor/test code is all I focus on being written.\n\nFor older projects I like doing the SonarQube passes -> fix the issues -> run simple auto documentation with AI tools -> generate call graphs -> THEN use that to form a coding style guide with detailed examples and softlinks. Practically it's a \"design by vetted examples\" for any AI to refer to (eg in a CLAUDE.md file). All new code is to be written like the prominent design of the repo, with formatting and linting rules as defined for the repo/project.\n\nBasically, this helps style and substance mirror what is on the codebase already. Helps in better, effective code writing even with AIs.\n\nEspecially if you have younger engineers you can't force them to not write code with AI.

Honestly AI can also be a great tool for this problem because it allows you to assert a lot of questions you might have against code you are not very familiar with and get answers quickly as to why that code might exist (or why it might not need to). Very often AI is good at checking work done by other agents and giving critical analysis of it. \n\nOther than that I'd say you'd handle it the same way you always would. Figure out if anyone on the team understands why something is done a certain way and, if not, and you see a potentially better solution than make a proposal or PR to fix it.

I don’t just want to grind tickets and hope it happens.\n\nWith AI tools getting better and better, it feels like just knowing syntax or cranking out code isn’t really what separates junior from senior anymore. I’m guessing the bigger differences are around system design, making good trade-offs, writing code that actually lasts, and understanding the bigger picture of what you’re building.\n\nI mainly work in Java, but I’m open to anything, be it language-agnostic books, architecture, distributed systems, mindset stuff, whatever made a difference for you.\n\nI’ve seen these recommended a lot:\n\n\\- Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n\n\\- The Pragmatic Programmer\n\n\\- Effective Java\n\nWhat books actually changed how you think as an engineer?\n\nThanks 🙏",

          "text": "I find the age old \"senior for your org? Or senior engineer by measure?\" is a great question to ask. The books only go so far - and you've got the general stack covered here already.\n\nIf it's the former - learn to organize things that take up your time, focus on being able to communicate in terms your stakeholders understand and start doing the senior engineer job at YOUR company. If nothing else, sit with your manager and talk about identifying your current gaps as well as taking things off their plate.\n\nIf you want to be senior engineer by \"measure\", I have a slightly different opinion : learn by changing jobs. I genuinely think it's a time-driven thing apart from there being a natural talent ceiling. What that means is, senior engineers own a different share of different problems depending on the org you're at.\n\nWhat stays consistent is being able to communicate outcomes, risks, and owning deliveries at THAT org. Quit fighting with the non tech stakeholders and start learning how to communicate with them, so there is great social and political capital being built. Understand what they mean when they expect something out of you, and slowly build the trust/ their learning to help them understand what you mean. Back your team's concerns in the way the stakeholders understand, and take the heat when they don't.\n\nSpend a couple years hopping between two or more orgs (where you consistently deliver over 2 years or so). Within the next three-five years you should get there. Good luck!",

Every architecture pattern you'll likely need.\n\n\\- **A Philosophy of Software Design**. Best practices for creating modular code, how to avoid unnecessary abstractions and how to keep software from getting overly complex.\n\n\\- **Refactoring**.

Great information for guiding your career with information I wish I possessed when I first started out.\n\n# Management:\n\n\\- **Engineering Management For the Rest of Us**. Read this as soon as you have to manage a team for the first time.\n\n# Bonus Mention:\n\n\\- **Efficient Linux at the Command Line**.

      "text": "Forgive me, I'm in a bit of a chicken or the egg situation with my mental health and I'm unsure at this point what is sensible and what is me overreacting.\n\nContext: I've 11 years of experience and worked my way up to a Staff SWE position in my current company. Long story short, I did a lot \"fake it until you make it\" to work my way up because I sought more compensation for a more comfortable life, and better employability, staying ahead of the curve. Especially as remote positions became the norm.\n\nAnyway, I think I overextended by convincing myself (let alone others) that I wanted to be staff level. It's been a couple years now, so I've noticed what has and hasn't improved. I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but it's less about capability and more about enjoyment and consistency. When I first pursued the promotion I was aware of some of my shortcomings and thought I'd work through them. My social battery is small. If I'm real, my ability to act like the adult in the room is limited. I cannot pretend to care about my company anymore. Lots of these things feel like facets of my personality and not skills to develop (I know I can fake some of them, it just drains me).\n\nI can afford a cut. I just don't know what that does for my career prospects. I feel damned if I do, damned if I don't. Other companies have their own expectations of staff level, and I feel like my company's standards are lower, and my organization's specifically are lower still. So when I do apply to other positions, I'm often looking for senior positions since I can often find similar pay estimates and my qualifications line up better, but previous attempts fell through. Job searching is demoralizing so I'm back to trying to make it work better at my current employer.\n\nHow does it come off on a resume to go from staff to senior, especially at the same company? Or should I try to rewrite history and claim I was never staff in the first place? Do I own it and explain why I sought demotion? Or maybe do I just get over myself and press on? Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nedit: additional context\n\nedit: Thanks everyone for your responses! For posterity, this is what I compiled:\n\ntl;dr: Address burnout, then come back to the question of demotion. Chances are it'd be better to switch positions and not worry about the title.\n\nI wanted to keep my post reasonably concise so I left out a lot of context I didn't think was important. I probably could've clarified a few more things such as what exact responsibilities I have in my current role. Ah well, doesn't matter now.\n\nThe one extra bit I'll add which I'm sure people could pick up on is that I'm undiagnosed but very likely neurospicy. Even in SWE the level of masking I have to do is a constant drain. Interviews especially. When I say \"fake it\" I didn't just mean competency but, like, being human about some things and professional about others. Pretending to care about various things. Who knows, maybe that's all part of the imposter syndrome too. \n\nI found it curious how different everyone's experiences were and how that shaped their responses. e.g. It seemed like a death sentence to ask for demotions with their own employers.\n\nThe titles are indeed arbitrary. I probably don't need to overthink this as far as switching titles between employers. \n\nThe elephant in the room is this sounds a lot like burnout, which is fair. I seem to go in and out of it in my position. On the one hand, as far as workload and benefits go, I shouldn't really complain. I would fear spending so much effort switching jobs only to realize it's worse elsewhere. On the other, it's a death by a thousand cuts. But I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. I don't know what to tell my manager either since so much of it seems outside of our control and I don't want to merely complain. I'll think on it.\n\nI have searched for other jobs, but I just haven't had any luck. Most staff-level positions clearly have higher expectations and it's rare for me to make it past the screening or the first interview. And while I've gotten further for senior positions, still no dice. This becomes a bit of a feedback loop and at some point I give up for a while. \n\nSo my plan of action for now is to hold my position and work on my mental health first. Especially since I need employment to afford healthcare. 🤪 Regardless of whether I stay or not, that's kind of the bedrock of my ability to make sensible decisions. I'll also need to do some soul searching to nail down what it is exactly I enjoy and what would motivate me. From there I should hopefully be able to either have a productive conversation with my manager and/or keep applying for new jobs and not get demotivated by it.",

Six months later I received my first \"below meets\" on an evaluation, because I asked to down level, and that wasn't staff engineer level behavior.  \n\n\nNever the less, I persisted, and took that moment as an opportunity to let go of all imposter syndrome and stress, and decide that \"I am a staff engineer, therefore everything I do is the behavior of a staff engineer\" and made the role my own. It was getting told no by that VP that made everything click, and made me realize that I am a very effective player-coach in up-skilling engineers, teams, code bases, and projects around me that I interacted with and I needed to act like it.\n\nUnfortunately, after this finally clicked fully, the company was bought out and in early 2025 underwent a 300 person RIF that I was hit by, and to this day I suspect the \"below meets\" was the thing that put me on the chopping block.\n\nHalf a year later I joined a company as a senior engineer and found myself extremely bored because the work was so easy I could do it with my arms behind my back, and I was surrounded by engineers who didn't care about the effort of work I was putting in. I then found out that I had minimal room to get promoted back to staff, for reasons that are unimportant, so I left and realized that I needed to keep setting my sights higher, not lower. If I could go back, I would thank that VP for putting me in that position, because it unlocked what I needed in my brain at the time, but I suspect we'll never actually interface again.\n\nObviously do what makes the most amount of sense to you. If you want to do it, you just need to sell the narrative that \"I am an engineer who is looking for the right fit, and the title is less important than the work.\" If I was in your shoes, and I could do it all over again, I would get over myself and press on. You ended up in the staff role for a reason, and because the type of work is very different from that of a senior, you just need to figure out how to make it your own where you can, and not just the expectation.",

If they know you as the guy who self-evaluated themselves as an L -1 then you'll likely get a below meets. Most of the promotions and perf reviews I've seen happen mainly come down to what perspective higher ups have about you/your biggest project. Even if you worked on 10 different projects, no one has time to go through all that so it's often way more vibes based once it gets to the senior director/VP level.",

So you want to make sure that how you express your role on your resume doesn't look like you are trying to deceive the company you are interviewing for, or, you provide that clarity once you're in the loop",

I had similar issues moving to management level, for me it was the looooooong fucking meetings where i had to pretend to care about minutia that didn't matter and 50+% of the time was spent listenign to people argue about things that were literally just two people not understanding/not listening to what each other were saying... My brain can't deal with that without the urge to quit overpowering my fear of being homeless... \n\nJust be 100% truthful (though professionally worded). Tell your manager or whoever that you thought you'd enjoy it and could grow within the role, but have found some aspects to be not enjoyable or not worth the stress it causes. An adult saying \"I tried it and I didn't like it and feel like it's not for me\" should be completely understandable for any even semi-capable manager or HR. \n\n> I just don't know what that does for my career prospects.\n\nIn a Staff role at this company, 100% tanks it. For other roles or at other companies, very little. You might notice a dip in your next review, but beyond that, it shouldn't matter unless your company is petty. and even a petty company shouldn't fire you for it, unless there's literally no need for the previous role anymore, then it could be touchy. \n\n>Job searching is demoralizing so I'm back to trying to make it work better at my current employer. \n\nIt is, but at worst,t  his role will hamper your future prospects, but I can't imagien a company out right firing you for it. \n\n>How does it come off on a resume to go from staff to senior, especially at the same company? Or should I try to rewrite history and claim I was never staff in the first place? Do I own it and explain why I sought demotion? \n\nI went to Manager and back to dev. I smudged the truth a bit, as I was desperate and the fear of homelessness was getting closer to reality, I applied to both dev and lead roles, for dev I listed Dev -> Lead -> Dev as the second dev was a different project. Most interviewers didn't ask, those who did I was honest and said I tried LEad, hated the 6=8 hours of meetings a day, and went back to what I enjoy, most smiled and said they understood. For Lead roles I left off the return to Dev, just listed Dev -> Dev -> Lead and told them I loved Lead work.",

I’ve gone through this too and I wouldn’t suggest trying to demote yourself until you try to solve the source of burnout. Try to find some meaning outside of work and just let work be work. \n\nHOWEVER, if you do try this then simply put senior SDE on your resume instead of staff. It’s easier if you don’t have to explain a title demotion. You can still accurately describe the scope of your role and let them draw their own conclusions",

The transition between those levels is the most misunderstood one in our industry.\n\n  \nAt senior, you're given well-defined problems and evaluated on how well you solve them. The ambiguity is technical: which approach, what trade-offs, how to test.\n\n  \nAt staff, you're expected to FIND the problems. The ambiguity shifts from technical to organizational: what should we be working on? Which team needs unblocking? What's the architectural decision that nobody has made yet because nobody owns it? That's not a harder version of senior work - it's fundamentally different work.\n\n  \nThe \"faking it\" feeling you describe is common and usually means one of two things:\n\n  \n1. You don't enjoy the ambiguous, cross-team, \"find the problem\" work - and that's completely legitimate. Some excellent engineers are happier with well-scoped technical challenges. That's not failure. It's self-awareness.\n\n  \n2. You haven't been given the support structure to learn staff-level skills. Most companies promote to staff and then provide zero guidance on what that actually means day-to-day. The skills aren't \"be a better coder\" - they're \"figure out what the organization needs before anyone asks.\"\n\n  \nBefore requesting a demotion, figure out which one it is. If it's #1, go back to senior without guilt. If it's #2, consider whether a different company with better staff engineering culture would change the picture.",

He can't control the narrative in a meeting and gets trampled on by others. He easily says yes. He also can't seem make decisive actions on resources -- moving people in and out of projects as he doesn't want to hurt people's feelings and wants to  be the nice guy. He lacks people skills but he is the most senior in terms of technicals. He gets totally defeated as he is attending more meetings (meetings I use to attend). So he is experiencing all this corporate politics first hand now.\n\nIn out KT (knowledge transfer meetings), that is all that is talked about. How to deal with certain personalities versus asking me about how a service works or explaining parts of the code base. My only advice is not to be the nice guy, he only should answer to his direct change of command in leadership -- engineering.\n\nI have a lot of political capital and when push comes to shove, I can get things done. Either by building consensus or getting support from leadership. I can steer the direction of the product roadmap and prioritize in favor of the engineering team. We want things that are secure, scaleable, feature rich, reduce user churn, and make the product better. Other teams want to redesign the main dashboard again for the 10th time. We rather make life easier for customers to connect to their data and automate things versus changing one card from the left to the right expanding it by two columns with a new color palette.\n\nAny good books or resources for SWE.

Basically respond with anything other than \"yes\". It is absolutely crucial to avoid making promises that have no realistic guarantee behind them.\n\nBeing a \"yes man\" only works for weak ass middle managers who can easily shift responsibility of delivery onto anyone else - and ultimately everyone ends up hating those kind of middle managers. (Meanwhile the projects and teams they delegate to will deteriorate in the messiest ways possible.)\n\nIf the individual is as spineless as you're describing and can't learn to say anything other than \"yes\", then they are certainly doomed to fail. The consequences will come fast and hard, hitting them directly along with everyone else on the team.

Over the next months lots of problems, zero willingness to try anything other than “doing it 100% by myself so i can learn” (no willingness to let me or others help, or show me what exactly was done). Eventually I put my foot done and said I need to at least see the weekly process in detail to give feedback. Agreement was very reluctant and starts each week with “i did it because you forced me, it’s a waste of time” (i explained why and how this weekly report should help, and judging from the progress now, it is somewhat working; also asked for other things they could think of, no alternatives proposed). Can’t get rid of person for at least another 15 months (and also they have many talents, just not the thing they insist on doing- they want to learn new things, while i’d quite like them to do what they can or accept my help for learning £",

But if he just needs time he can always say “let me circle back with you tomorrow”. \n\nThe thing about stuff like this is that him doing what you do probably won’t work.

Just for the fact the he's newer to this context, he's going to be a worse replacement for at least a whole after your knowledge transfer window is open.\n\nAlso be aware thst the new guy has a completely different standing than you. The guy that omboarded me as his replacement kept telling me that I need to be more assertive in my new role. The thing he doesn't know is that I kept getting reprimanded for standing up for my team against managers in my old project. I generally have no problem being assertive.\n\nBut he's asking me to be assertive about things that I'm not sure about towards people I just met, who I sometimes don't even really know what their role exactly is, in a meeting I'm missing a ton of context about. I have literally zero social standing with these people and when the new guy speaks up, people react completely differently to when someone speaks up who's been part of the project for years.\n\nSo I largely ignored his well meant \"advise\", took a ton of notes, met a ton of new people and know that everyone knows my face, I can be more assertive and tell people off. But it takes time.\n\nAnd you know what the most important part is? That I needed my onboarder to validate my thoughts and feelings about what happened in a meeting because sometimes the new guy is off-base on something that was decided before he joined the project. It was also extremely important that I can escalate issues to him without much of a fuzz. Sometimes I asked him to join a meeting or call and him showing up and showing that he backed my decision was huge for building my social standing with my new coworkers.\n\nMaybe OP's replacement is just a timid guy, but consider that in a new role, you lack both social standing and context and neither of those build up over night.",

                  "text": "IMO the boring tasks generally weren't an anchor on long-term productivity -- until they are for meta reasons, but I'll get back to that.\n\nThe boring tasks are often \"just work\" tasks like setting up a new repo, project, build script, and/or module for the start of a effort.  Getting started always feels chunky because you don't do it often, and the circumstances tend to change enough over context or time that it isn't quite the same each time.  Reducing the \"just work\" costs is a good thing!  They are inevitably steps that should be well-understood but not cost any more cognitive load than is useful for the initiative.\n\nThey become an anchor on productivity when they aren't understood or skipped \"for this one hot initiative\", which over time in a long-lived codebase becomes mixed zones of different standards.  The boring tasks become a productivity anchor because the last person who skipped them more-than-doubled the work of the next person impacted by their tech debt -- the interest payments always come calling.\n\nTo setup an analogy: when you're optimizing for performance a classic mis-optimization is to not take measurements to diagnose the performance issues before you start making changes. You might make some code run faster, but if the actual issue is lock contention -- your objectively better code on paper could make the real issue worse!\n\nThe boring work in my experience often isn't the productivity killer, even though it's a convenient punching bag for time not spent well and observable tech debt accretion.  The real productivity killers in my experience have always been higher level issues: ill-defined or understood contracts and expectations across separation of responsibilities, shifting and/or poorly-defined requirements, unnecessary context switching from a chaotic lack of planning, in-fighting over continuously punting the opportunity to disagree-and-commit over strategic decisions to avoid conflict.\n\nThe pet phrases I use to anthropomorphize these issues are:\n- rowing separate boats in the same direction\n- tactical solutions in a strategic direction\n\nBoth of which require sufficient product _and technical_ vision for separate groups to be properly incentivized to work together in a commonly understood direction.  If your boat is frantically zig-zagging for fear of heading in the wrong direction, the ride is going to feel worse than taking fewer and smaller course corrections because you can't generate productive momentum.  If your boat is tied to a dozen others all doing the same thing? It doesn't matter if the cost of checking the wind in a new direction or identifying your current position got cheaper -- you won't be going anywhere anyway, you're just making the boring work to change direction feel nicer.",

Goes on and on for several paragraphs hallucinating non existent issues with the right way to do it, to support the wrong way.\n\nI seen quality degrade from improper static analyzers, like a junior developer fixing coverity warning about double free, by introducing an actual double free (which coverity didn't complain about), making it a serious security exploit.

It required some back and forth, but it worked. It also wrote pretty good unit tests that gave 80+% coverage up front, and the code quality was higher than what most human developers could produce, including me (much more consistent style and organizational choices that were largely good ones).\n\nI don't have exact metrics, but clearly there is value in a tool than condenses coding work by an order of magnitude with some up front effort and produces results on par with or exceeding those of a human developer. It's not infallible and you need to review its output, but I will take some back-and-forth with Claude over trying to untangle human spaghetti code any day. If you're not getting good results like this, I think you should really look at how you're prompting it and managing context. If you just give it ambiguous prompts and throw your whole repo at it it's kind of a 'crap in, crap out' situation. If you give it a framework and requirements up front and let it break work into reasonable chunks (you know, what a human developer would also want), it can do small miracles.\n\nHonestly I don't know what universe the people saying AI is useless are living in.

I'll take that \"upgrade agent\" service I built with Claude as an illustrative example again.\n\nI had a pretty good idea of how I wanted the app to work before I wrote any code. I knew I wanted it to be driven by a state machine, and I already had a simple state machine class for it to use as a basis. It would have a CLI interface for monitoring/manually controlling the state machine, and an event-driven interface (basically it's a subscriber to some messages from other services). I knew exactly what state transitions I wanted to support and what behavior I wanted on edge transitions. I documented all of this in one big 'requirements doc', but didn't actually break the work up into sub-tasks or anything. I asked it to write documentation of the code it was producing.\n\nI gave it the document and asked it to implement the application and write unit tests to verify. At first, the code it produced didn't compile. I had to go through a few iterations of feeding back the compiler errors and asking it to fix the code. Then tests wouldn't pass. A few more iterations. After not too long, it got there.\n\nThen I reviewed its code. It took some weird architectural liberties. Partially I think this was my fault; I gave it a big blob of requirements and said \"build this thing\". Even though my document was pretty good, it left some wiggle room, and Claude went way too hard trying to cover edge cases that don't exist or adding functionality that was extraneous or redundant. I prompted it to remove things I thought were unnecessary, and it did a pretty good job cleaning up after itself when prompted. Sometimes it would break its own unit tests while cleaning up and it would need to go through some more debugging iterations to get them working again. Overall, its style was very consistent; good function and variable names, generally following SOLID principles. In some places I could see it was making the unit tests harder by not following principles like dependency injection and I asked it to refactor/use mocks in the tests.\n\nAfter that I asked it to implement the CLI tool. Similar kind of debugging cycle and hiccups. All told, I probably spent \\~2 hours on that initial chat session. Then, I had to take what it produced and load it in my staging environment and see how it worked. It had like 3-4 critical issues that prevented it from working properly, which I debugged myself but weren't very hard to figure out. I gave it feedback about what was wrong and it did a good job making appropriate changes. Overall, that was like another \\~3-4 hours I guess? After that my stuff was in pretty good shape, I think there were other minor fixes and refactors after that, but 6 hours or so of hanging out with Claude gave me a working service, CLI tool, and pretty solid unit tests.\n\nIts coding style was good, and maybe most importantly, consistent in a way that humans often struggle with. I find that humans often make typos, use inconsistent formatting, put logic in places it doesn't belong, create \"mega methods\" that are a tangled mess of if-else logic, tightly couple things that don't need to be tightly coupled, mess up shared state in multi-threaded applications...other cardinal sins. You can say \"well, the people who do that are bad programmers\". Maybe...but there's a lot of people out there making these mistakes and littering code bases with little idiosyncrasies! Claude writes in a way that feels like an amalgamation of generalized best practices, even if it doesn't have much creativity and needs some hand holding.\n\n\\--\n\nMy takeaways from this were that it is a bit of a Monkey's Paw; Claude will fill in the gaps in your prompts with its own interpretations that are only occasionally correct. It often over-complicates things and needs to be reigned in. It works best when given very clear instructions to do something cut-and-dry. But this is all true of human developers too...again, the up-front work of specifying what you want and breaking it into sub-tasks seems like a huge determinant of the outcome.",

But that is not a case of AI being a bad tool, it's a case of not capturing the necessary requirements and/or making sure what you're building in the first place is valuable. Which isn't what I was talking about.\n\nIf I have a good idea, and I accurately capture the high-level plan for implementing it, and then AI can do the implementation that would've taken me a month in a day or two (with some HITL course-correction, sure), how is that not a huge win?",

How would I show you evidence of me working faster lmao.\n\nI can give you a recent example from my work, I opened an archaic-ass JSF project and had to add a new page to it for a client who refuses to migrate to our new Angular based UI (JSF one is handled by backend teams, unfortunately) and spent 10 minutes explaining how I want the UI to work, prepared a bean with mock methods for it to wire up and had it generate the entire UI in a couple of prompts. I think the entire process took less than an hour and then I just finished up the backend part myself.\n\nNot only did I not have to look through the *rather old* JSF documentation but also skipped, what is for me, the most unpleasant part of working on that system, which honestly does slow me down out of just really not wanting to interact with it. \n\nAnother recent-ish example I can give I was pretty stumped on some java agents not injecting/connecting to a service, seemingly out of the blue, and after asking Gippity it threw out a \"By the way, the parameter format for this changes from :\\*: to \\*:\\* in this version\" and lo and behold that was a few hours of digging through commits to find out that indeed someone had upgraded it recently.\n\nI'm not some AI apologist that believes it's the cure-all for software engineering, but if you can't speed any part of your work up with them then that's either a you-issue or you're working on something incredibly bespoke/have such perfect knowledge of your stack that you rarely look anything up.\n\nI already said this but I will reiterate that I have a set amount of mental energy for the day, having to deal with something which is simple but tedious (any kind of UI, for one) depletes it faster, because it's finnicky and boring to me - this is a \"soft\" speed increase in that I don't feel done for the day as soon when I have to deal with less things I dislike.",

The problem is that AI lacks the human perspective and while it can \"help\" in tasks like organizing information and writing reports, it can also confidently present incorrect information which can completely throw off research efforts, simply because it was trained that way.\n\nIt has no true grasp of human intuition, the human experience, or empathy, which are often essential to forming research questions and interpreting findings in fields like psychology.  And ironically, psychology plays a significant role in software design since we build processes and often organize them in ways that make sense to us.  Object oriented programming is about mapping real world entities such as people, concepts, or things, into objects with specific behaviors in a system.  Our view points and feelings do impact how we implement those objects and while some parts are going to be identical, I've yet to see identical code between two people writing from scratch.\n\nAI does not improve readability, the user experience, or resource efficiency.  It forces compliance and rigid doctrine to code that is written to function rather than to be understood, built without any linkage to a living person, and maybe if we're lucky it will have some AI generated XML summary that states a generic message that will be created in a dozen or so unique iterations depending on how the dice roll.\n\nOh, I'm sorry!  AI DOES write code that is linked to living people because that is what it is trained off of!  It's trained off the hard work of other people who wrote books, code examples, etc.  It's great for replacing people and jobs so companies can spend less on \"human resources\".  \n\nBusinesses don't care if code is readable, simplified, SOLID, or anything like that. They want stuff predictably released without going back and forth with a human trying to answer the golden question of \"how long will this take?\"\n\nSorry I'm just a bitter person when it comes to this subject.",

          "text": "Well when I started at this startup (SaaS app) about a year ago — I’m 20 years in tech, senior tech lead, full stack, previous CTO in dev shops — our initial technical stack was:\n\nPostgres  \nGraphQL  \nNode.js  \nReact Router / TypeScript / Vite\n\nWe had expected to spend on a 4-person tech team.\n\nOver the past year that changed. It’s been one: me as the developer. Our PM even spun up a Playwright UX testing suite to run app tests. A year later I’ve delivered a first-gen product that’s performant and tested.\n\nImportant caveat upfront: at every stage I still needed to review AI output and check code. So it’s not necessarily faster.\n\nBut it absolutely requires fewer human resources. That’s the real lesson for me.\n\nHere’s where AI has made the biggest impact in my work:\n\n1. SQL and GraphQL — just easy to generate with modern coding models.\n2. Documentation — I’ve never had this much documentation (valid and updated) on a project in my past 20 years, including when I worked at NASA. These days (last couple weeks) I use Claude to auto-update docs and its Notion connector to publish our wiki from them.\n3. TypeScript — not only initial prototyping but ongoing backend and frontend development.\n4. Mobile — I added a full React Native frontend for native mobile since I had the time. Normally a 3–6 month effort.\n5. Unit testing — it’s very good. With the caveat that I validate each test to prevent performative “test theater” AI slop.\n6. Code review and GitHub management — added two levels of code review via LLM using GitHub’s MCP and code review models. For most of the year I had to be really careful because AI drifts on every run and makes stupid assumptions, but lately with newer models it’s gotten significantly better.\n7. Frontend — Opus is strong. Not as good as having a senior frontend dev with years of experience, but I have enough experience to manage things like useEffect overuse, bad UX decisions, and when the LLM doesn’t modularize properly on first pass.\n8. UX design — we had a designer on contract in the first pass a year ago, but now we iterate between CEO/COO, PM, and myself using [v0.dev](http://v0.dev), mock tools, and AI graphic tools like Ideogram for icons and SVGs.\n9. Cloud deployment and CI/CD — Docker, infra, all of it is much easier with LLMs handling syntax and boilerplate. I review everything before implementing. In the past I might have contracted a DevOps person. That’s no longer needed.\n\nAnyway, I could go on. Basically every aspect of design, development, and engineering work has shifted.\n\nAI needs a lot of review and overhead and makes a lot of bad assumptions and mistakes, especially not the overarching technical direction. You’re still the engineer. You’re still reviewing. You’re still catching the dumb stuff and reviewing at the code level if you want to keep your sanity.\n\nBut one or two experienced persons can now cover most of the surface area that used to take a team.\n\nIs it less stressful? No. It increases responsibility and cognitive load.\n\nIs it more fun? Yes and no. It’s fun to prototype and validate assumptions quickly. But the mental overhead is real.\n\nThis article feels accurate right now:  \n[https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it)\n\nWhat this looks like five years from now, I have no idea. Every layer of engineering is under intense experimentation as startups try to automate engineers out of existence. I don’t think full replacement is feasible.\n\nBut in my own experience over the last two years, it’s a real structural shift.",

Yet it's very difficult to. So difficult that even now, we don't really have a set of accepted metrics that we can judge our performance on. Obviously there are a few metrics that exist that absolutely should be looked at like service uptime/reliability and resource usage (that's why observability exists for these) but it's not really holistic enough to judge the software as a whole. Every other metric is either subjective (UX quality) or is going to be gamed\n\nSo your question would imply that there is a set of metrics that we can judge software on, when we've been unable to do so since the beginning of the profession. Thus the question feels somewhat flawed/contradictory.\n\nNow to management, the only metric that they care about is capex and revenue/profit. If they can get away with cutting wage capex without seeing huge plummets in revenue due to downtime and such, they will absolutely slash the fuck out of that spend. Even traditional software companies aren't free from this thought process, ex. Zuck's \"year of efficiency\"",

What it’s currently doing: just increasing code volume, which means more reviews, more integration work, and more maintenance, and it’s even used as a justification to squeeze productivity without hiring.\n\nWe need to organise and form unions. The current wave of AI output wouldn’t even exist without all of the illegally scraped open-source projects, Stack Overflow posts, blogs, and documentation written by actual developers.\n\nAnd honestly, this situation also reflects a culture in tech that too often pushes people to compete ruthlessly instead of collaborating and standing up for better conditions together.

Let alone getting them done part time in under a year. Oh, and they're done in languages that aren't my primary language. \n\nAt work, we have significantly higher velocity with fewer devs. Quality overall one first pass is also much higher because we don't have to skip/compromise for happy path (e.g., we handle edge cases out of the gate) because it's trivial to write massive numbers of tests. The trend seems to be that a single developer can take on more scope in the same amount of time. So the the MVP we had planned is now effectively what we planned on the 3 year roadmap. This in about 6 months with a small team. Originally we had planed 3 or 4 teams after MVP.\n\nThs biggest challenge is that gaps in layers are highlighted. For instance, backend work with AI is much, much easier. The front-end is lagging but that's partly because of design and because actually *using* the software by users takes time.\n\nThere is also the risk of burnout and cognitive load catching up to everyone. For instance, doing all the security and compliance on top of all the code we've built is going to come to a head. Operationally we may also pay the piper but we're trying to adjust now before release. Our biggest challenge is hiring.",

          "text": "I handle architecture and a decent chunk of coding, i'll give some concrete examples, make of them as you will.\n\n**Scenario A:**\n\nI am looking at code i did not write (but maybe designed or from before my time). I can ask specific questions on structure, architecture, root functions, inheritance and narrow down where i want to make the changes.\n\nIf i ask the AI to make the changes without doing this first, it will almost always \"fix it\" for the case i provide, but not fix it correctly for all cases. \n\nOnce i figure out where the code has to go, the change is usually 10 min of me typing and a lot of time testing. Ai does not help me with testing, because whatever tests it makes are generally just feel good but dont really do anything.\n\nHelpful? Yes, it saves a lot of searching and digging through code and speeds that up a lot. With the right prompts and the newer models, it will catch a few things i didnt even think about (rarely) but it's getting a bit better. Overall, the testing is what the time sink is and it really doesn't help much with that.\n\nDownsides: while reading and finding stuff in this code i don't know, i would:\n\n1. understand this part and learn it better\n2. find BS and tech debt nicely wrapped as a beautiful turd in a pretty bow that was deemed production ready and can now unpack and fix.\n\nThis is why it takes me longer than the AI. By using the AI, i skip those 2 bits which i think are pretty crucial.\n\n**Scenario B:**\n\nWorking on a feature and i am extending functionality.\n\nThis is where i feel it struggles the most. I will give a concrete example that happened on friday using claude 4.6;\n\nWe have a whole deployment management platform, on some more complicated updates, i decided to implement a way to perform red-black-ish deployment updates.\n\nI wrote the code to deploy a replica without being connected to an endpoint (build up to LB). I was now extending the code to create an endpoint and assign a cname for internal testing.\n\nThe code runs a pipeline for deployment. I asked claude to extend it and add the ability to generate an endpoint for testing, very simple, it has to come with a unique name so it doesn't clash with the original app live that we are updating.\n\nIt decided to go through the pipeline, when endpoint is checked, include the endpoint creation step and add a condition on -- if replica -> change endpoint name.\n\nThen go into the create record function an add an override for the name.\n\n*Wrong.* \n\nFirst of all, adding that logic in that step is just bad practice since regular create would never use this logic. Second, that logic does not belong there. The model for the replica already has code to determine the endpoint name based on the app name, that is used everywhere else. If it only made a change in the record create inside the pipeline step, it would break everything else. \n\nI told it to find the getter inside the model that returns the name and look to see if it contains the relationship for the migration/replica and fetch that and decide how to name it.\n\nRather than fetch the object and read metadata, it was happy to just check for the existence of the relation and call it a day.\n\nI explained that - at some point, the endpoint will be swapped to the updated version while it will still contain the relation for audit. Just checking for existence means when we swap it would return the wrong name. It needs to read metadata and figure out how this deployment is operating and return the endpoint name based on that.\n\nNow, this took longer to do with AI than if i went and did it myself and if someone with less experience let it do it the way it wanted to do it, it would have been a big issue. So, in this scenario, it would have been a trainwreck.\n\n**Scenario C:**\n\n- adding a completely new feature in an established framework\n\nSay i already have a pipeline, or an adapter pattern. It has abstract functions and examples already made. Let's say i have a few APIs i use from different providers for the same things and i employ adapters. Let's say i am adding a new one.\n\nIf i feed it the new api docs, my abstractions interfaces and other adapters, it will absolutely nail it.\n\nThis is the absolute gold usage I found for AI and it saves me an insane amount of time. But, it requires the base to be in tip top shape and well written and designed. \n\n**My own thoughts:**\n\nWill it replace developers? Some, maybe. Will it do a good job.. maybe...? If it can think and understand, i don't think GPT can \"understand\" or \"think\". An experienced developer will start with a basic idea and find the pitfalls as he fills it in. An AI will start with the basic idea and implement it to the dot, but nothing else. This is where the issue lies.\n\nFor a GPT to predict beyond the prompt the graph of possibilities explodes. For a human, it does not, because we think and we can plan, we don't need context. It's like using a developer who forgets everything after a few hours and everytime you need something done you need to explain everything again. They can write near perfect code, but nothing else. Just as a calculator can do perfect math.. but nothing else.\n\nI think it will be a great tool and i think it will be widely used.",

      "text": "I’m a Senior BE with 7 YOE and joined a new team about a month ago. The people are ok, but I’ve run into some architectural patterns that feel like anti-patterns.\n\nCurrently, a lot of the business logic and orchestration lives directly in the route handlers. There is a strict rule against service-to-service calls; instead, the team uses a pattern where logic from one service is injected into another via lambdas passed down from the route level. This \"callback hell\" approach is apparently meant to keep services decoupled, but it results in lambdas being passed many layers deep, making the execution flow incredibly difficult to trace.\n\nThe friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles, especially since i'm still new to the team so there is not much established trust. However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nHow do you go about shifting an established engineering culture without coming across as the arrogant new hire? I want to advocate for better DX and maintainability, but I'm looking for a way to do it that feels collaborative rather than confrontational.",

Once someone is integrated at a company for a while, they forget what kind of options exist outside of their tech stack/existing design. It's a mix of institutional knowledge plus not really exploring outside of their bubble. Which is totally fine, this is a day job.\n\nI think you especially see this in big corporate dev culture. You get established norms and no real options to challenge the status quo individually or even in a systemic way. Usually those decisions are driven top down anyway. \n\nAnd like you said, you really need a lot of trust from stakeholders to approach big structural changes. And it's almost never the hill to die on.\n\nAt least, that's my experience in corporate culture and even startup culture to a degree.\n\nI had an interview at eBay last year, and every round, the interviewers were absolutely pumped about migrating all their REST APIs to GraphQL and the \"big direction\" the company was taking towards their backend. I think they've been investing in external companies focused on GraphQL, too. Felt like the decision was being driven top down.\n\nI don't know much about GraphQL and I don't think GraphQL is that great tbh or even gamechanging. And they're kind of 10 years late to the party.

I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI am confused why this is an either-or thing. Perhaps this is a language specific problem (you didn’t specify the language), but a lambda is just a closure box around some function invocation. Sure you can write logic inline in the lambda, but there’s no reason you _have_ to do things this way, the lambda can equally just call a free function (in languages with such a thing) or capture some function object that implements the logic. Why can you not have the logic you want to directly unit test separated into a testable unit, test it, then simply pass that as the lambda? The lambda now only serves to “wire together” the injection point to the logic being injected.\n\nThis kind of design keeps the decoupling between transport and business logic that you’re looking for, while simultaneously not rocking the boat on their design patterns?\n\nAs for needing integration tests: I mean, yeah, ultimately you are going to need those, because at the end of the day you have to validate the system as a whole behaves as expected. Put differently, if the actual requirements on the system are “when API X is invoked with arguments Y, effect Z happens,” then you need to actually test _that_, the rest is implementation details. The point of separating out smaller units for testing is to isolate the point of failure. If the top level test fails but the unit test passes, you know the issue lies in the integration between the unit and the larger system. If both fail, you know at minimum there is a defect in the unit which likely is causing a defect in the system the unit is integrated into.\n\nI can’t comment on the overall architecture because your description of it isn’t very detailed. It sounds a lot like pretty standard inversion of control principles, which are usually considered *good* for testing and maintainability. Perhaps the problems you’re feeling there are tied to either poorly specified contracts (I.E. the contracts of those lambdas aren’t well specified), or due to implementation specifics (people writing massive, deeply nested lambdas inline instead of breaking out directly testable helpers with the logic and having the lambdas in the transport layer just wire them together). Once you’ve really understood the *why* of the design, perhaps you can push to close the gap on documentation or best practices that can help you and the next you understand the system better, as well as help shift left some of the testing practices from being purely massive top level integration tests to a healthy blend of system level and unit level testing.",

As long as you’re ok with that, pick your battles. Focus on cheap, high-yield pilot projects that have clear feedback when they work out. Performance issues are good for this, because numbers clearly go down/up. Things like “this makes the code easier to work with/easier to extend” are harder to prove, and therefore not great for gaining trust early on. \n\nYour challenge is a political one here - not technical. Maybe you had a lot of trust where you came from, so it’s hard to have your ideas viewed with skepticism, but an antidote to that is showing them you can do it their way, at least for a little while. It’s also an opportunity to check your own bias. If you’re surrounded by people who implicitly trust you, that can dull your awareness of weaknesses in ideas you have. And if you’re actually right, you’ll help others check their bias, but keep in mind how uncomfortable that can be for some people to have dictated to them. \n\nPS - I know how that can feel like you’re just going along with everyone’s complacency and it’s really frustrating. Like you’re watching a fire, holding a hose, and being told not to use it. Hope it works out for you.",

Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\n\nYou could advocate for tests using the Test host or equivalent in your environment (you don't mention which it is). The one that I use is for for outside-in, and all in-memory testing. You can and should swap out real database for mocks here, to keep it all in-memory and fast. You can call these \"component tests\" or regard them as decoupled unit tests. I find this a very useful pattern by either name. As it sidesteps the implementation details, use of  route handlers / DI or not. So you're free to refactor under test.\n\nNo, they're not the _only_ kind of tests that we have - there are \"methods & mocks\" unit tests, and also tests that run after deploy to dev and use real databases and external services. But they are the bulk of tests, and it works well.\n\n> I’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles . However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nThis is a real dilemma, because both are correct. The only thing worse than code that uses an odd pattern and style that doesn't work that well, is code that uses it 50% of the time at random so you never know what you're getting today.\n\nHowever, I too would be thinking \"WTF is this and why?\"  A \"strict rule against service-to-service calls\" is bizarre and useless, and an interface with 1 method on it is exactly equivalent to a lambda / delegate / func, except in that it has a named type, which makes it easier for humans and DI containers to deal with.\n\nIt's _possible_ that they have some odd requirement that makes this pattern necessary, but I'd bet money that they don't, it's just just habit, misunderstanding and ignorance of common good practice.\n\nOr maybe you're working in a Functional Programming language such as F# where passing functions to functions is the \"Right way\". Or with an ex-Haskell dev? ;)",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nAbout 17 years total experience, started off as a self-taught goofball writing scripts to make my job easier to working at big tech and startups, picking up my masters along the way.\n\nWhat really got me into tech/software was that I could solve a lot of business problems writing code and gain efficiencies. My love for it increased as I went back to school and worked with C and all its thorniness. I remember writing my own (shitty) web server for a class and load tested it on a potato computer, watching it serve tens of thousands of requests per second without fail. Or writing and managing my own (shitty) message broker.\n\nThen over time, a lot of things changed. You no longer write and host your own web servers; you have AWS for that. Okay, fine, I thought. There's still a lot of value in managing your provisioned resources, trying to figure out what your tech stack looks like, etc.\n\nA few years later, everything now is either server-less or otherwise managed. Why spin up your own Kafka running on ECS when you can just use MSK? Do you really want to manage your own message broker while AWS offers ManagedMQ now? Any time I need some sort of service to set up, my infrastructure guys would just be like, \"Yeah, let's just use this managed service instead.\"\n\n(On one hand, I get it. If managing a service ourselves takes up 10% of an engineer's time, then it might make sense to go with a managed service as your startup scales. On the other, it's a lot less fun and I have fewer opportunities to bolster my CV.)\n\nAt that point, my life was basically coming up with the architecture to manage distributed systems, but a lot of my day-to-day was relegated to writing CRUD APIs. And that was fine, too. You want me to pay me how much money to just write code that essentially delivers your request to a database and returns you some data? Sure!\n\nBut now with AI around, even writing CRUD is being supplanted (as much as people on this sub think otherwise, I've personally used it and it gets 80% there most of the time). And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that this has increased my anxiety and existential crisis. So my question to you all is, what now?\n\nI was thinking maybe moving into technical product management or maybe looking into the various \"forward deployed engineer\" roles where I can leverage my technical skills while doing work that is unlikely to be replaced by AI. But I think back to what made me so interested in software engineering in the first place and I want to see what else is out there. So far, I've played around with running my own LLMs, writing my own agents, etc. But even that essentially is CRUD with a wrapper around it. Not to mention that space moves so quickly that with a job and a child, it's very difficult to keep up.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts and ideas. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the thoughtful responses. I did read through all of them, but didn't reply to most. I appreciate the insights and thoughts here.

For these, yes, it is CRUD all the way down, and the extra layers put varying degrees of facade on top of the database and/or intermediate layers.\n\nThat accounts for most software jobs out there, because there is always a need to manage inventory, employees, billing and so on. There are other kinds of software that aren't just a fancy spreadsheet that talks to a database, which do things like control robots, drive video cards, edit movies, or play games. These still have a lot of CRUD, but their non-business focus allows for more variety. \n\nAbout the fanciest coding I've found in a business application is the algorithm to convert a pair of latitude/longitude points into a distance (by approximating Earth as a sphere). The fanciest I've ever had to create from scratch was a means to calculate \"overtime\" *before* the time is worked. So it isn't good enough to check whether there *is* overtime, but to check whether *this next shift* would go into overtime. Maybe that sounds simple to you, but overtime rules differ by business and by state. California goes into overtime after 8 hours in a day, and double time after 12, while most states just go into overtime after 40 hours in a week. And this particular application allowed for customized overtime rules. AND this check had to happen on the database side in a query, because reasons, so the algorithm had to go into SQLCLR (C#/SqlServer architecture). ",

Alerting is supposed to be actionable, and customer oriented. The story you tell is not that. And if the Product Owner wants this, there are other, better ways to achieve it than sleep deprivation.\n\n> 99% of which are false alarms for a p90 latency spike for an http endpoint\n\nFundamentally, alerting is a statistical exercise. Your quote there has like three statistical concepts already! Yet pretty much every SWE and SRE I've ever met are statistically undereducated. Myself included! It wasn't until pandemic lockdown that I corrected this and worked through a stats 101 textbook.\n\nThe way I see it, we can't do anything about slow queries that already happened, all we can do is adjust the system to handle future queries better. So any alert fired should represent a high confidence need for human intervention into the system. Statistically, confidence is built up through piles of data -- evidence! An endpoint with ten queries per scrape interval has less evidence than one with a thousand, and alerting needs to account for that somehow. \n\nSadly, Prometheus et al don't have great confidence interval functions we could use to natively calculate these. Instead **we typically use durations.** The idea here is simple: every scrape the failure signal persists is more evidence that it won't fix itself. This is especially important in the era of Kubernetes, where self-healing systems abound. Health checks automatically restart failed pods, and hpa scales up busy deploys, but these take time to action and we should give them a chance. If you're constantly waking up to pages for outages that are already over, that's an immediate argument for increasing the duration required before paging.\n\nIf SRE can't or won't accommodate you by increasing short (or absent!) durations, I recommend putting an override in to put them on call first until it's addressed.",

That decision had a cost, and that cost is being silently absorbed by whoever is on-call. The SRE team who set the thresholds doesn't get woken up at 3am for a p90 latency spike. The person who approved the policy doesn't see the Slack channel with 80 acknowledge messages per week.\n\n  \nThe fix isn't better alerting tools or tweaking thresholds. The fix is making the cost visible to the people who made the decision:\n\n  \n\"We're spending approximately X hours of engineering time per week responding to alerts. 99% of these are false alarms that require no action. The response time requirement means at least Y interrupted sleep cycles per on-call rotation. Here's what we could be building with that time instead.\"\n\n  \nPut that in a doc. Present it to engineering leadership. Frame it as a trade-off, not a complaint: \"We can keep the current alerting posture and accept this cost, or we can adjust thresholds to alert only on actionable conditions. Which do you prefer?\"\n\n  \nWhen you present the cost in terms of engineer-hours and opportunity cost, the \"we MUST have these alerts\" mandate usually gets reconsidered pretty quickly. People who mandate processes are rarely aware of what those processes actually cost.",

From my friends that have worked or currently work at the company I understand that the culture is supposed to be very chill with a strong engineering leadership. To boot they are also completely WFH. It's a pay cut but on paper I feel like it's the right move for my mental health. However I feel like I can't stop looking at the news and my experienc from my last company is making me fearful of the future.\n\nI'm coming out of FAANG (the worst one, you know which one) and in just the last year I've experienced:\n\n1. My entire team (and manager) being forced out, fired, or quit due to toxic upper management. \n\n2.I was LITERALLY THE ONLY FUCKING PERSON LEFT THAT UNDERSTOOD OUR SERVICE. One of my previous managers was given the domain and I was responsible for onboarding them and the rest of the team. Oh and I had only started working on this service at the START OF THE FUCKING YEAR.\n\n3. I was basically on-call constantly for 6 months because no one else knew anything about the service. I was still responsible for delivering my normal workload in my sprints though.\n\n4. A round of layoffs. I survived but still I think the whole experience fucking shook me to my core.\n\n5. Last but not least, and y'all could have predicted this, they relentlessly shoved AI down our throats and monitored our usage to make sure we were using it every day. To be honest I like using AI for research and brain dead repetitive tasks and some debugging, but I really don't use it to write my code. However everyone else on my team was basically pressured into only using Claude to code. I think the only reason I got away with it was because I was one of the top engineers and I was so critical to the service we owned.\n\nDuring my interview my recruiter and the interviewers basically sounded like they all used AI in the same way I did, but now I've heard they all got CursorCode subscriptions this year. I think CC can be a great tool and I've used some agents to parallelize some of my work like running tests or debugging but I just don't want it to write my code. It feels like I'm one of the few people that got into this job because I actually liked the craft and honing it?\n\nI'm just (maybe irrationally) worried that I'm just moving from one bad situation to another, and it's because no matter the company or culture AI has now turned our work into a sweatshop with no ingenuity.\n\nI think I really just need to know if there are other engineers out there who work in a company that is sensible about their engineering and they aren't pressured like I see all over Reddit and YouTube and at my last company? That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?",

It also started happening to us.\n\nUntil few months ago using copilot and claude was optional if needed and I was using them whenever it was making sense. Recently, there are a lot of pressure on us to do any thing as much as possible with claude. Our managers are convinced it boosts productivity 5x to 10x and no one wants to be that person to tell them otherwise.\n\nI also has a deep understanding in our teams domain. I usually break a task into smaller parts, then write and verify each part very carefully. But the way they pressure us to use claude, I'm not sure if I can do engineering like before. Apparently I have no choice but give it a try.",

Most people don't dive right into learning how to use it effectively, they start by dabbling here and there. Using it for one situation or another.\n\nI am the anecdotal case where I tell you that for me personally it is into the 5-10x more productive. I have created one webpage and two complete applications, in the span of about 4-5 days. Work that would have taken me at least 1-2 weeks for each of those situations. \n\nMy friend, who has completely adopted it, created a course to learn the advanced uses and I went through that course and picked up many more useful practices that didn't immediately jump out at me while I was in dabbling mode. Now I have defined /agents, a code-reviewer, a test-writer. I have hooks to prevent initializing tools I don't want it to use (or that don't work in windows). I am working on building some /skills for repetitive tasks that come up each day.\n\nI have been a software engineer for the last 30 years and I don't want to type much anymore. I have become skilled at recognizing what is a useful unit of work to take on at one time. How to provide enough guidance per task.\n\nI don't open Claude and say build me and application that does X. I create a set of folders, place some empty interfaces and classes (the core), create the domain entities. Then I explain one unit of work using those classes and files, like build a crud service with tests. Review the work, commit it. Rinse repeat until you have the whole application.\n\nIt feels good seeing your idea materialize into a working application in one morning, while sipping some coffee and skimming reddit.\n\nThe result is not AI slop, it is a carefully crafted useful tool built by an expert programmer and his assistant. With code reviews, planning sessions, requirements. All the things I would have done by hand but instead guided by my hand.",

Centralizing power and control, creating dependence, for the sake of further centralization of power and control.  \n\nNothing to do with software development, per se, I just think this bears calling out.  The solution, I feel, is not to quash such progress, but to compensate for its negative externalities (polluting our world is another way in which industrial civilization steals and fails to compensate), and prevent the worst abuses.  And the main insight is to recognize that the instances of harm are continual, and therefore the redress of it all must likewise be continual.  A one-time payment to the descendants of slaves and natives does not fix the inherent problems of our society (though it would be a good thing).  What we really need is to recognize the permanence of the abuse, and put into place permanent and growing redress.  A UBI is an example of this, as would be things like carbon taxes, extraction taxes, land value taxes.  \n\nI'm off my soap box now.",

          "text": "> I think I really just need to know if there are other engineers out there who work in a company that is sensible about their engineering and they aren't pressured like I see all over Reddit and YouTube and at my last company?\n\nMine is, but it's not a 'tech' company.  I'm one of two engineers for the whole company, we used to have three but are currently in a violent take over from an investor CEO who is cutting everywhere, so my job isn't secure anymore.\n\nThe original execs trusted us to do what we needed to do to build our internal tooling and support it so the business can operate.  They asked us about AI, one of the C levels loved to use it for work out advice and all sorts of random stuff.\n\nWe told them, it's basically a stack overflow replacement, great for boilerplate but ultimately is not a full on replacement for any real engineer.  We've slowly each, individually integrated it for our own selfs as we saw fit and shared things that worked.  \n\nOur UI guy I think got the most mileage out of it, for us in backend we used it for tests but really.. I mostly use it for looking up APIs and documentation, sometimes for creating unit tests boilerplate.\n\nI'm personally trying to learn more and more of it since everyone wants it and I'll probably lose my job in the next year.\n\nI'm even more of a dinosaur though, I can't stand editors other than VIM so I'll need a way to integrate AI without using a code editor myself, I ain't switching from VIM.\n\nI heard one of them, cursor or claude I forget, is basically like an AI terminal.  I'll try that route first.\n\nHaving AI actually write code seems kind of silly to me.  For UI I get it, at least our UI is a lot of.. redundant code (propagating properties through react components, same similar patterns to setup or create new react components).  There is redudency in backend but, it takes me a minute or two to just setup any boiler plate I need myself so AI doing it seems like a wash.\n\nAI has been EXTREMELY useful for things like, navigating AWS or Google UI consoles, generating or fixing errors in Docker and Docker compose files, configuration errors with different APIs we integrate, python dependency errors and basically as I said, a bunch of stuff i'd normally use Stack Overflow for.\n\nI tried VSCode + Copilot to implement a feature where we needed a celery task to pull data from a spreadhseet, make a call to a micro service we use to kick off a webscraper and write the webscraper function to pull the data from the site.  It.. kind copy pasted stuff to pull data from the sheet, but without context about what data was in the sheet or how to invoke our scraper, or what to do w/ the data from the scraper it was basically me writing the code but instead of writing code, I'm prompting the AI to write the code I would just.. write myself.  And it fucks up sometimes.  Basically pretty worthless for actual, local business logic.  \n\nPresumably I would craft a bunch of agents to like, look at the spreadsheet and determine from a header row I setup, what values are there and read the local python library we wrote to figure out how to read and write to the sheet and maybe access our microservice repository and automagically figure out how to make calls to it, run a browser to navigate to the site and generate XPath to use with selenium to find elements and navigate it appropriately.. but I would be spending weeks trying to figure out how to make all that happen.  I can just do it in minutes (hours including actually implementing the scraper and spreadsheet functionality).\n\nAnd of course, it's been basically worthless for debugging.  I get a bug report that a user is getting bad values in the system, a customer signs a contract indicating one thing but somehow it's stored incorrectly in the backend.  AI has no idea wtf is going on.  Since I know the entire system I can direct AI towards the problem areas and kind of baby it along it's reasoning but I'm still the one doing all the thinking anyways.  It's much easier for me to just run through and figure out stuff myself.   AI doesn't know the business logic, it just reads code, it doesn't understsand the product or how things are supposed to work, I do.  To leverage AI in this way, i'd need to spend all this time teaching the AI how everything is supposed to work and maybe.. it could at least figure out which code is relevant but it's a TON of context.  \n\nAI is basically just a suped up intellisense/autocomplete as far as I can tell and that's not really something I need when I have the whole programming AND product context in my head anyways myself.  As I said I'm a vim dinosaur so i don't even use intellisense for code completion or API information, I have most of it memorized by now.  When I do need to look things up I forget, like all the possible format options for formating a datetime string, AI is very helpful.  Again, it's just documentation stuff that i've found it useful for, not actually a junior engineer or anything.\n\nPeople say greenfield projects are where it excels, that makes sense to me.  Next time I need to setup a new service or build a new UI project I'll leverage AI and see how it goes, it's been helpful for things like that before.  Once you start having dependencies between different repositories and products/services and complicated business logic spanned across multiple systems.. it hasn't been very useful.",

How do they handle disagreements between engineering and product? Do engineers have real input on technical decisions or is it \"just build what we tell you\"? Ask this directly in interviews.\n\n  \n2. Does engineering leadership write code or at least understand the codebase? If the CTO hasn't opened a PR in 2 years, engineering decisions are being made by people disconnected from reality.\n\n  \n3. The AI mandate thing is a culture signal, not a technology signal. Good companies give you tools and let you figure out what works. Bad companies mandate tools and measure compliance. The companies forcing Copilot on everyone are usually the same ones that mandated Jira workflows and measured story points.\n\n  \nThe smaller company you're joining sounds like it could be the right move. WFH + strong engineering leadership + chill culture is basically the recipe. Give it a real shot before letting the industry anxiety pull you down.",

AI doesn't turn software engineering into a sweatshop, you have the terrible FAANG management you're working for to thank for that environment.  AI can actually reduce a lot of the toil of our job like you pointed out, there are several great use cases for that.  Ingenuity is still valuable and I would go so far as to say it is more valuable now than before.  Ingenuity is not something AI can do.  It cannot think outside the box beyond data it has been trained on.  It is not imaginative.  Humans still thoroughly dominate ingenuity and it will be what sets future companies apart from AI derivative outputs.\n\n\\> That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. This is not ingenuity. Wanting to hand write code is nice, but being creative and clever inventing new solutions is not actually tied to handwriting code at all.  You can have AI write code and direct it toward ingenius designs and never handwrite code.  Handwriting code has limited and diminishing value. However, reading and reviewing code and genuine creativity thinking of new designs and approaches that haven't been done before, that has increasing value.",

It’s context gap. They see artifacts and tradeoffs, but not the constraints that forced those decisions. Deadlines, weird client requirements, legacy integrations, staffing limits. Without that history, everything looks like a mistake.\n\nLetting them fully repeat the cycle is tempting, but expensive. What’s worked better for me is reframing from “we already tried that” to “here were the constraints at the time.” Even better if you can quantify it. For example, “we tried X, it caused Y in production, and we rolled back because Z.” Concrete scars land better than abstract warnings.\n\nYou could also suggest short design review checkpoints with explicit risk callouts. Not to block them, but to surface assumptions. If they consciously choose to accept a risk after hearing prior context, that’s different from walking into it blind.\n\nStack loyalty is real, but usually the deeper issue is ownership. They need to feel accountable for the outcome. The trick is injecting history without undermining that ownership.\n\nAre they dismissing specifics you bring up, or is it more that they don’t ask about the backstory at all?",

Document these but don't die on the hill. The new team might find a different solution.\n\n  \n3. \\*\\*Everything else\\*\\* - let it go. Some of the old decisions were genuinely wrong or outdated. The new team will find improvements you didn't see. Holding on to every choice as sacred is the other extreme of the problem.\n\n  \nThe hardest part is emotional. You built the thing. Watching someone dismiss your work feels personal. But the new team isn't wrong for questioning - they're wrong for not asking WHY before assuming the answer is incompetence. That distinction matters for how you frame the conversation.\n\n  \nDocument the critical stuff, present it clearly once, and then step back.

Good places are getting to grips with this explicitly. Bad places will just get to the same bad destination they were always headed for, only quicker.\n\nThe default starting point: people should own every line of agentic code they’re submitting for review, in the same way that they would if they had written every line by hand.\n\nThe question is then when it’s OK to deviate from that. My take is that a major factor is how much the code and its embedding in the wider world is likely to change in the future, whether in itself or in what’s depending on it.\n\nSo if it’s a one shot prototype, or some closed end single purpose utility of limited scope, limited human scrutiny is way more justifiable than it is for code that’s going into, say, a continuously-developing library with dozens of continuously-developing applications using it.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that you can get a lot of value out of automated agentic review. Not just for bugs and documentation inconsistencies, but spotting duplication and high level conceptual mismatches. I think some degree of that should be applied even to the most one-shot, single-purpose, almost-certainly-non-evolving code, since the cost of doing it is so low.\n\nGood places will apply these kinds of principles and get a massive multiplier in throughout with no drop in average quality - possibly even an improvement in quality overall. Bad places will not, and will end up in a mess even more quickly than they did before.\n\nEither way, agentic coding and review is a multiplier, not some magic bullet that can substitute entirely for human judgement.",

      "text": "I am not saying this to be self-deprecating either…I genuinely am too dumb to do this. Basically I am a 2018 grad, and I’ve been working since then. I have a Computer Engineering degree (which I regret because I hate hardware; I really want a true “software job” and I’ve been applying all over and have been doing all sorts of prep, but I fear I’ve been pigeon-holed atp). I coasted by in my first job out of college because it was for a defense company and I had great rapport with my teammates in general and I was well-liked overall. So even if I messed up (which I did a lot), it was forgiven because I was young/cute and “new” and friends with everyone.\n\nI quit in 2024 and started my current job, and yeah…I have felt like I’m way in over my far way too many times. I feel like I literally fooled my manager into hiring me, and I can tell I annoy him a lot with my incompetence. My current role has me working as a mid-level Embedded Engineer, and while I am good at/enjoy debugging and fixing issues in our firmware (this is literally the ONLY technical thing I am good at), I struggle with everything else. I have been given a bunch of hardware-related tasks during my time here, and I’ve already literally fried/blown up so many different pieces of hardware. I’ve also shocked myself a few times while handling hardware because I didn’t know that electricity would be flowing through a certain part or something. For reference, the last time I took a circuits class or did anything related to circuits was in 2015. I did some reading on my own on circuits and electricity, but yeah…anything hardware-related is just not intuitive to me.\n\nMy manager had also asked me to implement certain functionalities in our code at different times, but I literally cannot complete these tasks without getting significant help. And I’ve been reprimanded for “taking too long” to finish things plenty of times, so now I’m afraid to ask for help too (I know it’s super counterintuitive, but my mindset is that if I ask for help now, he’ll start grilling me over what I’ve been doing the past day/hours, which obviously makes it worse). Even now, I’ve been working on figuring out this one issue with a product, but all day and yesterday I’ve been having hardware issues (ie shaky connections so I couldn’t always get the console to appear, which I don’t know how to fix,  etc.), so I couldn’t make actual progress on the issue itself. When my manager called me at the end of the day today to ask for status, I said that I’m “still working on it”, which he clearly wasn’t happy about. He set up a meeting between us for the first thing tomorrow morning to get more status on this issue, and now I’m freaking out because I literally have nothing to update him with. I just don’t know what I will say and I’m certain I’ll get reprimanded.\n\nSomehow I’ve gotten “Meets Expectations” at every performance review I’ve ever had throughout my career, but even at my most recent one, my manger told me that I’m on the “lower end of that” (I suspect he feels that I am “Below Expectations”, but didn’t want that on paper) because I’m too slow and that I don’t know how to optimize my time well enough. I also feel shame because I’m a woman as well and I’m proving the “stereotypes” that women can’t do tech.\n\nHow can I be a better engineer? Is it even possible at this point? I’m at year 8 in this field and I’m miserable. Also what can I say during this “status meeting” tomorrow? I just feel a lot of fear and shame and anxiety with my situation overall.",

In tech, I would say the single biggest thing that correlates with success is the willingness to expose ignorance. In my experience, it is also the single biggest thing that underrepresented people—especially women—are terrified of doing. The reason that women don't want to expose their ignorance in situations men would is that they have accumulated a lot of experience over a long period of time that [it is unsafe to do so](https://xkcd.com/385/).\n\nMake an appointment with your manager and say that you feel you are underperforming by your own standard, and you want to turn things around. Explain that you often feel like you lack context on certain things and you're afraid to ask for fear of how it will make you look, and this builds up and up on itself until you're in a hole. Explain that you feel with a little of the right kind of support, you can level up.\n\nYou should look for a mentor, and then ask your manager to officially recognize this mentor relationship. Your mentor should be the person you level with when you don't know something or don't know how to proceed, and they should be senior enough to have those answers and be willing and able to coach you. The emphasis here should be sometimes just giving you the information you need, and other times helping you get the information you need for yourself. Your mentor should be able to judge when sending you out to ask a certain question actually will make you look bad vs. when it's totally appropriate for you to not know something and be seeking information, and they can protect you in the former case and push you in the latter until you develop that sense for yourself. To make this work, obviously, the highest priority is to find someone to mentor you that will be able to do so without judgment. The point of looping your manager in is that the upside for your mentor is they will be building experience toward a management role someday themselves, and they should feel good about this extra responsibility.\n\nThis should also be a limited engagement. Ideally, you get a mentor for one or two perf cycles, and after that it degrades into an informal relationship where you can go and ask for advice from your former mentor just as you would anyone else (and you should be branching out at that point too).",

People that accumulate knowledge gaps instead of filling them inevitably fail to have successful engineering careers. If you're afraid to ask a dumb question then ask it to Chatgpt (or Gemini / Claude) first. Then confirm with your mentor that the understanding you got is correct (yes, it's wrong sometimes and your mentor can also often provide additional context / perspective).\n\nAt 6 and 12 months do a self evaluation and compare this with your mentors evaluation of you. See if they have any advice on anything you should be doing differently. If after a year you still feel you're not enjoying embedded, that's ok it happens, you can then start applying for different jobs. But in your current situation it's too early to give up imo.",

You learn and the other time around you ask something new. That's how you show respect for others' time and progress in your own journey.\n\nIt \"seems\" you're in an environment that will be receptive to that kind of behavior, take advantage of it.\n\nIn similar situations it's helped me to think\n\" I may be right and be pretty much useless. Then I have nothing to lose really. I can give it an honest go and see where I land\"\n\nGoing software-only is an option, but to me it sounds like you're you're tapping out before the fight. Do your best here, then weigh your options.\n\nBtw, the troubleshooting that you mention you're good at... is the hardest skill ever and the start for any good engineer.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nPs.

As an engineer you should be able to resolve the problems in front of you - or know where to look for guidance and help. If I can solve/fix something in 5 minutes, its because I have experienced it before and learned the approach of attack; which before probably would've taken me hours, days on my own. I have been using AI chat as a teacher/mentor instead of just having it replace my job. Prompts I ask are things like \"why\" or \"best practice\" versus \"give me\" or \"solve for me.\" My company even has a internal chat so I don't have to worry about exposing sensitive information to the WWW.\n\nI'd describe the role as an entirely different way of thinking, you are a painter and your 'understanding of whatever platform or environment' is the color palette which is the key to successfully painting (interacting) and resolving the issues at hand. A natural river should be blue, not red. Its just cause and effect problem solving, some having more steps then others to find the solution.\n\nThe key thing to my success is that I take excellent notes and can communicate/articulate it well. This worked for the first couple of months. Now moving from a help-desk sort of role to an actual engineer/production support role, or I guess people call it dev-ops, I have to now explore the platform and document the unknown on my own, which means when I have a problem I have never come across - I have to figure it out on my own, or in the least if I know what questions to ask to get me to the solution - someone else might know the answers.   \n  \nCall it the leash has come off. And my notes? They're being ingested by a AI agent to support people who are coming after me, people who don't have any experience using my company's platform and are able to get up to speed. The notes existing help troubleshoot future problems by being proof of previously completed work.\n\nTo be successful you have to want to be successful, and I totally get it - until you feel like you want to succeed you probably won't and will keep down spiraling. I recommend therapy to unpackage those feelings, and also channeling your free time to production/positivity for yourself, instead of doom scrolling, enlist in some free classes that can make you feel more confident, work on small hobby projects to break the anxiety you may have and become more confident with software programming instead of hardware management.",

There's a ton of more general life things you can do to boost your confidence and that will carry over to work in my experience. Exercise is number one. Doesn't matter what really but ideally get your heart rate up high regularly and do some sort of strengthening stuff. Eating decent, staying hydrated, avoiding drinking/drugs. Do fun/social stuff in your free time. Go outside, get some fresh air and sun. Practice mindfulness, I don't mean becoming a meditation master, just try to learn to take a few breaths and ground yourself in the present moment and the physical experience of life. \n\nThis all seems like a lot but really just making some sort of consistent effort at hitting some of those points regularly makes a massive difference in my confidence and general well-being, which absolutely reflects in my work performance.",

Most of your issues seem to steam from a bad workplace situation rather than you not being smart enough to be an engineer. Just your post is a sign that you are smart enough to be an engineer.\n\nIdeas to improve in your current situation:\n\n1) Focus on giving clear communication on the issues. Don't wait for someone to ask you about status. At the end of the day if you didn't make any progress post about it in the team chat. If an engineer working for me only responded with \"still working on it\" on a task that should of been done I would have to go out of my way to figure out where they are stuck and why. It saves both of us a lot of time to post a short status once or twice everyday (the timing depends on the cadence of the team) of just \"What you are working on, what you tried today, what you've fixed, and what problems you are having\". Make it a predictable update. If you get good at it you can actually space out some days and not actually work (not that I would ever do that ;) ). The important thing is the appearance of progress and work is often enough to give you enough space to work things out.\n\n2) Learn how to keep and manage a personal development notebook. I have one that's just a folder of organized markdown files mixed with diagrams, code snippets etc I've made. A lot of low performing engineers I've encountered struggle because they have a hard retaining and recalling information. Especially at a new job where there is just a lot of new terminology and things to keep track of. Just having a notebook and keeping regular notes helps. It also tells managers you are taking things seriously.\n\n3) Find something at work you actually like and learn it inside and out. Not something general like \"debugging\" and \"fixing bugs\". Take a piece of the system and actually dig into it. Write your findings down in your notebook.\n\n4) Read the work of \"high performing\" colleagues when you have downtime time. Read through their commits and pull requests, can you understand it? Can you follow it? If not, write it in your notebook. The things you don't know at flag in your notebook and bring questions with you at the next opportunity.\n\nIdeas to leave:\nIf you just don't enjoy the domain or work, consider looking for adjacent work in the company. Application Engineer, Product and Marketing.. etc. There's other positions that are looking for technically knowledgeable people that do not require slinging code or slapping together hardware.",

Eventually it will click and the things that were hard will be easy, and they'll be replaced with a new batch of things to feel insecure about.\n\nI'd say the most difficult (and important) skill in writing software is to learn how to decompose a project down into small enough intermediate steps, that are each debuggable and move you in the direction of your eventual goal. Basically taking a difficult problem and turning it into a series (or a DAG) of small easy tasks.\n\nI am still learning how to do this, but it's the difference between being able to shit out a 100 line project that does the thing you want it to do and a 10k line project without really planning or architecting anything. If you do this, you'll find your code naturally gravitates towards some architectures depending on the problem, and you also start to get a feel for the \"friction\" when your code doesn't match the problem,\n\nThis is *not* an easy skill to learn. It is *not* taught or focused on. It is *absolutely necessary* if you wish to be a truly competent and independent engineer. That skill is the silent gatekeeper. If you're having this much trouble, it's because you're bouncing off against this hard wall. Which means you are absolutely capable of learning it, because you're cognizant of it, and can appreciate the enormity of it just upon observation.\n\nKeep at it, don't give up.

Usually mgmt/seniors get most frustrated with more junior folks who spend a lot of time going down rabbit holes instead of just asking earlier in the process.

And screw your boss for pressuring you so much.\n\nFor standup, just say your status, and own it.

We were (somewhere in-between) a startup/scaleup that was acquired by a much larger business, with the promise of new devs, investment, all the good stuff. They have followed through with much of this, but we have found that the developers who have moved over really just seem to dislike the way that we work and it is effecting everyone's job satisfaction.\n\nI like to think that we have been doing Agile 'properly', with genuine dev ownership of the features that they're working on, proper refinement, estimates based on real world velocity, all that stuff. Pretty high quality code and skilled devs too. When we saw how the new guys were used to working, being given long, detailed requirements and churning out code without any input, we assumed that they would be desperate to join in and get really involved in the product....but they straight up hate it. \n\nThey want to sit in a quiet room, and convert prewritten requirements into code, no questions asked. They weren't writing a lot of tests, and reviews were done begrudgingly with minimal effort. Very little discussion between devs about their work. Seems a hellish way to work to me, but each to their own. \n\nShould we even care? It feels like they are poisoning the well somewhat, it's pissing off the original developers, who feel like these new people are only doing half the job, but they do turn up and complete features. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice about cultural mismatches? Is this simply something that we're going to have to accept as we grow as a company?",

One group can work one way, the other group works the other way, and you kind of black box each other and compromise at the edges.\n\n3.

I kind of live in that role in my current work. It can be a little frustrating - one side pushes for more defined requirements, the other side pushes for better quality and design, and each group is slightly puzzled by why the other does that.

On the flip-side, features came out very slowly and often don't quite fulfill what the product needs.\n\nThere were attempts to somehow merge the solutions together and it always failed sooner or later. One side sees the other as snobs in an ivory tower who are so detached from the customers they don't see what creates actual business value. The opposite side sees them as inexperienced college students with no professionalism who need to be taught how to work properly.\n\nAt least in my team, coming from the \"gogogogo startup\", I definitely saw a need to change as way more people are now working in the code base and we have more protection from customers demanding everything yesterday. Also nudged things slowly into that direction to enforce tests and whatnot. But even when doing that, I could never quite shake the constant thought that ultimately, we need to deliver something to customers in a at least somewhat timely manner, and think about how to improve their experience instead of ours. So even when adjusting, it still clashed with the other culture, and they would start discussions about specific linter settings, how to name folders etc.. All things that I still view as a waste of time and will probably always. This will simply never work out unless one side gives in.\n\nSo imho: Either they exist in parallel or the people from the bought up company quit one after another. Haven't experienced it working out yet.",

From the business perspective, the larger company has all the reason to bring in the acquired company and to change their processes to match their own.\n\nThe people who are making these decisions know that this will disrupt ongoing work, cause issues, etc. They don't care. Most of these people are fixated on 1-3-5 year visions where those drops in productivity are mere blips on a graph. Someone might still get canned during that time for the lack of productivity.\n\nHuman capital management is a disgusting term but I encourage people in software to understand this subject because what is happening in our industry is pretty much all to reduce the cost of our work.",

          "text": "Cultural mismatches after a buyout are rough, especially when dev expectations are wildly different. The challenge is that you can’t really force people to value collaboration if they’re used to waterfall and heads-down coding. Trying to push them into the old startup culture too hard usually just creates more friction.\n\nA few things that can help: Start by surfacing and openly discussing the differences, why did your team value ownership? Why do the new folks value work in isolation? Sometimes there are legit reasons, like burnout from endless meetings or just being more introverted or neurodivergent. You might want to agree on some non-negotiables (like test standards and code reviews) but be flexible on things like how much product input is expected from everyone.  \n\nTry running mixed retros where both groups can share what’s working and what isn’t. This helps people feel heard and can surface compromises. Assigning pairings or small-group quests (not just for code, but for cross-team bonding) can break down some barriers, tools like QuestWorks in Slack do this without forcing video calls, which helps for camera-shy or introverted devs.\n\nFinally, measure outcomes, not just process. If people are delivering quality code on time but not engaging much, maybe that’s okay. But if quality drops or the team fractures, that’s when you tweak the approach. Basically, you probably won’t convert everyone, but you can try for some gradual blending, and make sure the original culture doesn’t get drowned out in the process.",

I told him that for more than a year I haven’t written code completely from scratch, but at the same time I’ve never accepted AI generated code blindly or shipped a feature without reviewing it and understanding its impact on the system and architecture.\n\nIn that call I explained that I had lost some of the dopamine I used to get from solving coding problems. Now I try to get that satisfaction from focusing more on system design and architecture, since AI gives us more room to think at that level. He replied that he now gets that dopamine from shipping features quickly and seeing things work.\n\nTo be honest, I needed the job, so I accepted it.\n\nNow the situation is this: more than 100,000 lines of backend code were generated in one month, and he is already talking about launching in multiple countries, scaling, and partnerships. Even a kid who plays games all day could probably find several security vulnerabilities in minutes. The codebase is complete spaghetti.\n\nThe team lead keeps telling me to “prompt correctly” because he thinks I don’t know how to prompt, and we’ve spent more time discussing how to prompt Cursor than it would have taken to build a proper system in the first place.",

At the end of the day how hard is it to wrap some logic in a function and pass params? \n\nI could have also written in the unit tests as I implemented, but considering I was handed a codebase with less than double digit coverage I’m just focusing on one problem at a time \n\nI’m just as surprised as you are that it worked so well, it was pretty awesome.

My question here is more related to whether you have been able to find a better fit elsewhere. For some context...  \n  \nI use plenty of AI, it's a great tool when used properly. But my company is pushing for heavy amounts of usage. I had my performance review where I started talking about the projects and what I had accomplished. My manager had little interest in that and we mostly talked about how I could create better prompts and use the tools more, as well as their success stories with what they've been doing with AI. \n\nHonestly I really like the company otherwise, and I've been there 3 years. But this has been frustrating and I am considering leaving. **If you've been in a similar situation, have you been able to find a better role?**   \n  \nI'm hoping to hear that some of you folks have made a jump to a team that has reasonable AI expectations. But I'm worried that my situation is the norm. Thanks in advance. ",

As a developer, I'm seeing unimaginable amounts of code pushed to our repositories on the daily without any PR review and very little testing. And as a result, we have tons of bugs on the backlog 🙃 It's pretty much the wild west out here. I'd imagine there's a lot of companies/devs right now that are going through the same thing. \n\nPersonally, I use AI moderately throughout the day. Really as a replacement for Google/SO. And only ~1 out of 10 lines of code I publish are generated by AI. Right now, I don't think AI is good enough atm to generate enterprise level projects without having an experienced developer (and also a great team) behind the wheel. But, who knows what it will be like 5 years from now.\n\nAlso, I don't mind seeing these AI questions every day. This is one of the biggest changes/shifts in programming that I think most of us have seen. It's important to discuss it and stay up to date with how we feel about it.",

Stop eating sugary sweets and junkfood. Get enough sleep. Take naps if needed.\n\nMedium: get the body moving. If you haven't exercised for a while it will do a ton of good if you can go for a walk after lunch, small bike ride, or just hit the gym for a 30-60 min strength workout 2-3 times a week. I was at my best when I woke up at 4 AM, went to the gym from 4.30 to 5.30 and then to work at 6.30.\n\nHarder to see: ensure you're not context switching too much. It's a productivity killer that's also linked to burnout, loss of motivation etc. I'm an architect on two different teams 50\\\\50 and I often feel exhausted and right now I'm dealing with loss of motivation. Even today I wake up to two different messages, before lunch I have had to jump between four different tasks and looked at PRs with two more. Afternoon I have to jump between huddles to help people with different things.. It takes it's toll. I've tried closing down all my notifications, list specific tasks I need to focus on, maintain focus on only one team, take regular breaks. Not sure if I just need to be harder on myself and enforce those boundaries even harder and not check messages so often.\n\nAnother thing for the dark winter (I'm from the Nordics); check that you're getting enough light exposure. I bought a bright light for my desk as I started to notice signs of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is more common in places that have long stretches of darkness and not enough sunlight.\n\nIf all else fails, seek professional help if it gets bad enough.",

I \"lead\" a very small team of 4 engineers total.\n\nI consider myself an AI pragmatist as in, I will use AI today in whatever ways it is most effective today but I will not adopt unproven or unsubstantiated patterns in the hopes that \"one day\" they are more effective. I don't believe in \"tooling up\" WRT learning how to use AI now so that I'm an expert 3 years from now. If it's that good, I'll learn it then. That's how I treat 99% of all other tools, I don't replace our testing harness once a quarter just because some CTO claims theirs *will* be better in a few years.\n\nI use AI day to day for developing ideas (like a rubber duck), finding ways to articulate technical concerns in concise ways, quickly spitting out code snippets, passing it a file with a question like \"why isn't X function working\", etc. But I don't bother asking it to solve fully creative problems. I'm *not* anti-AI.\n\nMy company, while not being an AI company, has gone full AI radical. They actively tell engineers that soon they will not be required and they should be embracing AI now so they are not left behind, because soon they will have the same job as PMs - which will both be developing features from the ground up. Like, that's a non-exaggerated paraphrase from the CTO. They fully expect their software company to be developed by non-engineers very soon. They said they expect engineers to stop writing tests, and just having AI do it for us. And so on. They said they are very happy to increase the number of outages & bugs because \"that is just the way of the world now\"\n\nI think that is fundamentally stupid and besides the existential threat to my job / insulting internal discourse, I want to leave *simply* because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by \\~80% and let PM's and designers run wild will, in my opinion, irreversibly destroy your product within a few years. And I don't want to be here for that.\n\n*Buuuuuuuuuuuut* I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project.\n\nSo here I am. Stuck for another 1-3 years, watching the company be burnt down from the inside by people giving AI tasks that AI is not yet equipped to solve. Trying to steer the ship towards sanity but merely doing that makes me look like I'm afraid to adopt new tech.",

I don't use any for work, period.\n\nNow what I did is to get informed on the field, how shit works (it helps that I am *very* familiar with ML), what are the limitations etc. In conversations pertaining to LLMs I end up the most knowledgeable about frontier models etc while I myself isn't a user of them.\n\nSo basically what I've been doing is that when I'm consulted, I give early warnings to the relevant engineering people, giving risk assessments to leadership people...and waiting.\n\n>  I want to leave simply because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by ~80%\n\nI completely understand. Like, a lot of the same, BUT. Leadership will come around. If you put yourself in their shoes, being promised +20% efficiency gains across the board org-wide for the price of a single engineer? Sign me the fk up! Unfortunately it's just all marketing bs so once the experiment will barely kill the company, leadership will come around.\n\nWrt downsizing that is just the stupidest way people understand \"efficiency gains\". It's +20% *per engineer*. If you fire all your engineers you get no gains anymore, duh.\n\n> Buuuuuuuuuuuut I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project. \n\nJust become leadership. Once you're there they *might* listen to words of caution. But until them, hunker down, and wait.\n\nMy anecdotal experience - I work in distributed E2EE systems - is that literally all of the projects with significant parts written by GenAI fail in some way because the engineers fail to acquire the related domain knowledge that working normally on those things would bring you. It allows you to debug shit instead of being absolutely clueless when something goes wrong.",

Absolutely insane value for quick prototypes to get a feeling what it'll look like and find edge cases. Medium sized repo in a non-mainstream language, still pretty good. It'll go through a bunch of files and find the right places very quickly. I use it iteratively most of the time. It'll be confidently incorrect at times so you have to double check. Specific guidance usually allows it to validate and catch itself. Once you have a good idea what you're going to do, make it write a plan and save to file. Then let it implement the change and once again guide it when it gets something not the way you like it. Global preferences of how you want to see the code in the corresponding md also help a lot. Working on changes spanning across multiple repos can get a bit wonky, but you can guide it out of confusion and context blowup with some md persistence. Closing the loop by giving it a compiler and tests is great as it'll fix silly mistakes. Asking it to add logs and debug an issue works some of the time. Pointing it to a CI failure and asking what happened can work surprisingly well. Pasting screenshots asking how to fix works some of the time. The key is in staying critical of what it's doing and working with it iteratively instead of expecting miracles. Sometimes it's absolutely stunning, sometimes it just falls on its face hilariously. Predicting which case it's going to be this time has been challenging.\n\nPS. Funny how y'all are downvoting facts. Good luck 👍",
