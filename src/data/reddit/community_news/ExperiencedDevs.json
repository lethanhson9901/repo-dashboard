Below it there was a GREAT discussion with \\~500 comments where other people shared their experience. I copypasted link to this post to two of my friends that are also programmers like me. Today I entered the link and I saw that post was deleted because of \"Low Effort\" without any other explanation. I don't understand why they are doing this,  what's the point?\n\n",

If that ain’t the point of Reddit idk what is. Yes that can apply to other careers but it’s dumb to take down a thread like that. Why? Because lawyers or other professionals can do this too? I don’t get it. Developers have different options and considerations than other careers. Where else can you get through to from other experienced developers?\n\nI like this sub and the thoughtful discussion even when the post at hand is the “same” as others in the past. But everyone and their situation is different so it’s really false to say these are repeated threads. All of this is to say I think the mods take down way too many posts that have interesting discussion \n",

In this sub the content that gets upvoted most are posts against AI. It would be awesome if we as technical people could adapt. \n\nFor example I’ll say the thing that will get me downvoted I’ve been partially vibe coding with an astonishing amount of success. I’m more than a decade and a half in too. I built out the bulk of a basic MVC, multitenant, subscription app with go just by carving out the bones and architecture of the app, documenting the coding standards of the app (two docs) and then giving a prompt for a CRUD action at a time and it’s been doing great. Things that took me a week now take an hour. The longest thing for me to do is code review. Truthfully it’s even fun again because I got in this to create. \n\nSome people absolutely hate that I said the above. They’ll chalk it up to either me being a shill, me being previously bad at my job, or all sorts of things. The reality is there’s a lot of jobs that took a lot of talent that could be moved to India. There’s a path for Western devs and it’s build more innovative stuff and extend what can be done. But it seems the limitation is insecurity leading to inaccurate criticism, being forced to use AI for everything, and a lack of capital to fund the new innovation.\n\nIt’s left the sub to be one of the worst technical subs on Reddit.",

The mods start lumping in good posts with bad posts because there is just so much to moderate, so anything remotely helpful likely will get removed.\n\nI still scroll and read this sub on occasion, and occasionally you find a gem of a post or a comment.

I skip most of the AI topics posted here too, as I don't use LLM based tools, but this particular one OP refers at I read and I found it an interesting PoV, one which **is a reality for many**, even if you don't like AI/use AI tools; if you have an OSS repo on github, chances are you will be confronted with this precise problem: people do drive-by PRs generated by LLMs and it's then up to you to wade through the mud to see what's useful (oh of course, you won't even look at them, and then you will be confronted by angry people who blame you for being lazy and/or asking you why you haven't merged their PR. It all increases time spent on irrelevant things). \n\nSo yeah, it's relevant, even for people who don't use AI tools (of which I'm one).",

          "text": "Here's what irks me about all subreddits that have a heavy hand for moderation regarding general content directionality: you're literally working against the core primitives of Reddit at the platform level. It's a fool's errand and the outcome is entirely predictable: user frustration across the board because the platform doesn't work as expected, the people who disagree with the moderation are going to be very well equipped to complain about it, and the people who agree with the moderation probably don't even know the moderation happened *and probably didn't need the moderation to happen in the first place*. So you're giving some users marginal to no benefit, some users a hugely visible negative experience, and *everybody* is getting treated like a child who can't be trusted to have nice things. There's barely any upside and very obvious much larger downsides.\n\nReddit is *literally* designed to be self policed, at least in terms of content direction. The core platform mechanisms of upvoting, downvoting, commenting, and time-based score decay are designed to algorithmically elevate the visibility of content people are *actually* engaged with, and to quickly bury content that people aren't engaged with. That is how Reddit as a platform intends to steer content directionality. Fighting against that as moderators can have no outcome other than annoying users. Yes, more than the annoyance users would see from observing an actual industry trend being repeated in their feed. \n\nHere's the simplest way I can put it: who should be in charge of determining what experienced devs talk about: experienced devs! It really is that simple. Let people talk about what they want to talk about. A moderator's job shouldn't be to gatekeep conversation topics. Trust me, commenters are more than willing to do that job for you and tell OP that their content sucks if it sucks. And sometimes there's good conversations to be had in the meta discussion about people agreeing or disagreeing about whether content sucks or not.\n\nModerator actions specifically in the dimension of content directionality should be exceedingly rare and the bar should be very high for such actions. It's not only a practical impossibility, but it's downright stupid to presume that you *should* stop developers, experienced or not, from talking about AI right now.\n\nI can not stress this enough: this is a pivotal moment for this subreddit. Continuing down this foolish path of trying to play conversation police via moderation will decimate this subreddit's engagement and stymie its future growth, especially once you get to the point of trying to enforce ridiculous policies like putting things in weekly threads. Again, Reddit is *literally designed not to work this way*. Over time, heavy moderation leads to fewer threads (whether strictly forced into weekly threads or not), which leads to the platform itself promoting the subreddit less often to existing members and less often to potential new members.",

          "text": "I can't speak for what the moderators thought.\n\nHowever, regarding AI, what kind of money do you think is currently circulating in this field, and what threat does this pose to those who are responsible for it? They still have budgets for huge advertising campaigns, and right now, as we speak, there's a gradual understanding that AI can't replace humans in complex development tasks.\n\nBut it's very well suited for deception, because even an experienced developer can't discern how well everything is done in thousands of lines of beautifully formatted code?\n\nIncidentally, a historical aside: When a bubble inflates, it first begins to grow in secret meetings and discreet discussions. Then it reaches the masses and usually turns into widespread hysteria before bursting, because it's necessary to reach even wider audiences with the smallest amount of money that can still be obtained.\n\nHowever, we use AI ourselves and can say that it's very good for some non-critical tasks. But only for non-critical ones, where the cost of error is low. This doesn't apply to development. In development, it's good for searching for certain information and, for example, viewing logs.\n\nI believe that critical discussions of AI are currently harming those who still hope to gain something from this market, and they are making efforts to suppress these discussions. These are temporary attempts to slow down the understanding that is already brewing. So much for the conspiracy theory. True, I think they're solving this through an incredibly large amount of AI advertising of all kinds. They've literally clogged the entire information space with it.\n\np.s.\n\nA scam (from the English word \"scam\" meaning \"fraud\") is a type of fraud based on the abuse of trust to obtain money, valuables, or personal information. Unlike hacking, which exploits technical vulnerabilities, a scam relies on social engineering.\n\n\\- So, if you were promised that by paying for a subscription to some AI client you'd receive fully working code or a real solution as a product, and you received something that doesn't meet your expectations, something that just doesn't work as expected, that means you were deceived and cheated out of your money. Now imagine that almost every day people come to me offering me work for $5 an hour, about 10 times less than I usually ask. They do this, believing that the work of fixing the code that was generated for them is cheap. But no. They've already spent their budget on a product that is very difficult to fix. And it really is better to rebuild it from scratch, simply because it's cheaper. So I have reason to believe they were deceived.",

Ironically, a post about passing responsibility without understanding the work gets removed by mods who didn't read the discussion it generated. The engagement showed it wasn't low effort. This happens across tech subs. Mods choose what they think should be valued, not what members find valuable. A post with 500 comments from experienced devs sharing war stories is perfect for ExperiencedDevs, but it was removed for not fitting someone's idea of \"high effort.' The AI/vibe coding topic often triggers removals because it's seen as controversial, already discussed, or low-effort. These topics resurface because they reflect real industry shifts. The frustrating part: those comments are gone. Genuine dev experiences are deleted because someone decided the post didn't meet an unstated standard. Subreddits decline from over-moderation, not spam or trolls, killing organic discussions. Members stop posting after many good threads vanish. What remains is sanitized and dull. Save valuable screenshots, as the good discussions are increasingly temporary.",

A bunch of out of touch devs who don't want to learn a new tool complaining about it in the saddest ways possible, blaming everything bad that has happened since 2023 on it, while everyone who tries to discuss it seriously or points out that times have changed gets blindly downvoted.\n\nThe problem with discussions like that is that they are pointless. They are full of the same people refusing to learn in every thread. The same arguments, the same biases, the same refusal to learn. It's really stupid to have the same \"WAAAH I have to use AI at my company woe is me\" thread at the top of the subreddit _every single day_.\n\nThe post you linked is honestly about as stupid as could possibly be. Of course using AIs shifts dev time away from writing and towards review. If people would just shut up about \"REEE AI\" for a second and actually consider what is going on they'd find it wildly obvious why AI creates more review for people to go over. _It's because there's being more code produced_ and produced code needs to be reviewed. Why do you need a different thread every single day to go over this?\n\nThe \"Waah they deleted my waah\" posts are getting old too",

They generate the code, push the PR, and let reviewers review “their” work.\n\nAs a reviewer, I'm honestly tired of pointing out bullshit 500+ lines super verbose Claude slop code filled with complicated logic and small mistakes that could've been avoided if the author wasn’t too lazy to review their own work properly.\n\nThink about it. These people are basically offloading their work onto the reviewers. All they did was write a prompt in basic English and pass the generated code along. Then reviewers do the hard work of actually reviewing and fixing what they were supposed to write in the first place. After it’s merged, they still get to claim the full credit. Reviewers get nothing.\n\nTo put it simply, they’re just middlemen between Claude and the reviewers. So why not just assign the task to me, let me prompt Claude directly, and let me claim the credit instead?\n\nMaybe it's just my incompetent team. I'm curious: are others seeing the same thing?

If devs are not doing their own thorough reviews for code generated by AI, they are just straight up not doing their jobs. It's like a worse version of copying and pasting directly from stackoverflow from loosely related problems.\n\n\nOP, depending on your role on the team, I would either create a policy or work with management and get buy in that you will auto reject code that is clearly just thrown over the wall/generated by AI. In the before-times, if there was an intern or someone junior who PRed something and clearly misunderstood or was way off down a rabbit hole or submitting broken code, you'd sit down with them and walk them through how to do it properly once or maybe twice.... If they continued to just not get it, they would not last on the team. \n\n\nWe should all be taking a similar approach, if a PR clearly hasn't been (thoroughly) human reviewed, reject it and talk to the dev directly about what they should be doing and why.... and if they continue to submit garbage code, handle it like it would have been handled previously. I haven't encountered laziness this extreme, but I'd start to escalate to upper management with references to wasted money on man hours and on the ai subscription, not to mention the massive risk of the company being a victim of, \"slopsquatting\".",

As he was going to a take a leave I looked to some PR to gather a little context.  \n  \nOMFG  \n  \nHe was accessing directly other project DB. That project has an endpoint to expose that data.

The front end guy in the past implemented some of code, including this stores. He did it correctly for sure. I am not sure if AI is now doing things in the same fashion or doing mistakes.\n\n\n\n>A.3- what do you mean? if a material is added to db, surely we need do nothing\n\n  \nI closed the threads (not that they mean anything in that project anyway). \n\nBut I let slip in the next meeting with the CTO that it was a little to much AI for me, and if that is that what he expected of me.

I don't really read most of that - I only look if there are any glaring issues that could cause problems outside of its scope. My bigger concern there is that AI might see some of those ugly patterns and repeat it in future changes in other pieces of the code, where it matters more.\n\nI am also less strict in demanding all of my comments be addressed at the time of the PR, because with CC it's easy to do that in a follow-up PR, and our devs are willing to do that. If you can merge in 5 PRs, 4 of which are cleaning/improving the original structure, you're probably better off quality wise than getting 1 PR up to perfection as you'll likely get to try the thing in some sort of staging environment and see what the \\*real\\* problems are, all the while you're simultaneously writing up the improvements to the original comments.\n\nWith business I've also made clear that we cannot guarantee a good level of quality & maintainability for much of the prototypes they're asking us to churn out. That's sorta OK as they get to try out a lot of ideas and we're free to completely restructure/rewrite the code later without worrying about producing the exact same results - which is usually quite a lot of work when you're having to refactor existing systems.",

Can't get the agents to run it is my biggest problem, the model tool calling reverts to what is appropriate for the language, rather than https://github.com/titpetric/atkins as clearly stated in prompts/agents/claude.md. lefthook + atkins is a little bit of of a guardrail, but it again gives LLMs ways to fuck up a process by just disabling the gate.\n\nExternal test suites have been called excessive in my line of work just two years ago.

Now I'm spending most of my time cleaning it up and (in some cases) rebuilding entire features because the AI built it in such a way that it's totally unmaintainable and broken in production due to edge cases that are a product of that bad design.\n\nFun fact: I got a glowing performance review from my boss the other week off the back of this work and that I'm ahead of most of the rest of my team for bonuses this year. Needless to say the contractors in question are actively being off-boarded and we're not using them again. \n\nThere's going to be a lot of work in remediating AI generated code, especially in critical services so I don't foresee senior devs having any job security issues in future.\n\nLooking forward though, AI will (eventually and undeniably) become the mainstream way of generating code. The question will be does the generated code move from being AI Slop that takes the effort of a full time emplyeee to maintain or does it become good enough to replace those jobs. The former of those 2 is preferable and IMO the likely outcome. \n\n",

It's not all bad for me, I've carved out a pretty interesting project that uses AI in a high leverage way, but it's certainly a level of company wide visibility that compresses the talent gradient.\n\nI'm still hopeful, because the model of how we're using AI is new, and could be the direction we take the entire org.

And, while they are learning, you are pretty much guaranteed that AI will do something better than they will, or at least as good as what they do.\n\nSo what we’re really looking at is: **do we want to burden a senior with some AI agents, or do we want to risk investing in a junior which will take a long time to be useful, and maybe when he does he will actually leave us to get a pay raise?**\n\nObviously, there are ways around this, such as giving better wages to junior people. However, this, again, the equation shifts towards AI, which ends up being much cheaper.\n\nI think we have a real issue with how we’re going to form and develop more juniors into seniors, and it will take stronger investment from companies.\n\nBut the little guys can’t do this, or they will be outpriced. So to me, it must be the big guys that have to be willing to do this, because they _can_ afford to put in the extra money to form people.\n\nI do think the little guys are getting the shaft, unless they find juniors who are very good. But, then again, if they are very good, they should probably go to a place where they will earn more.\n\nThe equation is very unbalanced. No one wants to pay more to juniors because it's a high-risk investment. And, yes, I think it's short-sighted. We **will** need people to develop skills and go from junior to senior.",

These are exactly the kind of things it might be very well positioned to do with the right setup. It is tougher on legacy codebases, but not impossible. However, sometimes the upfront setup of making it Claude-friendly repo might be not worth it.\n\nBut as far as lack of juniors - I get it. I exited the corporate a year ago (laid off, now doing my own thing) and I cannot imagine why I would hire juniors, at least not the \"caliber\" I worked with. I already saw this in 2024 - AI slop PRs, AI rising early in their career meant most of them will never actually learn to program by themselves. At my non-FAANG company the median junior was kind of terrible *before* AI and I can confidently say that Claude Code with Opus 4.6 simply produces better code. Yes, it needs more hand holding, yes, sometimes it will do absolutely stupid things, but on average it's better and it's also superhumanly fast.\n\nWith the things other commenters mentioned - the AI aided cheating, the massive AI slop resumes, etc. WHY in the world would you try to hire juniors when you can pick up experienced seniors, that presumably learnt to code without AI and due to wage compression you can probably pick them up for lower salary than a couple of years ago?",

The ones still in the squeeze are the ones that treated AI as headcount reduction rather than capability multiplication.\n\nYour point about seniors doing library upgrades and releases is accurate and it is painful. But the root cause is that the junior pipeline was not just about cheap labor, it was about freeing senior attention for the work that actually needs senior judgment. When that pipeline breaks, everyone steps down one level and the leverage disappears.",

The process of explaining why you made a system decision is actually how those decisions stay sharp. Without it, you get architecture by tribal memory, and tribal memory degrades fast especially when the team is already at capacity just keeping the lights on.\n\n\n\nWe went through something similar a few years back at a place I was at — not an AI story, just a round of layoffs that took out almost all the mid-level folks. The seniors were fine, technically, but within about 18 months the codebase had drifted in ways that were hard to explain. Not wrong exactly, just... internally inconsistent. Nobody had been asking \"why\" enough. The juniors who ask annoying questions are actually providing a service.\n\n\n\nThe AI angle makes it worse because the implicit promise is that the productivity gap will be covered by tooling, so you don't need the human pipeline anymore. But AI doesn't challenge assumptions. It just executes on them. So if your assumptions are quietly degrading, nothing catches it.",

                  "text": "You can’t compare MoviePass to Uber and Lyft. MoviePass failed because they had no leverage and no moat. The idea made total sense, but it was genuinely one of the dumbest business ideas I’ve ever heard.\n\nTheir idea was essentially to subsidize movie costs long enough to grow to large enough user base that they could then threaten to take theatre chains off their service and use that threat as leverage to negotiate lower ticket prices or a percent of concessions. They also planned to sell analytics data to studios to help them understand trends.\n\nThe problem was that the movie industry is dominated by just a few, massive chains who could replicate their idea in an afternoon once MoviePass proved the demand was there and MoviePass would have no leverage to do anything about it.\n\nFor customers, the only advantage MoviePass had was their pricing model. Whether you’re buying through MoviePass or the theater directly you’re still going to see the same movie, buying the same snacks, and sitting in the same seat. That meant that as long as MoviePass was still losing money all someone like AMC would need to do is match their price and wait for them to go broke. Since AMC is much bigger and could run at a loss for a lot longer than MoviePass it was never going to work out.\n\nI get why the Uber comparison seems to make sense at first glance. They both kind of fit the “we’re just going run at a loss and burn VC money until we have the leverage to raise prices”. The critical difference is that when Uber was starting up they were competing with much smaller, highly local companies who couldn’t just lower prices indefinitely and build a dispatch app over night. Also, the pricing dynamic is reversed. If you’re an Uber driver and Uber says they’re reducing driver pay, you can’t really go do your own Uber. You can quit, but that won’t meaningfully affect Uber. If MoviePass demands a better deal from AMC and AMC says no, so MoviePass removes AMC from their service, like I said before, AMC could just copy them and run at a loss until MP went broke which is essentially what happened",

Reality disagrees. While I agree that this is likely the viewpoint of some at the top of the chain pushing AI so hard... this isn't the ground level reality. Many companies using AI are already openly admitting they gain little to no benefit from AI, while pushback is already increasing.\n\nYour average business on a day to day are currently spending $0 on AI - most of the spend is highly concentrated near the top. This won't improve any if these companies were going to start charging. There are specific more targeted fields such as developers where AI has shown real gains. I don't want to make it sound like I think AI is useless... it's a legitimate technology with a lot of room to grow, but currently the primary value is in very targeted applications, and in many of those applications consumers are pushing against the use even when it may be useful (think AI in videogames etc.)\n\nAs of now at least, there are still a huge amount of jobs that require minimal computer use at best... while requiring effectively 0 AI use. If my plumber started bragging to me about using AI on his work... honestly I'd probably change plumbers. \n\nUntil we have high-end robotics with a functional near-AGI, many of these jobs will never adopt AI, because it does nothing for them. We are nowhere near a functional AGI or the necessary level of robotics, and there is a lot of research and evidence indicating that this current path of LLM's will likely never achieve true AGI. \n\nSo while use might expand out as they make AI versions more targeted at different areas other than development... this isn't a simple, or quick, or cheap thing for these companies to do. \n\nSo while I agree this might have been the intention here... we aren't actually seeing it succeed, and they are already starting to run out of \"runway\" of blowing a lot of money for little to no gain. Which leads me to your other comment...\n\n>And since it's all funny money (an A gives to B gives to C gives back to A circle jerk), they can keep this train on track, no matter how absurd it seems.\n\nFor a while they can... they absolutely cannot keep doing this indefinitely. All it takes is 1 piece to fail and the entire structure starts to crumble. Once that happens the entire circle jerk collapses.",

If your entire muscle memory and project config is built around a hosted tool that later triples in price, switching costs are high even if alternatives exist.\n\nThe hedge is not limiting AI use -- it is staying model-agnostic in your tooling where possible, and making sure you understand what the model is doing well enough to catch it when it is wrong. That skill does not atrophy when prices change.",

Which makes sense because this is ultimately just software and software is cheap to run but expensive to develop.\n\nMy thoughts on these implications:\n\n1. So for the foreseeable future, there's gonna be a seemingly endless push to the next model, because 1. they've already dumped billions into the next gen, and 2. if there's an arms race, no company feels like they can be the one to stop first.\n\n2. If the entire industry *does* grind to a halt in the research and frontier model areas, we won't necessarily be priced out of the current model at the time because again, it's cheap to run inference. I do expect prices to go up though, but how much is still in the air imo. When this happens and what might cause this collapse is anyone's guess.\n\n3. It's a weird thing that the current model is profitable, but they have to keep shoveling increasingly large amounts of money in to create the next thing. It's almost like the pharmaceutical/meds business model. Except there's not as big of a reward.",

Frankly I think automating more white collar work would be good for human welfare overall, and I wish we could get more compute online more quickly. On the other hand I think there are certainly a lot of potential risks associated with smarter and more capable AI systems coming online, and the more quickly they come online the less time we have to address those risks. I also think TSMCs natural monopoly here isn't great, but they literally made the market possible in the first place, so good for them I guess. Just wish they had some real competition. \n\nThere's also the possibility that we (or we, with the help of smarter AI) discover ways to create far more efficient and intelligent AI models, I'm talking about something entirely orthogonal to the current LLM approach, all this compute build-out becomes obsolete as a result, and we become obsolete as well.

Today, the open weight models are easily exceeding what was possible with Sonnet 3.7, with most of them within spitting distance of Sonnet 4.5/4.6. Hell, some even challenge Opus 4.5/4.6 in some tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to open weight models, what you see happening is people applying the well known pattern of any other form of hosting to inference.

People's jobs.\n\n\nFor the UK and the US (just googled this) the biggest source of government revenue is individual income tax (from employment I gather)...which gives you an idea of just how big that market is and why \"replacing people's jobs\" can be the type of thing that gets investors excited enough to keep throwing money into the dumpster fire.\n\n\nAnyway, whatever their aim, I think it just has to stop because it can't be our life's ambition as technology builders to make sure other people lose their jobs and can't feed their families. Tech (including AI) should _empower_ people not rob them of their dignity. My two cents :)",

This way it really can't build this self-reinforcing echo chamber of doom posts.\n\nBut my personal experience is that I started to develop this AI anxiousness around 3 month ago due to those posts, and couple of weeks ago it peaked to state really close to a panic attack. This was a tipping point where I decided to radically cut down on exposure to all platforms where AI hype is mainly advertised through. I guess it's obvious too that it did wonders to my mental health in no time. But I'm still guilty of jumping on my account to check out subs like this in a convenient manner.\n\nAnd no, I'm not a complete AI denier.

These people are all looking to get rich and this is the hot trend. \n\nIf you cut out all their noise AI is pretty awesome for us devs, especially on projects with a sole developer. I can pump out refactors faster, style up a new UI component, or identify regressions/bugs much faster. \n\nBut really all that allows me to do at my firm is accomplish things that wouldn’t get time before (e.g. style my app a bit nicer, summarize unfamiliar codebases, or spend 10 minutes on a bug that may have taken over an hour without AI). It’s not like I paste a chat message or JIRA ticket into a prompt and wait for my agent to do all the work while I play videogames.",

          "text": "There's a few aspects to it.\n\nOne is the simple notion that AI productivity gains gives companies a free license to conduct layoffs without fear of public backlash or running afoul of other laws. At least that's how their risk assessment frames things. So it matters not whether these productivity gains are real or imagined; what matters is that they effectively let the company pin the layoffs on something that's hard to push back on as a practical matter. Meanwhile, please don't look at the number of H-1B Visa applicants that same large company is applying to sponsor and please don't note how that number is suspiciously similar to the number of layoffs they just announced because they're now so much more productive.\n\nAnother is the notion that \"increased productivity\" from AI comes with tradeoffs that companies simply don't like to acknowledge: the AI output is lower quality than the previous human outputs, but it's way cheaper and faster so they simply don't care. There's nothing *inherently* wrong with trading risk and quality for speed and cost, but the perverse incentive here is that companies have every reason in the world to not acknowledge the full magnitude and consequences of the tradeoff being made here. They only want to see the \"faster and cheaper\" part, not the \"worse\" part and they certainly don't want to think through the negative externalities that might result from their outputs being lower quality. Depending on what domain this is being applied to, the consequences range from annoying to lethal. Customer support bots being shit is annoying, but a medical device company slapping AI into their products might literally kill people. Do you think that medical device company is going to explicitly acknowledge that their most profitable quarter came knowingly and predictably at the expense of X number of excess deaths and they made that tradeoff deliberately? No way.\n\nFinally, I think some people are simply not skilled enough in the domain to which they're applying AI (or imagining how AI will be applied) that they genuinely don't realize how bad it is. Whenever somebody not skilled in a domain talks about AI replacing people in another domain (or their own domain that they're junior in), I always ask them some version of this: \"Imagine the difference between me using Chat GPT to do your job, versus you using Chat GPT to do your job. If you're imagining an immense difference in output quality and the way the interactions work because of your domain expertise and my lack of it, that's exactly why AI isn't going to take anybody's job any time soon, at least not without a large drop in quality. It's just a tool for people already skilled to use.\"\n\nI'm not sure if this applies outside software development, but there's also the idea that productivity gains only come if you're willing to not invest the time to fully understand the LLM generated code. Yes, LLMs write very plausible code quickly, but if you're not actually taking time to *fully* understand the system and the implications of the code changes from the LLM, when you're actually trading off (besides quality) is simply *knowledge* of how your system works. This is one of those things that doesn't cause any acute damage, but it slowly chips away at quality and scalability and cost and it just generates so much code that nobody actually understands that it sets things up for a massive cascading system failure mode that will absolutely kill you when it triggers.",

I sort of feel like you’re asking a loaded question and don’t really want me to explain how AI tools help me.\n\nApologies in advance for any typos. I did spend a while on this comment, but I’m writing on mobile. \n\nI agree that 10x productivity numbers are suspect. But some observations:\n\n- The tools have continued to improve. Even in the last quarter and the last month. If you’re company isn’t paying for access to frontier models, we aren’t really having the same conversation here.\n\n- The “omg your company pays $500-$1000 per dev per month for AI token” posts are super disconnected. That’s a pretty normal productivity tooling budget for most companies even before AI. If you think that number is shocking, then you are either an outlying working at cost-center companies like banking, or you’re disconnected from how much tools normally cost. I guarantee that your company pays overheads like this on its profit centers. So if this number sounds crazy for a dev tool to you, I’m sorry that this is the first time you’re finding out that you are viewed as a cost center. \n\n- With that said, vibe coding still doesn’t work. Debugging, architecting, code structure, test practices, etc have become more important, not less. Now that AI can generate the easy stuff, the hard stuff becomes more of my job. \n\n- Additionally, a lot of my job has been about scaling out AI tools across multiple engineers and dev teams. Really no different than my previous responsibilities as staff engineers. 50 devs using AI tools effectively still generates more productivity than me generating code myself. \n\n- With that said, I *do* generate about 95% of code that I check in. No, it’s not slop. Clear design vision, technical specs, and written down business context really help out. You should’ve had this anyways, right? This was a good practice even before AI. \n\n- I’m not 10x more productive. But maybe 2-3x more productive. Obviously this doesn’t always show up in any metrics that can be measured. If I spend an afternoon fixing 3 user facing bugs instead of 1, obviously that’s not going to show up in any sort of metric that matters. I know all the devs here would flip out of their managers asked them to quantify their productivity, since we all know that measuring the effectiveness of developers is incredibly difficult. So why are my claims about AI tooling being held to that standard? Can you pull numbers which show that your favorite IDE or programming languages makes you x more productive. I will recognize that this is an problem for AI labs: they are investing real money but it’s possible the benefits won’t show up in monetary returns or GDP growth. Obviously those things only *sort of* measure human well being. It’s possible to build genuinely better software that benefits humanity without it reflecting in GDP growth. \n\nAnother important point is that I was an AI skeptic until a few months ago. I predicted we would hit a wall, but frankly we didn’t, so I admitted I was wrong.\n\nI also am not a bot and I don’t financially benefit from AI in any way. I’m skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims about the benefits of AI. But I do believe that the current tools make me 2-3x more productive.",

I don't want to add to the noise but I what I actually don't \"get\" is the unrestrained excitement people have over this. There is, I have to say, from this community, a little bit too much dismissal as well.\n\nI am a very experienced engineer now (nearly 3 decades) and I have helped build an \"AI company\" in the early doors times. This stuff is different, it is very good and it is improving. I think a few of you out there will already be learning that it is as good as it's steering, but as you evolve that, you can get it to stay on track for more and more cycles and the redirections it needs become increasingly minimal.\n\nIt is \\*incredible\\* tech, and I do think we are in trouble. Nobody should be happy, because even if you feel you can wield it like prometheus, many can't (across industries and fields) and could well be swallowed, and they will not sit back and die without an awful lot of turmoil.\n\nFrankly, there are pretty significant fields and professions that are \\*already\\* redundant and just haven't woken up to it.\n\nI also have to say that as the industry has grown in my tenure, the average quality of an engineer has dropped significantly. Sorry to say that, but too many bootcamps and people just looking for a comfortable office job. Those people are dead fucked. When your colleagues are sharing their experiences with this tech, pay careful attention to who is finding success with it (even if they complain). I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid national average wage and I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid minimum wage... and those people do very well with this tech as a partner and assistant and eventually get it doing their bidding largely with nudges and pushes. They know how to architect a codebase, and to avoid confusion in the context and they can iterate and build increasing complexity.\n\nThe people who haven't paid attention, don't care, and it works on their machine.... are the ones saying, \"this shit doesn't work at all, it keeps falling over, introducing stupid bugs, getting caught in a loop....\", etc.\n\nThe reason I have not replaced all the shit code that barely works that has been written by this people... has been a lack of time.\n\nAgain, I suppose I am adding to the noise here, but I hear \"wrongness\" from both sides (imo).\n\nI think it is simple and scary. This stuff is not perfect, but it is very good. We should be very alert to the fact that had somebody told you 10 years ago that your computer would happily work for hours on a coding problem and you would be a little bit excited when it finally got confused... you would call the men in white coats. Yet here we are...\n\nWorry is legitimate.",

Jackpot tbh.\n\n\nBut yeah using Opus 4.5, you can see its come along in leaps and bounds. I'm not convinced its actually faster to have AI written code fully, unless you don't care about quality, but it saves a tonne of time to know what you want, and work it out, or have the agent help work it out with you. I think being a naysayer is foolish considering just how much better these tools have gotten, they're not quite good enough yet, but if this rate of improvement continues, then I don't see why they couldn't automate basically all white collar work.",

Throw away the influencers, the machines and everything.  \n\nTake a minute to think about AI conceptually.  What problem is it trying to solve?  What TRILLION DOLLAR problem is it trying to solve - because that's how much money they are pouring into it.  \n\nThe answer to that question, my distinguished colleagues, is the single most expensive line item in nearly every single company in history - wages.  They are trying to solve for having to pay employees wages.  \n\nNow, given what you know about the average CEO, assume I am right about the above for just a moment - that they are basically trying to solve for paying wages.  Can you think of a single thing that would stop all of these margin-obsessed people from pursuing the ability to stop paying employees?  In a rational market, is there any way the market itself wouldn't punish a company for not trying to incorporate technologies that mean they don't have to pay their biggest line item?  \n\nThe doomsayers, as you call them, are trying to sound the alarm, I would imagine.  It's too late, but they are at least trying.  The tools have gotten better at a predictably geometric rate and are accelerating.  The tools this year are orders of magnitude better than the tools this time last year.  And those tools are being used to further accelerate the pace of development.  The better the tools get, the faster and better the NEXT generation of tools, which produces the faster and better NEXT generation of tools.  It's not going to stop improving.  It's not going to be legislatively slowed.  Better smarter AI is always going to be around the corner for the next little while unless we run up against some theoretical wall of which we are not currently aware.  \n\nI'm not even wading into the defense angle, which is a whole other ball of wax.  It's OBVIOUS most of the world powers think that the next wars will be fought in part by AI and are gearing up accordingly.  \n\nThis IS a transformative technology, and it WILL continue to get better.  The business world smells blood and can't see beyond the next quarter's results so they will continue to barrel towards a world where they don't have to pay knowledge workers anymore.  It's not there yet, but each generation of model is bringing us closer, to the point that it's scary close right now.  \n\nOh yeah, and before you go out and get a job as a welder, check out all the latest innovations in robotics!  You really think they're not gonna slap AI in those things the second they can and hire them out as robo-plumbers?\n\nThe writing is basically on the wall.  We're in for major disruption one way or the other from this technology.  People who don't see it - I'd just point you to the comparative benchmarking of the different generations of models.  It is a verifiable fact that they are getting better, and matching or exceeding human capabilities in a large class of general tasks.  And they're not likely gonna get much worse moving forward.  ",

I look at a graph of claude performance on benchmarks the last 3 years and there is nothing but inevitability written on a graph like that.  I've seen the curve in a thousand datasets and I know how it ends. I'm not even a doomer - I'm just saying disruption. I'm actually all in on ai and personally can't wait for AGI. I genuinely believe thr benefits will end up outweighing the negatives even if the ride is bumpy getting there. I'm banking on something like AGI will solve the problem even if humans can't.  If I'm wrong then no big deal. But something tells me you're going to end up thinking about comments like this a lot in the next few years regardless of what you believe right now.

          "text": "While some level of paid marketing is probably involved. I think everybody is actually impressed, scared and lost about what's going to happen. Obviously the \"Everyone will be replaced\" rhetoric is the most dumb conclusion one can get.\n\nHumans are here to stay. Unless our planet becomes so unbearable to human life that we all die and robots will outlive us, nobody is going to be replaced by anything. We will be served by AI and bots and our lives will be exponentially better. Companies need costumers. To have customers, companies need to employ. That's basic economics and companies know that. If they fire everybody, they are just creating infinite amount of competition, since 1 engineer can now produce alone the equivalent of 10, and those laid off engineers have industry knowledge. To survive they will need to create their own business. Big tech also know that and CEOs will need to be reasonable about how much risk they want to take by firing highly skilled people.\n\nPhilosophically speaking, I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where everything is trusted to AI. We all want a reassurance that there is a human in the loop in case things go south. If money disappears from your bank app, do you seriously want to talk to an AI engineer? No! You want someone who you can put in prison for violating the law. AI can't go to prison right now... its kind of a problem, isn't it?\n\nFinally, coding will become an increasingly scarce skill as younger generations have no incentive to code without AI assistance.  Experienced devs will retire. Just like Cobol engineers are still needed and rare to find, so will be experienced engineers that actually know how to code, instead of prompting.\n\nKeep on coding, and everything will be fine.",

The mood shifted very abruptly this year because the tooling went from \"it helps I guess\" to \"holy shit this thing just completed all my sprint work in an afternoon\".\n\n\nI think whats really going on is the dev world is splitting into two camps:\n\n\n1. Devs who work at companies that rapidly adopt new tech and have the resources to go balls to the walls in implementing it. These devs are seeing what this tech is capable of when given extensive documentation, tooling, and a very large repository of high quality code.\n\n\n2. Devs who work at smaller companies or non-tech companies that are slow to adopt new tech, have shoddy development practices, poor documentation, and basically just use AI out of the box. They might also be using obsolete AI products like Copilot and old models, or their company may not allow LLM usage at all and the devs cant be bothered to experiment with it outside of work.\n\n\nGroup 2 hasn't seen what Group 1 has. Group 2 thinks AI still churns out error ridden spaghetti code with no understanding of domain or business rules, while Group 1 is in the process of adapting to a new engineering paradigm.\n\n\n> I can't help but think we are being bombarded by a concentrated marketing effort by AI companies employing bots to disseminate their narratives.\n\n\nThe neat thing about this mindset is it makes it impossible for you to consider you could be wrong. Any evidence or experiences to the contrary that get presented to you can and will be brushed off as more evidence of a conspiracy.",

It's the talent to phrase a problem in words, then convert that problem into math and analyze it in math terms, and then convert that math result back into words so that a normal person can understand the answer. \n\nWe should all be familiar with our school experiences where very few students were good at math word problems, and that was a huge differentiator. Personally, I've run into students who can get a 100% A+ result on a calculus test (back in the 1980s, so not a grade-inflated A+), yet give them a simple physics problem (block on a frictionless inclined plane) but move \"theta\" from the horizontal angle to the vertical angle. I could give hint after hint after hint (that it's a different formula) but they'd still answer \"m\\*g\\*sin(theta)\" and not \"m\\*g\\*cos(theta)\". So you can have a lot of very smart people, but they're smart because their memory is good, not because they can look at a problem and figure it out from scratch.\n\nSo employers are necessarily trying to acquire the top 5% or so of all possible candidates. The competition is so steep that most employers can't afford that level of talent, so they end up with very bright people who can talk the talk because they can remember everything, but they are much slower at actual problem-solving.",

Someone inexperienced might see that and think that's just par the course. But in reality those jobs represent a minority compared to all of the software jobs out there. Most are not going to find themselves working at these types of companies.\n\nSame logic applies to the strength of the average developer. Most people are adequate and can do their jobs. You're in the minority if you are a 10x developer who eats, sleeps and breathes programming. I've worked with exactly 2 developers like that in 7 years across 3 different jobs. Most everyone (me included) is just an average developer who gets their work done and contributes, helps out where they can, and then goes home at 5 to do anything but stare at a screen programming.

Mostly because I sense that software engineering skills (in isolation) are becoming less valuable, and I'd have to adopt new skills (product management, data science, etc) in order to keep up. Kind of like combining multiple roles into this \"new, specialized software engineer\" role. Do you think this is true, that we have to learn more about additional fields as software engineers in order to keep up?",

Is it on some metric of \"they produce in X interval Y lines of efficient clean code to accomplish some defined outcome in a given common language\"? well that's who can ingest a well written ticket. Is it \"as a partner to stakeholders, they insightfully guide the refinement of the business statement and build the code and automation to suit the goal in a clean and meaningful way?\" then how do you measure that? If it's by the speed and financial success of the project, a personable developer who may not have as much familiarity with data structures as someone who doesn't engage with the ask but memorized a dozen DSA books would be more successful in that metric that no doubt matters more to the business, but we wouldn't call the former a stronger developer in a CS-class vacuum. \n\nIf we were to look at total outcome of career, again define that. Total earnings? The outliers are significantly based on luck, a weak developer who skated in as engineer 150 at Meta would be better than someone strong who chose a series of startups that failed to exit well. Plus, for some money isn't the goal. \n\nIn addition, people lie and talk big game on the internet, I'm sure plenty here have been on panels where someone's HN/LinkedIn presence is full of big talk about creating outcomes but then you put them in a whiteboard session and they can't do a tenth of what they post about. \n\nAll this to say, don't worry much about the internet presence unless you want to leverage that for your career (then back up big talk with skills, please). Focus on what matters for you and grow a little every day to reach that metric of \"better\" for yourself.",

I think it’s partially that, ultimately, this is just a job, and like any job, most of us find a point where we’re just coasting to collect a paycheck. I don’t think that’s a bad thing either. In fact, it’s pretty normal. Not everyone wants or desires to be incredible at their job. Most just want to pay the bills, so you get good enough to do just that. So, most devs are going to be mid.\n\nI also think, and this might just be my own issue, that because tech is constantly shifting and expectations for what you as a dev should know is always changing, it makes it hard to keep your skills sharp. By the time you get good at one thing, the industry has changed and you need to start picking up a new skill. Or the definition of what your job entails expands meaning that you always need to be learning more. I think this can cause a kind of burnout or a decrease in interest to try and be at your best. It becomes tiring to try and keep up, so, again, you just settle into being good enough to keep your job.\n\nIt’s really just the nature of work itself, or at least how we currently do work, that causes a settling of mediocrity in almost every field.

The devs with the most public presence often *are* exceptionally passionate. You occasionally see underskilled devs who bubble up, but often either not for good reasons or not for very long as their voices don't tend to add value to the broader dialogue in which they're participating.\n\nYou see this in other industries as well. Academia has its own version of this. Arts and entertainment have their own version of this. The medical field has its own version of this, and so on.\n\n> there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nDespite my remarks above, I'd still hesitate to make this extrapolation - it's akin to mistaking the mean for the median. I've worked and liaised with various orgs in various verticals. My observation has been that the talent distribution across an org typically seems to be at least approximately normal/bell-curved, with the majority of that org's devs in their own mid-level range (regardless of title or designation), but the bounds of that curve can vary significantly between orgs. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels could be senior or even principal engineers if they just went elsewhere. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels were essentially budding juniors who picked up enough to teach even newer juniors (but budding nonetheless, no slight intended).\n\nCommunication skill tends to vary along the same axis, but \"poor\" communication skill can mean different things when dealing with software engineers. Do they have a generally poor grasp of language itself (i.e., do they write with poor punctuation, spelling, broken SMS-style syntax)? If not, do they have the insight to translate literal code decisions to technical requirements? If so, do they have the insight to translate technical requirements to business requirements? If so, can they articulate those requirements in precision language that enables genuinely compelling dialogue with stakeholders?\n\nMy point being, tailor your expectations not to the market at large, but to the context into which you're sunk. Most of the engineers in that context are going to reflect its average, which may or may not be an objectively low bar to meet.",

So, they can solve most problems with \"good enough\" solutions. The hardest problems are still beyond them and they are only sometimes capable of innovating new ideas and thinking through them thoroughly. \n\nAbout 10% are capable. They can move into any field and figure out how to be productive. They actively read and educate themselves, so they know lots about things even if they've never directly experienced them. They can solve just about any problem, but not always optimally. The only exception might be highly scientific problems that require deep training with specific knowledge. They can lead, they can mentor, they can guard dog code bases, projects, business problems. These are your team leads. \n\nAbout 5% are savants. They dream up solutions others cannot. They are truly stimulated by hard problems. They have very high standards. They are constantly educating themselves even as a hobby. They have side projects to play with new tech they've discovered. Their friends and them mostly talk about tech and science. They can do things like imagine a new container orchestration mechanism with a custom kernel designed to achieve specific guarantees. They talk about designing hardware systems with variable baud rates for some arcane reason. They know what the downstream effects of storing principals in a token vs a database and what the trade offs are.

I’ve been thinking about something for a while and I’d like your opinion on it.\n\nI had a leader a few years back that used to say that he liked the lazy developers, because they’re the ones that come up with simpler solutions, and I completely agree, I’ve always felt like I was a lazy dev.\n\nHowever, with the ai usage increasing, complex code is easier to write. I know that everybody has talked about this already and that’s not my point.\n\nMy point is, since we’re not the ones actually doing the dirty work, it gets much easier to create more microservices than you have users, or adding 10 layers of abstraction to anything.\n\nI think that, for me, at least, I have to be careful not to become that astronaut architect, designing that “perfect” white marble tower",

And there have been a great many different measurements over the years.  Lines of code written.  Tasks completed.  Velocity points completed versus those points carried over.  Transactions per second or applications shipped or errors produced or bugs fixed or whatever the OKR of the quarter is focused upon.  We can focus on and increase any metric you want, and then still argue about if that made us more productive or not.",

          "text": "The problem with complexity, as I see it, is that we focus it on the code alone in a vacuum.\n\nLet's start first with what I claim is true: \n\n* Developers will solve problems as complex as they can and no more. If a problem seems too complex/hard to solve developers will make software that over simplifies or scopes to a simpler subset of the problem. \n* Developers will create solutions as complicated as they can handle. If a problem is easy they'll take on extra tech debt, over engineer it, or use ridiculous platform tools (e.g. electron) to make it.\n   * Note that most of these solutions make it easier to develop, or at least the developer will think that's the case. Such as using a myriad of npm deps for every trivial thing. \n* We can decrease apparent complexity with tools/frameworks/tests/etc which handle and solve that complexity for us (it converts the complex problem to a simpler one, even if it is harder!). We should note this isn't guaranteed to decrease dev time, and may even increase it, but the perception is generally of it making things faster. LLMs are a tool that reduce a lot of the complexity in making ambiguous specs into code, though it needs the other to be clear and has other limitations. \n* We can increase complexity by accruing tech debt, making dogmatic decisions (e.g. I want to make a very fast grep tool using only pure functional code, or I'll rewrite my blog host entirely in Rust), increasing the scope of the task, tackling more ambiguity directly (ie started l software that can do everything), it reframing the problem. \n* Complexity compounds. If I take modules foo and bar and use them together, the solution is going to be far more complex that either module alone. \n \nFrom this we can reach some interesting conclusions. Fire example: as we add more modules/features to our software, all the previous code needs to become simpler so that our software stays at the right limit of complexity. You can't do this preventively because we need the same level of complexity, so you'll end up with an el over-engineered solution that doesn't solve the problem that comes up. Similarly if you can't reduce the complexity of existing software it'll be impossible to add new features/modules as the complexity will grow to large and old features will have to be dropped. \n\nSimilarly it's easy for complexity to get out of hand. Because the complexity LLMs are hiding is the complexity of managing complexity. You still have to do it, but it's easy to be blindsided if you don't understand how to best use the tool. LLMs are this tool that seems like it could do anything, but many times there's a better tool already.\n\nNow this seems to keep us doomed, because any progress we do to improve our software will simply result in us becoming lazier (the wrong way) until the problem gets as hard, it even harder than before.\n\nSo what to do? Do we just force ourselves to code with old limitations? (Keep RAM usage to 10MB max, and binary system under 2MB?) I mean in some contexts that can totally work, but what about when we want to explore and be creative? Those limitations are against, but once we're done we can't just rewrite. I guess that's another solution, restart again, lose all progress and hope you get somewhere interesting, but even with hindsight it almost never works. Another solution is to go as fast as possible and manage tech debt with speed as the target, and that works well enough (though paradoxically it generally ends up being but the fastest possible, but it is consistently fast). But this is an issue with LLMs because it becomes really hard to manage and track tech debt if you misuse LLMs, and not only so we but know a lot about how to best use them, but it's very easy to misuse them and many times they push you towards the misuse, instead of solving and fixing things effectively. Thing is that the focus on speed misguides us on how to use LLMs and it easily leads to excessive complexity which means the program will start to crash and have issues until we drop features, abilities or slow down, none of what we want to do. \n\nSo this leads me to my final alternative. I reframe the problem as one of having to consider the many contexts in which the code exists. And this includes other developers. So when I write code I think of all the different reasons a programmer would interact with it, also ask the different things they may choose to do, and not only that I think of the different ways a programmer can think: what if they're more junior? What if they're not as familiar with the paradigm I use? What if their area of expertise is different (and once in but even familiar with), what if the strategy I used to approach the problem is one that they don't like? What if they're neurodivergent? What if they're an SRE, or a UX engineer who has to deal with my code? What if they're someone who knows the language conventions from 10 years in the future but not the ones now (that would be seen as bad habits by then)? And then I do the same for the clients.\n\nThe complexity of dealing with different human minds very quickly becomes overwhelming and it forces me to make the simplest, most straightforward code possible, because that's the limit of complexity at that point. It gets messy, because other coders will not use that strategy and will not understand the reason for the simplicity, making the code complex again either way, but the beauty of this is that I force myself to account for that too.\n\nAnd that has been leading more on how I use LLMs. I find that they are really good at parroting how other people would look at my code. I just need the stimulation of another viewpoint to help me see what I normally don't think like. And it works, a few passes on documentation, tests that consider edge cases I haven't, guidance on how to make the code guide the reader towards understanding better. I get to be lazier on the chores that take time, which lets me move faster, but still keeping my code simple enough.",

I admit the analogy breaks down a bit.  I still create sloppy Excel “programs” now and then.  Sometimes someone's spreadsheet solutions stick around far longer than they should.\n\nWith all the debate around vibe coding, I’m starting to think EVERYONE is right, but only in context. The arguments talk past each other because we don’t have precise language for why each position makes sense in different situations. The software contexts differ in ways we rarely interrogate deeply.\n\nWhat we actually need is a clearer distinction between:\na messy, one-off solution (yesterday’s Excel sheet), and\na core, durable business capability.\n\nHistorically, we handled this vaguely by saying:\n“Just use Excel”\n“Write a macro”\n“Throw together a one-off script”\nNow that role is increasingly filled by AI-generated, semi-disposable code. The definition of disposable has expanded. \n\nAnd just like one off scripts and proof of concept code that shouldn't, that code will inevitably leak into systems that were meant to be clean, stable, and engineered.\n\nSo the real question isn’t whether vibe code belongs—it’s when it’s acceptable to plan for it, and how to with the trade-offs. \n\nWhen is it reasonable for the business to intentionally rely on an Excel-level (or vibe-coded) solution? What differentiates:\n“Use Excel, then import the data” from “This no longer fits in Excel”?\n\nThose boundaries used to be fuzzy even with spreadsheets and macros. They’re fuzzier now with AI-generated scripts (slop) that feel oddly powerful but remain fragile and disposable. \n\nI shake my head at a critical business process running on Excel… while admitting it’s been “working” for years.\n\nOne critical thing though: a challenging problem with Excel was macros and security... and now vibe code.",

I spent years as a lead and a significant portion of my time was: reminding people to update tickets, following up on blockers, nudging PRs, and piecing together release status from 5 different conversations.\n\nJIRA tell you the state of things but don't actually close the loop on accountability. Most of the real coordination still happens offline and disappears into Slack.\n\nIs this just how it is? How do you all handle it? Has anything actually made this better? Please help. Tired of doing just status syncs :(\n\n*Edit: Thank you all for the thoughtful responses - both those who feel this pain deeply and those who've found ways to solve it through culture and leadership. Both perspectives are genuinely helpful. For those still struggling with this, I'm building a tool to address it and looking for early testers. DM me if interested*",

Company leadership on the other hand doesn't care about it. They need to solve business problems and deliver features/revenue. A manager/lead job is to quite literally be a bridge in between. You have to figure out how to motivate some of the smartest people you know to solve the problem the company cares about.\n\n\nWhat you're describing is pretty much a byproduct of this friction. It shows up differently in different companies. Some have strong processes, others have strong engineering culture. Sometimes your leadership can let some red tape slide, other times they won't. Sometimes the team you lead cares about the processes other times they're least bothered. Your job is the coach the team and manage up so these two sides of the coin gel together to produce results.",

If you close one as \"I'm not doing this,\" at most places, at least some of the time, someone will come to you and tell you to open it back up and pretend you're going to do it. If you explain that you're not going to do it, they're fine with this, they just want the appearance that it's \"being worked on.\" So soon you accumulate a bunch of tickets that don't reflect reality. Or else you try to reassign work that doesn't belong to you, and it comes back along with someone telling you that it's politically sensitive and you just need to keep it in your queue for now.\n\nNow multiply this across every tool in the org that a SWE deals with on a daily basis. You end up with a bunch of noise, and since you can't rely on the tools to tell you what actually needs doing vs. what merely needs to be maintained as the appearance of work that will be done, you start to ignore updating the real work because it's too much effort to separate it from the fake work.\n\nThe place I worked where this was not allowed, it was very transparent what everyone was doing at all times. You could just look at the issue tracker and see someone's actual work queue with the prioritizations. We didn't bother making predictions more than a week or two out because the org had found that the error bars were so large on those plans that it wasn't worth wasting time on, so we just put things in order instead.\n\nAlso, everything was tracked in the issue tracker. If you're working on something, then it's documented in a ticket, even if it's not code-related. Status reports pretty much went away because your status was always available for anyone that wanted to look. Doing a weekly sync was simply pulling up everyone's queue to see what their next couple of weeks looked like, and no one had to do any prep for it except scan their tickets to make sure everything was up to date.",

They believe they are just getting people to be accountable to their commitments, but in reality, they are the link between individual contributors and the decision makers. A manager's nudges communicate an implicit priority order of work, and if that conflicts with the explicit system, ICs get stressed.",

Everyone posts blockers and progress in a channel by 10am. If someone does not post, the team notices before I do. Peer accountability is way more effective than manager reminders.\n\n2. PRs got a 24-hour SLA. Not enforced by me, enforced by the team agreement. If a PR sat for more than a day without review, it became the top priority for the next available person. We tracked it for two weeks and review times dropped by 60%.\n\n3. I stopped being the router for information. If two engineers needed to coordinate, I would connect them directly instead of relaying messages. Took about a month for people to default to talking to each other first.\n\nThe underlying issue is usually that the team treats coordination as the manager's job instead of everyone's job.

It's not really my experience that my co-workers on the IC side need reminders to get things done, but we also probably follow a different model of assigning work.",

They are often repetitive, superficial, exaggerated, baseless etc. We combat it by removing such posts under Rule #9, which is fine\n\nHowever, it's still very easy to find multiple threads repeating the exact same discussion. One common suggestion is to limit LLM related posts to a megathread. In my opinion megathreads rarely work outside of big events. Doing so would practically mean no more LLM discussion allowed\n\nI do believe LLM discussion is, at the very least, a reality. It's not wise to be a luddite about it. There's real engineering in this field, there are real challenges to experienceddevs and therefore completely banning it isn't an option \n\nTLDR: What you would think if LLM related posts were only allowed on some days? Let's say Tuesday and Thursday. This simultaneously helps with the spam, but also doesn't completely kill the discussion like a megathread",

This tends to be fairly technology agnostic, and a lot of that advice would have been applicable 20 years ago, and will hopefully still be 20 years from now.\n\nCertainly LLMs disrupt how we interact with other colleagues and process changes so it can't just be ignored, but I'd really love to keep it in the super abstract.\n\nWith that said, there are a lot of the same conversations being had on repeat. I for one wouldn't mind limiting the number of posts (if it's easiest to have days of the week, then sure). I do think there is a difference between \"This is how I use it, and wow!\" vs \"I have a junior that relies on AI and I'm concerned in their ability to grow as a developer\".",

Instead, it's a daily \"I have a unique take about why you're wrong about LLMs\" post that just repeats the same points the last one of these made and is probably itself written by an LLM. \n\n\nI'd actually be interested in, say, somebody with 20 years of experience doing an in-depth comparison of the strength of different models, or something like that.

And just like now, these posts will inevitably garner lots of attention and discussion, not because the tech is cool or whatever, but because just the topic of ai is incredibly polarizing - topics that are naturally polarizing will always drive huge discussions regardless of the productivity of the discussion. But now because of the new rule you're allowed to close the post freely, pissing off more people because of whatever bias they perceive you for having: \"mods killed the discussion because they're ai lovers/haters\" post will show up more and more. \n\nI hate to give you this feedback without offering suggestions, but like everyone else, I am unsure the best path forward. You could consider the new LLM day rule, while also turning on mod approval on new posts - that way you can snuff them out early. This would require a lot more mod support though (I'm happy to help if I can), but the quality of the content would skyrocket. \n\nRegardless, good luck with whatever decision you make.",

In other words, in their position, I'd do the same thing, because it's rationale.\n\nSecond, it seems like narrative really bothers you, but in many organizations, doing stuff like pay lip service is the silent power best left unsaid. For companies, the signal is alignment with the greater goals, and that's what all this language and other stuff is designed to do.\n\nSo do you believe senior leadership are idiots? Because they are playing a different game than you, with different values than your own, and the results are going to mean compromising your technical values. I'd say: \"that's okay, just accept it and play the game yourself\", but that's my solution. You can do whatever you want, but at least spend the time to understand something before you criticize!",

Rotten, shit companies are full of people with attitudes like yours. Secretly resenting their job and hating it day to day and their coworkers.\n\nGo find somewhere that appreciates you.",

This relies on users' good-will, but we believe it will help with the flood of threads. Naturally, repeatedly trying to avoid this system by mislabeling a thread will result in a suspension.\n2. We'll no longer remove threads that are two or more days old. This subreddit severely lacks in moderators and it's simply impractical to keep a look out all the time. Regardless, we try to maintain a higher quality of discussion, which involves removing threads that break the rules. However, users are understandably upset when a thread is removed after many discussions have already taken place.\n\nWe're open to feedback on both counts and we're recruiting moderators. As usual, we'll see how it goes.\n\nApply here [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/application/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/application/).\n\n# Rule #10\n\n    No intentional and recurrent mislabeling of new posts. Every new post requires a flag. Intentionally mislabeling a post to avoid moderation will result in a suspension.\n\nThis rule is added simply to solidify point #1.",

      "text": "I scroll through here and it's absolutely not lost on me how shitty the job market is, how ridiculous development work has become at a lot of places and the disillusionment it's all causing in people. I have worked at such places and gone through such disillusionment before. But I'm pleased to say I'm quite enjoying things at my current job. I'm not here to gloat. I just thought it might be nice to share something positive.\n\nWe are a pretty small scale-up that's working towards profitability. There's a lot to do and it gets a bit chaotic, but communication is generally no-nonsense and travels fast. It's a fast-paced work environment so it kind of has to be that way.\n\nI work in a platform team with just one other guy. We have two development teams and every one (except one or two) is friendly, talented and dependable. If I need something, I feel comfortable just reaching out to them directly.\n\nI don't feel people are obstructed from innovating and bringing new ideas to the table. For example, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement with the branching strategy that teams were using. It was kind of like a half-baked GitFlow. There was general agreement that it was painful to keep branches organised and it was slowing down our release cadence. So I organised a workshop on trunk-based development and it was a big success. There were lots of good questions, great conversations were had and proper action items were taken to migrate all of our branches to it.\n\nThere is no on-call and work-life balance is great. Everything just runs pretty smoothly in Kubernetes or on Lambda functions. Incidents have happened but they are few and far between. The boss has said that we just don't have enough people to have a fair on-call rotation, so we simply accept the risk that comes with that.\n\nRecently there's been gentle encouragement from both leads and some engineers themselves for people to be less remote. That doesn't necessarily mean being in the office more (some of our engineers work remotely in other countries), but it does mean talking to each other, putting heads together to solve problems, knowledge sharing and interactive sessions where needed. So far I feel we've been very good at keeping these concise without them descending into spiralling soul-crushing meetings. It's very satisfying and I see it creating a noticeable bond. I've observed that it's getting more common for us to finish our office day (usually Thursday) with drinks together. Even some of our more reserved devs seem more willing to come in and join in later for a drink and a nice chat.\n\nIt's not all rose-tinted. The company are very stingy about hiring people and will only do so if they absolutely have to. There have been numerous painful lay-offs in the last few years that have left a very bitter taste in people's mouths. The AI adoption is very real across the company and it's led to some horrible results on our website which have had to be scaled back. But the perfect place doesn't exist of course. And in regards to AI, there is definitely agreement from us in engineering that it needs to be used as a tool and we really have to be mindful of its potential misuse.\n\nThat's it! Hope it gives you some semblance of positivity in these trying times. If anyone else has some recent success stories, feel free to share.",

We've built *one* new feature in the past 2 years, with none in the pipeline. They're largely focused on rebuilding the old system instead of creating features that drive revenue.

Not that I'm convinced it's transformative so far, but I'm more concerned about management deciding it is and making changes based on that.\n\nI work at a consultancy and juggle anywhere from 3 to 20 projects at a time. The CEO likes to sell jobs with little pre planning, so deadlines are often short with extremely fuzzy guidelines. I have an entire new system integration due in a little over a month, but I still don't have the documentation or credentials to get started ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIt's a pretty shitty job though, so I'm considering looking anyway. Thankfully the pay isn't bad and the benefits are mid. Short list of more recent bullshit issues:\n\n* My vacation this year is contingent on the aforementioned project being done in time, despite not having any of the resources I need to complete it.\n\n* To have PTO approved, I need to provide a personal emergency contact and their phone number so they can be called if I'm unreachable, and the specific location of where I'm going.\n\n* We're considered on-call 24/7. If a client needs me to work at 8 pm on Friday and lets me know at 4 pm, I'm expected to do it without compensation. This includes PTO and holidays.\n\n* The majority of my co-workers are MAGA, so almost every stand up is political or conspiratorial after any major event.\n\n* I have to track every minute of work in an Excel sheet that gets sent to the CEO at the end of the month because he refuses to pay for time tracking software.\n\n* Code needs to be written how our CEO does (i.e, from the earlier 2000s), so he can work on it as well. He doesn't use an IDE or understand package managers if that helps you understand how bad it may be. Luckily, for a lot of projects I can get away with writing it in a more modern way.",

I like business travel and the food budget is pretty good, so I don't mind that so much. The late night remote stuff is usually about 8-12 days per year.\n\nNo required in-office days for us, but the nature of working with hardware means a lot of people need to physically be in the lab to do their work. I still work from home 1-2 days a week if I don't have anything that needs to be physically moved around.

This company is planning to hit $100mil in ARR this year. \n\nI don’t really understand the numbers of how that could possibly be the case for regular devs that have a small stake in the company to get paid out that much even if a qualifying event happens like an acquisition. \n\nCan anyone shed light on the calculations for determining this?",

Only once has my equity been worth more than $1m. almost always buyouts end up with primarily equity in whoever is acquiring you and almost always that is worth basically nothing.\n\nI can't complain. I am very well off. But even for people at the very top of the org chart for even big dollar acquisitions are often non events.\n\nAfter 28 years the people I know who have made big money all went to big tech and just moved up into director level roles. Money has never really been my goal (beyond what I need for a comfortable life) and startups have provided that along with a version of work I intensely enjoy. But it's not lost on me that I have mostly labored to make other people very wealthy.\n\nTo bring this back to OP: that CEO is full of shit. He has no idea what the worth of the thing will be. The far and away most likely outcome is the whole thing fails and is sold for parts in three years. The second most likely outcome (by a lot) is that it truly succeeds and the CEO gets paid along with the investors while everyone else is given equity in yet another company that almost for sure fails to return on its employee equity.\n\nEvery other outcome is usually bad.\n\nIt's why Ycombinator has increased its class size so much. They need stakes in hundreds of companies per year to find the ones that matter.",

Selling electrons.  Capital expenditure vs. revenue, cost of production of each unit vs. revenue for each sale.  Google/Yahoo did similar for the value of \"the internet\".\n\nSo modest investments from venture capital turned into huge revenues, which skyrocketed the valuations.  That let the janitor with 100 pre-any-splits shares of Apple/MS/etc. be really rich because of that.\n\nBut that just won't happen anymore, outside some completely new industry that nobody else sees coming.\n\nNot only are things like ideas and intellectual property easier to value, now (within several orders of magnitude, at least), but the investment class is careful to keep much more of the profit for themselves.\n\nBasically, unless you literally got a stake in the company *before* any sort of VC got involved, the stock options are almost certainly designed to leave your payout pretty modest.  If you're very, very early in the company (in the first 10 or 100 employees) and it does very, very well, then you might get a can-buy-a-house-in-Silicon-Valley chunk of change.\n\nStock options at a company with good management and a good idea can yield you a very nice, comfortable bonus.  It's not going to bump you up a social class.  Never take stock option in lieu of decent pay.",

          "text": "Never trust anyone that makes specific assertions about payouts for equity comp in a private company.\n\nThey are either financially incompetent or dishonest. Unless they are currently finalizing a deal to sell, they can't know. And even then, deals fall through all of the time, so it would STILL be reckless to assert a number even if they had the term sheet in front of them.\n\nThey do not know what company will buy them, what their own financials will be then, what the macro environment will be then, what multiples their kind of business will get at sale or how their business will be slotted into that range, how much leverage they will have in the negotiation, how much flexibility the buyer will have, how long in the future that will be and how much dilution there will have been by then from additional fundraising in funding environments that they can't predict. They can't know basically anything, really. \n\nThat said:\n\nThe math is that you are either paid in rsus (stock) or options (the right to buy stock at a specific price).\n\nThe company overall has a number of shares it is divided into overall, some valuation, and a number of shares you are given.\n\nIf you are given shares rather than options, the present value is the price of the company times the percentage of the company you own, aka your shares over total shares.\n\nIf you are given options their value is far more complicated (usually the exercise price is the current value when you're given them so naively they're worth $0 [convenient for taxes]), but assume they're worth somewhere between a quarter and a half of the share value above. That is roughly what a financial model would say. No normal financial model would say they are worth more than half a share. Anyone who tells you otherwise is incompetent or lying. That is a common lie, pretending options are worth 1:1 with shares. There are tax advantages, but they have massive downside risk that shares don't have because they are worth $0 if the company doesn't grow.\n\nThat is the present value of the equity, which is the only thing you can know at all, and even still that is not super real because you can't sell the shares. They are illiquid. Even in a sale there are liquidation preferences and people in front of you in line might eat before you can get fed.\n\nThat said, if you really believe in the specific team and their company, and you have a decent slice as calculated above, where they have a real chance at winning a big market, the future value can be extreme and worth betting on.\n\nGenerally though, someone asserting a particular exit value when communicating about comp is either not sophisticated enough to be that guy, or thinks their team is stupid, and in either case they probably won't be the winner.\n\nIn terms of future value, basically the future value of the business is a multiple of how much money the company holds plus how much money people believe it will make over time, with the strongest evidence being how much money it currently makes, and with a very strong preference to making money sooner. If you have a clear path to the company making a lot more money than it currently does, probably it will be worth more. Although, sometimes the market is wrong about predicting how much money a company will make in the future in both directions, or the market is just not buying. So even that's hard for a full time professional investor to model to turn it into predictions about share price in the future, even if they somehow knew how much money it will make.\n\nBut yeah, evaluate the equity at the last round value, or shift it up by the amount they've grown since they last raised, maybe some leeway if growth accelerated and product market fit really seems obvious now and wasn't before. Do not value it based on some absurd claim about a specific future value. The investors in the VC that bought in aren't dumb. They are better at valuing the business than you. And they shouldn't get a better price than employees. So what they pay is what you should consider yourself to be paying, as in that's the value of that comp.\n\nSource: I have gone through acquisition from joining a small startup and have fought for, defined, and then educated people about the employee equity program at a decently large company.",

Did he mention that too? :) Company might do not well in the future, gets forced to sell and only ones with the special class stock might get a payout (founders, investors) and none for employees.\n\nCalculation is simple: you get stock options. ISO likely but NSO too. Companies does external valuation called 409A and sets the FMV (fair market value). It's \"external\" because company isn't public yet. Initial FMV is the strike price (the price you pay to buy the stock). Once a company goes IPO, you can sell your options after 6 month. Your gain is sell price - strike price.\n\nRemember that it's all \"high risk, high gain\".\n\nLet's just say company does make $100M ARR, and, for the sake of simplicity, the valuation is 10x of that so $1B. Also lets assume you join at $1B valuation and your grant is stock option that's worth $100k.\n\nIn order for that $100k to go $1M, you need company to grow 11x. 100k\\*11 (appreciated) - 100k (strike price) = 1M.\n\nWould it trivial for $1B company to grow $11B in N years? Depends. I'd say it's pretty hard.\n\nI've been at many failed startups and their story is about the same. \"We are valuated at D dollars, ARR growing mega fast, our customers are fortune 500s, picked as top K Deloitte ABC, etc, etc\". If I had a secret formula that could tell which ones will succeed and which won't, I'd be an angel investor making a fortune :)\n\nIt's very likely you won't exit with $1-10M. Startups are a lot more fun than FAANG though, but with a lot less pay.",

          "text": "The math is pretty simple to value a given amount of equity. Take the share price, and multiply it by the number of shares you have (minus the strike price if they’re ISOs rather than RSUs).\n\nThe question is “what is the value of a share.” If the company is actually close to an IPO or an acquisition, they will have a 409a valuation calculated by a bank. This represents what they are *actually worth,* given their cash and capital assets, revenue, and intellectual property value. It’s still made up, but it’s at least made up based on standard accounting practices. ISOs generally have to be issued with a strike price near the 409a valuation (it’s the whole reason it was invented after the Enron debacle).\n\nThey will also have a “fare market value.” This is what investors paid at their last fund raising round. The further away the startup is from IPO’ing or being acquired, the further away this number will be from the 409a. This is usually the number that recruiters will use to make claims on what the value of equity is, and it’s usually the number that equity grants themselves are valued against: a company will give you, for example, a $1.2mil grant, and this will be converted into a number of shares by dividing that value by the FMV on a given date.\n\nOnce a company is public, the stock price is the FMV is the 409a, so all these same calculations are just done off the public stock price.\n\nBut as for the feasibility of the claim: a $1mil payout would require you to own 1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $100mil, or 0.1% of a company that sells/IPOs for $1bil. 1% of a company may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually quite a large ownership stake, so I would not expect a company with more than 10-15 employees to be giving grants that large. Even founding engineers generally only get in the 2-3% range if their VCs are generous with the cap table.\n\nBasically, for this person’s statement to be true, it would probably mean they’re expecting an acquisition/IPO in the $10bil+ range. That’s a lot of money. You would know if this company actually has a chance to do that.\n\nBut it can never hurt to ask how they came to that valuation. \n",

The things that complicate it are dilution and stock preferences. I'm happy to explain the mechanics of both if you're interested (TLDR: dilution means that your percentage decreases every time they raise VC funding, preference means that at sale time investors can choose to take their money back and squeeze everyone else out), but it almost certainly doesn't really change how you should think about equity. \n\nIf you're early enough to have a significant number of shares, you don't have enough information to predict how all of the fundraising and sale details will shake out. If you're late enough to have useful information about all of that, you won't get enough shares to be worth anything. I just mentally ballpark startup equity as having an expected value around $10K and move on. Maybe it will go out of business and be worth nothing, maybe it will exit for way higher and pleasantly surprise me, I have no idea.

You need to know the number of options/shares in the pool. \n\nIt’s hard to get that number out of some companies, and it obviously grows with every round of funding. \n\nOn average say there is 100 million options (or maybe 150 million) in the pool by the time the company IPOs. \n\n$100m is the magic number companies use to IPO at, early 2010s it was $50m ARR. Now, $200m ARR? Wallstreet moves the goal posts. \n\n$100m revenue / number shares at IPO gives the price per share simply put. \n\nThen you have the multiplier that recurring revenue SaaS companies earn because their revenue can be predicted forward some years. \n\nIt use to see crazy multiples, 35x 50x revenue. These days I hear it’s mostly 6-8x revenue. \n\nSo if your company is making $100m revenue a year, times the 6x multiplier, divided by number options in the pool, you get the rough share price at IPO. Then it goes crazy up or down from there. \n\nMost companies will aim to IPO at $20 a share, no idea why I have just always heard it’s a magic number for NASDAQ IPOs. \n\nSo you can work out if you will have share splits/reverse splits and what your equity is possibly going to be if at $20 a share at IPO the company needs to reduce the number in the pool to make “$100m ARR * multiplier / pool size = $20” revenue math to work out. \n\n\nI wrote this pretty quickly but if anything doesn’t make sense ask follow ups. \n\nIf anyone has anything to add I got wrong let me know, at the end of the day I am much more an engineer than I am a business guy.",

The stock options vest at the end of this year, and I'll be granted close to 20k options, with an exercise price of about $8 per option.

When they do go public, I have to pray that the stock price is a decent amount higher than $8 per share in order to actually make any money from the stock options. There hasn't been any talk of going public lately, but I'm sure that they'll do an IPO sooner or later.\n\nSo until the company goes public, my payout from the sale of the company was $25k cash and a job that pays $140k salary (fully remote with good benefits and PTO).",

Looking at it another way - if someone introduced a high availability architecture with scalability from the get go and it scales incorrectly with the problems of today then not only is the program bad and costly when load isn’t there, it may actively make fixing things worse.\n\nIn the end, we’re all making decisions without full context - no one has a crystal ball that tells them if a project will succeed and hindsight is easy because it means we’re able to make decisions with more context.\n\nThe question may be “what is the role of the senior+ engineer outside of immediate firefighting?”\n\nI think the answers are:\n\n* Put tools in place (tests, CI, observability, reviews, etc.) to ensure that the fix is applied consistently and has the same effects over time.\n* Convince the culture to build things with more reliability - get things hooked up to observability and get the right notifications firing\n\nBasically - now that the fire has been put out or at least put into a manageable state, how do we implement processes technical or otherwise to stop firefighting?\n\nNot every manager or culture will be receptive to approaching things like this but in those cases it’s best to vote with your feet. There are good engineering cultures in the world and it’s possible the one you’re in won’t let you make the necessary changes to get out of firefighting due to any number of reasons - The software isn’t perceived to be critical to the success of the business, leadership doesn’t value engineering, the rate of business to keep the company alive requires a pace of development that requires more/better people and the investment budget isn’t there, etc.",

The team is refusing to be a team by making one person the backstop for every architectural shortcut.\n\nThe real question isn't \"how do I say no,\" it's \"what am I getting for saying yes.\" Because right now the answer is: more yes. If the fixing led somewhere—a principal title, an architecture role, a mandate to actually prevent this stuff—that's a different calculation. If it's just an infinite loop of fires, you're not building a career, you're maintaining someone else's.\n\nStart making the cost visible.

You (probably) need to implement \"undo\" for that action, support multiple file formats for input and output, program checks for something every 2 weeks? oh, add an option that customizes that at settings/preferences...and omg settings are strangely elusive to implement. Dark theme, admin-privileges, draggable UI panes, auto-updates, localization, imperial vs metric system presentation options. There seems to be no end to how thorough a piece of software can get. \n\nI'm my own boss, btw, so, I don't have any of that middle management breathing down my neck problem, for better and for worse. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to voice my appreciation for this craft.

All day I'm just either sitting in meetings, managing marketing campaigns, doing KPI's and OKR's and roadmaps or answering emails.

This is causing me a serious identity crisis as I feel like any skill I had at anything is constantly just withering away due to lack of use. 1 more year of this job and I'll be totally irrelevant.\n\nNow, the good part is that I can pretty much self-define what the role is and what I do. I've been trying to leverage it into an AI/service design job, but... it seems like any promotions from here (like CPO/CTO) are even more filled with this crappy manager stuff.\n\nDamn, do I miss coding.

Even now I'm struggling with boredom as the application I'm working with is just so simple, and the biggest problems there are just in communication and the customer being difficult. Even now the biggest challenge is putting this app in the cloud to run on one VM, with one database, and somehow I'm constantly having to wait because I don't have permission to set up access to resources, or I have to figure out why someone thought it was a good idea to put three applications inside one VM..

The identity crisis is real: I genuinely thought I was broken for hating what everyone told me was \"success.\" You're not broken, you just optimized for the wrong metric.",

      "text": "I don't usually talk about this but I've been writing about process and organizational dysfunction lately and people keep asking what actually happened to me so here it is.\n\nAbout five years ago I was working as an IT architect at a bank. Except I didn't really get \"hired\" in the normal sense. I was part of a corporate transition from Brazil, my previous project got killed and because I was already in the US on a work visa they absorbed me into the bank's team. And I mean absorbed, not hired. Everyone knew the difference. The guy running the org never wanted us there, we were basically imposed on him through a decision made three levels above.\n\nThe tech was a mess. Classic ASP, manual IIS deployments, someone remoting into a box at midnight and praying. Everything ran on tribal knowledge from people who'd been doing it that way for a decade and didn't want to change. There was this one senior dev, longest tenured guy on the team, and every single thing I proposed got the same answer: \"that won't work here.\" Not because he had a counterproposal, just because changing anything meant admitting the current way wasn't great and that wasn't something people wanted to deal with.\n\nI ended up shipping three major projects. Real-time payments integration because the bank was falling behind every competitor. Live account balances in the mobile app so customers didn't have to wait hours for batch processing to catch up. And the big one, I rebuilt the entire deployment infrastructure from manual IIS to K8S with actual CI/CD pipelines. All three went to production, all three still running as far as I know.\n\nSo the politics. The infra project was under this manager who was genuinely awful, narcissistic and territorial, the type who sees your competence as a threat to them personally. Midway through I got pulled to another team to do the payments and real-time stuff which honestly felt like being rescued. Different manager, could actually breathe for once.\n\nThen that manager got fired and I got sent right back to the original guy.\n\nHe didn't blow up or do anything obvious. He just started slowly erasing me. First I'm not on the architecture review invite anymore. Then someone else is presenting designs I made. Then my responsibilities get redistributed and nobody even sends an email about it. If you've never experienced this it sounds paranoid but if you have you know exactly what I'm talking about. \"You're still on the team\" yeah I was still on the team, I just wasn't on anything.\n\nThey called me into a room eventually. Contract ending, standard language, very professional and here's the part that most people in this industry will never have to think about: I was on an L1 visa. That meant I had 60 days to leave the country. Not 60 days to find a new job, 60 days to leave the country where my wife and I had been building a life.\n\nI drove home with the termination letter in a dark blue envelope. My wife saw it when I walked through the door and she didn't even ask, she just hugged me. Her green card process was already advanced enough that we didn't have to actually leave but for about a week I genuinely didn't know if the timing was going to work out.\n\nThe thing that messes with me more than the firing itself is that this wasn't even the first time. I've been the technical firefighter at multiple companies now. I walk in, the systems are broken, I fix what nobody else can or wants to fix, and then once the fire is out I somehow end up being the one who's vulnerable. Not because the work was bad but because I never build any political protection around the work. I just ship and assume shipping is enough.\n\nIt's not. 25 years in and I'm still learning this apparently.\n\nOrganizations love the firefighter when the building is burning. They don't love him after because he's walking around knowing where all the structural damage is and that makes people uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not posting this for sympathy. I'm posting it because I think this pattern is way more common than anyone talks about, especially among the more technical people who just want to build things and don't really care about office politics until office politics cares about them.   \n  \nCurious if others have been through something similar and what if anything you did differently.",

I never did that because it felt like politics and I thought the work should speak for itself.\n\nCurious from your side as a director, when you're in those rooms where decisions get made about people, what actually makes you go to bat for someone on your team?

If you’re shipping transformative projects, other people need to know so the narcissist can’t twist it all around. There are good organizations out there. Gotta re-roll man.\n\njoin us: /r/ManagedByNarcissists\n\nalso wow classic ASP! been a minute.",

Regional servers, CDN, geocache, round trip analysis, etc.\n\nBut there is a different bucket of answers that don't really answer the question but are valid in other ways.\n\n\"Do we have / want to have users in Africa?\"\n\n\"Is there enough traffic in Africa for a geocache solution to even work?\"\n\n\"Africa is a really big place... how is this 700ms figure being calculated? Equally weighted across all nations would skew this significantly if 99% of users are just in South Africa for example\"\n\nHow would you feel if a senior engineer / staff engineer / EM answered in this way? Rather than jumping straight to technical solutions.\n\nE: re all the people talking about \"do we want users in Africa?\" my point is, not all businesses need to serve all regions. A regional newspaper, a cable company that only services some states, or a boot strapped B2B company should probably not spend any money investing in Africa. It just doesn't have a good ROI.

Always make sure to check in with the interviewer that you’re going in the right direction for what they’re looking for in an answer\n\nI’m always impressed when people add on layers to their answer that goes outside of tech as it demonstrates ability outside of pure tech horsepower.

          "text": "This, to me, is one of the most frustrating parts of interviewing at modern tech companies.  The questions you're asking are the real life correct questions to ask.  They are also the types of questions most engineers don't think to ask until they hit staff level or higher, but -havent- gone up the management ladder yet (which atrophies this a bit, i speak from experience).\n\nWhat this all means, is delending on your interviewer, these questions are very likely correct, but -above- the interviewing person's skill level to see the value of.\n\nIf I'm being asked this interview question by a senior dev, theres a huge chance they would assume a response like \"how is this 700ms being calculated\" as a delay tactic because you don't know a good answer.  Because if they were the type of person to realize that africa is too big of a place to fix with \"add more cdns\" and that a single 700ms latency doesn't make sense for an entire continent, then they wouldn't still be a senior engineer.  \n\nThat said, part of being a staff eng is knowing how to talk to people with kess experience than you.  So you could, and probably should say, something like \"well there are a lot of ways to fix a latency issue like this.  We would probably investigate geocaching and regional cdns for example.  I could list some strategies like these if you're talking about fixing geographic katency im the general sense.  But if you're asking specifically about the example you've given, then I'd want to dive in a but deeper, because a 700ms latency fir the entire continent of africa seems a little suspect.  Do you know what the geographical distribution that elad to that number is?\"\n\nI would think in most situations that would impress the senior and be the right answer.  If the senior is open minded to it it would work.\n\nBut if you do this to every question, then they are never going to get to the point of testing your technical chops either.\n\nWhere this gets really bad, though, is when you get senior engineers asking leetcode style questions, which is what a lot of them do nowadays.  The hardest part i have with leetcode is how, if you actually think about the question for a few minutes, many (most?) of the questions completely fall apart with the type of analysis you're talking about.\n\nThe last time i opened a leetcode study book, which was admittedly a decade ago, I couldn't get passed the first question.  Because while it was obvious the question was looking for some sort of fancy breadth first search algorithm, i knew the actual domain the question was supposed to be about, and realized that 95% of the traffic was going to come from one point, meaning that any generic search algorithm would be irl wrong.  But good luck explaining that to someone reciting from a leetcode question sheet.\n\nSo i guess the answer is, know your audience, i suppose.  And chalk this up as yet another reason why modern tech interviewing is broken.  You need to show your ability to ask these questions because this is what separates you from younger devs, but chances are, you are soeaking to a younger dev and have to speak their language as well.",

Good interviewers are looking for people who challenge assumptions and ask clarifying questions before throwing solutions at poorly defined problems. The \"outside the box\" answers you listed aren't outside the box at all - they're the fundamentals of engineering leadership. Anyone can regurgitate CDN and regional servers, but understanding business context, validating the problem scope, and questioning data quality shows you've been burned by jumping to solutions too quickly in the past. That said, you do need to eventually provide technical solutions after establishing context, so the sweet spot is asking 2-3 clarifying questions that expose your thought process, then walking through potential solutions based on different scenarios.\n\nThe catch is that not all interviewers are good at their jobs, and some will mark you down for not immediately diving into technical details because they're reading from a rubric. You can usually gauge this in the first few minutes - if they seem annoyed by your questions or try to rush you past them, pivot faster to the technical stuff. If they engage with your questions and seem interested in the discussion, you've found someone who gets it. I'm on the team that built [AI copilot for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and from what job seekers tell me, practicing this balance of strategic questioning before technical deep-dives is what helped them land senior roles.",

I'd still ask for a technical solution but you'd get bonus points for this.\n\nAssuming this is technical interview - if you come up with a some outside of the box technical solution (even if it's a stretch) I'd definitely be interested in exploring it further instead of the standard answers. E.g. if you proposed to create a starlink-like constellation I'd definitely start asking about this instead of falling back to the regular interview questions.",

In real life I've seen teams spin up expensive infra in regions where we had like 50 users total because nobody asked the \"do we actually need this\" question first. That said, in an interview setting I'd probably lead with the clarifying questions but still sketch out the technical solution after, just so the interviewer knows you can do both.

Before you downvote just know I'm also sick of AI posts about everything, but I'm really interested in hearing other experienced devs perspective on this.\n\nI just don't see engineers being completely replaced actually happening (other than maybe the bottom 15%-20%), I have 11 years of experience working as a data engineer across most verticals like DOD, finance, logistics, media companies, etc.. I keep seeing nonstop doom and gloom about how software engineering is over, but there's so much more to engineering than just coding. Like architecture, networking, security, having an awareness of all of those systems, awareness of every single public interface of every single application that runs your business, preserving all of the business logic that has kept companies afloat for 30 years etc. Giving AI full superuser access to all of those things seems like a really easy way to fuck up and bankrupt your company overnight when it hallucinates something someone from the LOB wants and it goes wrong. I see engineers shifting jobs into using prompting to help accelerate coding, but there's still a fundamental understanding that's needed of all of those systems and how to reason about technology as a whole.\n\nAnd not only that, but understanding how to translate what executives think they want vs what they actually need. I'll give you an example, I spent 6 weeks doing a discovery and framing for a branch of the DOD. We spoke with very high up folks in this branch and they were very pie in the sky about this issue they've having and how it hinders the capabilities of the warfighter etc etc. We spent 6 WEEKS literally just trying to figure out what their actual problem was, and turns out that folks were emailing spreadsheets back and forth around certain resource allocation and people would send what they think the most current one was when it wasn't actually the case. So when resources were needed they thought they were available when they really weren't.\n\nIt took 6 fucking weeks of user interviews, whiteboarding, going to bases, etc just to figure out they need a CRUD app to manage what they were doing in spreadsheets. And the line of business who thought their problems were much grander had no fucking clue and the problem went away overnight. Imagine if these people had access to a LLM to fix their problems, god knows what they'd end up with.\n\nPoint being is that coding is a small part of the job (or perhaps will be a small part of everyones job). I'm curious if others agree/disagree, I think a lot of what I'm seeing online is juniors/new grads death spiraling in fear from all of the headlines they're constantly reading.\n\nWould love to hear others thoughts",

Real understanding comes from friction and obviously the absolute best way to experience that friction is \"on the job training\", trying to fix things when they break or go wrong.\n\nIf that's not an option, you can still learn these skills from others who have been through it. And there are ways to emulate the experience by also building things yourself, without any kind of assistance at all.\n\nThere are professions where you can't wait to gain experience before you brush up on critical skills (think: fireman or air traffic controller). You need to do trainings and simulations to emulate scenarios and build those skills ahead of time. While I understand being a programmer isn't quite in the same classification, you can still be in charge of very important systems. \n\nThat's why I'm putting together that [course](https://confident-coding.com/), really.

AI that isn't sentient, with real world experience.. just LLM prediction engines is never going to say \"I have an idea.. if we build this.. this way.. with these things.. we'll help the world\". That is something AI wont replace until we have sentient AI that can dissect problems in the world (such as how we use the worse \"chemical\" crap for power.. and how to find better ways like fusion, thermal induction, etc). Until then.. you're going to need for the next 10, 15+ years those of us that are still capable, have learned a lot.. and can direct/review/etc the AI LLMs as they get better. The next generation of AI (neural + llm + other stuff that we dont know about yet) will likely make LLMs look like child toys.. and advance the capabilities so much further that anyone will soon be able to say \"I have an idea.. \" and code it up start to finish. I think that is 10+ years out though.. but the shit is moving so fast who knows.\n\n",

Rather than compiling machine code you're now compiling natural language. We've seen so far, that despite levels of abstraction added to software, we still get paid a lot and there are still lots of roles.\n\nNow, it's totally possible that the overall amount of software that needs to be written is finite, we will run out of solvable problems and there will be a scarcity of jobs.\n\nIt's also possible that human beings just enjoy the creation of technology for the sake of it, that there will always be software to make and people to guide that, even with a sufficiently advanced AI you still need people to imprint domain knowledge and human values. Software developers can still exist, just that the utility is shifting towards \"entertainers\" rather than \"utilitarians\".\n\nTruth is, we don't know how valuable code will be in the future, but we do know that historically, just because code becomes easy to manufacture doesn't mean it becomes a cheap commodity.",

Organizations don't want to build and maintain competency in systems that fall outside their core business, and that constraint does not disappear just because AI accelerates the rate of delivery. SAP is the clearest example. The economics of a rewrite may appear compelling given its cost, but organizations will not pursue it regardless of how long it takes, because it is not their business to do so. In many cases the org has also spent decades molding its processes around the software, making migration risk alone a company threatening proposition. There are exceptions. Amazon built AWS internally before it became a product, but these cases tend to involve organizations where the strategic value of owning the capability is unusually high. For most, that threshold is never reached. Smaller, more narrowly scoped tools are a different story. These are ripe for disruption, whether through in house rewrites that AI has made newly practical, or through significant downward pricing pressure as vendors are forced to compete with good enough internal builds.",

          "text": "I think the bigger problem is that with a nontrivial system, one person can’t do everything, regardless of how good AI gets.\n\nI’m on a team with 4 other experienced devs and we own a very critical system. Today, I tried hypothesizing what this would look like if I was just our best dev on the team + AI.\n\nFirst, they’d be on call for this system 24/7. Immediately they aren’t getting any work done. They won’t be able to fit the entire system in their head so every niche page and support problem will require a lengthy conversation with AI to figure out exactly what to do.\n\nSecond, they’d need to be the point of contact on everything happening with that system. That’s not practical. And you can’t have an engineer in the middle of a meeting be asking AI the answers to tons of random questions, assuming it even knows them.\n\nThen, ignoring no time for development since they’re on call 24/7, they would need to make architectural decisions that make sense in the context of our business. AI is good at general answers, not specifics. I don’t see 1 person + AI making great decisions. We could assume we’d still do RFCs but just with the 1 engineer from each other team that’s a stakeholder, but then you’re getting away from replacing all devs.\n\nAnd even if all this works, you’d have one person designing like 5 complex features in parallel while fully understanding all of it, AB testing, rolling it out, etc? That is a huge mental burden, even assuming AI writes all of the code perfectly.\n\nI think overall, AI is good at speeding me up as an IC. And *maybe* 1 engineer + AI can begin owning multiple legacy systems that are very reliable and not being actively developed anymore. But I honestly don’t see a realistic path where it replaces more than 1-2 people on my team. My theory is that people don’t really understand what software engineering is and think because a nontechnical user can use AI to spin up a greenfield project, that this will somehow extend linearly. I think they just don’t understand the realities of the field. It’s just another “silver bullet.”",

At most companies, it's less than 50%, even when they're in a head-down implementation phase of their project. So a coding bot isn't going to do whatever it is SWEs are doing the rest of the time, even if AI is perfect at coding.\n\nHowever, think about what that time is spent doing: interacting with project managers, business analysts, managers, etc. All of this is aimed at understanding and refining product and technical requirements, working with other teams, etc. So I don't think that AI can completely replace engineers simply by coding.\n\nIn order to replace SWEs entirely, a good portion of all of those other roles would also have to be replaced. The AI would need to understand the problem domain, the proper modeling of it, the space of feasible solutions given the business context, and so on.\n\nThe conclusion I come to is not that AI cannot replace SWEs, it's that AI cannot replace SWEs without also replacing a lot of other job functions too. But we already see the germination of this. If you sit down now with the latest AI coding platforms, you can magic up a website front end to a CRUD backend. It will be prosaic, it won't scale, but think about all of the jobs that a few prompts can do now: UI designer, front end, back end, API, database. What it produces is very limited, sure, but if the business-design-product loop can be closed for tight iteration, that does dramatically change things.\n\nBut I guess we can take solace in the fact that we definitely won't be alone. If AI does take engineering jobs, it will take all of the roles we interface with and most of middle management with it.",

Does it even makes sense to quibble about the specifics of whether this role absorbs that one or vice versa? At that point it's all six months or a year or maybe three years or whatever away from all being subsumed.\n\nPeople are already talking about this. VC troll Marc Andreessen has already said he's looking forward to the day that an entire tech organization can be populated entirely by AI in every role from CEO on down. (At that point, it wouldn't make much sense to even disambiguate the roles.)\n\nThe bigger question is how reasonable or likely this is. I am of two minds. At the moment, if you look at the areas AI has been populating the longest, we still haven't made great strides forward. Look at self-driving cars. Yes, there are Waymos roaming around, and that is impressive, but if you step back and ask yourself why they haven't scaled, it's simply because AI isn't good enough. In order to work reliably, these cars have to rely on a sub-centimeter resolution scan of the environment they operate in so they have a baseline from which deviations can be detected. This is one of the major reasons they're slow to roll out, and the economics have to be in place to warrant that much effort, the liability, etc. If AI were truly as capable as humans as Waymos seem, then there would be no professional human drivers by now.\n\nThat's not to say it won't eventually happen. If I had to bet, I'd say it probably will happen, but I'm not sure about the timeline. I tend to think that this is going to be an evolution more than a revolution, and that's simply by observing how long it's taken so far to go from the self-driving DARPA challenge to today in spite of the transformer AI architecture being published in 2017.\n\nHaving said all that, I'm not sure many people in the industry will like the changes it introduces regardless. I kind of like coding. I like solving problems like that. I don't like managing people. I'm not sure juggling the output of a half a dozen agents is sufficiently like coding and unlike managing people that I want to do it.",

Entry-level work -- writing boilerplate, building simple CRUD endpoints, writing unit tests for clear specs -- is exactly what current models handle competently. The concern is not replacement of experienced engineers.

It wont neccessarily know what database to use or what kind of architecture to utilize without being told what it is you want. And non-technical people aren't going to be able to tell it what they want to that fine detail.\n\nThis is something that can never actually be fixed within the AI model itself because this particular limitation is related to the human aspect.",

          "text": "So, since being laid off I've been trying to learn as much as possible about LLMs. I'm doing this for the sake of my mental health. I find myself on a rollercoaster of emotions listening to the various \"thought leaders\" and influencers, so I would rather just have a solid foundation of understanding so I can sort the signal from the noise. I'd encourage everyone to do this. Instead of getting caught up in the hype of new models or new tools, learn the fundamentals so you can tell who is bullshitting you.\n\nSo first off, \"reasoning\" models aren't a fundamentally different architecture from other LLMs. The reason I mention this is whenever I point out these things are just stochastic parrots, people like to say \"but reasoning!!\". Basically, the training inputs are somewhat different (answers tend to include a \"chain of thought\"), and then they have various (interesting!) hacks to try to create a situation where more tokens = closer approximation to a good answer. One hack, for instance, is having it generate multiple answers in parallel, score them based on various heuristics (self consistency, for instance. Self consistency means that if it produces three answers, A, B, and C, are answers A and B the same but C is different? Probably go with A or B.)\n\nThe important point here though is these things are still just approximating an answer, not \"thinking\" or building world models.\n\nUltimately \"reasoning\" is a useful capability but not AGI. Also, these things tend to fail when asked to do things outside of their training, because again, they're stochastic parrots. Yes, there are some mitigations around this (RAG and tools), but it's pretty clear that transformer architectures aren't going to scale into AGI. They're just going to be really good at answering things contained in their dataset. To me, they're like a very fancy search engine. \n\nOne question I asked ChatGPT this morning was how LLMs handle structured text like JSON. The answer was pretty illuminating. ChatGPT does not fundamentally understand JSON, it just has such an inconceviably large dataset of JSON documents that it tends to get the syntax right through approximation. It also does interesting things like \"constrained decoding\", where the model is forbidden to emit syntactically incorrect tokens (ie, if it emits a token that results in bad syntax, it's forced to try again, until it produces correct syntax). This answer is straight from ChatGPT itself, not my characterization.\n\nAnyway, I think AI will make the job market much worse and basically make \\*everything\\* worse, like they kinda are already doing, but I don't think being able to think is going to stop being an economically important thing and that's ultimately what software devs are doing all day, thinking. The code is just one output of that. (And you still have to watch the stochastic parrots when they generate that)",

I do think it will radically change the nature of our jobs, and you will get left behind if you don't learn to use these tools, but those who adapt will have no problem finding jobs.\n\nI thought of an analogy when discussing this recently - remember what office work was like in the 50's/60's/70's?  Admin work specifically.  Any office had a whole department of people whose job it was to make copies, organize files into rooms of file cabinets, fetch files that people needed, send files where they needed to go, just manage the mountains of paper an office produced.  \n\nAfter computers and the internet, that job ceased to exist per se, but there are still armies of admin jobs in a lot of places.  Think medical coders, compliance people, any number of people at an insurance company.  Basically anything in the book \"Bullshit Jobs.\"  When we created technology to push paper more efficiently, paper pushers didn't go away.  Instead, the volume of paper to push exploded and the job of a \"paper pusher\" changed to look radically different, but it still exists at a similar skill level, if a slightly different skill set.\n\nSo that's what I think is coming to software development.  The skill set will be related, but a little different.  And I maybe the demand won't quite increase to match the inflated supply, but maybe it will.  Reality will probably be somewhere in the middle.",

Basically I was both the PM and Architect, and Claude was the dev.\n\nI'm very impressed with its capabilities. To a point. I'm evaluating it based on its performance with a language I don't know well (I'm not a web dev; I do cloud infrastructure engineering), and I still found myself having to hit Escape during 10+-minute long \"thinking...\" sessions so I could tell it things that any human, even a remarkably bad dev, would still know. I also had to write like 15 pages of documentation to set proper guardrails to keep it on track, and on several occasions had to outright do some of the development myself to point it in the right direction.\n\nAnd this was a project that I understood in its entirety. No back-and-forth with stakeholders, no trying to understand what people were telling me. I knew exactly what I wanted, and as a developer, I knew how to explain it in a way that an LLM *should* be able to understand.\n\nAI just isn't capable of fully replacing a developer. Or at least not a semi-competent one. Used correctly, it *can* increase velocity (though not nearly as much as the AI CEOs claim), but it can't replace devs entirely.

          "text": "I read something interesting on here the other day and it’s had me thinking. \n\nRight now, the fight for AI dominance is tough. You got all these firms burning VC money just to get market share and eventually when a few of them die, one will come out victorious and become what Google became for search. You will have your bings, opera etc but what Google was for search is what they’re all fighting for. (Listen to the Google episode on Acquired to learn about how they got there- very similar to what’s going on right now in AI) \n\nNow, when the dust has settled and we have our winner - devs will be relying on this platform very heavily. It’s not just as simple as model inference that people can just spin up local models for but it will have a moat that i can’t even think of right now. Either it’s so ingrained into a normal developer workflow or not using it puts you at a disadvantage so your firm will lose competitive edge. I.e your LOB will say “no we have to use that service because our competitors use that service”. At which point, the owner of the service will jack up prices to the point where businesses will have to pay. At some point, I think it will be a setup like Bloomberg terminals in finance. Firms pay a yearly subscription of like 20k or something, but they NEED it to stay competitive - no one’s putting booomberg out of business anytime soon. \n\nWhat did the introduction of Bloomberg terminals do to finance? Changed the whole game! A whole industry of people had to retrain, get skilled on it, Bloomberg introduced new features to the point where finance companies are kind of stuck now - if you don’t have a Bloomberg then what the hell is your firm doing. \n\nBut it becomes more nuanced than that becomes of how agentic these models are becoming. The LOB no longer have to employ as many X employees for Y output as they rely heavily on their “terminal” to do more work. It’s a hefty price which gets priced into the market rate of devs. What happened in finance? Companies assume that devs will be more valuable using this terminal that they’re willing to pay a new market rate for the productivity. Will we all lose our jobs? No. Because sometimes firms are not thinking about productivity of their own company but rather the relative productivity. “Am I more productive than my competitor”. Let’s say your competitor just hired a bunch of top tier devs AND has the terminal, you’re going to lose. \n\nAnd so the cycle will keep cycling. We will keep getting hired and fired until we reach an equilibrium of dev to terminal ratio where it’s economically viable. \n\nCool, so what am I doing to prepare for this? Stronger fundamentals. Just look at the finance world. Even with the Bloomberg terminals and “unlimited knowledge at their fingertips” it’s still the veterans that see signal and monetise it. Give 10 juniors and 1 senior trader the same information, the senior trader will probably make more than all the juniors combined. Same with tech. The seniors will become insanely productive and the juniors will be treading water. For anyone junior reading this, hurry the f up and get senior. Read your books on system design, data intensive apps, networking, comp arch and become cracked to the point where you’re the senior that can beat 10 juniors. If you get fired, you’re at peace because you know you can still get by.…\n\nOr maybe I’m just coping and we’re all fucked. Good day 👋🏽",

With every year that passed in my career I was excited to be learning something new. FrontEnd, BackEndnd, to FullStack. Every year I felt like I leveled up a developer. It was like a game: each promotion provided me with new year, every job change was a new level to learn.  Now, almost 8 years later I feel like I've plateaued at the senior engineering level. I don't even know if i love coding anymore, but the money's good and as things are getting more expensive I want to position myself for a promotion.\n\nWith the advent of AI, I feel like i've become more of a prompt engineer than anything. I feel like I can't even take the time out to learn new languages or frameworks because the demand for pumping out work has become so high. Even architecture diagrams are design nowadays with AI. Now, it's just a job like any other. \n\nFor those of you who've been developing for some time, what did it take for you to make the move from senior to staff? And for those of you who've done it more recently did that look any different than your older peers? Should I just grind Leetcode and pray I end up at a MANGA that doesn't lay me off,  just learn a sub-domain really well instead, or just suck it up and be thankful I have a job? ",

So doing this really taught me a lot, but the feedback loop was slow and research was tricky. \n\nYou aren't barred from reading code. You absolutely should understand all of the code you commit and how it works. AI doesn't excuse you from that responsibility. You really have a great chance now to learn quite a few languages. I've become much more adept at python, go and rust since incorporating LLMs into my workflow. In fact, it's really nice because if there's some aspect I don't understand, I copy and paste it into the context and get a brief explainer. I double check it against the docs and boom, whole new concept learned. \n\nAnyway, this part isn't the part of LLMs that bothers me. It's the part where people don't double check their work, and companies force it down our throats.",

It’s not an engineering book, it’s a negotiation book written by a former FBI hostage negotiator turned consultant. In it, he talks about incentives and understanding what people want from a conversation and using that to create non-zero sum outcomes, and even when you deal with someone who might be getting a rawer deal, explaining to them respectfully why their desired outcome lost out. It’s the biggest tool in my arsenal every day.",

          "text": "Grinding leetcode won't help, unless you mean just for the sake of getting into a bigger company and (re-) starting the progression to Staff there. Getting to staff is mostly about understanding how to overcome organizational challenges (convincing engineers to do the right thing (spoiler: it is not always going to be the best technical thing), and convincing leadership to agree to let engineers spend time doing the right thing (which is not usually going to be the fastest or easiest thing)), and then using that ability to actually get useful things done. That is a two way street since you need to understand what matters both to fellow (particularly less experienced) engineers, and what matters to management, figure out a solution that actually satisfies both, and then actually convince everyone to do that. IMO it is much easier to do that in a company and space you are very familiar with than in a new one.\n\nAI is nice because the above is usually so time consuming that you are not going to find time to actually code anything significant yourself, unless there are other Staff you can split responsibilities with. If you get familiar with AI tooling, you can still get quite a bit of actual code out the door by giving it quick instructions between meetings and reviewing its work. IMO this is a lot less satisfying than coding yourself, but it's like having you own personal intern that you don't have to feel bad about not responding to immediately.\n\nedit: there is a tendency in engineering forums to call all of this \"politics\", but it isn't. While there definitely is more politics at higher levels, the vast majority of the above is just paying attention to who you're talking to and trying to speak to them in a way they will understand and be reassured by. I have had to step into so many escalations where two teams have been disagreeing over something for days/weeks and I can't understand why - then I listen in on a call and there isn't actually an disagreement on technical grounds. One of them is just saying describing the solution in one way highlighting what is important to them, and not understanding what the other one wants from it, and my contribution ends up being just repeating what the first one said, but explaining how it will satisfy the second party too. It is stupid, I don't know how these otherwise intelligent and rational people can have spent a week on this issue without figuring it out, but here we are.",

          "text": "A lot of people hit that shift around senior, the game feeling fades because the work stops being about learning tools and starts being about owning outcomes. The jump to staff usually is less about grinding Leetcode and more about driving cross team decisions, influencing architecture, and being the person others rely on when things get messy. If you are feeling plateaued, it might help to ask whether you want deeper technical scope or broader organizational impact, because staff is often more about systems and people than code.",

If AI can eventually handle writing the code, our job will be to make the design decisions. This means high level architecture that LLMs are incapable of actually deciding, because their context window is very limited.",

But a staff should be \"Amazing\" at 1 or 2 specific types of work. Culture building, large scale client requests (beyond bread and butter work that seniors should do), super deep knowledge on the backend or frontend framework. \n\nBasically, the ability to code does not improve from Senior to Staff. so stop stressing about getting better there, the returns are incremental from here on out. Start thinking about what thing you are amazing at, or could be amazing at, and start marketing that. \n\nStaff -> Senior staff, in my eyes is the ability to be given extremely broad goals like \"improve the amazon homepage\" and build technical teams to specialize in the various aspects, while utilizing their specialized domain.",
