      "text": "I’m a senior software engineer at a large company with a structured promotion and calibration process. I’ve been at the company since May 2021, so I’m approaching 5 years, and I’ve never been promoted, despite my scope, responsibilities, and level of impact changing significantly over time.\n\nRecently, I was denied a promotion again. My manager said he took my case to the calibration committee, but the final decision was not to promote me now, with the justification being “lack of consistency.” What makes this harder to reconcile is that another engineer at the same level, within the same BU but on a different team, was promoted with around 6 months on the team, while I’ve been on my current team for over a year and at the company for almost five years.\n\nDuring our conversation, my manager used an analogy: someone digging with a pickaxe, very close to finding a treasure, and being encouraged not to give up now. I understand the intention behind it, but I’m struggling to trust that framing. Given my history here, it increasingly feels less like “almost reaching the treasure” and more like the classic donkey-and-the-carrot situation — where the reward is always just a bit further away, keeping you moving without real certainty that it will ever arrive.\n\nAfter that, I started considering a lateral transfer. I communicated this transparently to my manager. He said he understands, but speaking as a mentor, he believes my best chance of promotion would be to wait another 6 months and try again. He was clear that he can’t promise anything, only that he “intends to bring the case again.”\n\nI also spoke with the manager of a potential lateral transfer role and heard something similar: that if my primary goal is promotion, waiting a few more months in my current context might be my best chance.\n\nThe core issue is that I no longer trust the process. Not because I think anyone is lying or acting in bad faith, but because it feels like if there were enough real interest in promoting me now, a criterion like this wouldn’t have been the blocker. The rules seem flexible and dependent on context and people.\n\nThis has started to affect me outside of work: difficulty sleeping, constant rumination, and the feeling that I’m betting my emotional health on a vague promise.\n\nRight now, I’m torn between:\n\n\t•\tstaying where I am and “waiting” for something I no longer believe in;\n\n\t•\tpushing for a lateral transfer to change context;\n\n\t•\tor starting to plan an exit from the company altogether.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\n\nDoes it ever make sense to wait when you no longer believe in the process?\n\nHow would you approach this decision?",

There’s also a quality of years of experience.

When I started ny career at some software company, I wanted to be in development, not \"implementation.\"   They asked me to give them two years, and then put in for a transfer, which I did.   In the 4.5 years I worked at this company, I got a small raise every year, but seriously the money and the title both sucked.\n\nAfter 2 years, by that time a new manager had come in, and my old manager had transfered away.   I was stuck in the same position in Implementation instead of Development.   I also saw people of less ability easily transfer to Development while my manager sat on me and gave me excuse after excuse on why I couldn't transfer.  I was made promises that were later broken.   I saw this same manager do this to other people on my team.\n\nThis is absolutely a fucking horrible situation, and is a clear indication that although your manager may like you, often times their hands are tied by upper management who ... do NOY ... give a shit .. about YOU!!!!!\n\nI'm all with giving a new company a fair shot, but when a promise is broken the first time, then I'm done ... it's too late.   When I get shafted, it's time to move on ... transferring to a new part of the company doesn't work when the company is rotten at it's core.\n\nMy advice is update your resume, and move on.   For years, and years, and years this was often seen as the BEST way to get a better title, a better job, and certainly more money.   I understand the market sucks right now, and it's an EMPLOYERS market.   You have a job, and that's great, use this as an opportunity to find a new job.

It's not an injury people can see, but it's a harm that degrades your ability to operate with high degrees of trust and faith in the process.\n\nYou gotta start the process of a lateral transfer, at a minimum. Once you get passed over twice with no actionable reason, it's impossible to tell if waiting 6 months (again) will ever help, or you're not the guy they'll ever promote past senior. You could simply be out of the trust zone, and the longer you stay the higher the risk of burnout or stalling out your personal growth.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for lateral transfer, and I'm in the process of that now. You can't thrive in an environment you're not aligned with. You can dig in and soldier through, but the moral injury only accumulates when reality and expectations constantly conflict. It's okay to both believe in the process and company, and accept your local position is sub-optimal, and the other path is just to accept it and lower expectations (also valid).\n\nWhen it comes to senior promotions, what you are experiencing is very close to what I'm going through: 2 years a team lead, lead a project with big numerical impact and clear cross team influence, but instead of getting the nod after I pushed to cancel a losing project early, I'm shuffled into a high visibility role on a stacked team and used to de-risk execution. I've done everything I can for a Staff level promotion, and that leadership does not feel rewarded.\n\nIn the corporate game, we must make our own luck. You've executed well, but you can't control if management will recognize it or ever pick you for the next level. Amongst those who go beyond senior, switching teams when sidelined is basically a rite of passage, and a very common story in those who clibh higher. Keep your head up, and good luck!",

It's more of a long term strategy. \n\nI don't trust my company process because we don't have money, so it's really hard to get promoted. My em just find excuses. Knowing this, I know that a changing team will not help me, and the only path is to change company or wait for a lead to leave. \n\nGood luck!",

What would happen then?\n\nWill you seek another promotion? Can you reasonably expect that you won’t face a moving goalpost again? \n\nOtherwise, will you stay for compensation? It takes a few years to get to the next level’s full compensation after a promo.\n\nDo you enjoy the environment and your work so much that you would overlook the others aspects? Then why are you so concerned about the promo in the first place?\n\nThen, I’d lean on the “lacks consistency” motivation. What does that mean, it’s vague and non actionable? Did your manager elaborate? Did he give you actionable feedback to overcome this perception? Do you find this feedback justified?\n\nIf not, how would this perception change over 6 months if it is not being addressed?\n\nThese questions may help you understand your situation better.\n\nMy opinion is that you’re being led on and credible retention risk will likely be the only reason that will change the management’s perception around your promo. Even if you get it after the next 6 months, you already have bad feelings about it and likely won’t enjoy your time then. However, you have the reputation of someone who “lacks consistency”, it will linger and be used against you whenever it is convenient. \n\nThe analogy they made about mining betrays your manager’s gaslighting. I’ll give you a better analogy for your situation: 99% of gamblers quit gambling before winning the great jackpot. If they cared about retaining you long term, they would have promo’d you.\n\nMoving laterally may help you ease the mental cost of doing the full transition. I’d recommend it before leaving the company as interviewing while stressed and desperate is not ideal and may give the interviewers some bad vibes that they will avoid. You will also have it better personal life without all the stress in the current position which is more rewarding than any work reward.\n\nNow, my personal experience is that people who management wants promoted get promoted with weak correlation to gow outstanding they are in their job. I was in the same situation, telling management about my departure plans was the biggest mistake. The narrative around my performance restrospectively turned from positive key-person to “lacks consistency and bad networking”. I moved laterally but the old (adjusted) feedback still haunted me afterwards. Yet I made new friends, contributed to very cool projects and my new management was a lor more considerate and grateful for my efforts.\n\nMy advice is to get out of this bad situation, either by fortifying mentally to endure the current environment without it slipping into your personal life or by leaving to another team or company. Secondly, never expect promotions, you signed a contact to be paid X for work at a given Y level that outlines expectations and responsibilities. The company may need more work and they need to offer you the rewards for doing more, not otherwise. If you think you can perform at a higher level, go interview and take what’s yours.\n\nI hope we’ll hear from you in the next few months and that you’ll be in a better emotional and material position.",

If your org doesn’t have a business justification to have two L6s, it doesn’t matter how well you perform, you will *never* be promoted. This also is up to your manager or your manager’s manager: they have to both argue that there should be an L6 at all, and that you should be that L6.

It's a constant pain managing upwards because I'm doing 2x-3x the work for 0.5x the pay. \n\nAll of this along with doing days and days of unpaid overtime to deliver on goals has left a bad taste in my mouth for some time. On top of this my 2nd line manager decided to obliterate any remaining good will by calling me insubordinate, because I dared questioned his almighty power because because due to backlogs of work he doesn't seem to understand we have to do, I hadn't managed to deal with his frankly ridiculous demand by email that I do yet more of his job for him for the nth time. \n\nDo what I've done, the time is now to use your zeal and frustration with the situation and put it to good use. Don't waste it on the useless management you have in front of you blocking the way, use it to impress new managers and get the job and position you deserve.\n\nI've just accepted a new position at a new company being paid more money and with a defined fixed pay scale of what I'll earn in future years (just the nature of the business I'm applying to but it's a nice perk to know where I'll stand for the time I'm there). I'll be better off, with clearer defined responsibilities, management above me who from speaking to their staff have nothing but good things to say about the leadership and importantly a business with a direction I agree with is the right way forwards. \n\nAs others have said, keep it to yourself, plan your exit and when the change comes it will hurt them more than you. It's going to cost a lot of time and money to get someone to replace you and do what you're doing as it's not just the costs of recruitment, but they need to get that new person upskilled on whatever you've been working on. \n\nFor where I am currently, we have a huge back catalogue of things that just work and require little by way of attention. When they do require attention, I'm the only person on the team who has the knowledge of how to maintain them. All I've got are brand new juniors (see point about poor managers) that for good reason the decision is that they don't want them tinkering with old code without them being up to speed yet and it's a slow process as they are all very green.\n\nUnfortunately for the management team, they have never bothered to acknowledge and protect the business against this current bus factor problem (it's just me) after repeatedly being told they should have a formal plan for how they want things documented should anything happen. Case in point I was off sick for a couple of days recently and incidents came in, but no one dealt with them until I did when I returned from my sick leave. \n\nCurrently they don't know I'm about to hand my notice in, and when I do, there's some leave to be taken as well. So my tenure with them will be shorter than their first expect and I cannot wait to watch them scrabbling to get what they can out of me before it's too late.\n\nIt's a bed of their own making, and it's the same for you OP. If you feel you're ready for it and your manager is being serious they believe you deserve it too, then it's time to quietly plan your exit for new pastures and know leaving is the right choice. Do it on your terms (I took 6 months to get to this point) so put those feelers out to see if it's worth it for you too!",

Suggest a monthly check-in where you can look ahead together at the types of projects, behaviors, or other elements that you can take on to help exhibit what they're looking for. Keep a doc where you write down what you've visibly done in the past month during that conversation, capture it in the moment with their collaboration. Approach it from a \"I'm arming you to make the best case possible, I appreciate you continuing to take this back to them\".

          "text": "I had a similar situation last year. Year after year of stellar reviews, a verbal promise of the promotion from my direct manager, and a pretty good vote of confidence from my skip level. Everything looked good. And then the calibration committee shot it down. The reason I got was that I wasn’t impacting the org as a whole — only my team. This was only half true. On the one hand, I’d never been told that was an expectation. On the other, I’d done several things that impacted the entire org. \n\nSo I did what you did. Tried to push for a lateral move (into architecture) only to be told basically the same thing. However, that manger was in the calibration meetings, whereas my manager and my skip level were not. And he told me flat out that the reason I wasn’t promoted was because not enough of the people in that room knew who I was. \n\nI work remote, but we have options for both hybrid and remote depending on location. The fact of the matter is that I’d need to go into the office and run shoulders and play politics with the right people if I wanted the title. I won’t do that. I made the mistake of getting a little too emotional about it with my boss and my skip level both. Fortunately we’re all close, so they kept it to themselves, commiserated with me and accepted I was going to have to leave to get the title and raise. I haven’t left yet, but that’s mostly out of a lack of urgency. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can be great at your job, but it’s a popularity contest at the higher levels. It sucks, but that’s the corporate world. I was already pulling sixty-plus hour weeks trying to get promoted. I wasn’t going to work any harder for no reward. I decided to tone it down and focus more on my work-life balance. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made. Yeah, I didn’t get a “stellar” review this year, but I did fine, and I got to keep my sanity and dignity while I was at it. And when I find a gig worth jumping for, I’m gone.",

You don’t want to have 10 engineering managers that each have their own definition of junior, mid-level, senior, and so on.  That’s a recipe for variability in performance expectations that can lead to other issues like compensation inequality.  It’s also important because once you get to staff level and beyond there’s just not as many spots open because only a limited number of people are doing that work.  So you have to have some way of coordinating who moves into an open staff or principal role, which requires everyone to be on the same page about what each level entails.",

      "text": "How are y'all dealing with Chesterton's Fence when reading code?\n\nPre-AI, there used to be some signal from code being there that it had some value. By that I mean that if there's an easy way and a hard way to do something, and you see the hard way being done, it's because someone thought they needed to put in the effort to do the hard way. And there was some insight to be gained in thinking about why that was the case. Sure occasionally it was because the author didn't have the simple thing cross their mind, but with knowledge of the author's past code I could anticipate that too.\n\nWith AI generated code that feels less true. An AI has no laziness keeping it from doing the fancy thing. That means that sometimes the fancy thing isn't there for any particular reason. It works so it's there.\n\nThis naturally poses a problem with Chesterton's Fence: If I spend a bunch of time looking for the reason that a particular piece of complexity is there but 75% of the time it's never there, I feel like I'm just wasting time. What do you do to avoid this time/energy sink?",

This was true before AI, and it's still true now.\n\nHowever, let's assume the mess has already been made and snuck into the repo, despite not having a reason to be there.  Assuming the original (human) author is still around, treat it the same way you would have prior to AI --- go to them and ask them what motivated the complexity.  Honestly, if I suspect the code was made with AI, I push the \"why\" questions even if it becomes a little uncomfortable for the person I'm asking, since people *must* be responsible for the code they commit, even if an AI generated it.\n\nIf the author *isn't* present, the next step is your test suites.  If you can rip out the complex code and it fails a test case, then that identifies why it's there.  If you rip out the complex code and it still passes... that could just mean your tests are inadequate.  Time to look at tickets, commit history, and/or chat threads. If there's still no reason for why it's there, my inclination is to leave things be unless it's actually causing problems.",

But if its just \"implement feature X\" with no context and the code has that AI smell then I assume its probably safe to simplify.

And this should happen anywhere in the code they make a decision, even small ones.  \n\nIf some code doesn't have good comments like that, it's not really 'valuable', and the default assumption should be that any added complexity is a mistake\n\nAI very much does not do this well.  It adds a lot of comments, but they're always what, not why, and they occur randomly instead of in places where a significant decision was made\n\nOf course, even among devs that actually comment correctly, most of them make very few decisions and just copy/paste existing code that already made those decisions.  And devs don't get to decide business requirements, so the why of those is never in comments.  And if grooming is done correctly, devs should be making very few decisions at the time of writing code, and they're probably not going to copy notes from the story into the code's comments\n\nSo basically, uncommented code is human-written, but they didn't make any real decisions and probably didn't really think through their approach (or are an inexperienced dev), so it can probably be improved.  Badly commented code is always considered bad code, even if they happened to use a good approach, and usually written by AI.

Design Patterns can come into the picture once we get to this being a library fixture and API contracts start getting affected.

Practically it's a \"design by vetted examples\" for any AI to refer to (eg in a CLAUDE.md file). All new code is to be written like the prominent design of the repo, with formatting and linting rules as defined for the repo/project.\n\nBasically, this helps style and substance mirror what is on the codebase already. Helps in better, effective code writing even with AIs.\n\nEspecially if you have younger engineers you can't force them to not write code with AI.

Honestly AI can also be a great tool for this problem because it allows you to assert a lot of questions you might have against code you are not very familiar with and get answers quickly as to why that code might exist (or why it might not need to). Very often AI is good at checking work done by other agents and giving critical analysis of it. \n\nOther than that I'd say you'd handle it the same way you always would. Figure out if anyone on the team understands why something is done a certain way and, if not, and you see a potentially better solution than make a proposal or PR to fix it.

      "text": "The company I work for hired a junior a few months back. He is fresh out of university, cannot express himself very well,and during his time in college he made some consulting, and write some shallow tutorials in medium. Unsurprisingly, he has this mindset in which the more code he wrote and merge, the better employee he is, regardless the code nor the impact. It's ok, I was there once too.  \nMy manager wanted me to pair with him to slowly introduce him into the code base, starting with the easiest service. Im a senior but he doesn't report to me, so my work with him is meant to be collaborative where I lead and he follows.\n\nThe situation is the following:\n\nWhen I onboarded him and tried to give him permissions, he dismissed my questions and instructions quite abruptly and immediately sent me a PR to review. I chose to ignore that.\n\nLater, he spent weeks reviewing PRs he was assigned to, consistently approving everything without real review — including large PRs in a language he openly said he had never used, for a project he hadn’t been introduced to. On top of that, he started rushing others to merge, saying he had “already reviewed it.”\n\nWhen we started working together on a project, I assigned him a few tasks meant to help him get familiar with the service. He delivered quickly, but while the code looked polished, it lacked proper functionality: tests were missing or superficial, patterns weren’t followed, and he hadn’t tested the code. I gave clear feedback, explaining that testing and understanding the service was the whole point of the exercise. He ignored this, added reviewers outside the project to get approvals, and merged as soon as he could. The code was, unsurprisingly, broken. I told him I was happy to help if testing was difficult, as it’s part of the learning process.\n\nDuring a meeting to plan future work, he proposed a new way of working that would require appointing a tech lead, hinting himself for that role. The rest of the team reacted with visible awkwardness.\n\nAt some point he also started to review my work (definition, design, analysis and decomposition of tasks) to which he didn't have no background. Since he couldn't understand what I was talking about there, and with other people, he said that my work was incomplete and I had to add information that was lacking and pay attention because \"was very complex and not common\".  \n\\[...\\]\n\nI ended up talking with my manager and his manager (who seemed to have seen those signals and agree with me). Explained what I observed, what I tried how he responded and the aftermath was his manager talking to him, and him pairing with somebody else. I can see my other colleague is not super happy about the collaboration but things seem smoother.\n\nI can't help feeling that the result for my manager was \"I couldn't manage the situation\", so it's just better to change. Im trying to grow in my role and influence is a big part of this, so:\n\n\\- How would you solve this situation more autonomously? I would like to avoid go to my manager for help but rather saying \"I have this ~~problem~~ blocker, I propose to do this, do you agree\" without losing the project Im working with, or how solid I can be perceived.  \n  \n\\- Would you have talked before? Or only talked with his manager?\n\n\\- Other advice?\n\nThanks in advance!",

That’s their money, let them decide how they want to spend it. The rest depends on the answer. \n\nIf that junior is more important that the company business, users and stakeholders - it all gets into the management space, not technical space. The management is the whole process on its own, so I wouldn’t limit myself by obvious advices like “uh-oh you should listen them“ but apply something useful. These day I would suggest two good sources on management: Crucial Accountability for the companies more focused on a slow pace of correction and who can affords months to fix behavior or Radical Candor for the organization that needs to move fast. \n\nOtherwise what I see is lack of kind of “coaching contract“ established upfront in this relationships. Seems like there are a lot of unspoken assumptions on the both sides and these assumptions aren’t appear to be compatible. It is still good point to have open conversation on assumptions, even very evident, like “functional requirements must be fulfilled and internal coding standards must be obeyed” or “the information about how we work shared not to discuss, but to learn and apply”.

Instead, you need to tell him \"I cannot review your PR, because I need you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first\" or even review his PR and explain that it isn't tied to any real issue or need - or that it's low quality or whatever. Honestly, I'm not even sure what the problem is from reading this. I trust that his PR wasn't high quality, based on everything else you said, but there's nothing here to go by. Having this documented makes it easier to escalate if there is a problem and it gives him a chance to correct the issue.\n* When he approved the PRs without reviewing them - this one is hard to document. You could have a meeting with him to go over the PRs with you together and then document what happened. If it's clear he didn't actually review the PRs tell him not to approve them blindly, and follow up in an email with the contents of what was discussed and agreed upon in the discussion. If he refuses to talk to you, document and escalate that, too. If he isn't the one to review those PRs, that could also be a process/culture issue in the company that needs to be addressed, instead.\n* When he criticized your work, get him to specify which areas need clarification and what the common approach would have been to those issues. Force him to clarify his position. Tell him we all want the system to be easier to understand and modify, but we can't do that if he pushes back on designs without sharing his experience or tangible criticisms. That instead of shutting down discussion, he needs ask clarifying questions so we can move forward together as a team.\n\nThat said, I relate to your story. I've had a few juniors try to worm their way out of their responsibilities like this, and it took a few times for me to learn how to handle it. The best way to hold people and escalate is to be clear about your expectations, especially when they screw up. Leave a clear paper trail of the expectations you establish and their response to those. Then escalate when they refuse to comply.\n\nYou've got to take the emotion and subjectivity out of it and make it objective so that someone can say: \"This employee was fired because they were unwilling or unable to follow the process / guidelines which were clearly documented for them.\"",

Unfortunately there are some who have this attitude that will take conversations like this as a personal attack or a way to belittle them, so having a paper trail to cover yourself if this comes up is always a good idea.\n\nIf this continues, then I would arrange a meeting with their manager, yourself and them. This is basically you still being in control of the situation but bringing the manager in as the next step is for the manager to deal with, this also gives you another person in the room and this discussion should be along the lines of \"what you are doing now is not how we do things, you need to pull your head out of your ass.\"\n\nBeyond this point it is out of your hands and the manager needs to take over and deal with the situation.\n\nIn terms of your concern about \"I couldn't manage the situation\", I would say that a big part of managing the situation is knowing when to escalate a situation. If in your position you are purely a mentor who can coach and guide, but that is the extent of your \"hard authority\" then trying to reach them via these tools is all you can really do. I'd say so long as you can demonstrate you've leveraged all the tools available to you to solve the problem you should be ok.",

          "text": "First of all, I agree it’s a personality problem, and many of what others said (review process seems broken if you can’t request changes) you did a fine job yourself given it’s technically not your responsibility, but since you asked for an approach to be more proactive like an engineer, here’s my honest thoughts. \n\nWhat you were assigned for is mentorship. It takes a significant amount of your time, because it’s another big problem to solve. How you dealt with it was already acceptable, but it’s not to craft level. Just like you’d submit code that’s ok, but not craft. It’s true that human problems like this are a two-way street, but you have way more lever than you think. \n\nPersonally, when I’m assigned to mentor someone, just like studying codebase and all, I prepare a directory and markdown about them. I study them, document them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, proactively meet with them other than pair programming, document their personality and the boundary of failures. You’ve noticed problems, but they’re scattered and presented more like a rant. As you said, you need a plan of attack. \n\nThe same way that there’s documentation about the personality and technical capabilities of the junior, I’d create a roadmap of growth. Your roadmap could include every PR that he submits has to go through you. You would lay out why you’d like a thorough review on every one of these, at least when it’s a system you own, things include prevent code breakages and to facilitate better review process, and help him learn better on PR culture. You could also include things like more targeted PRs that he needs to test, even prepare some review templates to start with. I’d get buy-ins because my plan usually looks like I notice the human problems, I’m not emotional about it, objectively these are the things that need to get done, or need to be enforced by his manager, to help him grow. My first meet with the junior would’ve also included these discussions with them; while it’s collaborative, I would ask how they think of the codebase, what’s their career goal, what are the areas of interests and things they are learning about. I’d ask what they think they’re good at etc (as opposed to my own observation, good to see how delulu some are in documentation). \n\nAll of these take up significant of my time, but it’s part of mentorship. It’s also helpful to communicate/negotiate with the managers that, because of the plan of attack and all, this is where I’m spending my time and how. This way, it really can be communicated in a way that is basically the same as “do you want me to work on this feature/system more or that”. \n\nI haven’t gotten tons of mentorship opportunities, but the two I had were manageable as a result. One of them very arrogant, and really took a lot of my time, but it’s something I communicated and negotiated, and before I left the company, the junior expressed he really learnt a lot and wished there were more time. \n\nAh, I will say, since I’m Asian from Asia, I’ve been learning to balance the humbleness mindset and required amount of assertiveness. \n\nHope this helps.",

By the time sprint planning rolls around - it should be a matter of handling any carry-over, doing a 'gut check' on the work planned, and hitting 'go'.\n\nWho's organizing the spring planning? You can pitch the idea to them. Devs don't want to be stuck guessing on difficulties or high-level implementation right before they're set to go.",

Closest competitors are Dev/Medium with dumpster quality content and Hacker News which is exceptional however not a blogging platform on its own.\n\nI know that lately people tend to get content on Youtube etc, and maybe reading is not preferred by the younger generation of devs, but what about earlier times?\n\nWhy hasn't anyone built a platform with a quality threshold, proper technical formatting, and an engaged community of senior engineers?

Once a platform grows, moderation either gets expensive or quality slips. Hacker News works partly because discussion beats authorship, and the bar is social rather than formal.\n\nIt might also be cultural. The Russian tradition of long technical writeups and peer critique is stronger. In English speaking spaces, critique often gets read as negativity, so quality gatekeeping becomes controversial fast.",

Do you still read technical articles? You aren't the only one, and if you're a compelling writer, have something interesting to say, or did something interesting, people will want to read what you, the human, wrote. This isn't what people use LLMs for - instead they're used (especially for technical things) to get broad overviews of concepts, do research tasks (in which case they do link back to their sources), or ask specific questions that are usually covered in documentation.\n\nSo to make your work worth reading, you have to think about how people are using LLMs and fulfill the niches they can't. This may mean higher effort work, more unique content, or something else, but overall it raises the bar for what you write.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to think about why you're writing. To me, it doesn't really matter whether bots are scraping my content for AI or anything else. I write first for me, then for my audience, whatever it is. Some writers even make versions of their work more accessible for AI so that their ideas get out there or users can better query the work directly.",

On the hand, the aggregation means I do not need to know obscure blogs. \n\n\nI am quite young, but my guess, the difference is that runet never had strong tradition of independent blogs like the western internet had in 90s and well into 2010s (from my impression). \n\n\nWe went straight to VK/odnoclasniki because internet became a big widely available thing after the social media. So, down here people grouped themselves into different social media - like pikabu and habr and \"underground internet\". In the west these blogs were a thing,so they never centralised into one bug platform.\n\n\nIn Ukraine we have an idiosyncratic platform called Dou - it is more akin to news media for IT industry, but also quite a lot of habr-style technical posts. At least,used to be, I feel this aspect never took off properly. ",

      "text": "I’m a Senior BE with 7 YOE and joined a new team about a month ago. The people are ok, but I’ve run into some architectural patterns that feel like anti-patterns.\n\nCurrently, a lot of the business logic and orchestration lives directly in the route handlers. There is a strict rule against service-to-service calls; instead, the team uses a pattern where logic from one service is injected into another via lambdas passed down from the route level. This \"callback hell\" approach is apparently meant to keep services decoupled, but it results in lambdas being passed many layers deep, making the execution flow incredibly difficult to trace.\n\nThe friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles, especially since i'm still new to the team so there is not much established trust. However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nHow do you go about shifting an established engineering culture without coming across as the arrogant new hire? I want to advocate for better DX and maintainability, but I'm looking for a way to do it that feels collaborative rather than confrontational.",

Once someone is integrated at a company for a while, they forget what kind of options exist outside of their tech stack/existing design. It's a mix of institutional knowledge plus not really exploring outside of their bubble. Which is totally fine, this is a day job.\n\nI think you especially see this in big corporate dev culture. You get established norms and no real options to challenge the status quo individually or even in a systemic way. Usually those decisions are driven top down anyway. \n\nAnd like you said, you really need a lot of trust from stakeholders to approach big structural changes. And it's almost never the hill to die on.\n\nAt least, that's my experience in corporate culture and even startup culture to a degree.\n\nI had an interview at eBay last year, and every round, the interviewers were absolutely pumped about migrating all their REST APIs to GraphQL and the \"big direction\" the company was taking towards their backend. I think they've been investing in external companies focused on GraphQL, too. Felt like the decision was being driven top down.\n\nI don't know much about GraphQL and I don't think GraphQL is that great tbh or even gamechanging. And they're kind of 10 years late to the party.

          "text": "> The friction peaked during a code review for a new feature I was tasked to develop. I tried to structure the code to be more testable, but I was explicitly asked to move that logic out of my services and into the controllers instead. Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\nI am confused why this is an either-or thing. Perhaps this is a language specific problem (you didn’t specify the language), but a lambda is just a closure box around some function invocation. Sure you can write logic inline in the lambda, but there’s no reason you _have_ to do things this way, the lambda can equally just call a free function (in languages with such a thing) or capture some function object that implements the logic. Why can you not have the logic you want to directly unit test separated into a testable unit, test it, then simply pass that as the lambda? The lambda now only serves to “wire together” the injection point to the logic being injected.\n\nThis kind of design keeps the decoupling between transport and business logic that you’re looking for, while simultaneously not rocking the boat on their design patterns?\n\nAs for needing integration tests: I mean, yeah, ultimately you are going to need those, because at the end of the day you have to validate the system as a whole behaves as expected. Put differently, if the actual requirements on the system are “when API X is invoked with arguments Y, effect Z happens,” then you need to actually test _that_, the rest is implementation details. The point of separating out smaller units for testing is to isolate the point of failure. If the top level test fails but the unit test passes, you know the issue lies in the integration between the unit and the larger system. If both fail, you know at minimum there is a defect in the unit which likely is causing a defect in the system the unit is integrated into.\n\nI can’t comment on the overall architecture because your description of it isn’t very detailed. It sounds a lot like pretty standard inversion of control principles, which are usually considered *good* for testing and maintainability. Perhaps the problems you’re feeling there are tied to either poorly specified contracts (I.E. the contracts of those lambdas aren’t well specified), or due to implementation specifics (people writing massive, deeply nested lambdas inline instead of breaking out directly testable helpers with the logic and having the lambdas in the transport layer just wire them together). Once you’ve really understood the *why* of the design, perhaps you can push to close the gap on documentation or best practices that can help you and the next you understand the system better, as well as help shift left some of the testing practices from being purely massive top level integration tests to a healthy blend of system level and unit level testing.",

As long as you’re ok with that, pick your battles. Focus on cheap, high-yield pilot projects that have clear feedback when they work out. Performance issues are good for this, because numbers clearly go down/up. Things like “this makes the code easier to work with/easier to extend” are harder to prove, and therefore not great for gaining trust early on. \n\nYour challenge is a political one here - not technical. Maybe you had a lot of trust where you came from, so it’s hard to have your ideas viewed with skepticism, but an antidote to that is showing them you can do it their way, at least for a little while. It’s also an opportunity to check your own bias. If you’re surrounded by people who implicitly trust you, that can dull your awareness of weaknesses in ideas you have. And if you’re actually right, you’ll help others check their bias, but keep in mind how uncomfortable that can be for some people to have dictated to them. \n\nPS - I know how that can feel like you’re just going along with everyone’s complacency and it’s really frustrating.

Because the core logic is so tied to the transport layer, the team also expects me to scrap my unit tests in favor of route-level integration tests.\n\n\nYou could advocate for tests using the Test host or equivalent in your environment (you don't mention which it is). The one that I use is for for outside-in, and all in-memory testing. You can and should swap out real database for mocks here, to keep it all in-memory and fast. You can call these \"component tests\" or regard them as decoupled unit tests. I find this a very useful pattern by either name. As it sidesteps the implementation details, use of  route handlers / DI or not. So you're free to refactor under test.\n\nNo, they're not the _only_ kind of tests that we have - there are \"methods & mocks\" unit tests, and also tests that run after deploy to dev and use real databases and external services. But they are the bulk of tests, and it works well.\n\n> I’m struggling with how to handle this. If I push for a standard Service Layer or normal DI, I feel like the \"disruptor\" who goes against the team's coding styles . However, staying silent feels like I'm becoming complicit in building a codebase that’s increasingly hard to maintain.\n\nThis is a real dilemma, because both are correct. The only thing worse than code that uses an odd pattern and style that doesn't work that well, is code that uses it 50% of the time at random so you never know what you're getting today.\n\nHowever, I too would be thinking \"WTF is this and why?\"  A \"strict rule against service-to-service calls\" is bizarre and useless, and an interface with 1 method on it is exactly equivalent to a lambda / delegate / func, except in that it has a named type, which makes it easier for humans and DI containers to deal with.\n\nIt's _possible_ that they have some odd requirement that makes this pattern necessary, but I'd bet money that they don't, it's just just habit, misunderstanding and ignorance of common good practice.\n\nOr maybe you're working in a Functional Programming language such as F# where passing functions to functions is the \"Right way\". Or with an ex-Haskell dev? ;)",

Long story short, I did a lot \"fake it until you make it\" to work my way up because I sought more compensation for a more comfortable life, and better employability, staying ahead of the curve. Especially as remote positions became the norm.\n\nAnyway, I think I overextended by convincing myself (let alone others) that I wanted to be staff level. It's been a couple years now, so I've noticed what has and hasn't improved. I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but it's less about capability and more about enjoyment and consistency. When I first pursued the promotion I was aware of some of my shortcomings and thought I'd work through them. My social battery is small. If I'm real, my ability to act like the adult in the room is limited. I cannot pretend to care about my company anymore. Lots of these things feel like facets of my personality and not skills to develop (I know I can fake some of them, it just drains me).\n\nI can afford a cut. I just don't know what that does for my career prospects. I feel damned if I do, damned if I don't. Other companies have their own expectations of staff level, and I feel like my company's standards are lower, and my organization's specifically are lower still. So when I do apply to other positions, I'm often looking for senior positions since I can often find similar pay estimates and my qualifications line up better, but previous attempts fell through. Job searching is demoralizing so I'm back to trying to make it work better at my current employer.\n\nHow does it come off on a resume to go from staff to senior, especially at the same company? Or should I try to rewrite history and claim I was never staff in the first place? Do I own it and explain why I sought demotion? Or maybe do I just get over myself and press on?

          "text": "You sound exactly like where I was in 2022 and 2023, and I've been looking for an opportunity to tell this story here, so someone might find it helpful or insightful, so here you go.\n\nIn mid-2022, I applied to a company as a senior and did so well on the interview they offered me staff, which was a 5 year goal for me at the time, so I took it. For the first year, I stressed myself out feeling for the walls and trying to figure out what it meant to be a staff, even with tremendous support from my peers and people above me. I ended up in the same boat as you, often looking for previous advice in this very subreddit for whether or not I should try and down level myself because I missed the work of a senior crushing tickets. At the 18 month mark at the company, I asked my manager to down level.\n\nIt was the single biggest awakening and biggest regret of my career that I didn't feel for 2 years.\n\nMy manager was very kind and heard me out on my reasons and took it up a level to the VP of Engineering where I was told, effectively, I could do the job, or I could quit. In the moment I was bitter about it, but I decided to do the job. Six months later I received my first \"below meets\" on an evaluation, because I asked to down level, and that wasn't staff engineer level behavior.  \n\n\nNever the less, I persisted, and took that moment as an opportunity to let go of all imposter syndrome and stress, and decide that \"I am a staff engineer, therefore everything I do is the behavior of a staff engineer\" and made the role my own. It was getting told no by that VP that made everything click, and made me realize that I am a very effective player-coach in up-skilling engineers, teams, code bases, and projects around me that I interacted with and I needed to act like it.\n\nUnfortunately, after this finally clicked fully, the company was bought out and in early 2025 underwent a 300 person RIF that I was hit by, and to this day I suspect the \"below meets\" was the thing that put me on the chopping block.\n\nHalf a year later I joined a company as a senior engineer and found myself extremely bored because the work was so easy I could do it with my arms behind my back, and I was surrounded by engineers who didn't care about the effort of work I was putting in. I then found out that I had minimal room to get promoted back to staff, for reasons that are unimportant, so I left and realized that I needed to keep setting my sights higher, not lower. If I could go back, I would thank that VP for putting me in that position, because it unlocked what I needed in my brain at the time, but I suspect we'll never actually interface again.\n\nObviously do what makes the most amount of sense to you. If you want to do it, you just need to sell the narrative that \"I am an engineer who is looking for the right fit, and the title is less important than the work.\" If I was in your shoes, and I could do it all over again, I would get over myself and press on. You ended up in the staff role for a reason, and because the type of work is very different from that of a senior, you just need to figure out how to make it your own where you can, and not just the expectation.",

Most interviewers didn't ask, those who did I was honest and said I tried LEad, hated the 6=8 hours of meetings a day, and went back to what I enjoy, most smiled and said they understood.

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nAbout 17 years total experience, started off as a self-taught goofball writing scripts to make my job easier to working at big tech and startups, picking up my masters along the way.\n\nWhat really got me into tech/software was that I could solve a lot of business problems writing code and gain efficiencies. My love for it increased as I went back to school and worked with C and all its thorniness. I remember writing my own (shitty) web server for a class and load tested it on a potato computer, watching it serve tens of thousands of requests per second without fail. Or writing and managing my own (shitty) message broker.\n\nThen over time, a lot of things changed. You no longer write and host your own web servers; you have AWS for that. Okay, fine, I thought. There's still a lot of value in managing your provisioned resources, trying to figure out what your tech stack looks like, etc.\n\nA few years later, everything now is either server-less or otherwise managed. Why spin up your own Kafka running on ECS when you can just use MSK? Do you really want to manage your own message broker while AWS offers ManagedMQ now? Any time I need some sort of service to set up, my infrastructure guys would just be like, \"Yeah, let's just use this managed service instead.\"\n\n(On one hand, I get it. If managing a service ourselves takes up 10% of an engineer's time, then it might make sense to go with a managed service as your startup scales. On the other, it's a lot less fun and I have fewer opportunities to bolster my CV.)\n\nAt that point, my life was basically coming up with the architecture to manage distributed systems, but a lot of my day-to-day was relegated to writing CRUD APIs. And that was fine, too. You want me to pay me how much money to just write code that essentially delivers your request to a database and returns you some data? Sure!\n\nBut now with AI around, even writing CRUD is being supplanted (as much as people on this sub think otherwise, I've personally used it and it gets 80% there most of the time). And I'd be remiss if I didn't say that this has increased my anxiety and existential crisis. So my question to you all is, what now?\n\nI was thinking maybe moving into technical product management or maybe looking into the various \"forward deployed engineer\" roles where I can leverage my technical skills while doing work that is unlikely to be replaced by AI. But I think back to what made me so interested in software engineering in the first place and I want to see what else is out there. So far, I've played around with running my own LLMs, writing my own agents, etc. But even that essentially is CRUD with a wrapper around it. Not to mention that space moves so quickly that with a job and a child, it's very difficult to keep up.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts and ideas. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the thoughtful responses. I did read through all of them, but didn't reply to most. I appreciate the insights and thoughts here. Been a member for a bit of time and there's always something interesting going on.",

For these, yes, it is CRUD all the way down, and the extra layers put varying degrees of facade on top of the database and/or intermediate layers.\n\nThat accounts for most software jobs out there, because there is always a need to manage inventory, employees, billing and so on. There are other kinds of software that aren't just a fancy spreadsheet that talks to a database, which do things like control robots, drive video cards, edit movies, or play games. These still have a lot of CRUD, but their non-business focus allows for more variety. \n\nAbout the fanciest coding I've found in a business application is the algorithm to convert a pair of latitude/longitude points into a distance (by approximating Earth as a sphere). The fanciest I've ever had to create from scratch was a means to calculate \"overtime\" *before* the time is worked. So it isn't good enough to check whether there *is* overtime, but to check whether *this next shift* would go into overtime. Maybe that sounds simple to you, but overtime rules differ by business and by state. California goes into overtime after 8 hours in a day, and double time after 12, while most states just go into overtime after 40 hours in a week. And this particular application allowed for customized overtime rules. AND this check had to happen on the database side in a query, because reasons, so the algorithm had to go into SQLCLR (C#/SqlServer architecture). ",

      "text": "I'm an engineer with 5+ years of experience and I'm joining a new (small) company next week as a mid level engineer. From my friends that have worked or currently work at the company I understand that the culture is supposed to be very chill with a strong engineering leadership. To boot they are also completely WFH. It's a pay cut but on paper I feel like it's the right move for my mental health. However I feel like I can't stop looking at the news and my experienc from my last company is making me fearful of the future.\n\nI'm coming out of FAANG (the worst one, you know which one) and in just the last year I've experienced:\n\n1. My entire team (and manager) being forced out, fired, or quit due to toxic upper management. \n\n2.I was LITERALLY THE ONLY FUCKING PERSON LEFT THAT UNDERSTOOD OUR SERVICE. One of my previous managers was given the domain and I was responsible for onboarding them and the rest of the team. Oh and I had only started working on this service at the START OF THE FUCKING YEAR.\n\n3. I was basically on-call constantly for 6 months because no one else knew anything about the service. I was still responsible for delivering my normal workload in my sprints though.\n\n4. A round of layoffs. I survived but still I think the whole experience fucking shook me to my core.\n\n5. Last but not least, and y'all could have predicted this, they relentlessly shoved AI down our throats and monitored our usage to make sure we were using it every day. To be honest I like using AI for research and brain dead repetitive tasks and some debugging, but I really don't use it to write my code. However everyone else on my team was basically pressured into only using Claude to code. I think the only reason I got away with it was because I was one of the top engineers and I was so critical to the service we owned.\n\nDuring my interview my recruiter and the interviewers basically sounded like they all used AI in the same way I did, but now I've heard they all got CursorCode subscriptions this year. I think CC can be a great tool and I've used some agents to parallelize some of my work like running tests or debugging but I just don't want it to write my code. It feels like I'm one of the few people that got into this job because I actually liked the craft and honing it?\n\nI'm just (maybe irrationally) worried that I'm just moving from one bad situation to another, and it's because no matter the company or culture AI has now turned our work into a sweatshop with no ingenuity.\n\nI think I really just need to know if there are other engineers out there who work in a company that is sensible about their engineering and they aren't pressured like I see all over Reddit and YouTube and at my last company? That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?",

It also started happening to us.\n\nUntil few months ago using copilot and claude was optional if needed and I was using them whenever it was making sense. Recently, there are a lot of pressure on us to do any thing as much as possible with claude. Our managers are convinced it boosts productivity 5x to 10x and no one wants to be that person to tell them otherwise.\n\nI also has a deep understanding in our teams domain. I usually break a task into smaller parts, then write and verify each part very carefully. But the way they pressure us to use claude, I'm not sure if I can do engineering like before. Apparently I have no choice but give it a try.",

Most people don't dive right into learning how to use it effectively, they start by dabbling here and there. Using it for one situation or another.\n\nI am the anecdotal case where I tell you that for me personally it is into the 5-10x more productive. I have created one webpage and two complete applications, in the span of about 4-5 days. Work that would have taken me at least 1-2 weeks for each of those situations. \n\nMy friend, who has completely adopted it, created a course to learn the advanced uses and I went through that course and picked up many more useful practices that didn't immediately jump out at me while I was in dabbling mode. Now I have defined /agents, a code-reviewer, a test-writer. I have hooks to prevent initializing tools I don't want it to use (or that don't work in windows). I am working on building some /skills for repetitive tasks that come up each day.\n\nI have been a software engineer for the last 30 years and I don't want to type much anymore. I have become skilled at recognizing what is a useful unit of work to take on at one time. How to provide enough guidance per task.\n\nI don't open Claude and say build me and application that does X. I create a set of folders, place some empty interfaces and classes (the core), create the domain entities. Then I explain one unit of work using those classes and files, like build a crud service with tests. Review the work, commit it. Rinse repeat until you have the whole application.\n\nIt feels good seeing your idea materialize into a working application in one morning, while sipping some coffee and skimming reddit.\n\nThe result is not AI slop, it is a carefully crafted useful tool built by an expert programmer and his assistant. With code reviews, planning sessions, requirements. All the things I would have done by hand but instead guided by my hand.",

Centralizing power and control, creating dependence, for the sake of further centralization of power and control.  \n\nNothing to do with software development, per se, I just think this bears calling out.  The solution, I feel, is not to quash such progress, but to compensate for its negative externalities (polluting our world is another way in which industrial civilization steals and fails to compensate), and prevent the worst abuses.  And the main insight is to recognize that the instances of harm are continual, and therefore the redress of it all must likewise be continual.  A one-time payment to the descendants of slaves and natives does not fix the inherent problems of our society (though it would be a good thing).  What we really need is to recognize the permanence of the abuse, and put into place permanent and growing redress.  A UBI is an example of this, as would be things like carbon taxes, extraction taxes, land value taxes.  \n\nI'm off my soap box now.",

I'm one of two engineers for the whole company, we used to have three but are currently in a violent take over from an investor CEO who is cutting everywhere, so my job isn't secure anymore.\n\nThe original execs trusted us to do what we needed to do to build our internal tooling and support it so the business can operate.  They asked us about AI, one of the C levels loved to use it for work out advice and all sorts of random stuff.\n\nWe told them, it's basically a stack overflow replacement, great for boilerplate but ultimately is not a full on replacement for any real engineer.  We've slowly each, individually integrated it for our own selfs as we saw fit and shared things that worked.  \n\nOur UI guy I think got the most mileage out of it, for us in backend we used it for tests but really.. I mostly use it for looking up APIs and documentation, sometimes for creating unit tests boilerplate.\n\nI'm personally trying to learn more and more of it since everyone wants it and I'll probably lose my job in the next year.\n\nI'm even more of a dinosaur though, I can't stand editors other than VIM so I'll need a way to integrate AI without using a code editor myself, I ain't switching from VIM.\n\nI heard one of them, cursor or claude I forget, is basically like an AI terminal.  I'll try that route first.\n\nHaving AI actually write code seems kind of silly to me.  For UI I get it, at least our UI is a lot of.. redundant code (propagating properties through react components, same similar patterns to setup or create new react components).  There is redudency in backend but, it takes me a minute or two to just setup any boiler plate I need myself so AI doing it seems like a wash.\n\nAI has been EXTREMELY useful for things like, navigating AWS or Google UI consoles, generating or fixing errors in Docker and Docker compose files, configuration errors with different APIs we integrate, python dependency errors and basically as I said, a bunch of stuff i'd normally use Stack Overflow for.\n\nI tried VSCode + Copilot to implement a feature where we needed a celery task to pull data from a spreadhseet, make a call to a micro service we use to kick off a webscraper and write the webscraper function to pull the data from the site.  It.. kind copy pasted stuff to pull data from the sheet, but without context about what data was in the sheet or how to invoke our scraper, or what to do w/ the data from the scraper it was basically me writing the code but instead of writing code, I'm prompting the AI to write the code I would just.. write myself.  And it fucks up sometimes.  Basically pretty worthless for actual, local business logic.  \n\nPresumably I would craft a bunch of agents to like, look at the spreadsheet and determine from a header row I setup, what values are there and read the local python library we wrote to figure out how to read and write to the sheet and maybe access our microservice repository and automagically figure out how to make calls to it, run a browser to navigate to the site and generate XPath to use with selenium to find elements and navigate it appropriately.. but I would be spending weeks trying to figure out how to make all that happen.  I can just do it in minutes (hours including actually implementing the scraper and spreadsheet functionality).\n\nAnd of course, it's been basically worthless for debugging.  I get a bug report that a user is getting bad values in the system, a customer signs a contract indicating one thing but somehow it's stored incorrectly in the backend.  AI has no idea wtf is going on.  Since I know the entire system I can direct AI towards the problem areas and kind of baby it along it's reasoning but I'm still the one doing all the thinking anyways.  It's much easier for me to just run through and figure out stuff myself.   AI doesn't know the business logic, it just reads code, it doesn't understsand the product or how things are supposed to work, I do.  To leverage AI in this way, i'd need to spend all this time teaching the AI how everything is supposed to work and maybe.. it could at least figure out which code is relevant but it's a TON of context.  \n\nAI is basically just a suped up intellisense/autocomplete as far as I can tell and that's not really something I need when I have the whole programming AND product context in my head anyways myself.  As I said I'm a vim dinosaur so i don't even use intellisense for code completion or API information, I have most of it memorized by now.  When I do need to look things up I forget, like all the possible format options for formating a datetime string, AI is very helpful.  Again, it's just documentation stuff that i've found it useful for, not actually a junior engineer or anything.\n\nPeople say greenfield projects are where it excels, that makes sense to me.  Next time I need to setup a new service or build a new UI project I'll leverage AI and see how it goes, it's been helpful for things like that before.  Once you start having dependencies between different repositories and products/services and complicated business logic spanned across multiple systems.. it hasn't been very useful.",

          "text": "I survived a round of layoffs only to become lead developer on two projects that realistically require 40 hours a week each, but I am expected to do on a normal 40 hour schedule. It's basically unspoken that I should not charge more than 40 hours on my timecard, because A.) I won't get paid for it and B.) it will drain the funding from the contract. I work from about 7am to 7pm, and even on weekends sometimes (especially these past few months with the cold weather and getting snowed in.) \n\nSurviving the round of layoffs has me counting my blessings, but I also forgot what my career used to feel like. I think now if I went back to a \"normal\" workload, I'd be filled with anxiety that I'm not doing enough. \n\nMy coworker tells me what I describe is called \"remote work guilt\" where people who work remote feel guilty about not having to report into an office, and so they work extra, but honestly what I feel is far more than that. I support my wife and son, my wife who is very sick right now needs our health insurance. We're halfway through February and we've already met our yearly deductible. If I get hit by a car and taken out of their lives or something I'm positive she would die and my son's life would be ruined. The start of my career didn't have these life obligations hovering overhead, so I recognize that the \"good ol' days\" likely carry with it that level of mental freedom as well.\n\nDoes the job make me \"happy\"? I don't even know how I'd define happiness right now. I guess happiness for me is contentment, and contentment is the feeling that everything will be ok for who I love the most in this world.",

Similar frustrations - not FAANG-level but the same cultural drift toward process theater and mandating tools instead of trusting engineers to make good decisions.\n\n  \nThe sensible companies exist. They're just harder to find because they don't spend energy on employer branding - they're too busy actually building things.\n\n  \nSignals I've learned to look for:\n\n  \n1. How do they handle disagreements between engineering and product? Do engineers have real input on technical decisions or is it \"just build what we tell you\"? Ask this directly in interviews.\n\n  \n2. Does engineering leadership write code or at least understand the codebase? If the CTO hasn't opened a PR in 2 years, engineering decisions are being made by people disconnected from reality.\n\n  \n3. The AI mandate thing is a culture signal, not a technology signal. Good companies give you tools and let you figure out what works. Bad companies mandate tools and measure compliance. The companies forcing Copilot on everyone are usually the same ones that mandated Jira workflows and measured story points.\n\n  \nThe smaller company you're joining sounds like it could be the right move. WFH + strong engineering leadership + chill culture is basically the recipe. Give it a real shot before letting the industry anxiety pull you down.",

AI doesn't turn software engineering into a sweatshop, you have the terrible FAANG management you're working for to thank for that environment.  AI can actually reduce a lot of the toil of our job like you pointed out, there are several great use cases for that.  Ingenuity is still valuable and I would go so far as to say it is more valuable now than before.  Ingenuity is not something AI can do.  It cannot think outside the box beyond data it has been trained on.  It is not imaginative.  Humans still thoroughly dominate ingenuity and it will be what sets future companies apart from AI derivative outputs.\n\n\\> That even if it's slower there is still value into writing and crafting the code yourself and your leadership understands this?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. This is not ingenuity. Wanting to hand write code is nice, but being creative and clever inventing new solutions is not actually tied to handwriting code at all.  You can have AI write code and direct it toward ingenius designs and never handwrite code.  Handwriting code has limited and diminishing value. However, reading and reviewing code and genuine creativity thinking of new designs and approaches that haven't been done before, that has increasing value.",

Conversely there will be all sorts of things the original developers did well which are quietly working, possibly after much pain and multiple iterations by the original team, and the new team is likely to get a bunch of that stuff wrong.\n\nUsually from my experience this type of rewrite starts off well but then starts to run aground as people underestimate the difficulty of re-doing all the things which are just quietly working well in the thing being rewritten.\n\nI would probably stick to explaining why you did it like that and pointing out traps that the new team are about to fall into.  Things like 'We tried what you are about to try and it ended up this other way because of XYZ'.  Some of your problems may not apply to their work but sometimes you might save them a bunch of problems.",

It’s context gap. They see artifacts and tradeoffs, but not the constraints that forced those decisions. Deadlines, weird client requirements, legacy integrations, staffing limits. Without that history, everything looks like a mistake.\n\nLetting them fully repeat the cycle is tempting, but expensive. What’s worked better for me is reframing from “we already tried that” to “here were the constraints at the time.” Even better if you can quantify it. For example, “we tried X, it caused Y in production, and we rolled back because Z.” Concrete scars land better than abstract warnings.\n\nYou could also suggest short design review checkpoints with explicit risk callouts. Not to block them, but to surface assumptions. If they consciously choose to accept a risk after hearing prior context, that’s different from walking into it blind.\n\nStack loyalty is real, but usually the deeper issue is ownership. They need to feel accountable for the outcome. The trick is injecting history without undermining that ownership.\n\nAre they dismissing specifics you bring up, or is it more that they don’t ask about the backstory at all?",

      "text": "I am not saying this to be self-deprecating either…I genuinely am too dumb to do this. Basically I am a 2018 grad, and I’ve been working since then. I have a Computer Engineering degree (which I regret because I hate hardware; I really want a true “software job” and I’ve been applying all over and have been doing all sorts of prep, but I fear I’ve been pigeon-holed atp). I coasted by in my first job out of college because it was for a defense company and I had great rapport with my teammates in general and I was well-liked overall. So even if I messed up (which I did a lot), it was forgiven because I was young/cute and “new” and friends with everyone.\n\nI quit in 2024 and started my current job, and yeah…I have felt like I’m way in over my far way too many times. I feel like I literally fooled my manager into hiring me, and I can tell I annoy him a lot with my incompetence. My current role has me working as a mid-level Embedded Engineer, and while I am good at/enjoy debugging and fixing issues in our firmware (this is literally the ONLY technical thing I am good at), I struggle with everything else. I have been given a bunch of hardware-related tasks during my time here, and I’ve already literally fried/blown up so many different pieces of hardware. I’ve also shocked myself a few times while handling hardware because I didn’t know that electricity would be flowing through a certain part or something. For reference, the last time I took a circuits class or did anything related to circuits was in 2015. I did some reading on my own on circuits and electricity, but yeah…anything hardware-related is just not intuitive to me.\n\nMy manager had also asked me to implement certain functionalities in our code at different times, but I literally cannot complete these tasks without getting significant help. And I’ve been reprimanded for “taking too long” to finish things plenty of times, so now I’m afraid to ask for help too (I know it’s super counterintuitive, but my mindset is that if I ask for help now, he’ll start grilling me over what I’ve been doing the past day/hours, which obviously makes it worse). Even now, I’ve been working on figuring out this one issue with a product, but all day and yesterday I’ve been having hardware issues (ie shaky connections so I couldn’t always get the console to appear, which I don’t know how to fix,  etc.), so I couldn’t make actual progress on the issue itself. When my manager called me at the end of the day today to ask for status, I said that I’m “still working on it”, which he clearly wasn’t happy about. He set up a meeting between us for the first thing tomorrow morning to get more status on this issue, and now I’m freaking out because I literally have nothing to update him with. I just don’t know what I will say and I’m certain I’ll get reprimanded.\n\nSomehow I’ve gotten “Meets Expectations” at every performance review I’ve ever had throughout my career, but even at my most recent one, my manger told me that I’m on the “lower end of that” (I suspect he feels that I am “Below Expectations”, but didn’t want that on paper) because I’m too slow and that I don’t know how to optimize my time well enough. I also feel shame because I’m a woman as well and I’m proving the “stereotypes” that women can’t do tech.\n\nHow can I be a better engineer? Is it even possible at this point? I’m at year 8 in this field and I’m miserable. Also what can I say during this “status meeting” tomorrow? I just feel a lot of fear and shame and anxiety with my situation overall.",

In tech, I would say the single biggest thing that correlates with success is the willingness to expose ignorance. In my experience, it is also the single biggest thing that underrepresented people—especially women—are terrified of doing. The reason that women don't want to expose their ignorance in situations men would is that they have accumulated a lot of experience over a long period of time that [it is unsafe to do so](https://xkcd.com/385/).\n\nMake an appointment with your manager and say that you feel you are underperforming by your own standard, and you want to turn things around. Explain that you often feel like you lack context on certain things and you're afraid to ask for fear of how it will make you look, and this builds up and up on itself until you're in a hole. Explain that you feel with a little of the right kind of support, you can level up.\n\nYou should look for a mentor, and then ask your manager to officially recognize this mentor relationship. Your mentor should be the person you level with when you don't know something or don't know how to proceed, and they should be senior enough to have those answers and be willing and able to coach you. The emphasis here should be sometimes just giving you the information you need, and other times helping you get the information you need for yourself. Your mentor should be able to judge when sending you out to ask a certain question actually will make you look bad vs. when it's totally appropriate for you to not know something and be seeking information, and they can protect you in the former case and push you in the latter until you develop that sense for yourself. To make this work, obviously, the highest priority is to find someone to mentor you that will be able to do so without judgment. The point of looping your manager in is that the upside for your mentor is they will be building experience toward a management role someday themselves, and they should feel good about this extra responsibility.\n\nThis should also be a limited engagement. Ideally, you get a mentor for one or two perf cycles, and after that it degrades into an informal relationship where you can go and ask for advice from your former mentor just as you would anyone else (and you should be branching out at that point too).",

Mentoring junior and mid level engineers is part of the job description for a senior engineer so don't feel bad about it.\n\nUse chatgpt and your mentor to aggressively fill holes in your knowledge. People that accumulate knowledge gaps instead of filling them inevitably fail to have successful engineering careers. If you're afraid to ask a dumb question then ask it to Chatgpt (or Gemini / Claude) first. Then confirm with your mentor that the understanding you got is correct (yes, it's wrong sometimes and your mentor can also often provide additional context / perspective).\n\nAt 6 and 12 months do a self evaluation and compare this with your mentors evaluation of you. See if they have any advice on anything you should be doing differently. If after a year you still feel you're not enjoying embedded, that's ok it happens, you can then start applying for different jobs. But in your current situation it's too early to give up imo.",

If I can solve/fix something in 5 minutes, its because I have experienced it before and learned the approach of attack; which before probably would've taken me hours, days on my own. I have been using AI chat as a teacher/mentor instead of just having it replace my job. Prompts I ask are things like \"why\" or \"best practice\" versus \"give me\" or \"solve for me.\" My company even has a internal chat so I don't have to worry about exposing sensitive information to the WWW.\n\nI'd describe the role as an entirely different way of thinking, you are a painter and your 'understanding of whatever platform or environment' is the color palette which is the key to successfully painting (interacting) and resolving the issues at hand. A natural river should be blue, not red. Its just cause and effect problem solving, some having more steps then others to find the solution.\n\nThe key thing to my success is that I take excellent notes and can communicate/articulate it well. This worked for the first couple of months. Now moving from a help-desk sort of role to an actual engineer/production support role, or I guess people call it dev-ops, I have to now explore the platform and document the unknown on my own, which means when I have a problem I have never come across - I have to figure it out on my own, or in the least if I know what questions to ask to get me to the solution - someone else might know the answers.   \n  \nCall it the leash has come off. And my notes? They're being ingested by a AI agent to support people who are coming after me, people who don't have any experience using my company's platform and are able to get up to speed. The notes existing help troubleshoot future problems by being proof of previously completed work.\n\nTo be successful you have to want to be successful, and I totally get it - until you feel like you want to succeed you probably won't and will keep down spiraling. I recommend therapy to unpackage those feelings, and also channeling your free time to production/positivity for yourself, instead of doom scrolling, enlist in some free classes that can make you feel more confident, work on small hobby projects to break the anxiety you may have and become more confident with software programming instead of hardware management.",

I know from firsthand experience as I struggle with bouts of depression and self confidence issues.\n\nThe nice thing is you don't have to start at the hardest part of the cycle (work) to break it. There's a ton of more general life things you can do to boost your confidence and that will carry over to work in my experience. Exercise is number one. Doesn't matter what really but ideally get your heart rate up high regularly and do some sort of strengthening stuff. Eating decent, staying hydrated, avoiding drinking/drugs. Do fun/social stuff in your free time. Go outside, get some fresh air and sun. Practice mindfulness, I don't mean becoming a meditation master, just try to learn to take a few breaths and ground yourself in the present moment and the physical experience of life. \n\nThis all seems like a lot but really just making some sort of consistent effort at hitting some of those points regularly makes a massive difference in my confidence and general well-being, which absolutely reflects in my work performance.",

Most of your issues seem to steam from a bad workplace situation rather than you not being smart enough to be an engineer. Just your post is a sign that you are smart enough to be an engineer.\n\nIdeas to improve in your current situation:\n\n1) Focus on giving clear communication on the issues. Don't wait for someone to ask you about status. At the end of the day if you didn't make any progress post about it in the team chat. If an engineer working for me only responded with \"still working on it\" on a task that should of been done I would have to go out of my way to figure out where they are stuck and why. It saves both of us a lot of time to post a short status once or twice everyday (the timing depends on the cadence of the team) of just \"What you are working on, what you tried today, what you've fixed, and what problems you are having\". Make it a predictable update. If you get good at it you can actually space out some days and not actually work (not that I would ever do that ;) ). The important thing is the appearance of progress and work is often enough to give you enough space to work things out.\n\n2) Learn how to keep and manage a personal development notebook. I have one that's just a folder of organized markdown files mixed with diagrams, code snippets etc I've made. A lot of low performing engineers I've encountered struggle because they have a hard retaining and recalling information. Especially at a new job where there is just a lot of new terminology and things to keep track of. Just having a notebook and keeping regular notes helps. It also tells managers you are taking things seriously.\n\n3) Find something at work you actually like and learn it inside and out. Not something general like \"debugging\" and \"fixing bugs\". Take a piece of the system and actually dig into it. Write your findings down in your notebook.\n\n4) Read the work of \"high performing\" colleagues when you have downtime time.

Eventually it will click and the things that were hard will be easy, and they'll be replaced with a new batch of things to feel insecure about.\n\nI'd say the most difficult (and important) skill in writing software is to learn how to decompose a project down into small enough intermediate steps, that are each debuggable and move you in the direction of your eventual goal. Basically taking a difficult problem and turning it into a series (or a DAG) of small easy tasks.\n\nI am still learning how to do this, but it's the difference between being able to shit out a 100 line project that does the thing you want it to do and a 10k line project without really planning or architecting anything. If you do this, you'll find your code naturally gravitates towards some architectures depending on the problem, and you also start to get a feel for the \"friction\" when your code doesn't match the problem,\n\nThis is *not* an easy skill to learn. It is *not* taught or focused on. It is *absolutely necessary* if you wish to be a truly competent and independent engineer. That skill is the silent gatekeeper. If you're having this much trouble, it's because you're bouncing off against this hard wall. Which means you are absolutely capable of learning it, because you're cognizant of it, and can appreciate the enormity of it just upon observation.\n\nKeep at it, don't give up.

Usually mgmt/seniors get most frustrated with more junior folks who spend a lot of time going down rabbit holes instead of just asking earlier in the process.

Good places are getting to grips with this explicitly. Bad places will just get to the same bad destination they were always headed for, only quicker.\n\nThe default starting point: people should own every line of agentic code they’re submitting for review, in the same way that they would if they had written every line by hand.\n\nThe question is then when it’s OK to deviate from that. My take is that a major factor is how much the code and its embedding in the wider world is likely to change in the future, whether in itself or in what’s depending on it.\n\nSo if it’s a one shot prototype, or some closed end single purpose utility of limited scope, limited human scrutiny is way more justifiable than it is for code that’s going into, say, a continuously-developing library with dozens of continuously-developing applications using it.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that you can get a lot of value out of automated agentic review. Not just for bugs and documentation inconsistencies, but spotting duplication and high level conceptual mismatches. I think some degree of that should be applied even to the most one-shot, single-purpose, almost-certainly-non-evolving code, since the cost of doing it is so low.\n\nGood places will apply these kinds of principles and get a massive multiplier in throughout with no drop in average quality - possibly even an improvement in quality overall. Bad places will not, and will end up in a mess even more quickly than they did before.\n\nEither way, agentic coding and review is a multiplier, not some magic bullet that can substitute entirely for human judgement.",

We were (somewhere in-between) a startup/scaleup that was acquired by a much larger business, with the promise of new devs, investment, all the good stuff. They have followed through with much of this, but we have found that the developers who have moved over really just seem to dislike the way that we work and it is effecting everyone's job satisfaction.\n\nI like to think that we have been doing Agile 'properly', with genuine dev ownership of the features that they're working on, proper refinement, estimates based on real world velocity, all that stuff. Pretty high quality code and skilled devs too. When we saw how the new guys were used to working, being given long, detailed requirements and churning out code without any input, we assumed that they would be desperate to join in and get really involved in the product....but they straight up hate it. \n\nThey want to sit in a quiet room, and convert prewritten requirements into code, no questions asked. They weren't writing a lot of tests, and reviews were done begrudgingly with minimal effort. Very little discussion between devs about their work. Seems a hellish way to work to me, but each to their own. \n\nShould we even care? It feels like they are poisoning the well somewhat, it's pissing off the original developers, who feel like these new people are only doing half the job, but they do turn up and complete features. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice about cultural mismatches? Is this simply something that we're going to have to accept as we grow as a company?",

It can be a little frustrating - one side pushes for more defined requirements, the other side pushes for better quality and design, and each group is slightly puzzled by why the other does that.

This allowed us to match impossible timelines and make a lot of customers happy, but made it increasingly harder to onboard new people and the tech debt accumulated.\n\nTeams on the other end were on the opposite spectrum: Once some new version or technology is available, it's included and projects re-structured for it, everything was religiously kept up-to-date, lots of time spent in linter settings and whatnot. On the flip-side, features came out very slowly and often don't quite fulfill what the product needs.\n\nThere were attempts to somehow merge the solutions together and it always failed sooner or later. One side sees the other as snobs in an ivory tower who are so detached from the customers they don't see what creates actual business value. The opposite side sees them as inexperienced college students with no professionalism who need to be taught how to work properly.\n\nAt least in my team, coming from the \"gogogogo startup\", I definitely saw a need to change as way more people are now working in the code base and we have more protection from customers demanding everything yesterday. Also nudged things slowly into that direction to enforce tests and whatnot. But even when doing that, I could never quite shake the constant thought that ultimately, we need to deliver something to customers in a at least somewhat timely manner, and think about how to improve their experience instead of ours. So even when adjusting, it still clashed with the other culture, and they would start discussions about specific linter settings, how to name folders etc.. All things that I still view as a waste of time and will probably always. This will simply never work out unless one side gives in.\n\nSo imho: Either they exist in parallel or the people from the bought up company quit one after another.

          "text": "Cultural mismatches after a buyout are rough, especially when dev expectations are wildly different. The challenge is that you can’t really force people to value collaboration if they’re used to waterfall and heads-down coding. Trying to push them into the old startup culture too hard usually just creates more friction.\n\nA few things that can help: Start by surfacing and openly discussing the differences, why did your team value ownership? Why do the new folks value work in isolation? Sometimes there are legit reasons, like burnout from endless meetings or just being more introverted or neurodivergent. You might want to agree on some non-negotiables (like test standards and code reviews) but be flexible on things like how much product input is expected from everyone.  \n\nTry running mixed retros where both groups can share what’s working and what isn’t. This helps people feel heard and can surface compromises. Assigning pairings or small-group quests (not just for code, but for cross-team bonding) can break down some barriers, tools like QuestWorks in Slack do this without forcing video calls, which helps for camera-shy or introverted devs.\n\nFinally, measure outcomes, not just process. If people are delivering quality code on time but not engaging much, maybe that’s okay. But if quality drops or the team fractures, that’s when you tweak the approach. Basically, you probably won’t convert everyone, but you can try for some gradual blending, and make sure the original culture doesn’t get drowned out in the process.",

We get \\~80 page outs per week, not even joking. 99% of which are false alarms for a p90 latency spike for an http endpoint, or an unusually high IOPS for a DB. I've tried bringing this up, and everyone seems to agree its absolutely insane, but we MUST have these alarms, set by SRE. It seems absolutely ludicrous. If I don't wake up to answer the page within 5 min, and confirm that its just a false alarm it escalates. And they happen MULTIPLE times a night. We do have stories to work on them, but they are either 1. Not a priority at the moment, or 2. would require a major refactor in one of our backend API's, as there are a number of endpoints seeing the latency spikes. ",

      "text": "TL;DR: My company wants me to deliver what was scoped as a 3person backend project in the same timeframe, but alone using AI tools and I’m struggling.\n\nI work as a backend developer at a software company that builds turnkey applications for clients. Recently we signed a deal with a client for a finance app. The backend effort was originally planned as 3 devs over 3 months. The budget is agreed with the client, so that part is fine.\n\nBut my company is now insisting that I deliver the same work in the same time, completely on my own, with using ai. They’re very serious about it. I pushed back a lot at first, but given the market, I realized pushing too hard probably won’t help me, so I reluctantly accepted.\n\nI’m not new to ai tools I try to use them a lot which is probably why they picked me. But building a project from scratch like this with AI feels almost impossible. The app is a finance product that includes money transfers, and there are a lot of security and idempotency concerns I have to handle.\n\nI’m trying to keep the AI’s output in very small chunks and review everything, but I’m under huge time pressure. If I keep working like this, I’m sure it won’t be finished on time. When I try to go faster, I’m afraid I’ll end up with parts of the system where I don’t really understand what the AI produced and in a finance app, that feels risky.\n\nThis also made me wonder if this is what working as a developer is going to look like in the near futureconstantly being expected to do “3 people’s work” solo with AI. Maybe I’m just struggling, maybe others are doing it fine. If anyone here works like this, I’d really like to hear your advice.\n\nDo you think this is a temporary phase, or is this the new normal?",

Let's talk about what scope to cut for an MVP\"\n\nThe key IMO is not to accept the premise that a given scope can always be delivered in a given time just because someone's asked for it. More \"my professional advice is that this isn't workable\" than \"I personally won't do it\". Don't get sucked into mind games.\n\nI am personally stubborn enough to lose a job over this (this hasn't actually happened yet though, I've chosen most employers wisely i guess), but I suspect this advice might apply even if you're not. After all, the alternative is overpromising followed by failure, right? Or the small chance of producing something good enough by crunching 60h+ weeks, but have you actually seen that bear fruit on death marches (as opposed to those rare inspired passion projects)? Will it be worth it compared to standing your ground a bit while polishing your CV?\n\nFWIW I don't think this behaviour from certain organisations and managers is new, nor is it AI-specific.

If you have indempotency and other constraints it is easier to build a loop that produces near production ready code. \n\nYou must use tools like claude code, codex or opencode that operates over the whole source code, and a good agentic model, so you can feed it entire features, you already have a base and you can ask to generate the code that follows the same architecture/patterns as your current code. You might also have your handcoded segments that you absolutely want to preserve and your base.\n\nAI is particulary useful for financial code, if you have input <-> expected result and a sketch of the algorithm you want to use, it is easy to generate tests that verify precisely.\n\nTry to follow your usual workflow, design the databse, create the model, the controllers and the frontend for example, experiment with big tasks, subdivide in phases, use plan mode. use e2e tests to verify the application.\n\n\\--------------\n\nAt the end of the exercise you will have VERY FAST a large part of the application but buggy as hell, the reality is that you will need the same 3 months and the same 3 devs, one vibe coding and the other two doing qa and solving bugs. Since it is a new  process you might need  even more time since the bugs the AI generate are always very strange and hard to spot, and some code must be written manually.\n\nYou are working with experimental technology that is very imperfect, you should talk to your boss about the expectations and risks, and have two dev/test by monday, make it very clear that the testing cycle is non negotiable and longer than traditional development. If (when) the project fails it is because the manager didnt put enough resources, not because of you. \n\nIn my experience financial algorithms even with known input/output and enough samples should be made manually, you really need a wingman for this project, you will be fighting context rot and lobotomized models, you need a person dedicated to make sure the financial data is OK.  \n\\-----------\n\nIn conclusion you should give the AI a chance, use codex/claude (or kimi/minimax) + opencode, the project will most likely require MORE resources than a normal project, expected since it is an experiment and will take 2x the amount of testing.",

One group was encouraged to use AI tools, and the control group was not allowed to use them. They were given the same tasks.\n\nThe outcome was surprising for both sides of the argument. The team with the AI tools was able to deliver new features something like 30% faster. There was no difference between the two groups in code quality, or time to perform maintenance tasks.\n\nObviously, this result flies in the faces of any AI companies claiming 10x (or even 2x) velocities. On the other hand, it demonstrate value when the AI tool is guided by competent developers.\n\nThe real question is though, if 30% gains for new features are what we can realistically expect, are the costs of training and inference really justified?\n\nAnother impressive headline out there is that someone let 16 agents loose to build a new C compiler in two weeks. It did accomplish the goal, but if you read past the headlines the story is far more nuanced than the marketers and CEO’s would have you believe.\n\nThe agents were guided with a very heavy hand, and were allowed to use GCC and other existing test suites to validate the product. The agents needed almost constant guidance and correction by a human. The result, while technically a passing C compiler, produced far worse object code than even GCC with all optimizations disabled. The linker is also was buggy. There were also most likely hundreds or thousands of C compilers in its training data, so this wasn’t the same sort of task that most organizations are going to be asking it to do. Most companies build bespoke software when free software isn’t available, and COTS software is too expensive or doesn’t meet their needs, i.e. the example solution isn’t already in the training data.\n\nAnd they burned $20,000 USD worth of tokens. In two weeks. If you gave four CS grads $5,000 USD each and asked them to give you a C compiler in two weeks, they’d probably be able to build you a low quality C compiler.",

I found it was exhausting trying to review thousands of lines of code carefully over a sustained period of time. I think I was probably doing the work of 2-3 people, so I think it's possible to do it. Just keep the PRs as small as you can so that it's always clear what exactly you're trying to achieve. Once you start having larger PRs with thousands of lines of code, it becomes impossible to maintain quality control. I would recommend writing E2E tests and preferring it to unit tests, and don't try to make the tests comprehensive. It can become bloated and lose its effectiveness if you're just churning out giant test files. It's better to carefully plan what you think needs to be tested the most and make sure those areas are covered well. Another thing which I think can be very helpful, is to spend a good amount of time in the planning phase. If you can research and write up good technical documentation -- even if it takes days -- you can use those as living documents that you can load into new sessions, and have Claude Code keep them up to date. If you maintain a well-planned tech spec, it can easily generate Jira stories and tasks for you and save you a lot of administrative headache.",

And judgment doesn't scale 3x just because you have faster typing.\n\nTrust me - I'm at a licensed fintech company and have seen over the last 10 years many companies go bust because RBI comes knocking and asks you to just shutdown. When you're dealing with money, the accountability layer isn't optional. The parts you \"don't really understand\" become exactly the parts regulators or security audits find.\n\nWhat your company is betting on: AI writes code fast, so 1 person = 3 people.\n\nWhat they're missing: The bottleneck was never typing speed. It's understanding what you're building, catching the bugs before production, and being able to explain it when something goes wrong.\n\nThe uncomfortable answer: Document everything.

My question here is more related to whether you have been able to find a better fit elsewhere. For some context...  \n  \nI use plenty of AI, it's a great tool when used properly. But my company is pushing for heavy amounts of usage. I had my performance review where I started talking about the projects and what I had accomplished. My manager had little interest in that and we mostly talked about how I could create better prompts and use the tools more, as well as their success stories with what they've been doing with AI. \n\nHonestly I really like the company otherwise, and I've been there 3 years. But this has been frustrating and I am considering leaving. **If you've been in a similar situation, have you been able to find a better role?**   \n  \nI'm hoping to hear that some of you folks have made a jump to a team that has reasonable AI expectations.

Director has a real sense of what good product should look like, and what a healthy functioning team looks like.

Stop eating sugary sweets and junkfood. Get enough sleep. Take naps if needed.\n\nMedium: get the body moving. If you haven't exercised for a while it will do a ton of good if you can go for a walk after lunch, small bike ride, or just hit the gym for a 30-60 min strength workout 2-3 times a week. I was at my best when I woke up at 4 AM, went to the gym from 4.30 to 5.30 and then to work at 6.30.\n\nHarder to see: ensure you're not context switching too much. It's a productivity killer that's also linked to burnout, loss of motivation etc. I'm an architect on two different teams 50\\\\50 and I often feel exhausted and right now I'm dealing with loss of motivation. Even today I wake up to two different messages, before lunch I have had to jump between four different tasks and looked at PRs with two more. Afternoon I have to jump between huddles to help people with different things.. It takes it's toll. I've tried closing down all my notifications, list specific tasks I need to focus on, maintain focus on only one team, take regular breaks. Not sure if I just need to be harder on myself and enforce those boundaries even harder and not check messages so often.\n\nAnother thing for the dark winter (I'm from the Nordics); check that you're getting enough light exposure. I bought a bright light for my desk as I started to notice signs of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is more common in places that have long stretches of darkness and not enough sunlight.\n\nIf all else fails, seek professional help if it gets bad enough.",

Caffeine binds to those receptors and blocks actual adenosine from signaling them.\n\nCreatine works by allowing ADP to become ATP again and that also means less lactic acid.

Trying to get “everybody to actually agree on” what the real process is will NEVER happen, especially among opinionated developers who are very skilled at proposing alternatives and seeing pitfalls.   Management needs to assign leadership responsibility to somebody everybody respects.  That person says “These are the rules.  There may be debate, but these are still the rules until I say otherwise.   Your job depends upon helping us implement these rules, not arguing their suitability”.\n\nThat is hard.   Software people always want autonomy and “circles of talent” that work independently.   And for 90% of the time that’s appropriate.  So whoever does the leadership needs to know the difference between rules and directives that MUST be followed and must know how to allow people to have self-leading teams as well.  It’s not easy.   But if management does not INSIST on having such leadership in a software organization, they don’t know what they’re doing.",

The \"why\" behind how things work is what's missing, and that's way harder to reconstruct than the \"what.\"  \n\n\nA few things that actually moved the needle for us:  \n**1. Stop trying to document everything at once.** Pick the 3-5 processes that come up most in audits/customer questions and start there. Boiling the ocean is how documentation initiatives die.  \n**2. Record the explanations you're already giving.** Next time someone asks \"how does X work?\" and you find yourself explaining it, write that down immediately after. You just produced documentation in the most natural way possible - when context was fresh and the audience question shaped your answer. Way better than sitting down to \"write docs\" in a vacuum.  \n**3. Make someone own the narrative, not just the system.** The reason you get inconsistent answers is nobody owns the *story* of how things fit together. Individual owners know their piece. You need someone (maybe you, maybe a senior IC) who can explain the whole picture - and whose job includes keeping that explanation consistent.  \n**4. Use the \"new hire test\" ruthlessly.** Before any process is considered documented, a new person should be able to execute it from the docs alone. If they can't, the doc is incomplete - no matter how thorough it looks.  \n\n\nThe fragility you're feeling is real. The good news is an audit forcing function is actually a gift - most teams don't confront this until someone critical leaves and takes all the context with them.",

      "text": "So far, I've only worked at two companies full time, and both have had this culture of motivation through fear. Specifically feedback and guidance wise, I feel like it's been very much  \n  \n\"If you don't do this, this negative thing will happen to you.\"\n\n\"You are being compared to others.\"\n\nas opposed to:\n\n\"You have done amazing things, and these are the ways we are excited to see you grow.\"\n\nI know the truth must be that not every company environment is like this. At the same time, I've heard comments from other devs akin to \"grass is not necessarily greener.\" \"We are struggling here too.\" \"Every company has its shit.\"\n\nIn an ideal story book world, I'd love to work on a team and in an environment that's like the second scenario. I know it's out there because I hear about. In the companies I worked for, I've recognized that the times when my peers give positive or compassionate feedback, it inspires me a lot more. It makes me want to voluntarily do more work because it feels like there is a reward there, and something to move towards rather than some thing to run away from. The problem is a lot of times these kind of companies don't hire much/are competitive because - there is no attrition! Who would want to leave environments like that? \n\nSo I feel like that day may not happen immediately and in the meantime, I have to figure out how to embrace this suck. I'm no stranger to it, I've dealt with motivation by fear since childhood so I know how to survive, but I know it has also damaged my mental health in ways that I'm fighting to recover every day. I think I'm kinda exhausted and I want to choose not to deal with that kind of environment anymore...\n\nDo y'all have any advice on what you do when you are in environments like this? Considering \"get out\" is not a straight-forward option, of course. I'm now switching companies for the 3rd time, and from what I've heard, I might get what I want at this company. But I don't want to have any deluded expectations and want to keep cultivate my strengths in dealing with the suck, in a way that doesn't affect my mental health at least.",

It's also not great to bad mouth your employer so you will need to read between the lines. They may hesitate to tell you they work 996, but if you ask when the last time they took a vacation was, it can reveal a lot. ",
