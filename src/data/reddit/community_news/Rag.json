      "text": "I kept seeing recommendations that sentence chunking is best for RAG because it \"respects grammatical boundaries.\"\n\nDecided to test it systematically: 4 strategies, 2 datasets, 1,200 retrieval evaluations.\n\nWriteup with methodology and open source code: [Link](https://theprincipledengineer.substack.com/p/its-a-chunking-lie?r=2ivi0a)\n\n**Sentence chunking did dominate initially — 96.7% recall vs 80-83% for others.**\n\nThen I noticed something most benchmarks don't report: actual chunk sizes produced.\n\nWhen I configured all strategies with chunk\\_size=1024:\n\n\\- Token: 934 chars (0.91x)\n\n\\- Recursive: 667 chars (0.65x)\n\n\\- Semantic: 1117 chars (1.09x)\n\n\\- Sentence: 3677 chars (3.59x) ←\n\nSentence chunking was producing chunks 3.6x larger than requested. Larger chunks = more context = better recall. That's a size effect, not a strategy effect.\n\n**When I controlled for actual chunk size (\\~3000 chars across strategies), token chunking matched or beat sentence chunking.**\n\n**Correlation between chunk size and recall: r=0.74 (HotpotQA), r=0.92 (Natural Questions).**\n\nCurious if others have seen similar results or if this breaks down on different datasets.",

This is very important for onboarding DB developers.\n\nNot to blow my own horn but I have a book called “Vector Databases” from OReilly coming out in a few months - available on Amazon.\n\nIf you want to read parts of it for free - sign up for the OReilly Platform - it’s free for 7 days.\n\nThe first chapter deals with these issues.

In practice it feels like I’m rebuilding features that Weaviate already has (BM25 + hybrid + graph/relations).\n\nQdrant can be faster, but for me the difference like 25ms vs 35ms doesn’t really matter. Native support for everything I need matters more, so the next step will be migrating to Weaviate and testing it in real use.\n\nAt the same time I will keep FAISS as a nice option for people who want to run the project quickly without setting up a container and configuring Weaviate.\n\nSo Weaviate — **if someone thinks this is a mistake, please let me know** 🙂",

You can deploy your fine-tuned model anywhere: transformers, LangChain, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp etc.\n\nFine-tuning embedding models can improve retrieval & RAG by aligning vectors to your domain-specific notion of similarity, improving search, clustering, and recommendations on your data.\n\nWe provided many free notebooks with 3 main use-cases to utilize. \n\n* Try the [EmbeddingGemma notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/EmbeddingGemma_(300M).ipynb) in a free Colab T4 instance\n* We support ModernBERT, Qwen Embedding, Embedding Gemma, MiniLM-L6-v2, mpnet, BGE and all other models are supported automatically!\n\n⭐ Guide + notebooks: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/new/embedding-finetuning](https://unsloth.ai/docs/new/embedding-finetuning)\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)\n\nThanks so much guys! :)\n\n",

      "text": "Hey :)\n\nSome time ago I wanted to learn the fundamentals of RAG, and I started with chunking. Greg Kamradt’s tool ([https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)) helped me understand the basics, and it was a great starting point.\n\nWhile digging deeper, especially when reading papers like [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997), I noticed that **semantic** and **agentic** chunking are showing up more often and are getting adopted in new research. But I couldn’t find any visualizers that supported those methods, so I tried to build one myself.\n\nI put together **Chunking-Vis**, a small web tool for anyone who wants to explore and learn how different chunking strategies behave. I think it can be especially helpful if you’re new to RAG and want to see how chunks are formed before they’re sent to an embedding model or retrieval pipeline.\n\n# What Chunking-Vis supports\n\n* Character-level chunking\n* Word-level chunking\n* Token-level chunking (GPT-4o tokenizer)\n* Recursive chunking\n* Semantic chunking\n* Agentic chunking (Phi-3 powered, available locally on CPU)\n\nThere’s also a **Snapshot** feature that lets you save and compare different chunking configurations side-by-side, which can make experimentation easier.\n\n# Live Demo\n\n[https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app](https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app)  \n(Agentic chunking is disabled in the demo due to compute limits.)\n\n# Github Repository\n\n[https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis](https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis)\n\nHope some of you find it useful — and if you have ideas, feedback, or suggestions, please let me know.

The user uploads documents in a live chat session and wants to interact with them immediately, correct?\n\nThis rules out time intensive approaches like embeddings or generating summaries or metadata with LLMs.\n\nThere are a few things that could work:\n\nGive the agent a search tool that is based on BM25. Create page chunks from the data (usually a good semantic boundary too), index it into open search or elastic search and let the agent search the index. This is fast and context efficient.\n\nOn top of that, you could add the first one or two pages of each file to the context window of the agent. Usually, the first pages give an indication of what a doc is about. With that knowledge, the agent could make targeted searches inside a specific doc by using a filter with the search queries.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could use the file system based approach that coding agents like Claude code use. Give the agent tools to grep through the files and to read slices of the document. You don’t have to use an actual file system, it could just be simulated with tools. The agent will grep and slice through the docs to answer questions. RLM is an advanced version of this approach: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24601v1",

On ingestion, I generate a thin semantic layer, section summaries, key entities, numbers, obligations, relationships. That layer is small, fast, and always available to the agent. The heavy JSON stays out of the loop unless the agent explicitly needs to verify something.\nTrying to RAG directly over deeply nested extracted data is usually a dead end. It’s slow, and the signal to noise ratio is awful. Hierarchical retrieval helps a lot, first decide where to look, then pull only that slice, then answr. Latency stays low because most questions never touch the raw data.\n\nFor financial or forms heavy docs, I often skip RAG entirely and just query normalized fields. It’s boring, but it’s correct. RAG is great for “explain” questions, terrible for “calculate” ones.\n\nI’m building something in this space too, and the big unlock was treating documents like evolving knowledge objects, not blobs you fetch.

In a document with 300 pages, any given query could require a fraction (maybe 10 - 20 pages) for a suitable answer. Could a better approach be to do the search (fast) first and extraction (slow) later - especially after the user is happy to confirm the context? Well, I hope so because this is what I'm building with [ragextract.com](http://ragextract.com) !\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. RAG would work as a way to try narrow the search space for the user query but for financial data, it's unlikely to be sufficient on its own. You'll still need to post-process the pages for accuracy - though you may sometime get away with just winging it with vision models.  \n2. Multimodal RAG works incredibly well if documents don't share a standardised layout ie different statements from different bank. You'd also might want to look at a more optimised retrieval system for pages.  \n3. In practical terms, not that I can think of. Search-first-parse-later is an alternative RAG approach I think is worth exploring in this scenario.  \n4. Best practices for large documents? You probably already know this but go (1) big, (2) async and (3) distributed!",

One issue I saw is that most implementations relies on language dependent solutions for FT search.\n\nApproaches I've seen discussed:\n\n·         Per-language BM25 indexes: Detect language, route to the right index with proper stemmer. Seems correct but adds complexity. How do you handle bilingual documents?\n\n·         Language-agnostic tokenization: Skip stemming, just split on whitespace. Loses morphological matching but works across languages.\n\n·         BGE-M3 sparse vectors: Supposedly handles 100+ languages natively for both dense and sparse. But does it require GPU? What's the cost/perf tradeoff vs traditional BM25?\n\n·         Translate everything to English: Normalize the knowledge base. Feels wrong for legal where original wording matters and adds a translation failure mode.\n\n·         Dense-only + reranker : Skip BM25 entirely, use strong multilingual embeddings (BGE-M3, multilingual-e5) and rerank. Loses exact keyword matching.\n\n·         Qdrant's native BM25 : Qdrant now has built-in BM25 with language configs. Anyone using this for multilingual? How does it compare to dedicated solutions?\n\n \n\nWe’d rather use managed services when available in the cloud provider we chose (scaleway).\n\nOur constraints:\n\n* Managed PostgreSQL for app data : only supports pgvector, not pg\\_search/ParadeDB. Would require to self-host a postgres for additional extensions.\n* Prefer simplicity: Leaning toward Qdrant over Milvus since it seems easier to operate.\n* Cost-conscious: GPU-heavy solutions for embeddings are a concern.\n* Multi-tenant: Each tenant's documents are typically in one consistent language, but not always.\n\nAnyone would like to share their experience or thoughts on this challenge?  \n",

So I’d just accept that and let **multilingual embeddings handle cross-lang**, and use BM25 for the “same language, exact wording” wins (which matters a ton in legal).\n\nAlso bilingual docs: don’t route by *document* language, route by **chunk**. Chunk it, detect lang per chunk, store `chunk_lang`. Then BM25 mostly hits same-lang chunks, dense can still pull cross-lang if needed.\n\nRe: translate everything to English… yeah no thx for legal. If you ever need translation, do it only as a *query expansion* (translate the query to a couple langs) not the whole corpus.\n\nGiven your Scaleway constraints, honestly **OpenSearch** for the text side is a pretty sane pick. Qdrant BM25 is nice but once you want analyzers/highlighting/etc you’ll end up in search-engine land anyway.\n\nKeep rerank small (top 20–50) and do embeddings async on ingestion so you’re not “GPU all day” 🔥.",

You’re sort of freezing assumptions that may not match what people will ask later.\n\nBut it’s very use-case dependent. For code, I honestly think a dependency graph is pretty much **non-optional**. Calls/imports/inheritance aren’t opinions — they’re real structure. Without graph expansion you often end up with random snippets, and vanilla RAG struggles badly with questions like “where does this start?” or “what does this change affect?”, because you’re missing the whole call chain.",

That thread, along with related discussions, helped isolate the issue to what seems like a missing graph category.\n\nInteresting to see this resurfacing now. I’ve just published a timestamped preprint defining a *Deterministic Domain Graph (DDG)* category:  \n[https://zenodo.org/records/18373053](https://zenodo.org/records/18373053)\n\nI’m currently working on a framework to construct DDGs in practice, and early experiments suggest this is feasible even for large real-world codebases.",

I’m trying to keep the *edges* deterministic + auditable (calls/imports/inheritance, ReadsFrom/WritesTo, FKs etc.), and I’m really trying to avoid freezing “LLM-guessed” relations during ingestion.\n\nI kind of treat vectors as *ranking / fuzzy recall*, but the graph as the closed-world structure that should rebuild the same way every time. For example I force stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and I also add missing TABLE nodes so the SQL graph is actually closed (nodes + edges), not half implicit.\n\nOne thing I’d highlight though: **heuristics ≠ inference**. I’m fine with fixed, testable heuristics (like inline SQL detection) — even if it’s not perfect, it’s still deterministic and you can regression-test it. What I’m trying to avoid is context-dependent enrichment that changes depending on the model/prompt or whatever the “best guess” is this week.\n\nIf you’re curious, this repo is just the **indexing part** (Roslyn/.NET side). The actual RAG pipeline / retrieval is in a separate project:  \n[https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer)\n\nAlso curious how you want to handle schema evolution / versioning for DDGs on big real repos — do you version the domain spec per build, kind of like a compiler?",

Will dive into it right away.\n\nu/RolandRu, super appreciate you sharing your setup and the RoslynIndexer repo! Exactly aligns with what I've been thinking: keep the graph as closed-world, deterministic structure (hard facts like calls/imports/inheritance/ReadsFrom/WritesTo/FKs), and treat vectors as fuzzy recall/ranking. Love the emphasis on heuristics (fixed, testable, regression-friendly) vs. context-dependent LLM guesses—that's the brittleness killer.Your approach to forcing stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and adding missing nodes for closed structure is smart—avoids the \"half implicit\" mess. Curious on a couple things:\n\n\\* How do you handle schema evolution/versioning in big repos? Per-build domain spec like a compiler, or something else?\n\n\\* Have you seen measurable wins on those chain-tracing queries (e.g., impact analysis) vs. vanilla RAG?\n\n\\* Any thoughts on hybrid with dynamic rebuilds for evolving code, or is pure deterministic the way?\n\nThis ties perfectly into what I'm exploring next: code itself as frozen presuppositions/dependencies, and debug as closing the gap to reality. If you're open, I'd love to reference/link your repo/preprint in upcoming posts (with credit, of course).\n\nThanks again—threads like this are why I love posting here!",

Maybe another step would be to create detailed skill or rule for agent how to use this graph, because for LLM it is just graph, it doesn't know what to do with it and still reads the files to context for it's tasks.\nAs for me even better results was when I wrote spring documentation MCP, then even weak models become stronger.\n\nAnother though, you don't need to support All frameworks, java specific would be enough for commercial product, just choose this niche and keep going, enterprise clients will pay for it.\n\nFor patterns you need to ask LLM to write breaf reviews for graph chains, it could cost 20-100$, depending on repo and model. Also write custom wights algorithms, but it's rather doubtful, because it could work great for 1 project and can harm for another.\nI was participating in similar project for Cobol, and can say you are in the right direction and have similar problems ☺️",

I don't use standard graph databases anymore. I created a new type of graph database that can store the AST as well as the extracted rules together in one unified format. This helps the inference engine navigate back and forth between code and rules easily. It even helps with abstraction patterns. \n\n\nFor me the atomic unit is a prototype. And a graph of prototypes is called a prototype graph.\n\n\nThen instead of using extractors, I created a general object to graph framework with circular dependency detection and resolution. That lets me call ToPrototype on any object and have it serialized to a prototype graph which can be stored inside the graph database along with the rules. \n\n\nOne of the cool things of this approach is that the inference in learning engines can utilize graphs that contain natural language or code or data all in the same graph structure.",

Basically lets you do document search and context retrieval entirely offline, no cloud APIs required by default.\n\nIt uses local embeddings so you don't have to pay OpenAI or Cohere, and it's built on this fast storage engine that does O(1) lookups. Performance seems decent - about 5x faster than what I was getting with cloud alternatives when I tested it.\n\nCompared to cloud services like Pinecone that charge $70-200/month, this is completely free. Plus you get better speed since everything runs locally and your data never leaves your machine. + no cloud cost \n\nThe main issue I was trying to solve is that if you want privacy with your RAG setup, you usually end up with something slow or complicated. This keeps everything local but still performs pretty well.\n\nWould people actually use something like this? I feel like most RAG tutorials just assume you'll use Pinecone + OpenAI, but maybe there's demand for a local option that doesn't suck.\n\nDownsides: local embeddings aren't as good as the latest OpenAI models, and it depends on your hardware. But no monthly bills and your data stays private.\n\nWhat do you think - overkill or actually useful? Have you run into the privacy vs performance trade-off with RAG?",

My main concern is the ingestion/chunking process (garbage in, garbage out).\n\nLooking at OCR results I can see that a paragraph may have 1 line that lands on the next page, or that a bullet list goes across 2 pages or that structurally few headings are used.\n\nFor no good reason semantic chunking has stood out as something that makes logical sense as I just want chunks that in isolation make sense, and hopefully side-step the need for overlap etc. \n\nOne downside to this I can imagine however is that a chunk can be semantically complete, but could otherwise refer to an exception clause. Without both you could end up with poor context to feed an LLM when answering a user query.\n\n  \nSo back to the original question, for the stated use case does anyone have a pattern they would use here?",

It’s full of hardcoded regex and logic that only works for that specific vendor's layout. It won't scale.\n​My Questions\n\n1. ​Scalability: I see people talking about RAG for 100k+ documents. How? If I'm struggling with 15 docs of 30 pages each, what am I missing?\n\n2. ​Generalization: How do you handle table extraction and RAG context without writing custom logic for every new PDF layout?\n\n3. ​Local Vision: Is there a trick to getting local VLMs to handle 30-page PDFs without taking an eternity, or should I be chunking images differently?\n\n​I want a generic pipeline, not a collection of 15 different scripts.

Most people are able to scale and generalize because they compromise somewhere like not using local models or maintaining a bank of scripts. That said it can be done.\n\nIf you really want to do this right and keep it local the first thing you need to be doing is tagging the document. Otherwise known as image pre-processing + layout detection. Before you even parse anything use a vision model to draw boxes. At a high level those boxes should be table, useful prose, useless legalese. Once you have that you can 1 cut the crap and 2 use the right tool for each job. \n\nNow you have categorized sections of pdf. The tables go through a model designed to interpret tables. Can be a slow local llama or a more standard table tuned OCR. The point is it is something that doesn't screw up tables and doesn't care about prose. Then the regular valuable prose can go through something designed for it. Each piece has a tool appropriately powered and designed for it. \n\nMake sure you track provenance because you decomposed: so which page which document etc. Now you have reasonably parsed data structured in a way that is useable for downstream processes. There is no something for nothing. To get what you want you need to first understand the layout then use the right tool for the job. There are pre-existing tools out there if you don't care about the useful vs useless prose filtering before OCR. \n\nHigh-level: You need to decompose with layout detection.",

          "text": "The regex nightmare you're describing is exactly what happens when you try to solve parsing problems at the wrong layer. You're fighting symptoms instead of fixing the root cause.\n\nYour core issue isn't the AI generating document-specific code. It's that your parsing pipeline is already broken before the AI even sees it. When Docling and Marker mangle those tables, you're asking your models to extract structured data from garbage. Even perfect extraction logic can't fix information that was lost during parsing.\n\nHere's what you need to test: grab one of those 30-page contracts and run it through your current pipeline. Look at the actual markdown output. I guarantee you'll find tables split across chunks, headers separated from their content, and rate information scattered in ways that make context impossible to maintain.\n\nThe scalability problem you're seeing isn't about document volume. It's about data quality. Teams processing 100k+ documents have solved the parsing layer first. They're not debugging extraction failures because their documents come out clean from the start.\n\nFor your contract processing, try switching to a table-aware chunking strategy that keeps related pricing information together. Standard recursive chunking will slice right through your rate tables. You also need to preserve document structure so the RAG system knows which rates belong to which services.\n\nI've been building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_i) specifically for this kind of pipeline configuration problem. Instead of writing custom scripts for each layout, you configure the entire processing pipeline through conversation and see exactly what your documents look like after each transformation.\n\nWhat does your parsed output actually look like right now? Can you spot where the context is getting lost?",

Was there a test/validation split with the dataset?\n\nFor hardware testing and comparison, the laptop vs gpt-5 is an interesting comparison. Network latency will be a factor as well as thinking level. So a good test might be to test the NLI over the network, even if on a cloudflare tunnel to simulate cloud. Also test thinking/non-thinking variants of smaller cloud models. This way you can see where the cutoff in performance is. E.g., Can gpt-4o-mini perform just as well as gpt-5 on the dataset? And/Or maybe another cloud hallucination detector?\n\nThis might help ground the comparison and highlight the true benefits against systems people are already using.",
