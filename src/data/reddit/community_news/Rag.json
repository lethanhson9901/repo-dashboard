Tables, references, nested sections all get scrambled during ingestion, and you won't discover this until retrieval returns garbage.\n\nLlamaIndex and Haystack handle orchestration well enough, but they won't fix upstream problems. If your parsing mangles a critical study methodology or splits dosage information across chunks, no amount of sophisticated retrieval will recover that context. You need visibility into what your documents actually look like after processing.\n\nR2R has decent observability features, which helps with debugging retrieval issues. But the real problems usually trace back to chunking strategy and how you're handling document structure. Medical papers aren't just text blocks. They have hierarchies, cross-references, and metadata that needs to survive the processing pipeline.\n\nI've been building vectorflow.dev to tackle exactly this visibility problem, letting teams preview their processed documents before committing to a pipeline configuration. For your use case, I'd focus on getting document processing right first, then layer whichever orchestration framework fits your infrastructure constraints.\n\nWhat does your medical literature look like? PDFs with complex formatting, or cleaner structured documents?",

LlamaIndex abstracts a lot which is nice, but R2R gives you more flexibility for custom retrieval logic.\n\nFor medical literature though, retrieval quality matters way more than framework choice. We had Lexis Solutions set up a system with Voyage embeddings and proper chunking strategies that actually understood medical context instead of just semantic similarity. Made a huge difference in precision for our healthcare client. If you're doing production insurance stuff, getting the embedding model and chunk strategy right is probably more important than which framework you pick.",

I tried tools like Docling, which worked okay to parse the data, but were too slow for my use case, and tended to flatten the hierarchy. Everything ended up on the same level, which killed context for citations and retrieval.\n\nI needed something which could track deep nesting like this:\n\n* \\# Article II THE MERGER\n* \\## 2.7 Effect on Capital Stock  \n* \\### (b) Statutory Rights of Appraisal  \n* \\#### (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary…\n\nAfter a bunch of tweaking, I ended up writing my own parsing + chunking logic that:\n\n* Traverses the document hierarchy tree and attaches the complete heading path to every chunk (so you can feed the full path to the LLM for precise citations)\n* Links chunks by chunk\\_id and parent\\_chunk\\_id — at inference time you can easily pull parent chunks or siblings for extra context\n* Only splits on structural boundaries, so each chunk is semantically clean and there are basically 0 mid-sentence cuts\n\nIt worked really well for my project, so I wrapped it in a small frontend and published it as DocSlicer.\n\nTry it here: [https://www.docslicer.ai/](https://www.docslicer.ai/)\n\nJust drop in a PDF or URL, no sign-up needed. Export to json or parquet.\n\nIt's still early and I'm actively improving it, but it already works nicely for long financial or legal docs. Would love to hear real feedback.\n\nHappy to chat in the comments or DMs!",

What would be interesting is a hybrid approach where the 'category/metadata' for each 'chunk' is still linked (by relational DB field) to the chunk, but where the 'category/metadata' has IT'S OWN vector generated. So this means would be like having two semantic searches. First you identify things matching the high level category, and then once you narrow down you do semantic search on just the chunks (that don't have the metadata, or the duplicate lines at the start)\n\nI haven't yet done RAG myself, so I may be missing something.",

      "text": "Hey :)\n\nSome time ago I wanted to learn the fundamentals of RAG, and I started with chunking. Greg Kamradt’s tool ([https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)) helped me understand the basics, and it was a great starting point.\n\nWhile digging deeper, especially when reading papers like [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997), I noticed that **semantic** and **agentic** chunking are showing up more often and are getting adopted in new research. But I couldn’t find any visualizers that supported those methods, so I tried to build one myself.\n\nI put together **Chunking-Vis**, a small web tool for anyone who wants to explore and learn how different chunking strategies behave. I think it can be especially helpful if you’re new to RAG and want to see how chunks are formed before they’re sent to an embedding model or retrieval pipeline.\n\n# What Chunking-Vis supports\n\n* Character-level chunking\n* Word-level chunking\n* Token-level chunking (GPT-4o tokenizer)\n* Recursive chunking\n* Semantic chunking\n* Agentic chunking (Phi-3 powered, available locally on CPU)\n\nThere’s also a **Snapshot** feature that lets you save and compare different chunking configurations side-by-side, which can make experimentation easier.\n\n# Live Demo\n\n[https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app](https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app)  \n(Agentic chunking is disabled in the demo due to compute limits.)\n\n# Github Repository\n\n[https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis](https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis)\n\nHope some of you find it useful — and if you have ideas, feedback, or suggestions, please let me know.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m building an AI-assisted search feature for an early-stage legal-tech platform and I’m looking for recommendations for cheaper alternatives to Elasticsearch that still work well for hybrid search use cases.\n\n# The challenge\n\nWe’re not doing traditional full-text search only. The system needs to support:\n\n* Keyword search\n* Vector similarity search (embeddings)\n* Filtering on metadata (jurisdiction, document type, status, etc.)\n* Reasonable relevance out of the box (I’d rather not hand-roll ranking logic)\n\nThe content itself is mostly static (guides and reference documents), and traffic is currently low since this is still early days  - but the search quality matters because it feeds into an LLM for AI-assisted answers.\n\n# What we’ve implemented so far\n\n* Elasticsearch as the search layer\n* Hybrid search (keyword + vector)\n* Semantic-style retrieval for RAG workflows\n* Minimal custom scoring or tuning - mostly relying on built-in capabilities\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Elasticsearch works well. From a **cost perspective**, it feels hard to justify right now.\n\n# The problem\n\nEven at low usage, the baseline pricing and add-ons start to add up quickly. I’m trying to keep infrastructure spend sensible until there’s clearer traction, without completely downgrading search quality.\n\n# What I’m hoping to find\n\n* A more startup-friendly alternative to Elasticsearch\n* Supports keyword + vector search (or a realistic hybrid approach)\n* Can handle filters and structured metadata cleanly\n* Prefer managed or low-ops solutions\n* Not looking to fully custom-build a search engine unless there’s a strong reason\n\nIf you’ve built something similar (hybrid search feeding LLMs) and had to balance cost vs relevance, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Some highlights from related threads:\n- Determinism & reproducibility as key to relational DB win (echoing why Graph DBs struggled).\n- Real prod experiences: keep graphs deterministic/auditable (e.g., calls/imports/FKs), avoid LLM-guessed edges clutter.\n- Links shared: [DDG preprint](https://zenodo.org/records/18373053) and [RoslynIndexer repo](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer) for deterministic code RAG.\n\n---\n\nr/RAG — GraphRAG hype (explicit graphs over vector RAG) feels like 70s graph DBs (IMS/CODASYL): explicit relations won benchmarks but lost to relational cuz upfront assumptions brittle.\n\n**Hype vs Reality**\nLLM infers entities/relations → persist edges → query traversal. Cool for global search, but edges = ingestion-time guesses → bias for new intents.\n\n**Core Brittleness**\nFrom my [r/programming post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pz6pj3/graphrag_is_just_graph_databases_all_over_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): Nodes=facts, edges=guesses. Scoped query-time inference (BM25+vectors+rerank) often better for ambiguous RAG (no freeze).\n\n**Pushback & Predictability**\nComments nailed it: auditable edges > opaque LLMs (prod win). Dynamic rebuilds? Viable, but maintenance cost high vs simple hybrid RAG.\n\nShines: stable domains (regs/code deps). Fails: intent-shifting queries.\n\nMedium breakdown:[Medium friend link](https://medium.com/sisai/graphrags-deja-vu-why-are-we-repeating-the-same-mistakes-f6852f54bde0?sk=2692c642e7dfb19e9d552162462384c4)\n\n\nProd experiences? GraphRAG beat baseline RAG on your corpus (e.g., multi-hop QA, latency)? Hybrid + dynamic graphs? Or stick to rerank?\n\nShare benchmarks!",

You’re sort of freezing assumptions that may not match what people will ask later.\n\nBut it’s very use-case dependent. For code, I honestly think a dependency graph is pretty much **non-optional**. Calls/imports/inheritance aren’t opinions — they’re real structure. Without graph expansion you often end up with random snippets, and vanilla RAG struggles badly with questions like “where does this start?” or “what does this change affect?”, because you’re missing the whole call chain.",

That thread, along with related discussions, helped isolate the issue to what seems like a missing graph category.\n\nInteresting to see this resurfacing now. I’ve just published a timestamped preprint defining a *Deterministic Domain Graph (DDG)* category:  \n[https://zenodo.org/records/18373053](https://zenodo.org/records/18373053)\n\nI’m currently working on a framework to construct DDGs in practice, and early experiments suggest this is feasible even for large real-world codebases.",

              "text": "Thanks for sharing the article — honestly pretty interesting read.\n\nThis is actually close to where I ended up while building a **code RAG** system. I’m trying to keep the *edges* deterministic + auditable (calls/imports/inheritance, ReadsFrom/WritesTo, FKs etc.), and I’m really trying to avoid freezing “LLM-guessed” relations during ingestion.\n\nI kind of treat vectors as *ranking / fuzzy recall*, but the graph as the closed-world structure that should rebuild the same way every time. For example I force stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and I also add missing TABLE nodes so the SQL graph is actually closed (nodes + edges), not half implicit.\n\nOne thing I’d highlight though: **heuristics ≠ inference**. I’m fine with fixed, testable heuristics (like inline SQL detection) — even if it’s not perfect, it’s still deterministic and you can regression-test it. What I’m trying to avoid is context-dependent enrichment that changes depending on the model/prompt or whatever the “best guess” is this week.\n\nIf you’re curious, this repo is just the **indexing part** (Roslyn/.NET side). The actual RAG pipeline / retrieval is in a separate project:  \n[https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer)\n\nAlso curious how you want to handle schema evolution / versioning for DDGs on big real repos — do you version the domain spec per build, kind of like a compiler?",

Will dive into it right away.\n\nu/RolandRu, super appreciate you sharing your setup and the RoslynIndexer repo! Exactly aligns with what I've been thinking: keep the graph as closed-world, deterministic structure (hard facts like calls/imports/inheritance/ReadsFrom/WritesTo/FKs), and treat vectors as fuzzy recall/ranking. Love the emphasis on heuristics (fixed, testable, regression-friendly) vs. context-dependent LLM guesses—that's the brittleness killer.Your approach to forcing stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and adding missing nodes for closed structure is smart—avoids the \"half implicit\" mess. Curious on a couple things:\n\n\\* How do you handle schema evolution/versioning in big repos? Per-build domain spec like a compiler, or something else?\n\n\\* Have you seen measurable wins on those chain-tracing queries (e.g., impact analysis) vs. vanilla RAG?\n\n\\* Any thoughts on hybrid with dynamic rebuilds for evolving code, or is pure deterministic the way?\n\nThis ties perfectly into what I'm exploring next: code itself as frozen presuppositions/dependencies, and debug as closing the gap to reality. If you're open, I'd love to reference/link your repo/preprint in upcoming posts (with credit, of course).\n\nThanks again—threads like this are why I love posting here!",

      "text": " I’m building a document ingestion component for a Graph RAG pipeline. My responsibility is only the document → structured facts layer (not embeddings, not retrieval).\n\nThe documents are financial statement PDFs (balance sheets, consolidated statements, etc.), and I’m running into a fundamental problem that I want architectural opinions on.\n\nThe problem:\n\nThe PDFs contain tables with multi-level column headers, for example:\n\nParent headers like “THE GROUP” and “THE HOLDING COMPANY”\n\nChild headers like 2024 / 2023 under each parent\n\n Visually, the parent header spans two child columns, but the PDF has no explicit colspan metadata\n\nIssues I’m seeing consistently:\n\nParent headers get attached to only one year (2023 or 2024)\n\nLeft-aligned row labels are sometimes treated as paragraph text and omitted from the table\n\nPage titles / section headers sometimes get parsed as tables (which I don’t mind semantically)\n\n Different PDFs of the same domain use different layouts, spacing, alignment, and font styles\n\nI’ve realized that expecting a single tool to output a “correct table” is unrealistic, especially when layouts vary.\n\nMy question:\n\nIf you were in my position and had to build something robust to unseen layouts, what would you do?\n\nThanks in advance, interested in how others have approached this.",

          "text": "Hi,\n\nI've dealt with this exact problem — multi-level headers in financial PDFs where the visual layout has no structural metadata.\n\n**What worked for me:**\n\n1. **Don't try to parse the table directly** — convert each page to an image and send it to an LLM with vision (GPT-4o or Claude). Define your exact output schema in the prompt. The model \"sees\" the colspan visually even though the PDF has no explicit metadata for it.\n\n2. **Two-pass approach for accuracy** — first pass extracts raw cell values + positions. Second pass uses the visual layout to infer header hierarchy. You prompt the LLM with something like \"which parent header does each year column belong to?\" and it gets it right because it can see the spatial relationship.\n\n3. **Handle layout variation with few-shot examples** — include 2-3 different table layouts in your prompt as examples of correct output. The model generalizes to unseen layouts better than any rule-based parser.\n\n4. **For the row labels being dropped** — this happens because PDF extractors treat left-aligned text as paragraph content. Vision-based approach sidesteps this entirely since it reads the table as a human would.\n\n**On making it robust to unseen layouts:**\n\nThe key insight is to separate extraction from normalization. Extract what you can see (cells, positions, text) and then normalize into your target schema in a second step. This way when a new layout appears, you only need to adjust the normalization logic, not rebuild the parser.\n\nFor your Graph RAG pipeline specifically — output each row as a structured fact with full context: `{entity: \"Total Assets\", value: 1234, year: 2024, group: \"THE GROUP\", source_doc: \"balance_sheet_2024.pdf\", page: 3}`. This makes the graph construction downstream much cleaner.\n\nHope this helps!",

Adds slight latency (Cerebras is nice if you can use it), but managing context windows is the name of the game. \n\nOf course that’s after data ingestion pipes. I recommend doing it multiple ways. For PDFs, for example, we break it into 3 page chunks, have an LLM do semantic chunking of the extracted text, we turn those same 3 page chunks into images and have a vLM create semantic chunks, a few other tricks… then we use a small model to coalesce them (same with PowerPoints, word docs, architectural/engineering drawings), and then vectorize those semantic chunks after it’s been been viewed a few different ways along with a set of questions that might be asked of those chunks based on the industry/business/workflows you have… then graph them… we also use KBLaM and a few other custom models with dynamic knowledge base loading based on the query (the KBs are built dynamically also)\n\nThis is gold. Complicated gold, but gold nonetheless. Write it down 🤣🙃. Otherwise it’s magic. Works better than anything else we’ve tested. I’m leaving a lot out but there’s a lot there also.\n\nDiffMem and MemVid are interesting. RAG at scale is one of the few things in life where more complicated is better. Sigh… lol so hard.",

Models are becoming commodities; *context engineering* isn’t.\n\nCurious if others are measuring success with task completion / decision confidence rather than traditional IR metrics?",
