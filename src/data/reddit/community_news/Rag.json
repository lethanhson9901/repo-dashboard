      "text": "Hey everyone, I have been building a no code [platform](http://mindzyn.com) where users can come and building RAG agent just by drag and drop Docs, manuals or PDF. \n\nAfter interacting with a lot of people on reddit, I found out that there mainly 2 problems everyone was complaining about one was about parsing complex pdf's and hallucinations. \n\nAfter months of testing, I finally got hallucinations down to almost none on real user data (internal docs, PDFs with tables, product manuals)\n\n1. Parsing matters: Suggested by fellow redditor and upon doing my own research using Docling (IBM’s open-source parser) → outputs perfect Markdown with intact tables, headers, lists. No more broken table context. \n\n2. Hybrid search (semantic + keyword): Dense (e5-base-v2 → RaBitQ quantized in Milvus) + sparse BM25.  \nNever misses exact terms like product codes, dates, SKUs, names.\n\n3. Aggressive reranking: Pull top-50 from Milvus - run bge-reranker-v2-m3 to keep only top-5.  \nThis alone cut wrong-context answers by \\~60%. Milvus is best DB I have found ( there are also other great too )\n\n4. Strict system prompt + RAGAS \n\nIf you’re building anything with document, try adding Docling + hybrid + strong reranker—you’ll see the jump immediately. Happy to share prompt/configs\n\nThanks \n\n",

Use domain-appropriate embeddings.\n2) Opposition vs irrelevance.\nFalse negatives would mean relevant content scoring as incoherent. In practice, ARBITER distinguishes irrelevance from geometric opposition. Negative scores aren’t guesses — they indicate measurable semantic conflict, and you can inspect why.\nThat determinism is the point. When ARBITER rejects something, you can trace the geometry.

      "text": "**reposting because i've made significant changes and improvements; figured it's worth sharing the updated version. the post was vague and the quality and speed were much worse.**\n\n## what this is\n\na fast PDF extractor in C using MuPDF, inspired by pymupdf4llm. i took many of its heuristics and approach but rewrote it in C for speed, then bound it to Python so it's easy to use. outputs structured JSON with full layout metadata: geometry, typography, tables, and document structure. designed specifically for RAG pipelines where chunking strategy matters more than automatic feature detection.\n\nspeed: ~300 pages/second on CPU. no GPU needed. 1 million pages in ~55 minutes.\n\n## the problem\n\nmost PDF extractors give you either raw text (fast but unusable) or over-engineered solutions (slow, opinionated, not built for RAG). you want structured data you can control; you want to build smart chunks based on document layout, not just word count. you want this fast, especially when processing large volumes.\n\nalso, chunking matters more than people think. i learnt that the hard way with LangChain's defaults; huge overlaps and huge chunk sizes don't fix retrieval. better document structure does.\n\n**yes, this is niche. yes, you can use paddle, deepseekocr, marker, docling. they are slow. but ok for most cases.**\n\n## what you get\n\nJSON output with metadata for every element:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"heading\",\n  \"text\": \"Step 1. Gather threat intelligence\",\n  \"bbox\": [64.00, 173.74, 491.11, 218.00],\n  \"font_size\": 21.64,\n  \"font_weight\": \"bold\"\n}\n```\n\ninstead of splitting on word count, use bounding boxes to find semantic boundaries. detect headers and footers by y-coordinate. tables come back with cell-level structure. you control the chunking logic completely.\n\n## comparison\n\n| Tool | Speed (pps) | Quality | Tables | JSON Output | Best For |\n|------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|----------|\n| pymupdf4llm-C | ~300 | Good | Yes | Yes (structured) | RAG, high volume |\n| pymupdf4llm | ~10 | Good | Yes| Markdown | General extraction |\n| pymupdf (alone) | ~250 | Subpar for RAG | No | No (text only) | basic text extraction\n| marker | ~0.5-1 | Excellent | Yes | Markdown | Maximum fidelity |\n| docling | ~2-5 | Excellent | Yes | JSON | Document intelligence |\n| PaddleOCR | ~20-50 | Good (OCR) | Yes | Text | Scanned documents |\n\n**the tradeoff:** speed and control over automatic extraction. marker and docling give higher fidelity if you have time; this is built for when you don't.\n\n## what it handles well\n\n- high volume PDF ingestion (millions of pages)\n- RAG pipelines where document structure matters for chunking\n- custom downstream processing; you own the logic\n- cost sensitive deployments; CPU only, no expensive inference\n- iteration speed; refine your chunking strategy in minutes\n\n## what it doesn't handle\n\n- scanned or image heavy PDFs (no OCR)\n- 99%+ accuracy on complex edge cases; this trades some precision for speed\n- figues or image extraction\n\n## why i built this\n\ni used this in my own RAG project and the difference was clear. structured chunks from layout metadata gave way better retrieval accuracy than word count splitting. model outputs improved noticeably. it's one thing to have a parser; it's another to see it actually improve downstream performance.\n\n## links\n\nrepo: [https://github.com/intercepted16/pymupdf4llm-C](https://github.com/intercepted16/pymupdf4llm-C)\n\npip: `pip install pymupdf4llm-C` ([https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm-C](https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm-C))\n\nnote: prebuilt wheels from 3.10 -> 3.13 (inclusive) (macOS ARM, macOS x64, Linux (glibc > 2011)). no Windows. pain to build for.\n\ndocs and examples in the repo. would love feedback from anyone using this for RAG.",

Most people are stuck with either pymupdf's raw text or waiting forever for marker to crawl through documents. 300 pages per second with structured output changes the game completely.\n\nThe JSON metadata approach is spot on. Bounding boxes let you chunk on actual document structure instead of arbitrary word counts. I see too many RAG systems failing because they're splitting mid-paragraph or breaking up tables. Your bbox-based chunking fixes that fundamental problem.\n\nOne thing I'd test is how well the font weight detection works across different PDF generators. Some tools embed fonts weirdly and \"bold\" doesn't always mean what you think. But for high-volume processing where you need good-enough extraction fast, this hits the sweet spot.\n\nThe comparison table tells the story. Marker gives you perfection at 0.5 pages per second. You're giving 80% of that quality at 600x the speed. For most RAG use cases, that math works out perfectly. When you're processing millions of pages, waiting 55 minutes instead of 55 hours matters more than catching every edge case.\n\nTesting different chunking strategies on the structured output, something vectorflow.dev handles well, would help you dial in the optimal approach for your specific documents. The metadata gives you enough control to experiment with semantic boundaries versus fixed sizes.",

Think of it as the layer between your PDF extractor and your vector database.\n\nThe font weight issue is trickier than most people realize. Adobe's PDF spec allows fonts to be embedded in about six different ways, and \"bold\" can be a font name, a weight property, or just how the renderer decides to display it. I've seen PDFs where the same visual boldness gets tagged three different ways in the metadata.\n\nYour 80/20 approach is dead right for most cases. The only time I'd reach for marker over your tool is when I'm dealing with academic papers with complex equations or heavily formatted financial documents where every table cell matters. For standard business documents, technical manuals, reports - your speed advantage wins every time.\n\nThe bbox chunking strategy you're enabling is underrated. Most people chunk on token counts and wonder why their retrieval sucks. When you can say \"everything between y-coordinates 150 and 400 is one logical section\" you get much cleaner semantic boundaries. Tables stay intact, headers don't get orphaned from their content.\n\nHave you tested how it handles PDFs with multiple column layouts? That's usually where bbox-based approaches either shine or fall apart completely.",

Arguably at scale, you don't really know what kind of docs you're going to encounter. And with information retrieval, people kinda care about 1%.

I implemented **Microsoft's GraphRAG** with a flexible backend. You can run it **100% locally** using Ollama (for privacy/free testing) **OR** switch to the **Google Gemini API** with a single config change if you need production-level indexing speed.\n\nThe result is a chatbot that doesn't just retrieve text snippets but understands the *structure* of the data. I even added a visualization UI to actually *see* the nodes and edges the AI is using to build its answers.\n\nI documented the entire build process in a detailed tutorial, covering the theory, the code, and the deployment.\n\n**The full stack includes:**\n\n* **Engine:** Microsoft GraphRAG (official library).\n* **Dual Model Support:**\n   * *Local Mode:* Google's Gemma 3 via **Ollama**.\n   * *Cloud Mode:* **Gemini API** (added based on feedback for faster indexing).\n* **Graph Store:** LanceDB + Parquet Files.\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for chat history).\n* **Visualization:** React Flow (to render the knowledge graph interactively).\n* **Orchestration:** Fully containerized with Docker Compose.\n\n**In the video, I walk through:**\n\n* **The Problem:**\n   * Why \"Classic\" RAG fails at reasoning across complex datasets.\n   * What path leads to Graph RAG → throuh Hybrid RAG\n* **The Concept:** A visual explanation of Entities, Relationships, and Communities & What data types match specific systems.\n* **The Workflow:** How the system indexes data into a graph and performs \"Local Search\" queries.\n* **The Code:** A deep dive into the Python backend, including how I handled the switch between local and cloud providers.\n\n**You can watch the full tutorial here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc](https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc)\n\n**And the open-source code (with the full Docker setup) is on GitHub:**\n\n[https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG](https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG)\n\nI hope this hybrid approach helps anyone trying to move beyond basic vector search.

(Pinecone?)\n* How do you typically explore/debug your vector data today?\n* Any pain points with vector DBs that a GUI could solve?\n\nThis is a passion project, and I want to make it genuinely useful, so please be brutally honest - what would make you actually use something like this?  \nIf you find this useful, a ⭐ on GitHub would mean a lot and help keep me motivated to keep building!\n\nThanks! 🙏",

          "text": "This actually looks pretty useful — in a lot of teams I’ve seen people end up with a bunch of one-off scripts per vendor just to debug embeddings and results, so a single cross-DB desktop UI feels like a real gap. One thing I’d love is an “explain search” style view (metric used, distances, what filters were applied, etc) and an easy way to run the same query against two collections/providers and compare overlaps + distance distributions. Also pgvector/Postgres would be a big next target imo, and if you ever add a simple adapter/plugin API the community could probably contribute more backends. Do you plan to support hybrid search (BM25 + vector) and keep metadata/schema introspection consistent across DBs?",

For hybrid search, I’ll expose it where the DB supports it, and for others, client-side fusion can work.\n\nCross-collection comparison is a great idea. Being able to see overlaps and distance distributions across collections would be super useful for debugging, adding that and pgvector to the todos.\n\nThe plugin API sounds like a great idea. Right now I’m keeping things client-only because it’s just me and I don’t want to deal with server deployments and maintenance. In the future I might add a proper server-side plugin system, but for now the focus is on making the client solid.\n\nI try to normalize schemas into a common format, but edge cases pop up, so if you notice inconsistencies, opening an issue would be super helpful.",

Even messy PDFs/web pages have recoverable structure. It’s not perfect, but it’s way better than “arbitrary 1k tokens every 200 overlap.”\n\t\n•\t Adjacency expansion is a tiny part.\n\t\n•\t Multi-stage enrichment isn’t the same thing: it’s generating new retrievable units (claims, definitions, entity relations, “chapter summary”, “table interpreted into JSON”, etc.) with their own IDs + citations. Adjacency pulls nearby text; enrichment creates higher-level semantic hooks so you can retrieve what the doc implies, not just what it literally says.\n\t\n•\t Iterative retrieval: exactly, that’s the point. Most “enterprise RAG” stops at one retrieval hop and then blames chunking when it fails multi-hop questions.\n\nChunking isn’t “broken”… it’s just the lowest-effort baseline. Calling that “enterprise-grade” is what triggers the Corolla-with-a-spoiler analogy 😅",

You set chunk size to 500, cross your fingers, and only find out it sucks when your answers are garbage three weeks later. The automated cutoffs are especially brutal because they'll slice right through a critical concept or table, and you won't know until you're debugging why the model can't connect related ideas.\n\nWhat's helped me is getting visibility into what chunks actually look like before they hit the vector store. Being able to preview the parsing output and experiment with different chunk sizes immediately shows you when you're cutting through important context or missing relationships between sections. Most chunking problems are obvious once you can actually see what's happening to your documents. been working on something for this, lmk if you want to check it out.",

I battle tested just about everything you can imagine, from Python OCR pipelines to Grok, GPT, Claude, and others. Because the output was for audiobooks, precision and quality were non negotiable, which made this especially difficult.\n\nIn the end, no one came close to Mistral OCR. And I mean no one, by a thousand miles.\n\nPricing was $0.003 to $0.007 per page, with a batch API that can process an entire PDF library. But the real kicker is the JSON schema support.\n\nYou define exactly not only how the content is returned, but also the meta analysis you want run on each page. Meta data like; is this page part of a table of contents? Does the text continue on the next page, or is the last sentence complete?  There are no prompt gimmicks to force valid JSON. It is native, structured, and reliable. It is also massively strong in multiple languages, which mattered for us since the content was in French.\n\nWhat used to be a complex, fragile pipeline is now simple. An R2 bucket, a PDF upload, a queue event triggered on upload, a 20 line Cloudflare Worker invoking Mistral, and all content is saved back into R2 and automatically indexed by Cloudflare RAG. That is it. Nothing else. You could build the same thing on AWS in less than a day.\n\nRight now I am working on a much more challenging project: converting an archive of 500,000 printed architectural blueprints, mostly phone and fiber cable connections inside buildings, so we have a powerful search engine with an agent that can generate a first pass analysis and inventory for technicians planning a repair at a location.",

      "text": "Wanted to share some insights from a weekend project building a RAG solution specifically for financial documents. The standard \"chunk & retrieve\" approach wasn't cutting it for 10-Ks, so here is the architecture I ended up with:\n\n**1. Ingestion (The biggest pain point)** Traditional PDF parsers kept butchering complex financial tables. I switched to a [VLM-based library for extraction](https://github.com/emcf/thepipe), which was a game changer for preserving table structure compared to OCR/text-based approaches.\n\n**2. Hybrid Storage** Financial data needs to be deterministic, not probabilistic.\n\n* **Structured Data:** Extracted tables go into a SQL DB for exact querying.\n* **Unstructured Data:** Semantic chunks go into ChromaDB for vector search.\n\n**3. Killing Math Hallucinations** I explicitly banned the LLM from doing arithmetic. It has access to a Calculator Tool and must pass the raw numbers to it. This provides a \"trace\" (audit trail) for every answer, so I can see exactly where the input numbers came from and what formula was used.\n\n**4. Query Decomposition** For complex multi-step questions (\"Compare 2023 vs 2024 margins\"), a single retrieval step fails. An orchestration layer breaks the query into a DAG of sub-tasks, executes them in parallel (SQL queries + Vector searches), and synthesizes the result.\n\nIt’s been a fun build and I learnt a lot. Happy to answer any questions!\n\nHere is the repo. [https://github.com/vinyasv/financeRAG](https://github.com/vinyasv/financeRAG)",

You should add a layer that doesn't pollute your chromadb with entrophy.  \n\nMy suggestion is to add a layer before injestion to check the DB for duplication. In your example of compare \"2023 vs 2024\" those 10-Ks are littered with the same verbage over and over again. So the db get's flooded with the same words or concepts. A simple filter would reduce muddying things up.\n\nHierarchical indexing approaches that group related concepts at different levels of granularity tend to produce lower-entropy results compared to flat indexing structures that treat all vectors equally. The choice of distance metric in vector databases significantly impacts entropy levels. Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product each behave differently when it comes to grouping related concepts. Some metrics are more prone to grouping semantically unrelated but mathematically similar vectors.",

      "text": "After shipping hybrid search into multiple production systems (RAG/chatbots, product search, and support search) over the last 18 months, here's a practical playbook of what actually mattered. Full disclosure: we build retrieval/RAG systems for customers, so these are lessons we learned on real traffic, not toy benchmarks.\n\n**Why hybrid search**\n\nVector search finds semantics but misses exact matches (SKUs, IDs, proper nouns). BM25/TF-IDF finds exact tokens but misses paraphrases. Hybrid = pragmatic: combine both and tune for your user needs.\n\n**Quick decision flow (how to pick an approach)**\n\n\\- Need fastest time-to-market + minimal ops? Try a vector DB with built-in hybrid (Weaviate-style) if it fits your scale.  \n\\- Need tight control over scoring, advanced reranking, or best-effort accuracy? Use vector DB (Qdrant/FAISS) + a separate BM25 engine (Postgres full-text or Elasticsearch) and fuse results.  \n\\- Need transactional consistency, joins, or want a single source of truth for metadata and embeddings? Use Postgres + pgvector.\n\n**Patterns & code snippets**  \n  \nBuilt-in hybrid (example: Weaviate-style)  \nPros: simple API, single service, alpha knob for weighting. Cons: less control, black-box internals, possible limits on scale/tuning.\n\nPython pseudo-example:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python  \n\\# high-level example (client API varies by vendor)  \nresults = client.query.get(\"Document\", \\[\"content\"\\]) \\\\  \n.with\\_hybrid(query=\"how to cancel subscription\", alpha=0.7) \\\\  \n.with\\_limit(10) \\\\  \n.do()  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nTuning knobs: alpha (0..1), limit, semantic model version, chunking strategy.\n\nWhen to pick: small team, want fewer moving parts, need quick prototype, acceptable to trade some control for speed.\n\n\\---\n\n2) Multi-engine: Qdrant (vectors) + BM25 (Postgres/Elasticsearch)\n\nPattern A: Fuse scores from two full-retrievals  \n\\- Vector DB: get top-N semantic candidates  \n\\- BM25: get top-N lexical candidates  \n\\- Normalize scores and combine (alpha weighting or RRF)\n\nPattern B: Two-stage rerank (fast, often better tail quality)  \n\\- Stage 1: vector search to get \\~100 candidates  \n\\- Stage 2: BM25 (or cross-encoder) reranks those candidates\n\nExample normalization + fusion (Python sketch):\n\n\\`\\`\\`python  \n\\# vector\\_results = \\[{'id':id, 'score':v\\_score}, ...\\]  \n\\# bm25\\_scores = {doc\\_id: raw\\_score}\n\ndef normalize(scores):  \nvals = list(scores.values())  \nmx, mn = max(vals), min(vals)  \nif mx == mn: return {k: 1.0 for k in scores}  \nreturn {k: (v - mn) / (mx - mn) for k, v in scores.items()}\n\nvec = {r\\['id'\\]: r\\['score'\\] for r in vector\\_results}  \nvec\\_n = normalize(vec)  \nbm25\\_n = normalize(bm25\\_scores)\n\nalpha = 0.7  \ncombined = {}  \nfor doc in set(vec\\_n) | set(bm25\\_n):  \ncombined\\[doc\\] = alpha \\* vec\\_n.get(doc, 0) + (1 - alpha) \\* bm25\\_n.get(doc, 0)\n\nranked = sorted(combined.items(), key=lambda x: x\\[1\\], reverse=True)  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nTrade-offs: more infra and operational complexity, but more control over scoring, reranking, and caching. Two-stage rerank gives best cost/quality trade-off in many cases.\n\n\\---\n\n3) Postgres + pgvector (single-system hybrid)\n\nWhy choose this: transactional writes, rich joins (user/profile metadata), ability to keep embeddings in the same DB as your authoritative rows.\n\nExample schema and query (Postgres 14+ with pgvector extension):\n\n\\`\\`\\`sql  \n\\-- table: documents(id serial, content text, embedding vector(1536), ts tsvector)  \n\\-- create index on vector  \nCREATE INDEX ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding vector\\_cosine\\_ops) WITH (lists = 100);  \n\\-- create full-text index  \nCREATE INDEX documents\\_ts\\_idx ON documents USING GIN (ts);\n\n\\-- hybrid query: weight vector distance and text rank  \nSELECT id, content,  \n(1 - (embedding <#> :query\\_embedding)) AS vec\\_sim,    -- cosine distance -> similarity  \nts\\_rank\\_cd(ts, plainto\\_tsquery(:q)) AS ft\\_rank,  \n0.7 \\* (1 - (embedding <#> :query\\_embedding)) + 0.3 \\* ts\\_rank\\_cd(ts, plainto\\_tsquery(:q)) AS hybrid\\_score  \nFROM documents  \nWHERE ts @@ plainto\\_tsquery(:q)  \nORDER BY hybrid\\_score DESC  \nLIMIT 20;  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nNotes:  \n\\- pgvector uses \\`<->\\` or \\`<#>\\` operators depending on metric; check your version.  \n\\- You can include rows that don't match ts query by using LEFT JOIN or removing the WHERE clause and controlling ft\\_rank nulls.  \n\\- Use \\`lists\\` (IVF lists) and \\`probes\\` tuning for ivfflat; \\`lists\\` affects index size and build time.\n\nTrade-offs: single system simplicity and ACID guarantees vs scaling limits (need to shard or read-replicate for very high throughput). Maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE) matters.\n\n**Tuning knobs that actually moved metrics for us**\n\n\\- Chunking: semantic-aware chunks (paragraph boundaries) beat fixed token windows for recall.  \n\\- Alpha (vector vs BM25): tune per use-case. FAQ/support: favor vector (\\~0.7). SKU/product-id exact-match: lower alpha.  \n\\- Candidate set size for rerank: retrieving 100-500 candidates and reranking often beats smaller sets.  \n\\- Normalization: min-max per-query or rank-based fusion (RRF) is safer than naive raw-score mixing.  \n\\- Embedding model: pick one and be consistent; differences matter less than chunking and reranking.  \n\\- Index params: nlist/nprobe (FAISS), ef/search\\_k (HNSW), \\`lists\\`/\\`probes\\` (pgvector ivfflat) — tune for your latency/recall curve.\n\n**Evaluation checklist (offline + online)**\n\nOffline:  \n\\- recall@k (k = 10, 50)  \n\\- MRR (mean reciprocal rank)  \n\\- Precision@k if relevance labels exist  \n\\- Diversity / redundancy checks\n\nOnline:  \n\\- latency p50/p95 (target SLA)  \n\\- synthetic query coverage (tokenized vs paraphrase)  \n\\- task success (e.g., issue resolved, product clicked)  \n\\- cost per Q (compute + index storage)\n\nExperimentation:  \n\\- A/B test different alphas and reranker thresholds  \n\\- Log and sample failures for manual review\n\n**Ops & deployment tips**\n\n\\- Version embeddings: store model name + version to allow reindexing safely.  \n\\- Incremental reindex: prefer small, transactional updates rather than bulk rebuilds where possible.  \n\\- Cache hot queries and pre-warm frequently used embeddings.  \n\\- Monitor drift: embeddings/models change over time; schedule periodic re-evaluation.  \n\\- Fallbacks: if vector DB fails, use BM25-only fallback instead of returning an error.  \n\\- Attribution: always include source IDs/snippets in generated responses to avoid hallucination.\n\n**Common failure modes**\n\n\\- Mixing raw scores without normalization — one engine dominates.  \n\\- Using too-small candidate set and missing correct docs.  \n\\- Not accounting for metadata (date, user region) in ranking — causes irrelevant hits.  \n\\- Treating hybrid as a silver bullet: some queries need exact filters before retrieval (e.g., rate-limited or region-restricted docs).\n\n\\---\n\n**Example test queries to validate hybrid behavior**\n\n\\- \"how to cancel subscription\"  \n\\- \"SKU-12345 warranty\"  \n\\- \"refund policy for order 9876\"  \n\\- \"best GPU for training transformer models\"\n\nFor each query, inspect: top-10 results, source IDs, whether exact-match tokens rank up, and whether paraphrase matches appear.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\\- Hybrid = vectors + lexical. Pick the approach based on control vs speed-to-market vs transactional needs.  \n\\- Weaviate-style built-in hybrid is fastest to ship; multi-engine (Qdrant + BM25) gives most control and best quality with reranking; Postgres+pgvector gives transactional simplicity and joins.  \n\\- Chunking, candidate set size, and normalization/reranking matter more than small differences in embedding models.  \n\\- Always evaluate with recall@k, MRR, and online KPIs; version embeddings and plan for incremental reindexing.\n\nI'd love to hear how others fuse scores in production: do you prefer normalization, rank fusion (RRF), or two-stage rerank?

The two-stage rerank approach usually wins for quality, but most teams underestimate the operational complexity of running multiple engines.\n\nYour chunking point is spot-on. Semantic boundaries beat fixed windows every time, but here's what catches people: they optimize chunking strategy without seeing what their docs actually look like after processing. You end up tuning blind. Testing different chunk sizes while previewing the output, something vectorflow.dev handles, helped us narrow down the sweet spot faster than guessing from metrics alone.\n\nOne thing you didn't mention that bites people: embedding model drift during incremental updates. You version the model but forget that new documents embedded with the \"same\" model version can have subtle distribution shifts if the underlying service updated. We started checksumming a few reference embeddings monthly to catch this.\n\nYour failure mode about mixing raw scores is the big one. Every time I see \"hybrid search isn't working,\" it's usually naive score addition without normalization. RRF is safer than min-max normalization when score distributions are unpredictable, which they always are in production.\n\nWhat's your take on handling temporal relevance in the fusion? Most hybrid implementations ignore recency entirely, but for support docs or product catalogs, fresher content should often win ties.",

              "text": "This is a fantastic addition. The point about checksumming reference embeddings to catch silent API updates is something I hadn’t implemented, but I’m definitely stealing that idea. It’s a silent killer for long-running systems.\n\nRegarding temporal relevance, it’s tricky because you don't want recency to override semantic relevance entirely (e.g., a relevant doc from 2022 vs. an irrelevant one from today).\n\nHere is how we usually handle it in production:\n\n\\- Decay Functions (The \"Soft\" Way): In systems like Elasticsearch or Weaviate, we apply a Gaussian decay function based on the timestamp. It acts as a multiplier on the hybrid score. The key is tuning the scale so the decay isn't too aggressive. Usually, we just want to break ties or give a slight edge to newer content, not bury older foundational docs.\n\n\\- Hard Filters (The \"Hard\" Way): For things like news or urgent support issues, we sometimes enforce a hard filter (e.g., date > now - 1 year) before the vector search, but this hurts recall for \"legacy\" problems.\n\n\\- Reranking Signal: If we use a cross-encoder (Stage 2), we sometimes inject the date into the text passed to the reranker (e.g., \\[Date: 2024-01-01\\] Content...) so the model explicitly sees the freshness, though this relies heavily on the model's training.\n\nDo you use the decay approach, or have you found a way to incorporate recency directly into the RRF logic?",

Most production systems I've seen end up with hybrid approaches where they extract key table metadata (column headers, summary stats, table captions) as embeddings for discovery, then store the actual structured data separately for precise queries. The text conversion route works okay for simple tables but falls apart when you have complex relationships or need to preserve numerical precision.\n\nWhat kills teams is not seeing how badly their table parsing performs until way downstream when users complain about wrong answers. Tables especially get mangled during the parsing step if your PDFs have merged cells or weird formatting, and chunking algorithms treat table rows like paragraphs which destroys context. The hybrid approach adds complexity but gives you the semantic search for table discovery plus SQL precision for the actual data retrieval. been working on something for this, dm if curious.

That is where MCP stops being a wrapper and starts acting like an analytical surface.\n\nWhat makes this viable in production is security context support.\n\nIn my setup, Postgres row level security enforces user permissions at the data layer, and that exact security scope is bound to the MCP session. Every pivot, aggregation, or fact-check runs inside that scope.\n\nThe LLM and MCP tools never see unauthorized data. There is nothing to redact, nothing to “not mention”.

Getting all the rows and columns right is no easy task as there are so many variations when it comes to table structures.  For really complex tables, we've found that LLMs like Gemini (for paid) or PaddleVL (for open source) perform quite well.  For the types of questions our customers have used our service (Aryn DocParse) for, chunking and embedding and storing in vector databases work well.  Once you have the data extracted and in some structured format, you can store that in a relational database or even in a data lake, although we have not come across any customer who's doing this in production, yet.

Index type (for example, Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs)\n\nB. Different defaults (some default “fast but lower recall”)\n\nC.

Embedding model quality\n\nB. Chunking strategy\n\nC. Query rewriting\n\nD. Reranking (second stage re-ordering with a stronger model)\n\nDatabase choice matters, but it’s rarely the main reason your Retrieval-Augmented Generation answers are good/bad — unless you’re under-tuned or using heavy compression.\n\nHow to test it:\n\nDo it in two layers:\n\nStep 1: Measure retrieval recall\n\nMake a small eval set (like 50–200 real queries).\n\nThen:\n\n1. Run exact search (full scan) to get ground truth neighbours\n\n2. Run your normal approximate search\n\n3. Compute Recall at K: “How many of the true top-K did the approximate search retrieve?”\n\nThis tells you if you’re losing too much recall for speed.\n\nStep 2: Measure answer quality\n\nOn the same queries, score final answers using:\n\nA. Ground truth answers (if you have them)\n\nOR\n\nB. a mix of human review + automated judging\n\nThis tells you whether retrieval differences actually matter for your use case.\n\nFor the question which vector database is most accurate / state of the art?”\n\nIf you mean “most accurate possible”: exact search is the most accurate, but expensive.\n\nPS: The answer has been formatted and structured using AI.

You want to **use an existing vector index built with one embedding model and query it with another** \\- if it's expensive or problematic to re-embed your entire corpus, this is the package for you.\n2. You can also **operate mixed vector indexes** and map to the embedding space that works best for different questions.\n3. You can **save cost on questions that are easily adapted**, \"What's the nearest restaurant that has a Hamburger?\" no need to pay for an expensive cloud provider, or wait to perform an unnecessary network hop, embed locally on the device with an embedding adapter and return results instantly.\n\nIt also lets you experiment with provider embeddings you may not have access to.  By using the adapters on some queries and examples, you can compare how different embedding models behave relative to one another and get an early signal on what might work for your data before committing to a provider.\n\nThis makes it practical to:  \n\\- **sample providers you don't have direct access to**  \n\\- **migrate or experiment with embedding models gradually** instead of re-embedding everything at once,  \n\\- ***evaluate multiple providers side by side*** in a consistent retrieval setup,  \n\\- ***handle provider outages or rate limits*** without breaking retrieval,  \n\\- ***run RAG in air-gapped or restricted environments*** with no outbound embedding calls,  \n\\- ***keep a stable “canonical” embedding space*** while changing what runs at the edge.\n\nThe adapters aren't perfect clones of the provider spaces but they are pretty close, for in domain queries the minilm to openai adapter recovered 98% of the openai embedding and dramatically outperforms minilm -> minilm RAG setups\n\nIt's still early in this project. I’m actively expanding the set of supported adapter pairs, adding domain-specialized adapters, expanding the training sets, stream lining the models and improving evaluation and quality tooling.\n\nI’d love feedback from anyone who might be interested in using this:  \n*- What data would you like to see these adapters trained on?*  \n*- What domains would be most helpful to target?*  \n*- Which model pairs would you like me to add next?*  \n*- How could I make this more useful for you to use?*\n\nSo far the library supports:  \n*minilm <-> openai*   \n*openai <-> gemini*  \n*e5 <-> minilm*  \n*e5 <-> openai*  \n*e5 <-> gemini*  \n*minilm <-> gemini*\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone has any ideas please let me know.  \nI could use any support you can give, especially if anyone wants to chip in to help cover the training cost.\n\nPlease upvote if you can, thanks!",

Yeah, I'm super excited to share!\n\nRe architecture, I tried purely linear ( there are a couple in the registry ) but actually the mapping between embedding spaces is only mostly linear, not entirely, so higher accuracy models do benefit from non linearity. The balance is really how much size you want to add to the model. Still trying to figure out the best architecture for capturing, right now I'm leaning more toward a MOE of MLPs with residual connections, but still very flexible here.  The v2 models I'm training are more aligned with this.\n\nIt does seem to point to something interesting though, how can a small llm like minilm capture so much of a massive provider model ( even in a restricted domain ). Something deeper going on here perhaps?\n\nI'm training the v2 models atm expanding the training set size and providers, next version of embedding-adapters I plan to add fine tuning scripts so people can experiment here and upload their own adapters easier.  You can add to the registry as is if you have a working adapter as well, use the cli add  functionality or make a pr to the embedding-adapters registry\n\nhttps://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/embedding-adapters-registry",

I identified some platforms like\n\nQuivr but they dont seem to be maintained anymore.\n\n[https://github.com/QuivrHQ/quivr](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/quivr)\n\nI also identified a lot of frameworks that make it easier to build RAG apps like llamaindex, RAGflow, dify etc., but they dont provide the opinionated blackbox experience im searching for.\n\nSure there are also those \"all in one\" platforms like openwebui or localGPT that provide RAG capabilities and have an opinionated pipeline. But often times their primary focus is not just RAG and they thereby often do not incorporate SOTA techniques into their products. Also they are often built so that you could use them in conjunction with the rest of the package, not to just deliver the RAG results to another frontend.\n\n[https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT)\n\n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nThat being said i do think that it most definetly makes sense that there would be one giant FOSS project always keeping track of the latest and greatest techniques and would just provide a set of valves to tweak functionality and individualize the experience. Other proprietary vendors also try to provide this like Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent or Snowflake cortex. In these cases there is often a sophisticated RAG pipeline in place that does things like\n\n\\- broad chunk search, then narrow down when it identified focus on a specific document\n\n\\- expanding the context of found chunks\n\n\\- intermediate summarizations of docs when working with a large amount of docs simultaneously\n\n\\- ....\n\nAll of those things help to provide a great experience, but for me as a \"one engineer in the ai team\" cannot build, maintain and keep a self built RAG solution up to date to the latest and greatest additions to the space.\n\nJust to note one could say that an \"one size fits all\" solution is not possible, especially because data is so different from system to system, but i'd argue that many proprietary platforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot have perfected this already and can easily be plugged in to any arbitrary form of data and  work relatively well (atleast if the data is in one of the basic formats of data like txt, pdf, pptx, docx ...)\n\nIdeally i would want a RAG platform that always is relatively close behind SOTA, there would be (community) created adapters for enterprise data stores like sharepoint, SAP etc and allows for simple integration into other systems. I'd also pay for this, its not like i just want FOSS, but I would think that the community would also have identified a need for this..\n\nIs what im thinking about valid or is my department just too small to do any meaningful RAG and i should upgrade to more personal so i have the capability to build and maintain RAG pipelines from the ground up or am i just not noticing some development in the space?",

For example, before Symfony, and later Laravel, PHP was a mishmash solving the same problems on every project. I don’t love every design decision of those frameworks but holy crap do they do a lot of heavy lifting to get new devs started. Why not have that sort of thing for RAG?",

Most courses focus on the happy path, but production systems break when documents don't parse cleanly, chunks split poorly, or embeddings don't capture the right context. LangChain vs LlamaIndex matters less than understanding how your documents flow through each step and where things go wrong.\n\nStart by building visibility into your pipeline before optimizing it. You need to see what your parsed documents actually look like, how different chunk sizes affect your specific content, and why certain queries fail to retrieve relevant context. Running into chunking issues enough times made me build [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_d) to debug this stuff upstream instead of discovering problems during retrieval.

      "text": "Hi all,\n\n  \nI'm currently developing 'rich-soup', an alternative to BS, and \"raw\" Playwright.\n\n  \nFor RAG, I found that there weren't many options for parsing HTML pages easily; i.e: content-extraction, getting the actual 'meaty' content from the page, cleanly.\n\nBeautifulSoup is the standard, but it's static only (doesn’t execute JS). Most sites use JS to dynamically populate content, React and jQuery being common examples. So it's not very useful. Unless you write a lot of boilerplate and use extensions.\n\n  \nYes, Playwright solves this. In fact, my tool uses Playwright under the hood. But, it doesn't give you easy-to-use blocks, the actual content. My tool, Rich Soup intends to give you the DX of Beautiful Soup, but work on dynamic pages.\n\n  \nI've got an MVP. It doesn't handle some edge cases, but it seems OK at the moment.\n\nRich Soup uses Playwright to render the page (JS, CSS, everything), then uses visual semantics to understand what you're actually looking at. It analyzes font sizes, spacing, hierarchy, and visual grouping; the same cues humans use to read, and reconstructs the page into clean blocks.\n    \n    \n Instead of this:\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"_container\"><div class=\"_text _2P8zR\">...</div><div class=\"_text _3k9mL2\">...</div>...\n    ```\n    \n    \nYou get this:\n```json\n  {\n      \"blocks\": [\n        {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"spans\": [\"News article about \", \"New JavaScript Framework\", \"**Written in RUST!!!**\"]},\n        {\"type\": \"image\", \"src\": \"...\", \"alt\": \"Lab photo\"},\n        {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"spans\": [\"Researchers say...\", \" *significant progress*\", \"...\"]}\n      ]\n  }\n```\n    \n    \n  Clean blocks instead of markup soup. Now you can actually use the content—feed it to an LLM, chunk it for search, build a knowledge base, generate summaries.\n    \n  \n    \n**Rich Soup extracts**:\n- Paragraph blocks - (items: list[Span])\n- Table blocks- (rows: list[list[str]])\n- Image blocks - (src, alt)\n- List blocks - (prefix: str, items: list[Span])\n    \n  \n> Note: A 'span' isn't `<span>`. It represents a logical group of styling.\n> E.g: `ParagraphBlock.spans = [\"hi\", \"*my*\", \"**name**\", \"is\", \"**John**\", \".\"]`\n\nBefore I develop further, I just want to see if there's any demand. Personally, I think you can do it without this tool, but it takes a lot of extra logic. If you're parsing only a few sites, I reckon it's not that useful. But if you want something a bit more generically useful, maybe it's good?",

I architected this in my V3 Core using a Graph-Vector Handshake. Here is the logic:\n\nDecouple Auth from Storage: Don't just rely on vector metadata tags (which get messy with complex org charts). Use a Graph DB (like Neo4j) or SQL to map your real-world hierarchy: User(2Dog) -\\[:HAS\\_ROLE\\]-> Role(Finance\\_Manager) -\\[:CAN\\_VIEW\\]-> Doc(Salary\\_Report\\_2025)\n\nThe Pre-Filter Workflow: When a user asks \"What are the salary bands?\", do not search the Vector DB immediately. \n\nStep 1: Query the Graph: \"Get all Document IDs this user is allowed to see\" \n\nStep 2: Pass those IDs as a filter to your Vector Search (Chroma/Qdrant/Pinecone)\n\nStep 3: The Vector DB only searches within that \"Safe Subset\"\n\n\n\nWhy this wins: Zero Leakage: The vector search physically cannot see the restricted chunks.\n\nInstant Revocation: If you remove the CAN\\_VIEW edge in the Graph, the user loses access instantly. No need to re-index millions of vector chunks.\n\nI recently published the architecture manifest for this approach (Multi-Lane Consensus + Graph Security). It’s designed exactly for this \"Finance vs. Everyone else\" scenario.\n\nArchitecture breakdown here:  [https://github.com/2dogsandanerd/RAG\\_enterprise\\_core](https://github.com/2dogsandanerd/RAG_enterprise_core)",

The idea is to use both internal (in-house) data and also allow the model to search the internet when needed.\n\nI’m a 2025 college graduate and I’ve built a very basic version of this in less than a week, so I know there’s a lot of room for improvement. Right now, I’m facing a few pain points and I’m a bit confused about the best way forward.\n\nTech stack\n\t•\tMongoDB for storing vectorized data\n\t•\tVertex AI for embeddings / LLM\n\t•\tPython for backend and orchestration\n\nCurrent setup\n\t•\tI store information as-is (no chunking).\n\t•\tI vectorize the full content and store it in MongoDB.\n\t•\tWhen a user asks a query, I vectorize the query using Vertex AI.\n\t•\tI retrieve top-K results from the vector database.\n\t•\tI send the entire retrieved content to the LLM as context.\n\nI know this approach is very basic and not ideal.\n\nProblems I’m facing\n\t1.\tMultiple contexts in a single document\nSometimes, a single piece of uploaded information contains two different contexts. If I vectorize and store it as-is, the retrieval often sends irrelevant context to the LLM, which leads to hallucinations.\n\t2.\tTop-K retrieval may miss important information\nEven when I retrieve the top-K results, I feel like some important details might still be missed, especially when the information is spread across multiple documents.\n\t3.\tQuery understanding and missing implicit facts\nFor example:\n\t•\tMy database might contain a fact like: “Delhi has the Parliament.”\n\t•\tBut if the user asks: “Where does Modi stay?”\n\t•\tThe system might fail to retrieve anything useful because the explicit fact that ‘Modi stays in Delhi / Parliament area’ is missing.\nI hope this example makes sense — I’m not very good at explaining this clearly 😅.\n\t4.\tLow latency requirement\nI want the system to be reasonably fast and not introduce a lot of delay.\n\nMy confusion\n\nLogically, it feels like there will always be some edge case that I’m missing, no matter how much I improve the retrieval. That’s what’s confusing me the most.\n\nI’m just starting out, and I’m sure there’s a lot I can improve in terms of chunking, retrieval strategy, query understanding, and overall architecture.\n\nAny guidance, best practices, or learning resources would really help.

Storing full documents means your embeddings represent the average semantic meaning of everything mixed together, so when you retrieve that document, you're dumping tons of irrelevant context on the LLM. You need to chunk first, then embed each chunk separately. Start with something simple like 512 token chunks with 50 token overlap and see how that changes your retrieval quality.\n\nYour Modi example hits on a harder problem though. That's where you need either better retrieval strategies like hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching, or you need to preprocess your knowledge base to extract more explicit relationships. The edge cases will always exist, but proper chunking gets you 80% of the way there. The latency concern is real too since smaller, focused chunks usually mean faster, more relevant retrievals.

          "text": "You’re not far off, you just built the “first version” that everyone builds 🙂\n\nMain thing: embedding whole documents is gonna hurt you. One vector for a full doc becomes kind of an average of many topics, so you retrieve the doc and then you flood the LLM with unrelated parts. Chunk it. Start simple: split by paragraphs / headings if you can, otherwise do like 400–800 tokens per chunk with a bit of overlap. Store chunk-level embeddings + metadata (docId, section title, createdAt, etc). That alone usually fixes a lot of hallucination issues.\n\nSecond: don’t do “topK and send everything”. Do retrieve more then filter. Common trick: pull top 30–100 candidates (cheap), then rerank down to top 5–10 with a reranker (cross-encoder) or even an LLM rerank if budget is ok. This helps with “I missed the important detail” because you increase recall first, then you get precision back with rerank.\n\nAlso add hybrid search. Vectors are great but names and exact facts often work better with keywords. Even a basic BM25 (or Mongo text search) plus vector search and then merge results will make it feel way more reliable, specially for proper nouns and specific terms.\n\nAbout your Modi example: that’s not only retrieval, it’s a data/knowledge gap. If your data never states Modi -> Delhi (or residence -> location), your system cannot magically pull it. You can reduce it with query expansion (generate a few alternative queries and search each), or HyDE (generate a “hypothetical answer”, embed it, then search with that). Longer term if these implicit questions matter, you’ll probably want to extract entities/relationships into a small graph (person -> city -> building) and use that as extra signal.\n\nFor low latency: cache embeddings, keep chunks smaller, use ANN index, and keep reranker lightweight. Also don’t hit the web for every question — only do it when your internal retrieval confidence is low (scores are low, reranker can’t decide, etc).\n\nEdge cases will always exist yeah, but chunking + hybrid + retrieve-many-then-rerank + a bit of query expansion gets you to “mostly boring and correct” in practice. If you say what type of docs you have (pdf manuals, tickets, wiki pages, etc) people can suggest better chunk rules and metadata filtering.",

          "text": "You’re not missing something obvious — you’ve basically run into the natural limits of RAG faster than most people do.\n\nA few things jump out from your setup.\n\nFirst, the biggest issue isn’t MongoDB or Vertex, it’s **granularity**. Vectorizing and storing entire documents “as-is” almost guarantees mixed context. A single embedding can only represent one dominant semantic direction. If a document contains multiple ideas, retrieval will always be noisy. That’s why you’re seeing irrelevant context and hallucinations — the model isn’t confused, it’s just being fed blended signals.\n\nChunking isn’t optional, but naive fixed-size chunking also causes problems. What works better in practice is chunking by semantic boundaries (sections, headings, logical breaks), keeping chunks relatively small (a few hundred tokens), and adding overlap. Treat chunks as *atomic claims*, not files.\n\nSecond, Top-K retrieval itself isn’t the enemy — **blind Top-K is**. Most production systems do something like:\n\n* retrieve a relatively large candidate set (K=20–50)\n* re-rank those candidates with a stronger scorer (cross-encoder or even a cheap LLM pass)\n* discard low-confidence chunks\n* only send the minimal useful context to the LLM\n\nThis alone fixes a lot of the “important info is missing” feeling, especially when facts are spread across documents.\n\nYour “Delhi / Modi” example is also important, because that’s not really a retrieval bug — it’s a **knowledge modeling problem**. You’re storing explicit facts, but the query requires implicit reasoning. No vector database will magically infer “Modi stays in Delhi” unless you either:\n\n* expand the query into implied sub-queries\n* model entities and relations (even very lightly)\n* or run a small reasoning step that asks: *what facts would I need to answer this?*\n\nMost real RAG systems quietly do a retrieve → think → retrieve loop, even if it’s shallow.\n\nOn latency: low latency and robustness are always in tension. The trick isn’t to make every query perfect — it’s to avoid paying the full retrieval + rerank + reasoning cost when you don’t need it. Caching, early exits, and confidence thresholds matter more than micro-optimizing embeddings.\n\nAnd finally, your intuition about edge cases is correct: they never disappear. What changes is that they become **predictable**. Over time, failures fall into buckets:\n\n* retrieval missed → fallback path\n* weak or conflicting context → refusal or clarification\n* no strong signal → ask the user\n\nAt that point, RAG stops feeling mysterious and starts feeling like systems engineering.\n\nYou’re already past the “toy RAG” stage. The confusion you’re feeling is the moment most people realize this isn’t a vector DB problem — it’s an information systems problem. That’s where the interesting work actually starts.",

This way when you retrieve stuff you are getting focused context instead of throwing entire documents into the LLM which causes hallucination and inaccuracy.\n\nThe implicit facts problem is tricker. What helps is doing query expansion where you rephrase the user question into a couple variations before searching, Also look into reranker models after you get your top\\_k from vector search and run them through a reranker to score relevance more accurately. This catches stuff semantic search misses.. hybrid search combining vector with keyword search like BM25 also helps.\n\nAbout the expense side, since you are still experimenting, vertex AI gets expensive really fast when you are iterating. You can test via different providers like deepinfra or together for instance for the same embedding models and llms and and it's way cheaper while you figure out latency, top\\_k settings and all that before deploying.\n\nIf you haven't already, check out LlamaIndex or LangChain. They handle most of the RAG orchestration and make it easy to swap between different providers while you figure out what setup works best.",

We recently launched a new metadata extraction feature that allows you to extract metadata/properties of interest from unstructured documents using JSON schemas.  I know this community is really big on various ways of dealing with unstructured documents (PDFs, docx, etc) for the purpose of getting them ready for RAG and LLMs.  Most of the use cases I see talked about here are around pulling out text and chunking and embedding and ingesting into a vector database with a heavy emphasis on self-hosting.  We believe that metadata extraction is going to provide a differentiation for RAG because the process of imposing structure on the data using schemas opens the door for many existing data analytics tools that work on structured data (think relational databases with catalogs).  Anyone actively looking into or working on this for their RAG projects?  Are you already using something for metadata extraction.  If so, how has your experience been using it?  What's working well and what's lacking?  I'd love to hear your experience!",

The approach works by mapping content into a 72-dimensional semantic space and measuring coherence gaps between query intent and retrieved content.\n\nFor compression: Instead of arbitrary similarity thresholds (0.7, etc.), I identify which parts of documents maintain the highest coherence with the query context, then compress based on those semantic boundaries.

Measure whether candidate documents actually satisfy the semantic constraints of the query rather than just having similar embeddings.\n\nThe key insight is that similarity ≠ coherence. Two documents can be highly similar in embedding space but completely incoherent when trying to answer a specific query.\n\nThe geometric approach lets you compress based on actual meaning preservation rather than token counting or prompt-based summarization.

Most teams discover their chunking preserves zero semantic structure only after they've embedded everything and are debugging weird retrievals.\n\nHow are you handling the boundary detection in practice?

If your documents are getting mangled during parsing or split poorly during chunking, even fast retrieval won't help. Tables get scrambled, context gets lost across chunk boundaries, metadata doesn't propagate properly.\n\nFor speed, check your chunk sizes first. Smaller chunks retrieve faster but lose context. Larger chunks are slower but more complete. Also worth looking at your embedding model. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is faster than the large version with minimal accuracy loss for most use cases.\n\nThe preprocessing pipeline is where I spend most of my time debugging these setups, which is why I ended up working on document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev.

      "text": "Hi r/RAG,\n\nWe often talk about chunking strategies and rerankers here, but I’ve found that the biggest ROI in my recent pipelines came simply from cleaning the input data. Specifically: **Deduplication.**\n\nFeeding duplicate chunks into a Vector DB is a silent killer. It messes with MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance), wastes storage/compute, and pollutes the context window with repetitive information.\n\nI couldn't find a lightweight tool that could handle 100GB+ datasets locally without crashing my laptop (OOM) or requiring a GPU cluster. So I built **EntropyGuard**.\n\nIt’s open source (MIT), Python-based, and designed to sit between your raw data (PDFs/Scrapes) and your chunking/embedding step.\n\nHere is the architectural breakdown of how I handled memory constraints and performance.\n\n# The Stack\n\n* **Data Processing:** `Polars` (LazyFrame is essential here)\n* **Embeddings:** `SentenceTransformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)\n* **Vector Search:** `FAISS` (CPU build)\n* **Hashing:** `xxhash`\n\n# The Hybrid Pipeline (Architecture)\n\nProcessing large datasets purely semantically is O(n²) painful. I implemented a two-stage waterfall approach to balance speed and accuracy.\n\nStage 1: Exact Hash Filtering (The \"Fast Pass\")\n\nBefore calculating a single embedding, the data streams through a normalized hashing filter.\n\n* **Logic:** Normalize text (lower/strip) -> Calculate `xxhash` \\-> Bloom Filter / Set check.\n* **Performance:** \\~6,000 rows/sec.\n* **Result:** In my tests on scraped documentation, this removed \\~40-60% of garbage (duplicate error logs, identical headers) instantly.\n\nStage 2: Semantic Filtering (The \"Smart Pass\")\n\nOnly unique hashes survive to this stage.\n\n1. **Batching:** Data is collected in strict memory-safe batches (e.g., 10k rows).\n2. **Embedding:** Generated using `sentence-transformers`.\n3. **Indexing:** Added incrementally to a FAISS `IndexFlatL2`.\n4. **Thresholding:** I calculate the L2 distance. If the distance to the nearest neighbor is `< threshold` (default equivalent to \\~0.95 cosine similarity), it's marked as a semantic duplicate.\n\n# Memory Management (Polars vs Pandas)\n\nThe biggest challenge was OOM (Out of Memory). Using Pandas meant loading the whole CSV/JSONL into RAM.\n\nI switched to Polars Lazy API.\n\n    # Simplified logic\n    lf = pl.scan_ndjson(\"massive_dataset.jsonl\")\n    # Operations are queued, not executed\n    lf = lf.with_columns(\n        pl.col(\"text\").map_elements(compute_hash).alias(\"hash\")\n    )\n    # Streaming execution\n    lf.sink_json(\"clean_output.jsonl\")\n    \n    \n\nThis allows the CLI to process datasets significantly larger than physical RAM by iterating over chunks.\n\n# Benchmarks (Lenovo ThinkBook, 16GB RAM)\n\nI tested this on a dirty dataset (mixed web scrapes + logs):\n\n|**Metric**|**Value**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Dataset Size**|65,000 documents|\n|**Raw Size**|\\~120 MB|\n|**Processing Time**|2m 14s|\n|**Peak RAM Usage**|900 MB|\n|**Duplicates Found**|24,300 (37%)|\n\n# Why use this over a Vector DB's built-in dedup?\n\nMost Vector DBs check for ID collisions, not semantic content collisions before insertion. Some allow checking existence by vector, but doing that network round-trip for every insert is incredibly slow.\n\nThis tool is meant to be a pre-processor. You pipe your raw data through it, and only clean, high-entropy data goes to your expensive Pinecone/Weaviate index.\n\n# Roadmap / Request for Feedback\n\nThe tool is functional and stable (`v1.22.1`), but I am looking for feedback from this community on:\n\n1. **Thresholds:** I'm using a default distance threshold. For RAG, do you prefer aggressive dedup (risk of losing nuance) or conservative?\n2. **Models:** Currently defaults to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for speed. Is anyone using BGE-M3 for this kind of task locally, or is it too heavy?\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard](https://github.com/DamianSiuta/entropyguard)\n\n**Pip:** `pip install entropyguard`\n\nHappy to answer questions about the Polars/FAISS implementation details!",

Especially agree with your point about duplicate chunks quietly breaking MMR and retrieval diversity.\n\nOne thing we ran into downstream of this: once you *do* have clean data, embedding churn becomes the next hidden risk. Teams experiment with models (MiniLM → BGE → local variants), and suddenly previously deduped corpora behave differently because similarity geometry shifts.\n\nWe ended up treating embeddings as a pluggable backend so we could re-embed / A-B without rewriting pipelines, similar to how you’re treating dedup as a preprocessing concern rather than a vector-DB responsibility.\n\nRe your questions:\n\n* **Thresholds**: we’ve had better luck conservative at ingest + more aggressive later if needed. Losing nuance early is painful to debug.\n* **Models**: BGE-M3 is great but heavy — for local pipelines MiniLM-class models still feel like the sweet spot unless recall is mission-critical.\n\nReally nice work — tools like this feel like the kind of “boring infrastructure” that actually moves RAG quality the most.",

I hadn't fully considered the operational headache of re-deduping when switching from MiniLM to BGE, but it makes total sense, the geometry shifts, and suddenly your \"unique\" threshold might cut off valid data or let noise through.\n\nThat's actually a strong argument for keeping the dedup stage strictly decoupled from the retrieval stage, potentially even versioning the cleaned datasets based on the model used (`clean_data_v1_minilm.jsonl`).\n\nRe: Thresholds , \"Losing nuance early is painful to debug\" is going to be my new mantra. I’ll probably adjust the default config to be slightly more conservative based on this. It's easier to filter more strictly at query time than to resurrect a chunk that was deleted 3 steps ago.\n\nAppreciate the insight on BGE-M3 vs MiniLM as well.

For some file formats I return also the bytes representation of images. I notice a lot of talk about image and the potential in image representation creation for QA but I have seen little concrete examples of how this looks like (for creating/storing and also using image rep.). You can access the binary rep. of an image via the returned content object. It is a loose end for now. I open to adapt here as well.  \nThis image topic did not cross my table yet as a hard critical feature but always just as a nice to have.",

Network analysis is its own entire field if you want to understand who is interacting with what ect you need to build one architecture for that.

For example yes for the network analysis you likely want a graph but for the IR you are likely creating far more problems than you are solving by adding in a graph.\n\nOne last word to the wise it’s going to be temporality that really kicks you in the nuts.

Weights & Biases handles experiment tracking but RAG-specific metrics are bolted on. LangSmith does evaluation but the experiment management is basic. Ragas has good metrics but zero experiment infrastructure. You end up stitching together three different tools.\n\nThe tricky part isn't the dashboard or parameter tracking. It's handling the data transformations consistently across experiments. When you're testing different chunk sizes or embedding models, you need to see what your documents actually look like after each step, something vectorflow.dev handles, before you can trust your evaluation metrics. Most people skip this and wonder why their metrics don't correlate with actual performance.\n\nYour biggest challenge will be the evaluation metrics themselves. RAG evaluation is still pretty broken. Context relevance scores don't predict user satisfaction. Answer correctness metrics miss nuanced failures. Faithfulness checks are unreliable. You'll spend more time debugging the evaluations than building the experiment infrastructure.\n\nWhat specific pain point are you trying to solve? Are you dealing with inconsistent experiment results, or is it more about the operational overhead of running multiple configurations?",

So \"car\" and \"automobile\" would have similar vectors even if they never appear together in training.\n\nThe model learns these relationships from massive text corpora. It sees patterns like \"I drove my car\" and \"I drove my automobile\" in similar contexts, so it learns they're related. Same with synonyms, related concepts, even some analogies.\n\nBut there are limits. Domain-specific synonyms might not be captured well if they weren't in the training data. \"Myocardial infarction\" and \"heart attack\" might be close, but specialized legal or technical terms could be hit or miss.\n\nThe \"trust\" part depends on your use case. For general knowledge, embeddings work well for semantic similarity. For highly specialized domains, you might need domain-specific models or fine-tuning.\n\nOne thing to watch is that similarity doesn't always mean relevance. \"Python programming\" and \"Python snake\" might be closer than you want if someone asks about coding.",

Could you tldr what it is the provide exactly, and if you might have tried other similar tools why you prefer them?\"**\n\nA. Sorry for the long post, but I hope my answer really helps you. I will give you the exact business case.\n\nI build AI Employees that clients staff full time or part time. They pay every two weeks. If they do not like it, they just fire it. It takes about one hour to spin one up, and it starts helping right away.\n\nThe primary use case is overloaded key talent that is close to burnout. The girl or guy who ends up doing 60 hours a week and we wish we could clone.\n\nMy AIs are not that sophisticated. They just take the basic knucklehead work out of the person’s day to day. Things like answering the same question for the 20th time or having to contact 30 people to get a status update.\n\nPeople have to call the AI at least once a day for about 15 minutes. It gathers everything it needs, does email follow ups, and then sits down with the employee to agree on a game plan for the next day. While the person sleeps, it prepares all follow ups so that the next morning we can hit the ground running.\n\nNow let’s translate that into RAG vs Mem0 vs MCP needs.\n\n1. First, we have facts.\n\nProject X budget is overrun by 10k dollars. That is something you want in MCP. It either calls the API or, even better, has proper pivot capacity so the LLM can use that data for reasoning.\n\nTen thousand dollars overrun. Follow up why, where, starting from when, and on what type of resources. None of that should happen as chunks from RAG because you want the LLM to actually reason through it. Pull, deep dive, then answer the user. You also do not want chunking to create hallucinations.\n\n2) Second, we have knowledge.\n\nThe project is about X, Y, and Z. Our current challenges are delays in shipping specific pieces of equipment, and during the last three phone follow ups the project manager was still trying to find a solution. These are transcripts of conversations, project documentation, etc.\n\nRAG is good here. Not perfect, but decent enough with proper guardrails. You crystallize your current knowledge but always default to MCP when you need facts, for example the exact status of each SKU for delivery.\n\n3) Then you have what I call transient knowledge.\n\nThis is knowledge that is not fact yet, but will be. The client (lets say Sophie) asks to postpone next week’s meeting during a conversation with the AI. Then, half an hour later, someone else calls the AI to ask when the meeting is. Since Sophie's request is not confirmed yet, it's not fact, but it would be stupid to not give that context to the user, as an actual competent colleague would do.\n\nRAG is bad for that. It will not compute transient information well and will quickly mess up facts with “not yet” facts, and you don't want to let chucking algorithm do that and just hope all relation and context were correctly pull in. You also wish to have that effortlessly updated with minimal code and no re-indexing of your rag, etc, etc, etc... You can set TTL (Time to Leave) data you attached to the graph, tag it and much more.\n\nThis is where Mem0 kicks in. Mem0 act as a memory layer for AI applications that enables personalized, context-aware experiences by storing and managing long-term memories across users, sessions, and tools. It uses a graph-based structure to handle entities, relationships, and contextual data, making it ideal for maintaining transient or evolving information without relying on static retrieval like RAG.\n\nNot only with a proper graph of when to pull a chunk, but by pulling all chunks that are context related and user related (hence the graph need).\n\nHere, it will pull that the entity Sophie had requested a meeting change, while the official documentation still has it scheduled for Monday. It can go much further: it can access memories from other AIs or view all AI memory from an entity perspective. (In my case, this means all my AI Employees at that company can tap into the combined company-wide graph intelligence for a specific entity X or topic Y.) This does not replace hard facts from MCP, it simply provides rapid context and visibility into changes or evolving opinions. For example, we have a slate for delivery on Friday, but 20 out of the 25 devs I’ve spoken with already say this will never happen. Mem0 helps the LLM quickly surface clear, nuanced takes like: “Three of the five senior devs agree on why it’s unrealistic, but the QA team has a completely different perspective on the blockers.”\n\nFor example accessing all memories related to Sophie, or all the memories AI number two had with Sophie.\n\nAnd of course, you control everything. Security, scope, and what memory can be viewed by whom, and in what context.\n\nWith the upcoming addition of Mem0 in ElevenLabs (early Q1 rollout), this means you can seamlessly move with transient memory between calls, emails, and chats. For instance, a detail mentioned in a voice call can instantly inform an email response or chat update, keeping everything consistent and fluid across channels without losing context.",

I simply wanted to share where I found mem0 useful in my business case.\n\nFeel free to DM me. 🙂\n\nI am very niche, which is why my mem0 example mattered so much. It had a significant impact on the quality of my agents. My clients are almost exclusively small businesses in non tech industries that are short on white collar staff, mainly in mining, light industry, construction, and shipping.\n\nI focus on voice based AI employees with phone, email, and reporting capabilities. I have 71 agents 'full time'. They talk with staff, gather information, surface friction, and help create breathing room for key leaders and key contributors. At the same time, they continuously output and update a structured, queryable database (Postgres + MCP) and a relationship graph of recurring issues, shared challenges, and operational signals.\n\nThis works especially well for companies of around 75 to 200 employees where a voice culture is strong and critical knowledge is rarely written down, but instead passed through conversations and meeting. These are often companies with one or two developers who are also responsible for the printer and the Wi Fi. :)\n\nI mainly cover coordinator roles (status reporting, motivation, venting, friction reduction), HR roles (staff onboarding, change management, intelligence gathering), and project manager roles (information sharing, forecasting). These positions are offered at roughly one quarter of the normal salary, paid every two weeks.\n\nSo transient knowledge and transient memories are a big deal in my case. The benefit was massive from day 1 when we implemented mem0. And I cant wait for it to be implemented by 11labs. Right now I push it as a MCP tools but being able to have it in flight at low latency during a conversation is going to be a big deal.",

The duplicate vector storage across 5000 indexes would be brutal on costs and management overhead.\n\nThe metadata approach scales better. You can filter by customer_id at query time and handle the shared documents elegantly. When the same PDF applies to multiple customers, you just duplicate the metadata records, not the actual vectors.\n\nOne thing that often gets overlooked in this setup is making sure your document processing pipeline handles the metadata propagation correctly. If chunks lose their customer associations during parsing or chunking, your filtering breaks down. I've been building document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev specifically because this kind of metadata handling is where most RAG setups fall apart.\n\nWhat's your plan for handling documents that get updated?

Going with \"One Index per Customer\" (Option B) sounds secure at first, but it breaks apart the moment you have shared documents. \n\nWhy Option B fails: \n\n* Redundancy: If a shared PDF (e.g., \"Regulatory\\_Update\\_2025.pdf\") changes, you have to re-ingest and update it in 500 different indexes. That's a maintenance nightmare. \n* Resource Waste: You are paying for storage and compute on duplicate vectors. \n* Scalability: Managing 5000 indexes is not just about AWS limits; it's about latency in your management plane. \n\n\n\nThe Solution (Option A + RBAC): \n\nUse a Single Index with robust Metadata Filtering. Store the customer\\_ids or access\\_groups list in the metadata of each chunk. \n\nShared PDF Metadata: {\"allowed\\_tenants\": \\[\"all\"\\]} or {\"allowed\\_tenants\": \\[\"id\\_1\", \"id\\_2\", ...\\]} \n\nPrivate PDF Metadata: {\"allowed\\_tenants\": \\[\"id\\_1\"\\]} \n\n\n\nThe Pro Move (Hybrid Approach): In my own architecture (V3), I actually offload this permission logic to a Graph DB (Neo4j) or your Postgres. User asks question. System queries DB: \"Which Document IDs is User X allowed to see?\" System queries Vector DB with a pre-filter: WHERE doc\\_id IN \\[list\\_of\\_allowed\\_ids\\]. \n\nThis keeps your Vector Index clean and your permission logic centralized in your SQL/Graph DB. \n\nDon't over-engineer the isolation unless you have strict legal requirements (e.g., physically separated data for Top Secret clearance).

It's tedious but necessary because by the time you're looking at similarity scores you're three steps removed from the root cause.\n\nThe real issue is that you can't see what went wrong until you're deep into debugging weird responses. Most teams discover their chunking is broken only after they've already embedded everything. You're essentially debugging blindfolded because the parsing and chunking happened upstream and you have no visibility into what actually survived that process.\n\nWhat kills me is how much time gets wasted on retrieval tuning when the problem is usually that documents got mangled during parsing. Tables split mid-row, paragraphs chunked at weird boundaries, metadata stripped out. The debugging pain you're feeling is why I ended up building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_d) to see what docs actually look like after each transformation step before they hit the vector store.\n\nThe inefficiency isn't your process.

The object storage native architecture is going to give you a lot of cost efficiency once you’re in the 10s to 100s of millions of vectors, and if you’re using a large clickhouse cluster in production, I’ll assume you’re somewhere in that range or larger. \n\nclickhouse is an amazing database and it has some pretty cool vector search features, but it’s an olap database at its core. I also know from experience that they’re much more focused on the elastic use cases (text search over logs) than vector/semantic search, whereas turbopuffer does both (and hybrid) extremely well.\n\nin production turbopuffer is going to be more scalable with less handholding. it’s extremely fast given its tradeoffs and scales well both vertically (documents) and horizontally (indexes/namespaces)\n\nif you want something that “just works” i’d give tpuf a shot. if you’re comfortable with your clickhouse eng skills and want to stay with something familiar, try ch and see how it goes. you might end up puffing anyway ;)\n\np.s. not sure where you heard the 10x faster claim on turbopuffer. it is indeed very fast for a warm namespace, but i would say that performance is comparable to state-of-the-art vector/fts engines not 10x faster. but the 10x cheaper claim is legit: the benefit of an object-storage native architecture.",

I’m looking for people who want to:\n\n* test it with real documents\n* try to break retrieval accuracy (now im using some models that wont give the best accuracy just for testing rn)\n* see where UX / ingestion / answers fail\n* tell me honestly what’s confusing or useless\n\n# Who this might be useful for\n\n* People experimenting with RAG\n* Indie hackers building internal tools\n* Devs who want an embeddable AI assistant for docs\n* Anyone tired of “embed → pray” RAG pipelines 😅\n\nIf you’ve read my previous posts and were curious how this works *in practice*, now’s the time.\n\n👉 **Beta link:** [*https://chatbot-builder-pro.vercel.app/*](https://chatbot-builder-pro.vercel.app/)\n\nFeedback (good or bad) is very welcome.",
