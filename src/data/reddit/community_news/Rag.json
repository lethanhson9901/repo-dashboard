      "text": "If you've built a RAG system, you've had the chunking conversation. Somebody on your team (or [a Medium post](https://medium.com/%40adnanmasood/chunking-strategies-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-a-comprehensive-guide-5522c4ea2a90)) told you to \"just use 512 tokens with 50-token overlap\" or \"semantic chunking is strictly better.\"\n\nWe (hello from the R&D team at Vecta!) decided to test these claims. We created a small corpus of real academic papers spanning AI, astrophysics, mathematics, economics, social science, physics, chemistry, and computer vision. Then, we ran every document through seven different chunking strategies and measured retrieval quality and downstream answer accuracy.\n\nCritically, we designed the evaluation to be **fair**: each strategy retrieves a different number of chunks, calibrated so that every strategy gets approximately **2,000 tokens of context** in the generation prompt. This eliminates the confound where strategies with larger chunks get more context per retrieval, and ensures we're measuring chunking quality, not context window size.\n\nThe \"boring\" strategies won. The hyped strategies failed. And the relationship between chunk granularity and answer quality is more nuanced than most advice suggests.\n\n# Setup\n\n# Corpus\n\nWe assembled a diverse corpus of 50 academic papers (905,746 total tokens) deliberately spanning similar disciplines, writing styles, and document structures: Papers ranged from 3 to 112 pages and included technical dense mathematical proofs pertaining to fundamental ML research. All PDFs were converted to clean markdown using [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown), with OCR artifacts and single-character fragments stripped before chunking.\n\n# Chunking Strategies Tested\n\n1. **Fixed-size, 512 tokens**, 50-token overlap\n2. **Fixed-size, 1024 tokens**, 100-token overlap\n3. **Recursive character splitting**, LangChain-style `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens\n4. **Semantic chunking**, embedding-based boundary detection (cosine similarity threshold 0.7)\n5. **Document-structure-aware**, splitting on markdown headings/sections, max 1024 tokens\n6. **Page-per-chunk**, one chunk per PDF page, using MarkItDown's form-feed (`\\f`) page boundaries\n7. **Proposition chunking**, LLM-decomposed atomic propositions following [Dense X Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06648) with the paper's exact extraction prompt\n\nAll chunks were embedded with `text-embedding-3-small` and stored in local ChromaDB. Answer generation used `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` via OpenRouter. We generated 30 ground-truth Q&A pairs using Vecta's synthetic benchmark pipeline.\n\n# Equal Context Budget: Adaptive Retrieval k\n\nMost chunking benchmarks use a fixed top-k (e.g., k=10) for all strategies. This is fundamentally unfair: if fixed-1024 retrieves 10 chunks, the generator sees \\~10,000 tokens of context; if proposition chunking retrieves 10 chunks at 17 tokens each, the generator gets \\~170 tokens. The larger-chunk strategy wins by default because it gets more context, not because its chunking is better.\n\nWe fix this by computing an **adaptive k** for each strategy. This targets \\~2,000 tokens of retrieved context for every strategy. The computed values:\n\n|Strategy|Avg Tokens/Chunk|Adaptive k|Expected Context|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Page-per-Chunk|961|2|\\~1,921|\n|Doc-Structure|937|2|\\~1,873|\n|Fixed 1024|658|3|\\~1,974|\n|Fixed 512|401|5|\\~2,007|\n|Recursive 512|397|5|\\~1,984|\n|Semantic|43|46|\\~1,983|\n|Proposition|17|115|\\~2,008|\n\nNow every strategy gets \\~2,000 tokens to work with. Differences in accuracy reflect genuine chunking quality, not context budget.\n\n# How We Score Retrieval: Precision, Recall, and F1\n\nWe evaluate retrieval at two granularities: **page-level** (did we retrieve the right pages?) and **document-level** (did we retrieve the right documents?). At each level, the core metrics are precision, recall, and F1.\n\nLet R be the set of retrieved items (pages or documents) and G be the set of ground-truth relevant items.\n\nPrecision measures: of everything we retrieved, what fraction was actually relevant? A retriever that returns 5 pages, 4 of which contain the answer, has a precision of 0.8. High precision means low noise in the context window.\n\nRecall measures: of everything that *was* relevant, what fraction did we find? If 3 pages contain the answer and we retrieved 2 of them, recall is 0.67. High recall means we're not missing important information.\n\nF1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It penalizes strategies that trade one for the other and rewards balanced retrieval.\n\n**Why two granularities matter.** Page-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling the right *passages*. Document-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling from the right *sources*. A strategy can score high page-level recall (finding many relevant pages) while scoring low document-level precision (those pages are scattered across too many irrelevant documents). As we'll see, the tension between these two levels is one of the main findings.\n\n# Results\n\n# The Big Picture\n\n[Figure 1: Complete metrics heatmap. Green is good, red is bad.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/metrics_heatmap.png)\n\n|Strategy|k|Doc F1|Page F1|Accuracy|Groundedness|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Recursive 512**|5|0.86|**0.92**|**0.69**|0.81|\n|**Fixed 512**|5|0.85|0.88|0.67|**0.85**|\n|**Fixed 1024**|3|**0.88**|0.72|0.61|0.86|\n|**Doc-Structure**|2|0.88|0.69|0.52|0.84|\n|**Page-per-Chunk**|2|0.88|0.69|0.57|0.81|\n|**Semantic**|46|0.42|0.91|0.54|0.81|\n|**Proposition**|115|0.27|**0.97**|0.51|**0.87**|\n\n**Recursive splitting wins on accuracy (69%) and page-level retrieval (0.92 F1).** The 512-token strategies lead on generation quality, while larger-chunk strategies lead on document-level retrieval but fall behind on accuracy.\n\n# Finding 1: Recursive and Fixed Splitting Often Outperforms Fancier Strategies\n\n[Figure 2: Accuracy and groundedness by strategy. Recursive and fixed 512 lead on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/generation_quality.png)\n\nLangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens achieved the highest accuracy (**69%**) across all seven strategies. Fixed 512 was close behind at 67%. Both strategies use 5 retrieved chunks for \\~2,000 tokens of context.\n\nWhy does recursive splitting edge out plain fixed-size? It tries to break at natural boundaries, paragraph breaks, then sentence breaks, then word breaks. On academic text, this preserves logical units: a complete paragraph about a method, a full equation derivation, a complete results discussion. The generator gets chunks that make semantic sense, not arbitrary windows that may cut mid-sentence.\n\nRecursive 512 also achieved the best page-level F1 (**0.92**), meaning it reliably finds the right pages *and* produces accurate answers from them.\n\n# Finding 2: The Granularity-Retrieval Tradeoff Is Real\n\n[Figure 3: Radar chart, recursive 512 (orange) has the fullest coverage. Large-chunk strategies skew toward doc retrieval but lose on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/radar_comparison.png)\n\nWith a 2,000-token budget, a clear tradeoff emerges:\n\n* **Smaller chunks (k=5)** achieve higher accuracy (67-69%) because 5 retrieval slots let you sample from 5 different locations in the corpus, each precisely targeted\n* **Larger chunks (k=2-3)** achieve higher document F1 (0.88) because each retrieved chunk spans more of the relevant document, but the generator gets fewer, potentially less focused passages\n\nFixed 1024 scored the best document F1 (**0.88**) but only 61% accuracy. With just k=3, you get 3 large passages, great for document coverage, but if even one of those passages isn't well-targeted, you've wasted a third of your context budget.\n\n# Finding 3: Semantic Chunking Collapses at Scale\n\n[Figure 4: Chunk size distribution. Semantic and proposition chunking produce extremely small fragments.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/chunk_size_distribution.png)\n\nSemantic chunking produced **17,481 chunks averaging 43 tokens** across 50 papers. With k=46, the retriever samples from 46 different tiny chunks. The result: only **54% accuracy** and **0.42 document F1**.\n\nHigh page F1 (0.91) reveals what's happening: the retriever *finds the right pages* by sampling many tiny chunks from across the corpus. But document-level retrieval collapses because those 46 chunks come from dozens of different documents, diluting precision. And accuracy suffers because 46 disconnected sentences don't form a coherent narrative for the generator.\n\n**The fundamental problem:** semantic chunking optimizes for retrieval-boundary purity at the expense of context coherence. Each chunk is a \"clean\" semantic unit, but a single sentence chunk may lack the surrounding context needed for generation.\n\n# Finding 4: The Page-Level Retrieval Story\n\n[Figure 5: Page-level precision-recall tradeoff. Recursive 512 achieves the best balance.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/precision_recall.png)\n\n[Figure 6: Page-level and document-level F1. The two metrics tell different stories.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/retrieval_f1.png)\n\nPage-level and document-level retrieval tell opposite stories under constrained context:\n\n* **Fine-grained strategies** (proposition k=115, semantic k=46) achieve high page F1 (0.91-0.97) by sampling many pages, but low doc F1 (0.27-0.42) because those pages come from too many documents\n* **Coarse strategies** (page-chunk k=2, doc-structure k=2) achieve high doc F1 (0.88) by retrieving fewer, more relevant documents, but lower page F1 (0.69) because 2 chunks can only cover 2 pages\n\n**Recursive 512 at k=5 hits the best balance**: 0.92 page F1 and 0.86 doc F1. Five chunks is enough to sample multiple relevant pages while still concentrating on a few documents.\n\n[Figure 7: Document-level precision, recall, and F1 detail. Large-chunk strategies lead on precision; fine-grained strategies lead on recall.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/document_level.png)\n\n# What This Means for Your RAG System\n\n# The Short Version\n\n1. **Use recursive character splitting at 512 tokens.** It scored the highest accuracy (69%), best page F1 (0.92), and strong doc F1 (0.86). It's the best all-around strategy on academic text.\n2. **Fixed-size 512 is a strong runner-up** with 67% accuracy and the highest groundedness among the top performers (85%).\n3. **If document-level retrieval matters most**, use fixed-1024 or page-per-chunk (0.88 doc F1), but accept lower accuracy (57-61%).\n4. **Don't use semantic chunking on academic text.** It fragments too aggressively (43 avg tokens) and collapses on document retrieval (0.42 F1).\n5. **Don't use proposition chunking for general RAG.** 51% accuracy isn't production-ready. It's only viable if you value groundedness over correctness.\n6. **When benchmarking, equalize the context budget.** Fixed top-k comparisons are misleading. Use adaptive k = round(target\\_tokens / avg\\_chunk\\_tokens).\n\n# Why Academic Papers Specifically?\n\nWe deliberately chose to saturate the academic paper region of the embedding space with 50 papers spanning 10+ disciplines. When your knowledge base contains papers that all discuss \"evaluation,\" \"metrics,\" \"models,\" and \"performance,\" the retriever has to make fine-grained distinctions. That's when chunking quality matters most.\n\nIn a mixed corpus of recipes and legal contracts, even bad chunking might work because the embedding distances between domains are large. Academic papers are the *hard case* for chunking, and if a strategy works here, it'll work on easier data too.\n\n# How We Measured This (And How You Can Too)\n\nMy team built [Vecta](https://www.runvecta.com/) specifically to meet the need for precise RAG evaluation software. It generates synthetic benchmark Q&A pairs across multiple semantic granularities, then measures precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and groundedness against your actual retrieval pipeline.\n\nThe benchmarks in this post were generated and evaluated using Vecta's SDK (`pip install vecta`)\n\n# Limitations, Experiment Design, and Further Work\n\nThis experiment was deliberately small-scale: 50 papers, 30 synthetic Q&A pairs, one embedding model, one retriever, one generator. That's by design. We wanted something reproducible that a single engineer could rerun in an afternoon, not a months-long research project. The conclusions should be read with that scope in mind.\n\n**Synthetic benchmarks are not human benchmarks.** Our ground-truth Q&A pairs were generated by Vecta's own pipeline, which means there's an inherent alignment between how questions are formed and how they're evaluated. Human-authored questions would be a stronger test. That said, Vecta's benchmark generation does produce complex multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information across multiple chunks and document locations, so these aren't trivially easy questions that favor any one strategy by default.\n\n**One pipeline, one result.** Everything here runs on `text-embedding-3-small`, ChromaDB, and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. Swap any of those components and the rankings could shift. We fully acknowledge this. Running the same experiment across multiple embedding models, vector databases, and generators would be valuable follow-up work, and it's on our roadmap.\n\n**The equal context budget is a deliberate constraint, not a flaw.** Some readers may object that semantic and proposition chunking are \"meant\" to be paired with rerankers, fusion, or hierarchical aggregation. But if a chunking strategy only works when combined with additional infrastructure, that's important to know. Equal context budgets ensure we're comparing chunking quality at roughly equal generation cost. A strategy that requires a reranker to be competitive is a more expensive strategy, and that should factor into the decision.\n\n**Semantic chunking was not intentionally handicapped.** Our semantic chunking produced fragments averaging 43 tokens, which is smaller than most production deployments would target. This was likely due to a poorly tuned cosine similarity threshold (0.7) rather than any deliberate sabotage. But that's actually the point: semantic chunking requires careful threshold tuning, merging heuristics, and often parent-child retrieval to work well. When those aren't perfectly dialed in, it degrades badly. Recursive splitting, by contrast, produced strong results with default parameters. The brittleness of semantic chunking under imperfect tuning is itself a finding.\n\n**What we'd like to do next:**\n\n* Rerun the experiment with human-authored Q&A pairs alongside the synthetic benchmark\n* Test across multiple embedding models (`text-embedding-3-large`, open-source alternatives) and generators (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama)\n* Add reranking and hierarchical retrieval stages, then measure whether the rankings change when every strategy gets access to the same post-retrieval pipeline\n* Expand the corpus beyond academic papers to contracts, documentation, support tickets, and other common RAG domains\n* Test semantic chunking with properly tuned thresholds, chunk merging, and sliding windows to establish its ceiling\n\nIf you run any of these experiments yourself, we'd genuinely like to see the results.\n\nHave a chunking strategy that worked surprisingly well (or badly) for you?

      "text": "The Problem:  \nAsked about \"max heating capacity of refrigerator\". Got a mixed answer combining V6, V8, and other refrigerator variants.\n\nThe Fix - 4 Simple Approaches:\n\n1. Force Clarification Before Searching Ambiguous query: Agent stops and asks. \"Refrigerator\" has 3 variants V4, V6 and V8 which one do you mean?\n2. No guessing. No assumptions.\n3. Query Decomposition: Break every request into required pieces (eg. sperate queries for heating and cooling capacity). Do parallel execution for each query and combine the unique results of dense and sparse.\n4. Filtering (most effective): Apply filters once the user confirms their product, filter documents BEFORE retrieval. Think \"search only in Building A, Floor 3\" instead of \"search the entire campus.\" Let the agent apply filters dynamically.\n5. Context Pruning: Long conversations hit token limits fast. Prune old search results. Drop the heavy intermediate retrieval data.\n\nThe Result: The agent now asks \"Which one?\" instead of making assumptions.\n\nCode snippet for the tool calling,\n\n    class SearchInput(BaseModel):\n        query: str = Field(description=\"The specific query to search for in the knowledge base., For complex requests, break this down into specific sub-queries.\")\n        target_directory: Optional[str] = Field(\n            description=(\n                \"Crucial for filtering. Apply precise folder paths based on the user's confirmed product category \"\n                \"(e.g., 'v6_idu/ac', 'v8_idu/wall_mounted', 'vrf_odu/side_discharge'). \"\n                \"Only leave empty if the user asks a broad, cross-category comparison question.\"\n            )\n        )\n    \n    @tool(args_schema=SearchInput, response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\n    async def knowledge_base_search(query: str, target_directory: Optional[str] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Executes a search within the technical documentation. \n        \n        Usage Guidelines:\n        1. **Precision:** Always apply the `target_directory` derived to exclude irrelevant product lines (e.g., filtering out 'V6' when the user asks for 'V8').\n        2. **Iteration:** Call this tool multiple times if the initial search results are missing required data points.\n        3. **Scope:** Returns raw documentation chunks relevant to the query and path.\n        \"\"\"\n\nI structured the product data in folders and sub-folders that represent a hierarchy. Something like this, for other type of data this can be done based on financial years /  companies / authors / product types.\n\n    VRF\n    ├── V6 IDU\n        ├── AC\n    ├── V8 IDU\n        ├── DC\n        ├── AC\n    └── VRF ODU\n        ├── AC\n        ├── V6R\n        ├── V8\n        │   ├── V8 Master\n        │   ├── V8 Pro\n        └── VC pro\n\nThis structure can be directly given in the system prompt, or if the structure is big then create a new \\`get\\_folder\\_structure\\` tool that uses fuzzy logic to get relevant paths.\n\nNow if we ask, What is the max cooling capacity of V8 IDU?  \nLLM will first ask whether you mean  V8 IDU AC or V8 IDU DC.",

Single explanation gets split across two chunks. Tables lose their structure. Headers separate from data. The chunks going into your vector DB are semantically incoherent.\n\nI've been testing semantic boundary detection instead where I use a model to find where topics actually change. Generate embeddings for each sentence, calculate similarity between consecutive ones, split when it sees sharp drops. The results are variable chunks but each represents a complete clear idea.\n\nThis alone gets 2-3 percentage points better recall but the bigger win for me was adding metadata. I pass each chunk through an LLM to extract time periods, doc types, entities, whatever structured info matters and store that alongside the embedding.\n\nThis metadata filters narrow the search space first, then vector similarity runs on that subset. Searching 47 relevant chunks instead of 20,000 random ones.\n\nFor complex documents with inherent structure this seems obviously better than fixed chunking. Anyway thought I should share. :)\n\n",

Less impressive in production. Research shows that performance degrades as context grows and this effect becomes significant beyond 100k tokens \\[[Context Rot: How Increasing Input Tokens Impacts LLM Performance, Hong, Troynikov & Huber, Chroma, 2025](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)\\]  \nI've felt this firsthand. Context rot in my own applications at just 40–50k tokens. The ceiling isn't 1M. It's far lower.  \nMeanwhile, enterprise knowledge bases contain billions of tokens. The math doesn't work. You will never stuff your way to an answer.  \n  \nAgents aren't a silver bullet either.  \nProgressive disclosure lets agents traverse massive codebases and document sets, but every hop is a lossy compression. Information degrades. Reasoning quality drops. The growing wave of agentic workflows is itself a signal: frontier model improvements are slowing. The delta between model generations is shrinking. Future gains will come from agentic engineering around models, not from the models themselves.  \nSo if today's LLMs are roughly as good as it gets, how do you leverage massive knowledge bases? RAG. Still.  \nNot the naive RAG of 2023. Smarter retrieval. Better chunking. Hybrid search. Context engineering. Agentic. But the core idea of RAG is more important now than ever. Retrieve what's relevant, discard what isn't.  \n  \nRAG isn't a workaround. It's a non-trivial part of the architecture.",

It embeds, chunck the pdf files and i can chat with them.\n\nBut the answers are shit. Not sure why….\n\nThe way i built it is using a openotebooklm open source and then i built on top if it, editing alot of stuff.\n\nI use google embedding 004, gemini 2.0 for chatting, i also use Surrelbd.\n\nI am not sure what is the best structure to build one? Should i Start from scratch with a different approach? All i want is a rag model with 4 files (Legal guidance) as its knowledge base and then j upload a project files and then the chat should correlate the project files with the existing knowledge base and give precise answers like Notebooklm.",

      "text": "Some helpful insights from one of our senior software engineers, Muhammad Imtiaz.\n\n# Introduction\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a paradigm shift in how artificial intelligence systems access and utilize information. By combining the generative capabilities of large language models with dynamic information retrieval from external knowledge bases, RAG systems overcome the fundamental limitations of standalone language models—namely, their reliance on static training data and tendency toward hallucination.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive technical reference covering the essential concepts, components, and implementation patterns that form the foundation of modern RAG architectures. Each concept is presented with clear explanations, practical code examples in Go, and real-world considerations for building production-grade systems.\n\nWhether you are architecting a new RAG system, optimizing an existing implementation, or seeking to understand the theoretical underpinnings of retrieval-augmented approaches, this reference provides the knowledge necessary to build accurate, efficient, and trustworthy AI applications. The concepts range from fundamental building blocks like embeddings and vector databases to advanced techniques such as hybrid search, re-ranking, and agentic RAG architectures.\n\nAs the field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, RAG remains at the forefront of practical AI deployment, enabling systems that are both powerful and grounded in verifiable information.\n\n# Core Concepts and Implementation Patterns\n\n**Generator (Language Model)**\n\nThe component that generates the final answer using the retrieved context.\n\n**Retrieval**\n\nRetrieval is the process of identifying and extracting relevant information from a knowledge base before generating a response. It acts as the AI’s research phase, gathering necessary context from available documents before answering.\n\nRather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, retrieval enables the AI to access up-to-date, domain-specific information from documents, databases, or other knowledge sources.\n\nIn the example below, the retriever selects the top five most relevant documents and provides them to the LLM to generate the final answer.\n\n`relevantDocs := vectorDB.Search(query, 5) // top_k=5`  \n`answer := llm.Generate(query, relevantDocs)`\n\n**Embeddings**\n\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They convert words, sentences, or documents into dense vectors that preserve context and relationships.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to generate embeddings using the OpenAI API.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"context\"`  \n`\"github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`client := openai.NewClient(\"your-token\")`  \n`resp, err := client.CreateEmbeddings(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`openai.EmbeddingRequest{`  \n`Input: []string{\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\"},`  \n`Model: openai.SmallEmbedding3,`  \n`},`  \n`)`  \n`if err != nil {`  \n`log.Fatal(err)`  \n`}`  \n`vector := resp.Data[0].Embedding`\n\n# Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are specialized systems designed to store and query high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches, they use distance metrics to identify semantically similar content.\n\nThey support fast similarity searches across millions of documents in milliseconds, making them essential for scalable RAG systems.\n\nThe example below shows how to create a collection and add documents with embeddings using the Chroma client.\n\n`import \"github.com/chroma-core/chroma-go\"`  \n  \n`client := chroma.NewClient()`  \n`collection, _ := client.CreateCollection(\"docs\")`  \n  \n`// Generate embeddings for documents`  \n`docs := []string{\"RAG improves accuracy\", \"LLMs can hallucinate\"}`  \n`emb1 := embedder.Embed(docs[0])`  \n`emb2 := embedder.Embed(docs[1])`  \n  \n`// Add documents with their embeddings`  \n`collection.Add(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`chroma.WithIDs([]string{\"doc1\", \"doc2\"}),`  \n`chroma.WithEmbeddings([][]float32{emb1, emb2}),`  \n`chroma.WithDocuments(docs),`  \n`)`\n\n# Retriever\n\nA retriever is a component that manages the retrieval process. It converts a user query into an embedding, searches the vector database, and returns the most relevant document chunks.\n\nIt functions like a smart librarian, understanding the query and locating the most relevant information within a large collection.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic retriever implementation.\n\n`type Retriever struct {`  \n`VectorDB VectorDB`  \n`}`  \n  \n`func (r *Retriever) Retrieve(query string, topK int) []Result {`  \n`queryVector := Embed(query)`  \n`return r.VectorDB.Search(queryVector, topK)`  \n`}`\n\n# Chunking\n\nChunking is the process of dividing large documents into smaller, manageable segments called “chunks.” Effective chunking preserves semantic meaning while ensuring content fits within model context limits.\n\nProper chunking is essential, as it directly affects retrieval quality. Well-structured chunks improve precision and support more accurate responses.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a character-based chunking function with overlap support.\n\n`func ChunkText(text string, chunkSize, overlap int) []string {`  \n`var chunks []string`  \n`runes := []rune(text)`  \n`for start := 0; start < len(runes); start += (chunkSize - overlap) {`  \n`end := start + chunkSize`  \n`if end > len(runes) {`  \n`end = len(runes)`  \n`}`  \n`chunks = append(chunks, string(runes[start:end]))`  \n  \n`if end >= len(runes) {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n`return chunks`  \n`}`  \n  \n`chunks := ChunkText(document, 500, 50)`\n\n# Context Window\n\nThe context window is the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) an LLM can process in a single request. It defines the model’s working memory and the amount of context that can be included.\n\nContext windows range from 4K tokens in older models to over 200K in modern ones. Retrieved chunks must fit within this limit, making chunk size and selection critical.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to fit chunks within a token limit.\n\n`func FitContext(chunks []string, maxTokens int) []string {`  \n`var context []string`  \n`tokenCount := 0`  \n  \n`for _, chunk := range chunks {`  \n`chunkTokens := CountTokens(chunk)`  \n`if tokenCount + chunkTokens > maxTokens {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`context = append(context, chunk)`  \n`tokenCount += chunkTokens`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return context`  \n`}`\n\n# Grounding\n\nGrounding ensures AI responses are based on retrieved, verifiable sources rather than hallucinated information. It keeps the model anchored to real data.\n\nEffective grounding requires citing specific sources and relying only on the provided context to support claims. This reduces hallucinations and improves trustworthiness.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a grounding prompt template.\n\n`prompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Answer the question using ONLY the provided context.`  \n`Cite the source for each claim.`  \n`Context: %s`  \n  \n`Question: %s`  \n  \n`Answer with citations:`  \n`\\`, retrievedDocs, userQuestion)`  \n  \n`response := llm.Generate(prompt)`\n\n# Re-Ranking\n\nTwo-stage retrieval enhances result quality by combining speed and precision. First, a fast initial search retrieves many candidates (e.g., top 100). Then, a more accurate cross-encoder model re-ranks them to identify the best matches.\n\nThis approach pairs broad retrieval with fine-grained scoring for optimal results.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic re-ranking workflow.\n\n`// Initial fast retrieval`  \n`candidates := retriever.Search(query, 100)`  \n  \n`// Re-rank using a CrossEncoder`  \n`scores := reranker.Predict(query, candidates)`  \n  \n`// Sort candidates by score and take top 5`  \n`topDocs := SortByScore(candidates, scores)[:5]`\n\n# Hybrid Search\n\nHybrid search combines keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search. It leverages both exact term matching and meaning-based similarity to improve retrieval accuracy.\n\nBy blending keyword and semantic scores, it provides the precision of exact matches along with the flexibility of understanding conceptual queries.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a hybrid search implementation.\n\n`func HybridSearch(query string, alpha float64) []Result {`  \n`keywordResults := BM25Search(query)`  \n`semanticResults := VectorSearch(query)`  \n  \n`// Combine scores:`  \n`// finalScore = alpha * keywordScore + (1-alpha) * semanticScore`  \n`finalResults := CombineAndRank(keywordResults, semanticResults, alpha)`  \n  \n`return finalResults[:5]`  \n`}`\n\n# Metadata Filtering\n\nMetadata filtering narrows search results by using document attributes such as dates, authors, types, or departments before performing a semantic search. This reduces noise and improves precision.\n\nApplying filters like author: John Doe or document\\_type: report focuses the search on the most relevant documents.\n\nThe example below demonstrates metadata filtering in a vector database query.\n\n`results := collection.Query(`  \n`Query{`  \n`Texts: []string{\"quarterly revenue\"},`  \n`TopK: 10,`  \n`Where: map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"year\":       2024,`  \n`\"department\": \"sales\",`  \n`\"type\": map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"$in\": []string{\"report\", \"presentation\"},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`)`\n\n# Similarity Search\n\nThe retriever is the core search mechanism in RAG, identifying documents whose embeddings are most similar to a query’s embedding. It evaluates semantic closeness rather than just keyword matches.\n\nSimilarity is typically measured using cosine similarity (angle between vectors) or dot product, with higher scores indicating more relevant content.\n\nThe example below demonstrates cosine similarity using the Gonum library.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`func CosineSimilarity(vec1, vec2 []float64) float64 {`  \n`v1 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec1), vec1)`  \n`v2 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec2), vec2)`  \n  \n`dotProduct := mat.Dot(v1, v2)`  \n`norm1 := mat.Norm(v1, 2)`  \n`norm2 := mat.Norm(v2, 2)`  \n  \n`return dotProduct / (norm1 * norm2)`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Usage example`  \n`queryVec := Embed(query)`  \n`for _, docVec := range documentVectors {`  \n`score := CosineSimilarity(queryVec, docVec)`  \n`// Store score for ranking`  \n`}`\n\n# Prompt Injection\n\nPrompt injection is a security vulnerability where malicious users embed instructions in queries to manipulate AI behavior. Attackers may attempt to override system prompts or extract sensitive information.\n\nCommon examples include phrases like “ignore previous instructions” or “reveal your system prompt.” RAG systems must sanitize inputs to prevent such attacks.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic input sanitization function. In production, multiple defenses—such as regex patterns, semantic similarity checks, and output validation—are required.\n\n`func SanitizeInput(userInput string) (string, error) {`  \n`// Basic pattern matching - extend with regex for production use`  \n`dangerousPatterns := []string{`  \n`\"ignore previous instructions\",`  \n`\"disregard system prompt\",`  \n`\"reveal your instructions\",`  \n`\"ignore all prior\",`  \n`\"bypass security\",`  \n`}`  \n  \n`lowerInput := strings.ToLower(userInput)`  \n`for _, pattern := range dangerousPatterns {`  \n`if strings.Contains(lowerInput, pattern) {`  \n`return \"\", errors.New(\"invalid input detected\")`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Additional checks for production:`  \n`// - Regex for obfuscated patterns (e.g., \"ign0re\")`  \n`// - Semantic similarity to known attack phrases`  \n`// - Length and character validation`  \n  \n`return userInput, nil`  \n`}`\n\n# Hallucination\n\nGenerative AI can produce convincing but incorrect information, including false facts, fake citations, or invented details.\n\nRAG helps reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, though proper grounding and citation are essential to minimize risk.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a verification function that checks whether a response is supported by source documents. For higher reliability, consider using Natural Language Inference  models or extractive fact-checking, as relying on one LLM to verify another has limitations.\n\n`func IsSupported(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`verificationPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Response: %s`  \n`Source: %s`  \n  \n`Is this response fully supported by the source documents?`  \n`Answer yes or no.`  \n`\\`, response, sourceDocs)`  \n  \n`result := llm.Generate(verificationPrompt)`  \n`return strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(result)) == \"yes\"`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Alternative: Use NLI model for more reliable verification`  \n`func IsSupportedNLI(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`// NLI models classify as: entailment, contradiction, or neutral`  \n`result := nliModel.Predict(sourceDocs, response)`  \n`return result.Label == \"entailment\" && result.Score > 0.8`  \n`}`\n\n# Agentic RAG\n\nAgentic RAG is an advanced architecture where the AI actively plans, reasons, and controls its own retrieval strategy. Rather than performing a single search, the agent can conduct multiple searches, analyze results, and iterate.\n\nIt autonomously decides what information to retrieve, when to search again, which tools to use, and how to synthesize multiple sources—enabling complex, multi-step reasoning.\n\nThe example below demonstrates an agentic RAG implementation.\n\n`func (a *AgenticRAG) Answer(query string) string {`  \n`plan := a.llm.CreatePlan(query)`  \n  \n`for _, step := range plan.Steps {`  \n`switch step.Action {`  \n`case \"search\":`  \n`results := a.retriever.Search(step.Query)`  \n`a.context.Add(results)`  \n`case \"reason\":`  \n`analysis := a.llm.Analyze(a.context)`  \n`a.context.Add(analysis)`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return a.llm.Synthesize(a.context)`  \n`}`\n\n# Latency\n\nRAG latency is the total time from a user query to the final response, including embedding generation, vector search, re-ranking (if used), and LLM generation. Each step contributes to the delay.\n\nLatency directly impacts user experience and can be optimized by caching embeddings, using faster models, narrowing search scope, and parallelizing operations. Typical RAG systems aim for sub-second to a few seconds of latency.\n\nThe example below measures latency for each stage of the RAG pipeline.\n\n`import \"time\"`  \n  \n`func MeasureLatency(query string) {`  \n`start := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 1: Embed query`  \n`embedding := Embed(query)`  \n`t1 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 2: Search`  \n`results := vectorDB.Search(embedding)`  \n`t2 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 3: Generate`  \n`response := llm.Generate(query, results)`  \n`t3 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`fmt.Printf(\"Embed: %v | Search: %v | Generate: %v\\n\",`  \n`t1.Sub(start), t2.Sub(t1), t3.Sub(t2))`  \n`}`\n\n  \nHope this all helps!",

      "text": "Looks like it's a chunking day here. :) Let me add my 5 cents.\n\nMost “RAG accuracy” problems show up later as people tweak rerankers, prompts, models, etc.\n\nBut a huge % of failures start earlier: chunking.\n\nIf the right info can’t be retrieved cleanly, the model can’t “think” its way out. It’ll either hallucinate, or answer confidently from partial context.\n\nLet's start with the definition: A chunk is the smallest unit of meaning (!) that can answer a real question without needing its neighbors.\n\nToo big → you retrieve the answer plus extra junk → model gets distracted (precision drops). Too small → you retrieve fragments → missing context (recall drops). Wrong boundaries → meaning gets shredded (definitions, steps, tables…).\n\n# 3 common symptoms your chunking is broken\n\n1. Chunks too big: top-k retrieval contains the answer but also unrelated sections → the LLM free-associates.\n2. Chunks too small: the answer exists but is split across boundaries → retrieval misses it.\n3. Bad split points: tables, lists, procedures, “Definitions” sections → you split exactly where coherence matters.\n\n# There are actually 3 chunking modes that cover most real-world docs (NOT ALL of them, still)\n\n# Mode 1) Structure-first (best default)\n\nUse for: technical manuals, policies, specs, handbooks, wikis (anything with headings).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Chunk by heading hierarchy (H2/H3 sections)\n* Keep paragraphs intact\n* Keep lists/tables/code blocks intact\n* Store section\\_path metadata (e.g., Security > Access Control > MFA)\n\nWhy it works: your doc already has a map. Don’t throw it away.\n\n# Mode 2) Semantic windows (for messy conversational text)\n\nUse for: transcripts, email threads, Slack dumps, scraped webpages (weak structure, topic drift).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Build topic-coherent “windows” (don’t hard-split blindly)\n* Use adaptive overlap only when meaning crosses boundaries\n   * Q → A turns\n   * follow-ups (“what about…”, “as mentioned earlier…”)\n   * references to earlier context\n\nWhy it works: conversation doesn’t respect token boundaries.\n\n# Mode 3) Atomic facts + parent fallback (support/FAQ style)\n\nUse for: FAQs, troubleshooting, runbooks, support KBs (answers are small + repetitive).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Index atomic chunks (1–3 paragraphs or one step-group)\n* Store pointer to parent section\n* Retrieval policy:\n   * fetch atom first\n   * if answer looks incomplete / low confidence → fetch parent\n\nWhy it works: high precision by default, but you can pull context when needed.\n\n# Most useful tweaks\n\n# Overlap: use it like salt, not soup\n\nDon't do “20% overlap” everywhere.\n\nOverlap is for dependency, not tradition:\n\n* 0 overlap: self-contained sections\n* small overlap: narrative text\n* bigger overlap: procedures + conversational threads + “as mentioned above” content\n\n# Tables are special (many mess this up)\n\nDo not split tables mid-row or mid-header.\n\n* Store the whole table as one chunk + create a table summary chunk\n* Or chunk by row, but repeat headers + key columns in every row chunk\n\n# Metadata: the cheap accuracy boost people sometimes forget\n\nStore at least:\n\n* `doc_id`\n* `section_path`\n* `chunk_type` (policy / procedure / faq / table / code)\n* `version` / `effective_date` (if docs change)\n* `audience` (legal / support / eng)\n\nThis enables filtering before vector search and reduces “wrong-but-related” retrieval.\n\n# How to test chunking fast (with no fancy eval framework)\n\nTake 30 real user questions (not synthetic).\n\nFor each:\n\n* retrieve top-5\n* score: Does any chunk contain the answer verbatim or with minimal inference?\n\nInterpretation:\n\n* Often “no” → boundaries wrong / chunks too small / missing metadata filters\n* Answer exists but not ranked → ranking/reranker/metadata issue\n\nBonus gut-check: Take 10 questions and open the top retrieved chunk. If you keep thinking “the answer is almost here but needs the previous paragraph”… your chunk boundaries are wrong.\n\n# Practical starting defaults (if you just want numbers)\n\nThese aren’t laws, just decent baselines:\n\n* Manuals/policies/specs: structure-first, \\~300–800 tokens\n* Procedures: chunk by step groups, keep prerequisites + warnings with steps\n* FAQs/support: atomic \\~150–400 tokens + parent fallback\n* Transcripts: semantic windows \\~200–500 tokens + adaptive overlap\n\n# What we actually do for large-scale production use cases\n\nWe test extensively and automate the whole process\n\n* Chunking is automated per document type and ALWAYS considers document structure (no mid-word/sentence/table breaks)\n* For each document type there's more than one chunking approach\n* Evals are automated (created automatically and tested automatically on every pipeline change)\n* Extensive testing is the core. For each project different chunking strategies are tested and compared versus each other (here automated evals add velocity) As a result of these automations we receive good accuracy with little \"manual RAG drag\" and in a matter of days.",

Having an in-house pipeline makes things easier, as you know your data best, as well as you know your domain best, so you can anticipate end user interactions better.\n\nI have implemented a chunking strategy based (completely in-house), where you convert unstructured PDF data to markdown, and use OCR on figures. Then, creating chunks for sections and sub-sections, and creating separate chunks for figures and tables with cross-references in the main chunk. This allows to preserve to a large extent the hierarchy. \n\nSpending some time in the document preparation and processing stage has been quite fruitful. Although, nowadays most providers have the option to use in-built retrieval tools, it’s quite satisfying to see your own implementation working in a real world product.",

      "text": "bb25 v0.2.0 is out — a Python + Rust implementation of Bayesian BM25 that turns search scores into calibrated probabilities.\n\n[https://github.com/instructkr/bb25](https://github.com/instructkr/bb25)\n\nA week ago, I built bb25 that turns BM25 into a probability engine! In addition to the Rust-based implementation, the paper's author shipped his own implementation. Comparing the two taught me more than the paper itself.\n\nThe Bayesian BM25 paper does something elegant, in that applying Bayes' theorem to BM25 scores so they become real probabilities, not arbitrary numbers. This makes hybrid search fusion mathematically principled instead of heuristic.\n\nInstruct.KR's bb25 took a ground-up approach, tokenizer, inverted index, scorers, 10 experiments mapping to the paper's theorems, plus a Rust port. Jaepil's implementation took the opposite path, a thin NumPy layer that plugs into existing search systems.\n\nReading both codebases side by side, I found my document length prior has room to improvement (e.g. monotonic decay instead of symmetric bell curve), my probability AND suffered from shrinkage, and I further added automatic parameter estimation and online learning entirely.\n\nbb25 v0.2.0 introduces all four. One fun discovery along the way, my Rust code already had the correct log-odds conjunction, but I had never backported it to Python. Same project, two different AND operations.\n\nThe deeper surprise came from a formula in the reference material. Expand the Bayesian posterior and you get the structure of an artificial neuron! Think of weighted sum, bias, sigmoid activation. Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, Attention all have Bayesian derivations. A 50-year-old search algorithm leads straight to the mathematical roots of neural networks.\n\nAll creds to Jaepil and Cognica Team!",

They asked us for a discovery meeting.  But they basically knew what solutions they want. We picked the most interesting one.\n\nWhat was the scope? - Some very specific document/outcome search. But not just semantics stuff, but some path dependent precedents + analytics. The LLM basically only summarizes the output. Traceability was most important. \n\n\n\nHow long did the project take from discovery to delivery? - \\~1 month from discovery to signing. Pilot delivery \\~6 weeks. A lot of follow ups needed.\n\nWhat were the biggest technical challenges you faced? - Preprocessing shitty data.\n\nDid you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery? - We handle maintenance if something breaks.\n\n\n\nHow did you find these clients? - Network / they found us.\n\nWhat did you charge? - Our deal was kinda different so any inside from me here will not reflect real market value. We did a research project for them at special conditions (highly profitable for both sides).\n\nHow did you structure pricing? - Fixed price per month for developing with 2 months of expected development time. We granted the option to exit the project after 1 month without paying for 2. If we would build in a different setting we surely would go for usual 30/40/30 splits.\n\n\n\nWere clients happy with the results? - Yes.\n\nDid you iterate/improve the system after launch? - Not yet but we do run market research to evaluate if this may fit a broader audience.\n\nAny lessons learned that you'd do differently next time? - Nothing we really did wrong but the project shifted my view on RAG, from \"some useless semantic search\" to a more broader, creative approach.   \nBut I will add that RAG can't to magic for LLMs. If your project scope is fundamentally not solvable by an LLM (for example writing high quality law stuff), RAG will not change it. \n\n",

The main work was making the outputs more deterministic and structured (fields, tables, clean exports) rather than conversational.\n\nThe result is that you can now pull usable data from PDFs and long documents without manually hunting through them or post-processing chat responses.\n\nHuge thanks to the beta users who tested early versions and gave thoughtful, honest feedback. This feature exists largely because people were clear about what wasn’t working and what would actually make the product useful.\n\nStill early, but it’s moving in a much more practical direction.\n\nIf you deal with document-heavy workflows and care about reliable, structured outputs. I’d love more feedback.",

Extraction runs as an agentic workflow where retrieval, validation, and re-checks happen iteratively based on schema needs. So that helps a little.\n\nSchema drift is handled by keeping schemas intent-based rather than layout-dependent. Missing or ambiguous fields are allowed instead of forcing guesses. Multi-table PDFs are handled as independent units. Cross-page references are resolved by expanding retrieval when required. But still,  no matter how robust we make it, there're always some outlier PDFs which don't properly fit into this. \n\nOCR is supported for scanned PDFs and images and works well, with quality depending on input. OCR noise reduction is a problem we're focusing on now. I'm trying to involve LLMs as little as possible to make this more robust and generalised and to reduce token usage ofcourse. Also actively working on improving OCR for handwritten documents. Many teams asked specifically if they can use this on legacy handwritten documents, especially in the manufacturing domain.",

There's always some block either missing or not part of the correct group, for example: \n\n* list items interpreted as being text block, thus not being part of a list group\n* header of a table not being interpreted as the header of that table, but as a header of the section the table lies within. So basically the table is missing a piece of information. \n\nWith my projects demand for accuracy Docling is not enough, but it's so so close! \n\nPlease tell me if there's some way to configure Docling, possibly making it convert tables differently? Or maybe there is some functionality of Docling I'am not utilizing?  \nOr maybe this is the exact problem with pdfs having different layout, and for 100% accuracy I need another approach than Docling?\n\nThank you for taking your time!",

You're not answering one question, you're running 50 targeted extractions across a massive document set where the answer for each could be anywhere.\n\n**For those who've built something similar:** How do you approach retrieval when the document is huge, the features are predefined, and simple semantic search isn't enough?\n\nCurious about any strategies — chunking, retrieval, reranking, or completely different architectures.",

Typically first few pages.  \n2) At time of query, only expose the document titles and their TOCs either in the prompt, tools or MCP  \n3) The trick is to let the agent decide which documents (and/or pages) given are likely relevant to the user's query.  \n4) Let the agent scope and perform its RAG search filtered on the matched documents  \n5) Extend via deepsearch-like looping where the agent can repeat steps 2-4 until it finds a suitable answer\n\nThis approach differs by being top down as opposed to just diving straight into the contents and working out where you are is bottom up. Of course,  works better if the document has a TOC otherwise the alternative is parsing the documents to essentially generate your own TOC.\n\nAlso as a fellow enthusiast in handling large documents, would love some feedback on something I'm building [ragextract.com](http://ragextract.com) and how it compares to your pipeline (particularly interested in what you're doing for retrieval).

Benchmarks are still being formalized, but it’s already usable for local RAG experiments.\n\nGitHub is here if anyone wants to try it:  \n[https://github.com/RYJOX-Technologies/Synrix-Memory-Engine]()\n\nThis is still early, and we’d genuinely love feedback from people building RAG systems:\n\n* How are you handling retrieval today?\n* What pain points do you hit with vector DBs?\n* What would you want to see benchmarked or improved?\n\nHappy to answer questions, and thanks in advance for any thoughts 🙂",

That seems like a category error in terms of comparison, as essentially all of the major DBs have efficient prefix lookups as well. These include many DBs that are open source and can be run locally or even in process. I’d be more interested in seeing side by side comparisons of equivalent search methods against some major open source DBs.  \n\nAlso, a search scaling only with the top-k result count sounds impossible, unless you’re talking about simple hash lookup on a key. But if that’s what you’re talking about then you need to already know a priori the exact piece of data you want to lookup. And even then in practice B-trees will be more efficient for ID lookups than using a hash on large DBs (so also not independent of DB size).\n\nMaybe you can clarify your intentions, your claims, or how things work since nothing on your repo or your website really provide any explanation, technical detail, examples, or actual benchmarks/comparisons.",

User will ask a question about some app, then have a router which uses keyword matching initially, falling back to LLM-based routing to determine which data source is the best one.\n2. Then do I need a query transformation like multi-querying and step back to get a better phrased question. Is this step necessary or its just a overhead?\n3. Then using [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) for vector database which will embed the documents/databases/links on start-up(currently basically creates a snapshot of the data on initial app start-up) and basically do semantic search  using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings.\n4. Cross-encoder model to score and filter documents from retrieved documents, based on query-document relevance, reducing hallucinations by excluding low-confidence results , taking the top 8 docs since creating a local version of my age old pc.\n5. Answer Generation\n6. On start-up, the application exports database tables and Confluence pages to JSON documents, which are then chunked into 512 even sized chunks with text overlapping and embedded into Qdrant alongside static JSON documents. Is this static method of snapshotting the DB or better creating a pipeline which will repeat after some days\n\n6)Here are my model choices are they good for my self hosted application\n\n* LLM: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`\n* Embedding: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n* Reranker: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6-v2` If not, what alternatives would you suggest?\n\nAny suggestions or things i can improve upon would be appreciated!",

Architecture: Is it better to use a static graph, dynamic query-time graph, or agentic Graph RAG for legal domains? What worked best for you in production?\n2. Relations: What are the most effective techniques for creating strong relations between chunks in legal documents? Entity backbone plus LLM triples? Cross-reference edges? NLI or contradiction edges? Temporal and amendment links? or any other approches?\n\nIf you had to pick a small high-impact stack, what would it be?\n\n1. Chunking What chunking strategy works best for law? Clause level, section level, sliding window, or hybrid?\n2. Evaluation How do you measure quality in legal Graph RAG? Citation precision, lawyer review, curated multi-hop Q&A?\n\nWould appreciate practical advice from anyone who have knowledge of Graph RAG  \nThank You",

          "text": "legal graph RAG is one of the harder setups because the relationships between documents actually matter for correctness — you can't just do similarity search and hope for the best.\n\n  \non architecture: go agentic over static. in legal you constantly need to trace things like \"this clause was amended by X statute on Y date\" or \"this ruling cites and partially overrules case Z.\" a static graph can't adapt to these multi-hop paths well because the traversal pattern changes based on the query type. an agentic approach where the model decides which edges to follow based on the question gives you much better citation chains.\n\n  \nfor chunking: clause-level is the way to go for legal. section-level loses the granularity you need for citation accuracy (you want to point to the exact clause, not a whole section). but keep the section hierarchy as metadata so you can still navigate up/down the document structure.\n\n  \non relations — cross-reference edges + temporal links are probably the highest-impact combo. statutes constantly reference each other and get amended over time. NLI edges are cool in theory but expensive to compute at scale and contradiction detection accuracy in legal language is still sketchy.\n\n  \nfor eval: curated multi-hop Q&A sets with lawyer review on the citations is the gold standard. automated metrics alone won't catch hallucinated citations that look plausible.",

      "text": "I've been researching RAG failure patterns for a few months and one thing kept coming up: most pipeline failures I looked at didn't trace back to the generation model. They traced back to how the data was chunked before retrieval even happened.\n\nThe pattern looks like this: vector search returns chunks that score high on relevance. The LLM generates a confident, well-formatted answer. But the answer is wrong because the chunk boundary split a piece of context that needed to stay together. Swapping in a stronger model doesn't help here. It just produces more convincing hallucinations from the same incomplete context.\n\nThree patterns that consistently helped in the systems I studied:\n\n**Parent-child chunking:** You index small child chunks for retrieval precision, but at generation time you pass the larger parent chunk so the model gets surrounding context. LlamaIndex has a good implementation of this with their `AutoMergingRetriever`. This alone caught a big chunk of \"almost right but wrong\" failures.\n\n**Hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25):** Pure embedding search misses exact-match terms. Product names, error codes, config values, specific IDs. Running BM25 keyword search alongside vector retrieval and merging results (Reciprocal Rank Fusion works well here) picks up what embeddings miss. Langchain and Haystack both support this pattern out of the box.\n\n**Self-correcting retrieval loops:** Before returning a response, the pipeline evaluates whether the answer is actually grounded in the retrieved chunks. If groundedness scores low, it reformulates the query and retries. The original Self-RAG paper by Asai et al. (2023) covers this well, and CRAG (Corrective RAG) by Yan et al. (2024) extends it further.\n\nI am just curious what others here have run into.   \nWhat has been your worst chunking or retrieval failure?   \nThe kind where everything looked fine on the retrieval side until you actually checked the output against the source documents.",

Had a pipeline where table rows kept getting split across two chunks. The embedding for each chunk was technically relevant to the query, retrieval scored it high, but the model was generating answers from half a table row. Took weeks to trace because the outputs looked confident and formatted correctly.\n\nThe fix wasn't a better chunking strategy though. It was fixing what went into the chunker. The source data was markdown with navigation elements, breadcrumbs, and related links all mixed in with the actual content. Once I switched to extracting just the content with typed fields (paragraphs, tables as arrays, headings as hierarchy), the chunking almost didn't matter anymore because each field was already a meaningful unit.\n\nSecond one was overlapping chunks that shared boilerplate text. Footer content appearing in 40% of chunks meant the embedding space was polluted. Retrieval kept returning chunks that scored high because they all shared the same footer, not because they were actually relevant.",
