      "text": "I've been diving deep into RAG architectures lately and wanted to compile/crowdsource the best resources out there. Here's what I've found so far:\n\n**GitHub Repos to Star:**\n- LangChain / LlamaIndex (obviously, but they've evolved a lot)\n- Ragas - for RAG evaluation metrics\n- Chroma / Weaviate / Qdrant - vector DB options with great docs\n- RAGFlow - end-to-end RAG framework\n- Haystack by deepset\n\n**AI Startups to Watch:**\n- Pinecone (vector search infrastructure)\n- Cohere (embeddings + reranking)\n- ZeroEntropy (SoTA Rerankers & Embeddings)\n- Vectara (RAG-as-a-service)\n- LlamaIndex (now a company, not just OSS)\n\n**Communities:**\n- r/RAG (obviously lol)\n- r/LocalLLaMA (great for self-hosted RAG setups)\n- LangChain Discord\n- Context Engineers Discord\n- MLOps Community\n\n**Learning Resources:**\n- LlamaIndex docs (actually really good tutorials)\n- Pinecone learning center\n- \"Building RAG Applications\" courses popping up everywhere\n\nWhat am I missing? Especially interested in:\n1. Any lesser-known GitHub repos that are actually good?\n2. New startups doing interesting RAG work?\n3. YouTube channels or podcasts focused on RAG?\n\nDrop your favorites below 👇",

The gap: when retrieval is wrong, proving what was retrieved requires more than better embeddings or reranking. You need capture of actual chunks, doc versions, timestamps.\n\nWe use similar stack (LlamaIndex, Chroma, rerankers). When Legal asks \"what docs informed this decision,\" the tools retrieved successfully but we can't verify: were chunks stale, which doc version, why these over others.\n\nResources for building RAG are plentiful. Resources for making RAG auditable are scarce. That's the actual production blocker - not accuracy, but provability.\n\nWhat resources exist for RAG evidence capture and incident replay?",

      "text": "OpenClaw, 145k stars in 10 weeks. Everyone's talking about MCP - how agents dynamically discover tools, decide when to use them, etc.\n\nI connected a local RAG to OpenClaw via MCP. My agent now knows when to search my docs vs use its memory.\n\n**The problem:** it was searching at the right time, but bringing back garbage.\n\n**MCP solves the WHEN, not the WHAT**\n\nMCP is powerful for orchestration:\n\n* Agent discovers tools at runtime\n* Decides on its own when to invoke `query_documents` vs answer directly\n* Stateful session, shared context\n\nBut MCP doesn't care about the quality of what your tool returns. If your RAG brings back 10 chunks and 7 are noise, the agent will still use them.\n\n**MCP = intelligence on WHEN to search** **Context Engineering = intelligence on WHAT goes into the prompt**\n\nBoth need to work together.\n\n**The WHAT: reranking**\n\nMy initial setup: hybrid search (vector + BM25), top 10 chunks, straight into context.\n\nResult: agent found the right docs but cited wrong passages. Context was polluted.\n\nThe fix: **reranking**.\n\nAfter search, a model re-scores chunks by actual relevance. You keep only top 3-5.\n\nI use **ZeroEntropy**. On enterprise content (contracts, specs), it goes from \\~40% precision to \\~85%. Classic cross-encoders (ms-marco, BGE) work for generic stuff, but on technical jargon ZeroEntropy performs better.\n\n**The full flow**\n\n    User query via WhatsApp\n        ↓\n    OpenClaw decides: \"I need to search the docs\" (MCP)\n        ↓\n    My RAG tool receives the query\n        ↓\n    Hybrid search → 30 candidates\n        ↓\n    ZeroEntropy reranking → top 3\n        ↓\n    Only these 3 chunks enter the context\n        ↓\n    Precise answer with correct citations\n\nAgent is smart about WHEN to search (MCP). Reranking ensures what it brings back is relevant (Context Engineering).\n\n**Stack**\n\n* **MCP server:** custom, exposes `query_documents`\n* **Search:** hybrid vector + BM25, RRF fusion\n* **Reranking:** ZeroEntropy\n* **Vector store:** ChromaDB\n\n**Result**\n\nBefore: agent searched at the right time but answers were approximate.\n\nAfter: WhatsApp query \"gardening obligations in my lease\" → 3 sec → exact paragraph, page, quote. Accurate.\n\n**The point**\n\nMCP is one building block. Reranking is another.\n\nMost MCP + RAG setups forget reranking. The agent orchestrates well but brings back noise.\n\nContext Engineering = making sure every token entering the prompt deserves its place. Reranking is how you do that on the retrieval side.\n\nShootout to some smart folks i met on this discord server who helped me figuring out a lot of things: [Context Engineering](https://discord.gg/F9VNyJzb)",

When the agent cites wrong passage despite reranking, can you replay what was actually in those top 3 chunks?\n\nWe use reranking too. Helps accuracy but doesn't solve the debugging problem. Agent extracts wrong data, we know reranking happened, but can't verify: were those top 3 chunks stale? Did reranking score change between dev and prod? What version of the docs were retrieved?\n\nMCP orchestration plus reranking gives better answers. Still can't answer \"prove what the agent saw at 2:47am on case #4521\" because logs show reranking executed, not what content passed through.\n\nFor WhatsApp queries this works great. For production agents where Legal asks for evidence, the gap is: can you capture and verify the actual retrieved content, not just that retrieval happened?\n\nDoes your setup store the reranked chunks with timestamps for replay, or just return them to the agent?",

The \"toy\" setups like basic MCP or vanilla LangChain wrappers just fall apart the second you feed them high-density documents.\n\nIn my experience, if you aren't obsessing over the retrieval pipeline before the query even hits the LLM, you're just building a very expensive hallucination machine. A few things I’ve learned the hard way:\n\n1. **Hybrid search is the only way out.** If you rely only on vector embeddings for factual stuff (like specific dates or IDs in a 500-page report), you’re going to get \"semantic blurring.\" You need BM25 keyword matching running alongside your vectors with a tunable alpha. It’s the only way to catch those \"needle in a haystack\" moments.\n2. **Rerankers are double-edged swords.** I’ve seen Rerankers actually kill the correct result because the threshold was a hair too tight. Now I just pull a wider window (Top-K 20) and let the reranker sort the Top-5 without hard-filtering. It’s safer and much more consistent.\n3. **Small chunks > Big chunks.** We moved to 600-char chunks with a decent overlap and the \"contextual precision\" shot up. Big chunks just add too much noise and confuse the model.\n4. **Stop the \"vibe-checks.\"** You can’t tell if a RAG is good just because the answer \"sounds professional.\" I had to build a full eval pipeline to realize my \"best sounding\" model was actually making up half the citations.\n\nEnterprise RAG isn't about which LLM is smarter, it's about how much you can control the data flow.",

No more context window panic. No more \"as I mentioned earlier\" when you definitely did not mention it earlier.\n\nSo naturally: \"Why do we even need RAG anymore??\"\n\nI actually dug into this and... It's not that simple (shocking, I know).\n\nBasically:\n\n* **Agent memory** = remembers what IT was doing (task state)\n* **RAG** = retrieves what THE WORLD knows (external facts)\n\nOne is your agent's personal journal. The other is the company wiki it keeps forgetting exists.\n\n**An agent** with perfect memory but no retrieval is like a coworker who remembers every meeting but never reads the docs. We've all worked with that guy.\n\n**A RAG system** with no memory is like that other coworker who reads everything but forgets what you talked about 5 minutes ago. Also that guy.\n\nTurns out the answer is: stack both. Memory for state, retrieval for facts, vector DB(Like Milvus) underneath.\n\nRAG isn't dead. It just got a roommate who leaves dishes in the sink.\n\n👉 Full breakdown here if you want the deep dive [https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md](https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md)\n\n**TL;DR:** Claude Cowork's memory is for tracking task state. RAG is for grounding the model in external knowledge. They're complementary, not competitive. We can all calm down (for now).",

If you're scraping static documentation or PDFs, tools like Docling or standard parsers work perfectly.\n\nThe specific use case FastRAG solves is Client-Side Rendered (SPA) websites.

Standard scrapers often fail there.\n\nFastRAG uses a headless browser instance (Puppeteer) to fully hydrate the DOM before scraping, so you catch the content that only appears after JS execution.

      "text": "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** has become the dominant paradigm for grounding large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Among RAG approaches, **vector-based retrieval**—which embeds documents and queries into a shared semantic space and retrieves the most semantically similar chunks—has emerged as the de facto standard.\n\nThis dominance is understandable: vector RAG is simple, scalable, and fits naturally into existing information-retrieval pipelines. However, as LLM systems evolve from single-turn question answering toward multi-turn, agentic, and reasoning-driven applications, the limitations of vector-based RAG are becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nMany of these limitations are well known. Others are less discussed, yet far more fundamental. This article argues that **context blindness**, the inability of vector-based retrieval to condition on full conversational and reasoning context, is the most critical limitation of vector-based RAG, and one that fundamentally constrains its role in modern LLM systems.\n\n# Commonly Discussed Limitations of Vector-Based RAG\n\n**The Limitations of Semantic Similarity**\n\nVector-based retrieval assumes that semantic similarity between a query and a passage is a reliable proxy for relevance. This assumption breaks down in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, similarity-based retrieval often misses what should be retrieved (false negatives). User queries typically express intent rather than the literal surface form of the supporting evidence, and the information that satisfies the intent is often implicit, procedural, or distributed across multiple parts of a document. As a result, truly relevant evidence may share little semantic overlap with the query and therefore fails to be retrieved by similarity search, creating a **context gap** between what the user is trying to retrieve and what similarity search can represent.\n\nSecond, similarity-based retrieval often returns what should not be retrieved (false positives). Even when retrieved passages appear highly similar to the query, similarity does not guarantee relevance, especially in domain-specific documents such as financial reports, legal contracts, and technical manuals, where many sections share near-identical language but differ in critical details such as numerical thresholds, applicability conditions, definitions, or exceptions. Vector embeddings tend to blur these distinctions, creating **context confusion**: passages that appear relevant in isolation are retrieved despite being incorrect given the actual scope, constraints, or exceptions. In professional and enterprise settings, this failure mode is particularly dangerous because it grounds confident answers in plausible but incorrect evidence.\n\n**The Limitations of Embedding Models**\n\nEmbedding models transform passages into vector representations. However, the input length limits of the embedding model force documents to be split into chunks, disrupting their structure and introducing information discontinuities. Definitions become separated from constraints, tables from explanations, and exceptions from governing rules. Although often cited as the main limitation of vector-based RAG, chunking is better viewed as a secondary consequence of deeper architectural constraints.\n\n# The Under-Discussed Core Problem: Context Blindness\n\nA core limitation of vector-based RAG that is rarely discussed is its **context blindness**: the retrieval query cannot carry the full context that led to the question. In modern LLM applications, queries are rarely standalone. They depend on prior dialogue, intermediate conclusions, implicit assumptions, operational context, and evolving user intent. Yet vector-based retrieval operates on a short, decontextualized query that must be compressed into one or more fixed-length vectors.\n\nThis compression is not incidental — it is fundamental. A vector embedding has limited representational capacity: it must collapse rich, structured reasoning context into a dense numerical representation that cannot faithfully preserve dependencies, conditionals, negations, or conversational state. As a result, vector-based retrieval is inherently **context-independent**. Documents are matched against a static semantic representation rather than the full reasoning state of the system. This creates a structural disconnect: the LLM reasons over a long, evolving context, while the vector retriever operates on a minimal, compressed, and flattened signal. In other words, **the LLM reasoner is stateful, while the vector retriever is not.** Even with prompt engineering, query expansion, multi-vector retrieval, or reranking, this mismatch persists, because the limitation lies in the representational bottleneck of vectors themselves. The vector retriever remains blind to the very context that determines what “relevant” means.\n\n# Paradigm Shift: From Context-Independent Semantic Similarity to Context-Dependent Relevance Classification\n\nThe solution to context blindness is not a better embedding model or a larger vector database, but a change in how retrieval itself is formulated. Instead of treating retrieval as a semantic similarity search performed by an external embedding model, retrieval should be framed as a **relevance classification problem** executed by an LLM that has access to the **full reasoning context**.\n\nIn this formulation, the question is no longer “Which passages are closest to this query in embedding space?”, but rather “Given everything the system knows so far—user intent, prior dialogue, assumptions, and constraints—is this piece of content relevant or not?” Relevance becomes an explicit decision conditioned on context, rather than an implicit signal derived from vector proximity.\n\nBecause modern LLMs are designed to reason over long, structured context, they are naturally well-suited to this role. Unlike embedding models, which must compress inputs into fixed-length vectors and inevitably discard structure and dependencies, LLM-based relevance classification can directly condition on the entire conversation history and intermediate reasoning steps. As a result, retrieval becomes context-aware and adapts dynamically as the user’s intent evolves.\n\nThis shift transforms retrieval from a standalone preprocessing step into part of the reasoning loop itself. Instead of operating outside the LLM stack as a static similarity lookup, retrieval becomes tightly coupled with decision-making, enabling RAG systems that scale naturally to multi-turn, agentic, and long-context settings.\n\n# Scaling Relevance Classification via Tree Search\n\nA common concern with context-dependent, relevance-classification-based retrieval is token efficiency. **Naively classifying relevance over the entire knowledge base via brute-force evaluation is token-inefficient and does not scale.** However, token inefficiency is not inherent to relevance-classification-based retrieval; it arises from flat, brute-force evaluation rather than **hierarchical classification**.\n\nIn **PageIndex**, retrieval is implemented as a **hierarchical relevance classification** over document structure (sections → pages → blocks), where relevance is evaluated top-down and entire subtrees are pruned once a high-level unit is deemed irrelevant. This transforms retrieval from exhaustive enumeration into selective exploration, focusing computation only on promising regions. The intuition resembles systems such as **AlphaGo**, which achieved efficiency not by enumerating all possible moves, but by navigating a large decision tree through learned evaluation and selective expansion. Similarly, PageIndex avoids wasting tokens on irrelevant content, enabling context-conditioned retrieval that is both more accurate and more efficient than flat vector-based RAG pipelines that depend on large candidate sets, reranking, and repeated retrieval calls.\n\n# The Future of RAG\n\nThe rise of frameworks such as **PageIndex** signals a broader shift in the AI stack. As language models become increasingly capable of planning, reasoning, and maintaining long-horizon context, the responsibility for finding relevant information is gradually **moving** **from the database layer to the model layer**.\n\nThis transition is already evident in the coding domain. Agentic tools such as **Claude Code** are moving beyond simple vector lookups toward active codebase exploration: navigating file hierarchies, inspecting symbols, following dependencies, and iteratively refining their search based on intermediate findings. Generic document retrieval is likely to follow the same trajectory. As tasks become more multi-step and context-dependent, passive similarity search increasingly gives way to structured exploration driven by reasoning.\n\nVector databases will continue to have important, well-defined use cases, such as recommendation systems and other settings, where semantic similarity **is the objective**. However, their historical role as the default retrieval layer for LLM-based systems is becoming less clear. As retrieval shifts from similarity matching to context-dependent decision-making, agentic systems increasingly demand mechanisms that can reason, adapt, and operate over structure, rather than relying solely on embedding proximity.\n\nIn this emerging paradigm, retrieval is no longer a passive lookup operation. It becomes an integral part of the model’s reasoning process: executed by the model, guided by intent, and grounded in context.",

Keeping metadata separate is correct you should embed only the actual text content and store the metadata alongside it so you can filter or rank with it later. Embedding metadata usually just adds noise.\nChunking isn’t fixed either. Sometimes smaller chunks work better, sometimes larger ones, and semantic chunking is often the best option. It’s normal to tweak your chunking strategy as you see how your retrieval performs.\n\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right about retrieval. Don’t rely only on embeddings. Combining embeddings with metadata filtering, keyword or BM25 search, and then adding a reranking step gives much better results in most cases.\n\n\nSo yes, what you described is basically how strong RAG systems are built. we are following same for Zynfo AI to build out chatbot",

          "text": "You’re asking the wrong question and I mean that in the most helpful way possible.\nThe chunking debate (semantic vs fixed size vs hierarchical) assumes your RAG architecture is correct. It’s not. You’re optimizing for retrieval when you should be optimizing for knowledge structure.\nHere’s the problem with your current setup. Docling to Markdown to Vectors to Retrieval. This pipeline loses the thing that makes FAQs useful, which is the relationships between questions. When you chunk Q+A as atomic units, you lose which questions are siblings under the same topic, which answers reference concepts explained elsewhere, and the hierarchy you already identified (heading to subheading to FAQ).\nWhat you actually want is to stop chunking for embedding and start structuring for reasoning.\nInstead of treating each FAQ as an isolated chunk, build a structure where each FAQ has an ID, knows what topic it belongs to, knows what other FAQs it relates to, and carries its prerequisites. Now your retrieval can find the relevant FAQ by semantic match, pull in related FAQs automatically so you don’t get out of context answers, and include parent topic context without re-embedding it every time.\nIf you’re committed to vector RAG, here’s the practical move. Chunk at FAQ level with Q and A together, you had this right. But prepend the heading hierarchy as metadata, not as embedded text. Store the path like “Account Settings > Security > Password Recovery” and at retrieval time inject that context before the FAQ content. This gives you semantic search on the answer content while preserving structural context for the LLM.\nThe hybrid approach you’re circling around looks like this. Your chunk is the individual FAQ as a Q+A pair. Your metadata is the full heading path, related FAQ IDs, and section summary. Your embedding should be the question plus the first sentence of the answer, not the full text since answers tend to be verbose. At retrieval you grab your top-k FAQs plus their metadata plus the parent section summary.\nToken budget roughly 50 to 100 tokens per FAQ chunk, 20 to 30 tokens for heading context, pull 3 to 5 related FAQs and you’re at maybe 500 tokens total. That’s enough for high answer accuracy without blowing up your context window.\nTo hit your specific questions directly. Chunk by FAQ with Q and A together, yes this is correct. Use semantic size not fixed tokens since FAQs vary so let them. Metadata is your secret weapon here, the heading path, section ID, related IDs. And don’t embed the hierarchy, reference it. Embed the answer, retrieve the structure.\nIf you want to go deeper on this, look into knowledge graphs as a retrieval layer instead of pure vector search. Structure beats embedding for FAQ style content every time. And I do mean EVERY TIME! Just my opinion 🤷🏽‍♂️",

      "text": "Most RAG tutorials teach you to load a PDF into a list. That works for 5MB, but it crashes when you have 2GB of manuals or logs.\n\nI built a pipeline to handle large-scale ingestion efficiently on a consumer laptop. Here is the architecture I used to solve RAM bottlenecks and API rate limits:\n\n1. **Lazy Loading with Generators:** Instead of `docs = loader.load()`, I implemented a Python Generator (`yield`). This processes one file at a time, keeping RAM usage flat regardless of total dataset size.\n2. **Persistent Storage:** Using ChromaDB in persistent mode (on disk), not in-memory. Index once, query forever.\n3. **Smart Batching:** Sending embeddings in batches of 100 to the API with `tqdm` for monitoring, handling rate limits gracefully.\n4. **Recursive Chunking with Overlap:** Critical for maintaining semantic context across cuts.\n\nI made a full code-along video explaining the implementation line-by-line using Python and LangChain concepts.\n\n[https://youtu.be/QR-jTaHik8k?si=a\\_tfyuvG\\_mam4TEg](https://youtu.be/QR-jTaHik8k?si=a_tfyuvG_mam4TEg)\n\nIf you have questions about the `yield` implementation or the batching logic, ask away!",

      "text": "when it comes to retrieval, aggregation methods really matter and yet many people use heuristics which are not always very rigorous.\n\nbm25 scores and dense similarity scores live on very different scales and distributions. Even with normalization, the balance is usually heuristic and dataset‑dependent, so you often end up tuning weights per domain.\n\nrrf ignores score magnitudes and uses only rank positions. That’s robust to scale mismatch, but it can discard useful confidence information and flatten large gaps between documents, which matters when one signal is clearly stronger.\n\n\\## Experiments\n\n    Setup\n    - Dataset: SQuAD\n    - Metrics: NDCG@10, MRR@10\n    - Dense model: BGE-M3\n    - Compared: weighted-sum (WS) hybrid vs RRF\n    \n    Results\n    - WS (bb25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.9149, MRR@10 0.8850\n    - WS (BM25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.9051, MRR@10 0.8717\n    - RRF (BM25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.8874, MRR@10 0.8483\n\nBayesian BM25 maps BM25 scores into calibrated probabilities using a likelihood and prior model. Once lexical scores are on a probabilistic scale, they combine more naturally with vector scores (also treated as probabilities). In practice this reduces scale mismatch and stabilizes hybrid fusion without heavy tuning.\n\nuse with \\`pip install bb25\\`. happy to share code and details if anyone’s interested. feedback welcome!\n\n\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/sigridjineth/bb25](https://github.com/sigridjineth/bb25)\n\nLibrary: [http://pypi.org/project/bb25/](http://pypi.org/project/bb25/)",

In production, retrieval fails for reasons metrics don't capture: stale index, query typos, edge case queries, domain drift after model updates.\n\nWhen retrieval returns wrong documents, you need to know: which fusion method chose this, what were the raw scores, why did BM25 rank differently than dense, what would different weights have returned? Bayesian probabilities help fusion accuracy but don't help incident debugging.\n\nWe hit this with hybrid search on document intake. Metrics looked good, but specific customer queries failed mysteriously. Couldn't reconstruct why fusion chose document A over B without logging raw scores, fusion weights, and retrieval timestamps. Calibrated probabilities make fusion more principled but debugging still requires evidence capture.\n\nFor production systems: are you logging fusion decisions (raw scores, calibrated probs, final ranking) in a way that's replayable later? Or just optimizing for eval metrics?",

You'll hit this when auditors ask \"what regulation informed this decision?\"\n\nWe use BGE-large for similar formal documents. Works well for semantic search. But when extraction is wrong, embeddings don't help you debug. Vector DB logs show query embedding, not what chunks were returned or if they were current versions.\n\nFor your use case, beyond embedding choice: how will you verify retrieved content later? Manufacturing compliance means \"prove this safety decision used regulation version X dated Y.\" Embeddings find relevant chunks, but you need to capture which chunks, from which doc version, retrieved when.\n\nPractical advice: test BGE-large vs E5-large on your actual compliance docs, not benchmarks. More important: design your RAG to store retrieval decisions (chunk IDs, doc versions, timestamps) not just return results. You'll need that evidence trail.\n\nWhat's your plan for handling doc version control when regulations update?",

So far its been great!. I would also suggest you experiment with different embedding models. In my earlier years I did a lot of experimentation with embedding models, and BGE models performed well given they produced better results than the E5/GTR models, but the speed didn't come close to the MiniLM models. I have built many RAG systems in production for very long Health Care related documents, with varying complexity. Your biggest challenges will be handling the PII/PHI data, How to embed different document types, handling complex document structures, like nested tables in PDF files, image references etc, but you can use a vision model / ocr model to handle some of that. If you have questions just IM me directly, and I would be happy to help. ",

Blocks of 768 numbers, 1024 numbers, 1536 numbers, etc. when you create a vector database, you must define how many dimensions that database will essentially be “configured” for. You can have multiple databases with different dimensions, each serving strategic purpose. \n\nThe more dimensions, the more context it has, however, more does not equate to better understanding in this context. \n\nBecause we would essentially strategize to give more meaning in a set number of blocks, 1024 becomes a sweet spot. 1024 dimensions compact enough context, and via context chaining (done by your LLM), you’re able to provide “comprehension” of the context to your query. That query is to LLM, comprehension is for the LLM. \n\nSo why wouldn’t someone use smaller dims, or higher dims. Because compute. The smaller it is, the more it loses context (at least per my experiment on certain documents), the higher it is, the more compute it does per dim, yielding higher latency and context lose (bloating if you will). 1024 seems to be fast, efficient, and a sweet spot. \n\nI use qwen3:0.6b embedding model as well as openai’s text embedding 3 small - both at 1024 dims. OpenAI’s is hard truncated (built in logic), while the qwen3:0.6b naturally can produce 1024 but no higher than that.\n\nIn today’s world, you can ask chatgpt, or deepseek this question and get an understanding further.

As most of you know, given a single pdf file, paddleocr vl returns a folder with md and json files (as set to save both md and json files) for each page. If the pdf file has 50 pages, there are 50 md and json files.   \n  \nI am having difficulty in how to do the chunking. I know that given a query, I need the page information as a metadata to show the related page and passage within documents.   \nIf I just concatenate all the md files and do one of the chunking strategies, I will lose the page information. But If I do not concatenate them, I will lose context of some passages where one half is on the first page and the other is one the next page. \n\nBesides that I am well-aware of embedding models, the RAG architecture, rerankers, etc. But no matter how good your overall architecture is, if your chunks are garbage, the retrieval results will also be garbage.\n\nThose, who have come accross with such issue, please, advice me.  \nThank you beforehand.",

Chunking at fixed window sizes will for sure rotten your context, so the chunking strategy is of extreme importance. \n\nMy approach, which is theoretical at this stage, is to adopt a multi-stage conditional chunking approach as follows: \n- Set a max chunk size (C_max)\n- recursively traverse the document (e.g., md) and chunk if section/subsection size <= C_max, else (i.e., section size > C_max) initiate a chunk set [c_0, .. c_i] where you chunk at max size up until the last chunk will is treated similarly to first if branch. Your metadata should maintain the link between chunks within a set, so that if one element is hit with your vector search, the whole set is retrieved. \nThe metadata may also include section header numbering/titles, page numbers etc. when you rank chunks that you’ll populate the context with, you can use the page numbers associated with those in the metadata to get the snippets highlighting used chunks. \n\nYou may further try to “compress” the set of chunks to fit it into your context. \n\nThis is the approach I intend to work with.

      "text": "TL;DR**:** We developed a multi-agent framework that generates multimodal, multihop QA pairs from technical documents (PDFs containing text, tables, charts). Unlike existing pipelines that often generate shallow questions, MiRAGE uses an adversarial verifier and expert persona injection to create complex reasoning chains (avg 2.3+ hops).\n\n**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15487](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15487)\n\n**Code:** [https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE](https://github.com/ChandanKSahu/MiRAGE)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nWe've been working on evaluating RAG systems for industrial/enterprise use cases (technical manuals, financial reports, regulations), and (as many have) we hit a recurring problem: standard benchmarks like Natural Questions or MS MARCO don't reflect the complexity of our data.\n\nMost existing eval datasets are single-hop and purely textual. In the real world, our documents are multimodal (*especially* heavy on tables/charts in our use cases) and require reasoning across disjoint sections (multi-hop).\n\nWe built and open-sourced MiRAGE, a multi-agent framework designed to automate the creation of \"Gold Standard\" evaluation datasets from your arbitrary corpora.\n\nInstead of a linear generation pipeline (which often leads to hallucinations or shallow questions), we use a swarm of specialized agents.\n\nInstead of immediate generation, we use a retrieval agent that recursively builds a semantic context window. This agent gathers scattered evidence to support complex inquiries *before* a question-answer pair is formulated, allowing the system to generate multi-hop queries (averaging >2.3 hops) rather than simple keyword lookups.\n\nWe address the reliability of synthetic data through an adversarial verification phase. A dedicated verifier agent fact-checks the generated answer against the source context to ensure factual grounding and verifies that the question does not rely on implicit context (e.g., rejecting questions like \"In the table below...\").\n\nWhile the system handles text and tables well, visual grounding remains a frontier. Our ablation studies revealed that current VLMs still rely significantly on dense textual descriptions to bridge the visual reasoning gap, when descriptions were removed, faithfulness dropped significantly.\n\nThe repo supports local and cloud API model calls. We're hoping this helps others stress test their pipelines.",

You can’t escape it.\n\n# The trade-offs (pick 2, the 3rd fights back)\n\n**Accuracy + Latency → Cost goes up**  \nYou add: rerankers, query rewriting, multi-stage retrieval, more evals, more calls.\n\n**Accuracy + Cost → Latency goes up**  \nYou accept slower flows: stricter gating, extraction-first, better versioning, more checks.\n\n**Latency + Cost → Accuracy is constrained**  \nYou go cache-heavy, link-first answers, templates, smaller models, fewer steps.\n\n# Why agentic chains make it worse\n\nIf each step is \\~80% reliable, 3 steps is:\n\n0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 = **51%**\n\nThat’s not “pretty good.” That’s coin-flip automation with nicer UX.\n\n# My practical rule: define floors, don’t chase “best RAG”\n\nThere's no best RAG architecture.  \nFor every use-case, there's the minimum acceptable floor for each constraint.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Support bot: optimize accuracy+latency, pay cost, add confidence gates\n* Legal/Finance: optimize accuracy+cost, allow latency, quote-first + abstain\n* Sales/Marketing: optimize latency+cost, constrain accuracy, claim-gates + sources\n\n# Levers that actually move the needle\n\n# Accuracy levers (usually cost/latency ↑)\n\n* hybrid search + metadata filters\n* reranking (cross-encoder)\n* query rewrite / decomposition\n* structure-based chunking (clauses/sections)\n* confidence gates + abstention\n* evals + regression tests\n\n# Latency levers\n\n* routing (fast path vs safe path)\n* caching (answers, retrieval results, embeddings)\n* precompute (summaries, intent bundles)\n* strict token budgets\n* fewer model calls\n\n# Cost levers\n\n* small model for routing/classification\n* extraction over generation (numbers/thresholds)\n* offline summarization (don’t pay per query)\n* reuse approved snippets/templates\n* measure cost per *resolved task*\n\n# Metrics (the bare minimum)\n\n* grounded answer rate / citation rate\n* P95/P99 latency end-to-end\n* cost per resolved conversation/task\n* abstention quality (abstain when you should)\n* unsupported-claim rate (should trend to 0)\n\nWDYT?

      "text": "Agentic RAG sounds powerful, but it will burn your tokens like crazy.  \n  \nI was just going through this new paper that introduces a new Agentic RAG framework 'A-RAG' - A framework designed to unlock the reasoning capabilities of frontier AI models that traditional RAG systems underutilise.   \n  \nWhile Naive Agentic RAG grants models the autonomy to explore, it is limited by using only a single embedding-based retrieval tool. This makes it inefficient and less useful, as it consumes a massive amount of tokens while delivering lower accuracy than the full framework.  \n  \nTo address this, the authors created the A-RAG (Full) framework featuring hierarchical retrieval interfaces. It provides specific tools for keyword search, semantic search, and chunk reading.   \n  \nThis allows for progressive information disclosure, where the agent views brief snippets before deciding which full chunks are relevant enough to read.   \n  \nThis approach solves the \"noise\" problem of traditional systems by drastically improving context efficiency - retrieving far fewer tokens - while reaching higher accuracy.   \n  \nUltimately, A-RAG shifts the primary failure bottleneck: while traditional RAG often fails because it cannot find documents, A-RAG finds them so reliably that the only remaining challenge is the model’s reasoning quality.   \n  \nThis positions A-RAG as a truly agentic system that scales alongside advances in model intelligence.  \n  \nRead more about this new Agentic RAG framework A-RAG in the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03442).",

      "text": "Hey guys! I am new to the world of knowledge graphs and RAGs, and am very interested in exploring it!\n\nI am currently looking at using property graphs (neo4j to be specific) as the 'knowledge base' for RAG implementations since I've read that they're more powerful than the alternative of RDFs. In other words, I am building my RAG's 'knowledge source' using a knowledge graph\n\n\n\nThere is just one problem here I can't quite seem to crack, and that's the validation of the knowledge source (be it a vector DB, a knowledge graph, or otherwise). A RAG builds itself on the assurance that its underlying data-source is correct. But if you can't validate and verify the data-source, how do you 'trust' the RAG's output?\n\n\n\nI am seeing two schools of thought when it comes to building the data-source (assuming I am working with Knowledge Graphs here) :\n\n1) Give an LLM your documents, and ask it to output the data in the format you want (exp, 3-tuples for KGs, JSON, if you're building your data-source on JSON and so on)\n\n  \n2) Use traditional NER+NLP techniques to more deterministically extract data, and output it into the data-source you want\n\n\n\n  \nTo BUILD a decent knowledge graph however, you need a relatively large corpus of your data 'documents', potentially from various different sources, making the problem of verifying how correct the data is, hard\n\n  \nI've gone through a commonly-cited paper here on Reddit that delves into verifying the correctness *(KGValidator: A Framework for Automatic Validation of Knowledge Graph Construction)*\n\n  \nThe paper's methodology essentially boils down to (\"Use an LLM to verify if your data source is correct, and THEN, use ANOTHER RAG as reference to verify the correctness, and THEN, use another knowledge graph as reference to verify the correctness\")\n\n  \nFor one, it feels like a chicken-egg problem. I am creating a KG-based RAG in my domain (which in and of itself is a bit on the niche side and occasionally involves transliterated language from a non-English language at times) for the first time. So there IS no pre-existing RAG or KG I can depend on for cross-referencing and verifying  \n  \n  \nSecond, I find it hard to trust an LLM with completely and accurately validating a knowledge graph if LLMs are inherently prone to hallucination (and is the reason I am shifting to a RAG-based methodology in the first place; to avoid hallucinations over a very specific domain/problem-space), because I am worried about running into the ***garbage in = garbage out*** problem \n\n\n\nI can't seem to think of any deterministic and 'scientifically rigorous' way to validate the correctness of a RAG's data-source (Especially when it comes to assigning metrics to the validation process). Web-scraping has the same problem, though I did have an idea of web-scraping from trusted sites and feeding it as context to an LLM for validation (Though again, it's non-deterministic by design)  \n  \n  \nIs there any better way to solve it, or are the above mentioned techniques the only options?",

Now you build a KG/ RAG and ask the question who was the first president ? Your rag will perform a semantic search / KG path traversal and bring back Trump, but your LLM knows that’s not true, so after the synthesis stage your LLM might say that your retrieved result is not true. While it works here because the LLM was trained on this data, it will lack details about domain specific things e.g., different acronyms used internally or anything the LLM was not trained on. As you said you can do a web search to correct the result but you are back to domain issue. So make sure the ground truth is the actual truth and things will work out well!",

No matter how I create them (frontier models or specialized models).\n\n  \nSince you already have everything in json format that means you're dealing with structured data. I would build an ontology on top of it and do ontology guiding search​. That means you're not dealing with hallucinations. And still use the llm in the parts of the pipeline where it makes sense, just not for the parts that require no hallucination.",

If we look at SNOMED-CT there might be 10 times that number if you consider all the different structures disorders etc. \n\n  \nThose codes exist because there's some sort of medical workflow or billing logic or treatment that depends on them being distinct. When you try to apply RAG to this problem, your in essence hoping that you can fragment the documents into those 1200 codes or 12,000 codes depending on your scenario. \n\n  \nEven the very best models are going to have a hard time doing that with Fidelity. I find it's better to invert the problem, use the ontology first, and then then we use the llm to do generative tasks.",
