          "text": "You’re not wrong - flat chunk RAG hits a wall fast on policy/legal corpora because “correctness” is mostly about scope, definitions, exceptions, and precedence, not semantic similarity. The teams I’ve seen get this working stop treating retrieval as “top-k chunks” and start treating it as a constrained legal reasoning pipeline: definition expansion > scope filters > precedence rules > targeted clause fetch > answer with mandatory citations. Graph adds value when it’s used for precedence + definition binding, not as a generic knowledge graph. If you want a concrete example of how this looks in practice (especially definition/exception handling + audit-friendly outputs), AI Lawyer has some useful patterns you can mirror: strict citation gating, clause-level retrieval, and override/exception tracing.",

          "text": "Yeah, you've hit the ceiling that most people hit. Token-based chunking on legal docs is basically guaranteed to break cross-reference reasoning because it has no awareness of document structure.\n\nThe issue isn't your retrieval stack, it's what you're feeding it. Legal docs have explicit hierarchical relationships: definitions that apply to specific sections, exceptions that modify clauses, cross-references that span documents. Flat chunks destroy all of that before your embeddings ever see it. Doesn't matter how good your reranker is if the chunk boundaries cut through a definition-to-usage relationship.\n\nGraph RAG can help with traceability but it won't fix the upstream problem. You're still building the graph from chunks that already lost the structure. Same with agentic approaches, they're working with degraded inputs.\n\nWhat's actually worked in production for policy docs: semantic chunking that respects section boundaries, explicit metadata for document hierarchy (section > subsection > clause), and preserving cross-reference relationships as first-class data. You want chunks that know what section they belong to and what other sections they reference.\n\nDocling gives you structured output but are you actually using that structure for chunking decisions? Most people parse structured and then chunk flat anyway. I've been building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_i) specifically for this kind of pipeline configuration, where you can see how your docs look after each transformation before committing.\n\nFor the cross-document reasoning specifically, you probably need document-level metadata propagation so chunks know which policy they came from and what other policies they relate to. That's not a retrieval problem, it's an enrichment problem that happens way before Milvus sees anything.",

          "text": "Graphs are the answer. You need to rethink chunking strategies though - semantic and section based chunking. All the questions you have are indeed things you need to work through. \n\nYou can (and should) approach retrieval from both ends: start with keyword and vector search, use the findings to traverse graph relationships - you’ll need agentic search here so it can intelligently ‘loop’ and refine queries as needed. You can come from the graph side as well if you know certain nodes on specific edges you’re looking for to filter (keep an index). \n\nHave your agent use a ‘scratchpad’ during search and keep each search branch’s context clean and focused - what I’ve found so far, what information I still need, search terms used).  There are a hundred more things but yea…\n\nI built an engineering assistant for the hydrogen mobility industry (think hydrogen fueling stations and generation facilities) that is used to validate plans and even day to day work packages against required standards, protocols, and regulations. It provides detailed report with citations of ‘why’ for go/no-go decisions.  So yes, to answer your final questions, this is the way. Prompting and intelligent search is more art than science though. Expanding user queries, prompting the user intelligently for search clarity, cacheing and vectorizing queries to store them with ‘what worked’ provenance so the agent can find like or similar answers later. \n\nA simple ranking system that users can ‘thumbs up/down’ responses (and potentially provide feedback) helps a lot for refining the system down the road. Good luck!",

So this would be a separate pipeline that understands key important things that you're looking for in these docs. Eg. Which compliance or audit standards are discussed, etc.\n\nAdding the graph DB should be a great help. Doing multiple levels of chunking so that you include whole paragraphs and sections will also be a help for ranking.

Subagent has some CLI prompts for processing, it knows how to call lynx -dump or pdftotext. \n\nAnother one is the legal researcher. It knows how to call another subagent doing research on our legal database for case law, cross references to other relevant laws, etc. It provides a list of sources (then to be processed by source intake) , and a preliminary answer to the legal question.\n\nThere's a subagent for actually writing the text answering a research question. It has an extensive style guide: every sentence either a premise or a conclusion. Every premise has a citation. Conclusions depending on interpretation need a citation too backing up this conclusion. \n\nThen, a subagent for validation. Does the cited document exist? Is the citation precise enough?

I would start by identifying the most valuable subset of documents, define a conversion approach (pref. towards markdown files) and then experiment with different chunking strategies (esp. parsing) to test retrieval. Embedding and Reranking should be considered. Those models are usually tiny and can run locally. For the reasoning part (responding to the user query by formulating an answer starting from the retrieved chunks) you can think about using a cloud LLM to have more advanced reasoning and potentially less hallucinations.",

Run an 8b model (i prefer qwen3 family, and personally use qwen3:4b for my construction documents, I do government contracts only). This is your main LLM so serve with vLLM. If budget is low, go Tesla V100 32 GB. If budget is good, go RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell.\n\n2. Get another GPU, this I think should be a V100 32GB and will process all documents for embedding. You don’t need vLLM for this, Hugging Face Transformers works perfectly fine because most requests are batch processed and you want it to be like that.\n\n3. Get another GPU for OCR and use PaddleOCR-VL - it is genuinely good. \n\n\nOnce you’re good, deploy your gateway, I use dokploy, so get a container going for your gateway, a web app, and you have an entire pipeline.\n\nFor RAG, use lanceDB + S3 to store vector data directly into the S3, saving on storage otherwise you’ll need excessive amount of data/drive management. I use an older 0.17.0 version of lanceDB + Backblaze B2. Latency is 400-500 ms for me. S3 would be 200-300, I ain’t dying.\n\nQuality of OCR matters, but so does organization of documents, and knowledge graphs. Use dgraph for knowledge graph, and call it a day.\n\nIf you’re not dealing with Handwritten Text, then you can use something like OCRMyPDF (i wrapped an API around it, it’s at https://github.com/ikantkode/exaOCR - completely free and dockerized). This runs CPU only and is very effective for me since I don’t work with HTR (handwritten text recognition). I mainly deal with scanned/text recognizable PDF, and it works like a charm.\n\n\nYou’d wanna create a gateway",

If so, that's a big win, because the really good stuff requires GPU acceleration.\n\nSo yeah, experiment. I am building RAG for a lot of funky stuff like [math-heavy PDFs](https://linear.axler.net/). For that, [marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker) outclassed everything else I listed above, but it's also the slowest., Guess you get what you pay for.\n\nEven that isn't always good enough, so in my workflow, I typically take marker's JSON output and run it through a cleanup XGBoost model I hand-tuned to omit stuff that annoys me.

          "text": "Yeah, that's a classic enterprise RAG problem. The scale isn't the hard part, it's getting consistent results across 2-4 million documents when you can't see what went wrong during processing.\n\nStart with your document processing pipeline first. OCR quality varies wildly between tools, and bad OCR creates garbage chunks that'll haunt your retrieval later. Test Tesseract vs cloud OCR on a sample of your PDFs to see what you're working with. For parsing, Unstructured handles PDFs reasonably well, but you'll want to preview what your documents actually look like after each transformation step.\n\nChunking strategy matters more than your vector store choice here. Recursive chunking works for most enterprise docs, but test different chunk sizes on your actual content. 500 tokens might work great for technical docs but fail on contracts or reports.\n\nLocal makes sense for security, but don't underestimate the infrastructure overhead. You'll need serious compute for embedding 2-4 million docs, plus vector storage that can handle the scale. Qdrant or Chroma can work locally, but plan your hardware accordingly.\n\nThe real killer is iteration speed. Every config change usually means reprocessing everything, which gets expensive fast at your scale. That's what I've been building around at vectorflow.dev, but honestly any approach that lets you test configurations before committing to the full pipeline will save you weeks.\n\nWhat type of PDFs are you dealing with?

If money is the primary concern (and not time), consider using a CPU server with a lot of RAM. GPUs are great for acceleration but unnecessary for building the initial database. A standard PC with a 7900 or 5080 could serve the actual AI model once the database is fully assembled. Since security is an issue you will have to be technical btw. Use air gapped protection without wifi-bluetooth-eth0 initially then when the database is assembled serve it as a reverse proxy (with apache or nginx) to a second machine in a VM with monitoring.\n\nTools:\nChromadb transformers torch langchain\nFaiss and llama.cpp are optional. Custom binding a llama.cpp fork for security is extra work but necessary for security.\n\nFrom HF.io:\ndeepseek-ocr\nQwen3-embedding \nNomic-text-embedding (is highly rated)\n\nIt would be a multi-model setup to make the initial database but after that just serve it with apache or nginx and a reverse proxy to your intranet.\n\nAlso, you ‘might’ be able to use traefik as a web scraper arranged locally on the initial data and then feed it to the Chromadb setup. (Custom programming for sure)\n\nAlso, Also, you could look into using vision models for the PDFs like llama scout but most I think are heavy on ram and vision models still struggle with setup and accuracy.",

Hire ME, I can be available. #shameless-pitch\n\nFor real though… hire someone who demonstrably has done this before. You’ll never succeed. Not putting you down, it’s just that hard and there STILL doesn’t yet exist a service that you can just plug and play into. Further, even if you do everything RIGHT, it will be very expensive just to do the ingestion and processing of this many documents - you/your employer likely won’t expect actual costs. \n\nIf you do things wrong or need to trial/error, costs balloon. There isn’t really a way to test if things work until you scale the ingestion as well. Lots of processes work at smaller document numbers and fall apart in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Nevermind millions.  \n\nFor the record I’ve led building systems for utility-scale capital construction projects where 5-10 million artifacts are produced over the course of the project. The utility portfolio has hundreds of millions. In addition to the artifacts created, the actual management of the project requires accurate retrieval to give go/no-go decisions as well as adherence to standards, regulations, etc where reporting decisions with provenance is critical.

Keyword highlighting is useless – if someone searches \"iPhone performance\" and the text says \"A15 Bionic chip, smooth with no lag,\" nothing gets highlighted.\n\nWe looked at existing semantic highlighting models:\n\n* OpenSearch's model: 512 token limit, too small for real docs\n* Provence: English-only\n* XProvence: supports Chinese but performance isn't great + NC license\n* Open Provence: solid but English/Japanese only\n\nNone fit our needs, **so we trained our own bilingual (EN/CH) model (Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/zilliz/semantic-highlight-bilingual-v1)**. Used LLMs to generate 5M training samples where they explain their reasoning before labeling highlights. This made the data way more consistent.\n\n**Quick example of why it matters:**\n\nQuery: \"Who wrote the film The Killing of a Sacred Deer?\"\n\nContext mentions:\n\n1. The screenplay writers (correct)\n2. Euripides who wrote the Greek play it's based on (trap)\n\nOur model: 0.915 for #1, 0.719 for #2 → correct\n\nXProvence: 0.133 for #1, 0.947 for #2 → wrong, fooled by keyword \"wrote\"\n\nWe're using it in Milvus and open-sourced it (MIT license), covers EN/CH right now.\n\nWould be interested to hear if this solves similar problems for others or if we're missing something obvious.",

Majorly, it involves reading financial documents(more specifically, DCF models, MIS in Excel).\n\n\n\n\n\nI am using the Claude/GPT 5.1 models for my extraction agent (LLMS running in a Loop) and have in place chunking and indexing with Azure OCR and Azure Search (which provide indexing and searching).\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, PDF extraction is working better, but with Excel I am facing many issues where LLMs mix data, such as saying data is for FY21 when it is for FY22(after getting the chunk data) or not able to find the exact related chunks.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that, in Excel, it is very number-heavy (like a 100\\* 50 type table). Also, structurally, it is a finance document and is created by different individuals, so I really do not control the structures, so lots of spaces or themes, so it is really not like CSV, where columns and rows are well defined.\n\n\n\nMajor Problem:\n\n1. By chunking the data, it loses a lot of context, like headers or information is missing if a single table is divided into multiple chunks, and hence, the context is missing, like what that column is like, the year, and the type.\n\n2. If I keep the table big, it is not going to fit sometimes in context as well.\n\n\n\n3. Also, as these tables are mostly number-heavy, creating chunks really does not make sense much (based on my understanding, as in vector embedding, the number itself does not have much context with text).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease suggest if someone has worked with Excel and what has helped them to get the data in the best possible way.",

You’re overthinking it. You just want a knowledgebase.\n\nEasily put, RAG is a process not an object, the G for generation should tell you that much.\n\nHow are you going to make a chatbot that can possibly really detect every possible combination of keywords and make sure that it pulls up the right docs? Are you sure its not just the fact that you’re really really overthinking LLM’s and you would much rather not just download LM Studio + Anything LLM and drag and drop all your docs? Or is it because you can’t afford it? Solutions are usually made entirely to fix a problem, and noone can help solve your problem unless we know what  it even is.\n\n122 days ago you posted a thread related to RAGs. During that 122 days you have not still even understood what a RAG even is. It’s pretty easy to tell you just gave up when if you were to go and ask Gemini, it would give you exact step by step instructions on how to set this up, you can even really use like a 1-4b model on a 10 year old laptop, and Gemini can put the steps in a way that even a child can understand if you simply say “explain the steps like you’re explaining to a kid”.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what answer here someone gives you. You’ve shown that you will pretend to care and want to know something but still won’t make any progress 122 days later. The biggest group of people I despise are those that say they “want to learn something” when they really really don’t care in the slightest - it just makes people who actually want to learn get taken unseriously.",

      "text": "Hey guys! I am new to the world of knowledge graphs and RAGs, and am very interested in exploring it!\n\n  \nI am currently looking at using property graphs (neo4j to be specific) as the 'knowledge base' for RAG implementations since I've read that they're more powerful than the alternative of RDFs\n\n  \nWhat confuses me is about how one should go about generating the knowledge graph in the first place. neo4j's own blog and various others propose using LLMs to extract the data for you, and construct a JSON/csv-esque format which is then ingested to create the knowledge graph\n\n  \nExcept it feels like I am poisoning the well here so to speak? If I have tons of text-based documents as my corpora, won't using LLMs to do the job of data extraction and graph generation have issues?\n\nOff the top of my head, I can think of the following issues:\n\n1) The LLM could generate duplicates of entities across documents/chunks (For example, the word \"White House\" is present in a bunch of various documents in various levels of described detail? The LLM could very well extract out multiple such 'White House' entities\n\nI did have an idea of pre-defining all entity types and relations and forcing he LLM to stick with that, as well do an NLP-based deduplication technique, though I am not sure if it'll work well\n\n  \n2) The LLM could just up and hallucinate up data. Bad for obvious reasons, since I don't want a garbage in = garbage out problem for the resultant rag\n\n  \n3) It could just generate wonky results with incorrect 'syntax'. Bad for obvious reasons\n\n  \n4) Manually extracting data and writing the appropriate CYPHER queries? Yeah, won't work out feasibly\n\n5) Using an NLP-based entity and relation extractor? Faster and cheaper compute-wise, but the duplication issue still remains. It does solve issue 3)\n\nWith all these issues comes the extra issue of validating the output graph. Feels like I'm biting off more than I can chew, since all of this is VERY hard to pack into a pipeline unless I make my own bespoke one for the domain I am focusing on. Is there a better way of doing things?",

          "text": "Knowledge graphs definitely aren't for the faint of heart. The reason everyone recommends using llms to generate the graph is because the alternatives involve significantly more effort. Stanford maintains the CoreNLP library which you can use and is deterministic so no hallucination risk. It's very easy to try out and once you see it's default hot mess you'll see why people risk it with llms.  \n  \nNowadays the risk of improper extraction is fairly low with the llm but the cost is obviously very high. For many RAG setups retrieval corpus's are large and queries are sparse. This can mean you are paying to have a llm generate a mostly unused graph which can hurt at scale.  \n[](https://alb.reddit.com/cr?za=ierAezmqakjkPaVDWKzCA3tCEIV4aCCC0bCRBCF5670AiSndpd2SMNGrxPD7pIs6QF_4_YGz223SK1eDI9NQaF3Bknih3JiBtO6-hq5KNJJm-M01GGJkGTYSSFvK9a--Ar68SJTzwWNl4P85wKLFZdf16OlAlcuEW3bQ8uXOYDazxjJfRvbl32NUYNgzANollM-JxDrxA9w5Y12eNTUmO27Ryo87KWbIfQIfJGpcpepJNJAFeDTsF2g3zJADNX9DoiMdVapRNgCzoQJ7qVHCxGrTGszYBwTzOhewPPUg97EFuriNOiSlKB8mgqfSm7Y6VBddMqH2m3j8H5TviyJQqm9pkBWo1-bQzRQvzseTDrb640e94Gk5GLcfiwM2rq0HtTVmaCwYyVGZ3xCSnsAe9uGOTYk9_rGGRR-AacQb5Mt_CAbs4yf7K4tOwLzW0Gf54Qf2tO_sJQF39wH8Ze8qdBof95qtUiZTkvswn5SQCJ_mUXzAHEUmOh-XA2Sl598ax2cyd-oM1T3oPMMf7m85Q99cXlzhY_Fp23SrxgpqwblimxUIWyD84KxrrgRU2ZpYBN3gxww2U4FwY6Rij4hIWQ7s-xTHsBcaSUSThgeUcd4XuZj5OATt&zp=EhBBaNqSZnW-BP4gOIznz82pQlrRYlfvaCNcyBIhs7wTVfWQDkGmlXivkNxEMtVXgXrymn3Wp2-145A4MY8bevLzVp1T2C9RxQn5ZonalUJpLtqYJENT7XBECPofmqZoSYN6dRcQs05mbKpeONZg3gNhIuibc7o_A9zb46C_7iccXXMOH2yC0cwG6bnT-efJDN_tqMYjKd2etZfrO3Y8GCROkZrxPUnmC--M3iUkc79mq0cOkoRo2W8LVfPMGq6mhq1oAyQ_hbSV6sOcq946_PtUYjPmN3kr4meSycYg_NXUQQfmxr99tsjBBv25tnzoWhw3hJHyQf_N6XQMXqpOhRCRm55i8xSv3PhZYuijg7qfIfRZ5LPyr2gvl21sBitjPlEmA2UuICjDB7Kypxrts7lNzRc-eCtDEuPDpGBHV3KpsXB30tBvlbVpNyhx2uMiFpeS4c3pn-Dii9nkkcviACMwawKXj0mue16rI3_gKxMWYnnStQ&a=598359&b=565262&be=383828&c=382514&d=568613&e=378211&ea=379178&eb=353934&f=352953&r=10&g=1&i=1768835127842&t=1768835729084&o=1&q=1&h=212&w=732&sh=864&sw=1536)  \nYou also identified the other issue which is canonicalization.

I just spent the last few hours reading various material and watching videos on the subject, but still can't  figure out the answer.\n\nConsider this use case (more of a toy problem than a real use case, but close enough in spirit):\n\nYou have a collection of cookbooks, each one being a PDF file several hundred pages long. Let's say you have a few hundreds of them. That is your knowledge base\n\nYou want to be able to query *exclusively* and *exhaustively* this knowledge base with question that may be as simple as:\n\n\"List *all* the recipes using kale in the knowledge base providing the source title, author, and page number.\"\n\nto more complex one such as, for instance, \n\n\"Provide a list of *all* recipes suitable as a main course that include a green vegetable similar to kale as one of the main ingredients, providing the source title, author, and page number.\"\n\n  \nIn short: I have a corpus of documents that are semantically fairly homogeneous and therefore all more or less relevant to the possible queries and I need to the answers to be exhaustive.\n\nThe resources I have read and watched, on the other hand, seem to focus on a different set of use cases, where they are confronted with a vast collection of potentially heterogeneous documents (e.g., all the internal policy documents of a large company) and are keen to extract the very few items relevant to the query at hand in order to integrate the LLM processing step.\n\nWelcoming all suggestions!",

          "text": "Your instinct that standard RAG might not fit here is worth taking seriously. The typical RAG setup optimizes for finding the most relevant handful of chunks, not exhaustive recall across a corpus. When you need every recipe with kale, similarity search with a top-k cutoff is fundamentally the wrong tool.\n\nWhat you're describing sounds more like a structured extraction problem. You'd want to parse each cookbook, extract recipe entities with their ingredients, metadata, and page references, then store that in something queryable like a database or search index. The LLM piece comes in for the fuzzy matching (\"green vegetable similar to kale\") but the exhaustive listing part needs deterministic retrieval.\n\nThe preprocessing step is where this gets tricky. PDF cookbooks are a nightmare because recipes span pages, ingredient lists get mangled, and section headers don't always parse cleanly. I work on document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev and this exact pattern comes up a lot. You need to see what your parser is actually extracting before you can trust any downstream queries.\n\nFor your use case, I'd explore a hybrid approach: structured extraction for the exhaustive search, semantic matching for the similarity queries. What format are these PDFs in? Scanned images or native text?",

      "text": "I've been working on RAG systems and kept running into the same frustrating pattern: I'd retrieve 10 documents per query, each a few thousand tokens long, but only a handful of sentences actually answered the question. The LLM would get distracted by all the noise, and my token costs were spiraling.\n\nI tried a few existing context pruning models, but they either only had tiny context windows (512 tokens), or weren't commercially usable. Nothing fit what I needed.\n\nSo I trained my own model to do semantic highlighting - basically, it scans through your retrieved context and identifies which sentences are actually relevant to the query. It's a small encoder-only model (0.6B params) that's fast to run and supports both English and Chinese.\n\nHere's how it works in practice:\n\n    from transformers import AutoModel\n    \n    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\n        \"zilliz/semantic-highlight-bilingual-v1\",\n        trust_remote_code=True\n    )\n    \n    question = \"What are the symptoms of dehydration?\"\n    context = \"\"\"\n    Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in.\n    Common signs include feeling thirsty and having a dry mouth.\n    The human body is composed of about 60% water.\n    Dark yellow urine and infrequent urination are warning signs.\n    Water is essential for many bodily functions.\n    Dizziness, fatigue, and headaches can indicate severe dehydration.\n    Drinking 8 glasses of water daily is often recommended.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    result = model.process(\n        question=question,\n        context=context,\n        threshold=0.5,\n        # language=\"en\",  # Language can be auto-detected, or explicitly specified\n        return_sentence_metrics=True,  # Enable sentence probabilities\n    )\n    \n    highlighted = result[\"highlighted_sentences\"]\n    print(f\"Highlighted {len(highlighted)} sentences:\")\n    for i, sent in enumerate(highlighted, 1):\n        print(f\"  {i}. {sent}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTotal sentences in context: {len(context.strip().split('.')) - 1}\")\n    \n    # Print sentence probabilities if available\n    if \"sentence_probabilities\" in result:\n        probs = result[\"sentence_probabilities\"]\n        print(f\"\\nSentence probabilities: {probs}\")\n\nOutput:\n\n    Highlighted 3 sentences:\n      1. Common signs include feeling thirsty and having a dry mouth.\n      2. Dark yellow urine and infrequent urination are warning signs.\n      3. Dizziness, fatigue, and headaches can indicate severe dehydration.\n    \n    Total sentences in context: 7\n    \n    Sentence probabilities: [0.017, 0.990, 0.002, 0.947, 0.001, 0.972, 0.001]\n\nOut of 7 sentences, it correctly picked the 3 that actually answer the question. The token reduction is huge - I'm seeing 70-80% savings in production use cases.\n\nThe model is based on the Provence architecture (encoder-only, token-level scoring) and trained on 5M+ bilingual samples. I used BGE-M3 Reranker v2 as the base model since it already handles long contexts (8192 tokens) and supports multiple languages well.\n\nReleased everything under MIT license if anyone wants to try it out.\n\nCurious if others have been tackling similar problems with RAG context management.

          "text": "Yeah, that's the usual story with RAG systems. You pull back way more context than you need and the LLM gets lost in the noise. Smart move training your own model for this.\n\nThe semantic highlighting approach is solid. I've seen similar patterns where people try to solve this with better retrieval (hybrid search, reranking) but miss that the real issue is context bloat after retrieval. Your model catches the stuff that made it through retrieval but shouldn't have.\n\nFew things to watch out for with this approach. First, the threshold tuning can be tricky. 0.5 might work great for some domains but be way off for others. I'd test across different question types because technical queries vs conversational ones can have very different score distributions.\n\nAlso, sentence-level splitting can miss context that spans multiple sentences. Like if you have \"The company reported losses. This was due to supply chain issues.\" Your model might only highlight the second sentence but lose the connection to what \"this\" refers to. Might be worth experimenting with paragraph-level or sliding window approaches for certain document types.\n\nThe bilingual support is nice though. Most context pruning solutions are English-only which is a pain if you're dealing with mixed-language documents.\n\nWhat kind of domains are you testing this on? Technical docs vs conversational content can behave pretty differently with semantic scoring. And are you seeing any cases where it's too aggressive with the pruning?",

So my problem is less how well it can handle many nodes performance speaking wise, but how fast can I find a specific node. So it's more about space management and so on.

It has a ton of customization available in it.\n\nIf you'd like the ability to build context graphs and view them in 3D in a single platform with zero coding, TrustGraph is free and open source:\n\n[https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph](https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph)",
