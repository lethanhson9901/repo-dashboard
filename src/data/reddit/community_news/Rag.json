      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I'd like to share (what I believe) may be a useful tool I've made.\n\nI was recently helping develop a cybersecurity RAG program with my dad (I'm 15). He probably didn't care about speed, but I did. In fact, I got annoyed. I couldn't find a single lightning fast PDF parser for RAG, with quality intact. I had this weird itch to scratch.. I wanted to change my chunking pipeline and see results INSTANTLY.\n\nAnd so, I ended up porting (kind of, though it has a different output format) `pymupdf4llm` to C, then binding it back to Python. And the results were insane.. not even as much as I thought.\n\n~300 pages a second. 30x faster than `pymupdf4llm`.\n\n\n## what exactly is it?\nA fast PDF extractor for Python. I used most of `pymupdf4llm`'s features and heuristics for detection and parsing as a reference, then wrote it in C for speed. However, unlike `pymupdf4llm` and many others, for RAG, I chose to output structured JSON with **heaps** of data: geometry, typography, document structure, etc.\n\n**speed:** ~300 pages/second on CPU. no GPU needed. 1 million pages in ~55 minutes.\n\n## the problem\nMost PDF extractors give you either raw text (fast but unusable) or *full on* OCR and ML kinda stuff. Anyway, for RAG, I believe you'd want structured data you can control; you want to build smart chunks based on document layout, not just word count. you'd want this fast, especially when processing large volumes.\n\nAlso, chunking matters more than people think. I'm serious here.. not even related to my tool, but I used to have 200 word slivers of text.. and bigger embedding models were NOT helping, lol.\n\n## what you get\n\nJSON output with metadata for every element:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"heading\",\n  \"text\": \"Step 1. Gather threat intelligence\",\n  \"bbox\": [64.00, 173.74, 491.11, 218.00],\n  \"font_size\": 21.64,\n  \"font_weight\": \"bold\"\n}\n```\n\nFor example, instead of splitting on word counts and overlaps, you can, now:\n- use bounding boxes to find semantic boundaries (*where does this chunk probably end*, **literally**.. instead of guessing for each document)\n- filter out headers and footers from the top & bottom of pages\n- and lots more. you've got ALL the data!\n\n## comparison table\n\n| Tool            | Speed (pps) | Tables | Images (Figures)                                  | OCR (Y/N)     | JSON Output      | Best For              |\n| --------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |\n| pymupdf4llm-C   | ~300        | Yes    | No (WIP)                                          | N             | Yes (structured) | RAG, high volume      |\n| pymupdf4llm     | ~10         | Yes    | Yes (but not ML to get contents)                  | N             | Markdown         | General extraction    |\n| pymupdf (alone) | ~250        | No     | No, not by itself, requires more effort I believe | N             | No (text only)   | basic text extraction |\n| marker          | ~0.5-1      | Yes    | Yes (contents with ML?)                           | Y (optional?) | Markdown         | Maximum fidelity      |\n| docling         | ~2-5        | Yes    | Yes                                               | Y             | JSON             | Document intelligence |\n| PaddleOCR       | ~20-50      | Yes    | Yes                                               | Y             | Text             | Scanned documents     |\n\n**the tradeoff:** speed and control over automatic extraction. marker and docling give higher fidelity if you have time; this is built for when you don't.\n\n## what it handles well\n\n- high volume PDF ingestion (millions of pages)\n- RAG pipelines where document structure matters for chunking\n- custom downstream processing; you own the logic\n- cost sensitive deployments; CPU only, no expensive inference\n- iteration speed; refine your chunking strategy in minutes\n\n## what it doesn't handle\n- scanned or image heavy PDFs (no OCR)\n- 99%+ accuracy on complex edge cases; this trades some precision for speed\n- figues or image extraction\n\n## why i built this\ni used this in my own RAG project and the difference was great. i got to see results instantly, and my chunks were better! (i used bounding boxes to find where one paragraph ends, not \"2000 chars, 500 overlap\").\n\n## links\nrepo: [https://github.com/intercepted16/pymupdf4llm-C](https://github.com/intercepted16/pymupdf4llm-C)\n\npip: `pip install pymupdf4llm-C` ([https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm-C](https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm-C))\n\nnote: prebuilt wheels from 3.9 -> 3.14 (inclusive) (macOS ARM, macOS x64, Linux (glibc > 2011)). no Windows. pain to build for.\n\ndocs and examples in the repo. would love feedback from anyone!",

The reason why we need slow stuff with OCR or VLMs is that PDF is a horrible abomination allowing for maximum contol over layout - it was designed for print. I had to write a tool to patch PDF contents once and I kid you not - whatever software they used to create these docs positioned each character on the page individually thru X/Y coords.\nThis makes document extraction at scale - where your solution would be extremely useful - very tricky. Arguably at scale, you don't really know what kind of docs you're going to encounter. And with information retrieval, people kinda care about 1%. Would be neat if some of the libraries with adaptive parsing took what you've built and used it for the first pass. That might result in much better overall throughput",

Most people are stuck with either pymupdf's raw text or waiting forever for marker to crawl through documents. 300 pages per second with structured output changes the game completely.\n\nThe JSON metadata approach is spot on. Bounding boxes let you chunk on actual document structure instead of arbitrary word counts. I see too many RAG systems failing because they're splitting mid-paragraph or breaking up tables. Your bbox-based chunking fixes that fundamental problem.\n\nOne thing I'd test is how well the font weight detection works across different PDF generators. Some tools embed fonts weirdly and \"bold\" doesn't always mean what you think. But for high-volume processing where you need good-enough extraction fast, this hits the sweet spot.\n\nThe comparison table tells the story. Marker gives you perfection at 0.5 pages per second. You're giving 80% of that quality at 600x the speed. For most RAG use cases, that math works out perfectly. When you're processing millions of pages, waiting 55 minutes instead of 55 hours matters more than catching every edge case.\n\nTesting different chunking strategies on the structured output, something vectorflow.dev handles well, would help you dial in the optimal approach for your specific documents. The metadata gives you enough control to experiment with semantic boundaries versus fixed sizes.",

Think of it as the layer between your PDF extractor and your vector database.\n\nThe font weight issue is trickier than most people realize. Adobe's PDF spec allows fonts to be embedded in about six different ways, and \"bold\" can be a font name, a weight property, or just how the renderer decides to display it. I've seen PDFs where the same visual boldness gets tagged three different ways in the metadata.\n\nYour 80/20 approach is dead right for most cases. The only time I'd reach for marker over your tool is when I'm dealing with academic papers with complex equations or heavily formatted financial documents where every table cell matters. For standard business documents, technical manuals, reports - your speed advantage wins every time.\n\nThe bbox chunking strategy you're enabling is underrated. Most people chunk on token counts and wonder why their retrieval sucks. When you can say \"everything between y-coordinates 150 and 400 is one logical section\" you get much cleaner semantic boundaries. Tables stay intact, headers don't get orphaned from their content.\n\nHave you tested how it handles PDFs with multiple column layouts? That's usually where bbox-based approaches either shine or fall apart completely.",

A guy at a networking event asked \"where is the data stored?\" I proudly said \"OpenAI, Claude, you can pick!\" He walked away. A week later, a lawyer told me straight up: \"We will never feed client cases to ChatGPT or any US company due to privacy concerns\".\n\nThat was my wake-up call. The EU market REALLY cares about data sovereignty, and it's only getting stronger.\n\n**The full migration**\n\nHere's what I had to replace:\n\n\n\n|Component|Before|After|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|LLMs|GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc...|Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen3 235B, DeepSeek R1, Mistral Nemo, Gemma 3, Holo2|\n|Embeddings|Cohere|Qwen-embedding (seriously impressed by this)|\n|Re-ranking|Cohere Rerank|RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)|\n|OCR|LlamaParse|Mistral OCR|\n|Object Storage|AWS S3|Scaleway (French)|\n|Hosting|AWS|Hetzner (German)|\n|Vector DB|\\-|VectorChord (self-hosted on Hetzner)|\n|Analytics|Google Analytics|Plausible (EU)|\n|Email|Sender|Scaleway|\n\n**On ditching Cohere Rerank for RRF**\n\nThis was the hardest trade-off. Cohere's reranker is really good, but I couldn't find an EU-hosted alternative that didn't require running my own inference setup. So I went with RRF instead.\n\nFor those unfamiliar: RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) merges multiple ranked lists (e.g., BM25 + vector search) into a unified ranking based on position rather than raw scores. It's not as sophisticated as a neural reranker (such as Cohere Re-reanker), but it's surprisingly effective when you're already doing hybrid search.\n\n**Embedding quality**\n\nSwitching from Cohere to Qwen-embedding was actually a pleasant surprise. The retrieval quality is comparable, and having it run on EU infrastructure without vendor lock-in is a huge win. I'm using the 8B parameter version.\n\n**What I'm still figuring out**\n\n* Better chunking strategies, currently experimenting with semantic chunking using LLMs to maintain context (I already do this with website crawling).\n* Whether to add a lightweight reranker back (maybe a distilled model I can self-host?)\n* Agentic document parsing for complex PDFs with tables/images\n\n**Try it out**\n\nIf you want to see the RAG in action:\n\n* **ChatGPT-style knowledge base:** [help.chatvia.ai](https://help.chatvia.ai)  this is our docs trained as a chatbot\n* **Embeddable widget:** [chatvia.ai](https://chatvia.ai)  check the bottom-right corner\n\n**Future plans**\n\nI'm planning to gradually open-source the entire stack:\n\n* Document parsing pipeline\n* Chat widget\n* RAG orchestration layer\n\nThe goal is to make it available for on-premise hosting.\n\nAnyone else running a fully EU-hosted RAG stack? Would love to compare notes on what's working for you.",

Dealing with an unstable US government is a headache for every and any non-US company and country. And it is deemed to be 'not worth the headache anymore\" in the EU. And I'm quite sure that many other countries on other continents feel the same way. They may not (yet) officially proclaim it, but they sure do.

Because the US was making a significant sum of money from cloud-services in the EU.

Your embedding switch working out is huge because that's where most quality degradation happens during migrations.\n\nThe chunking experiments you mentioned are where I'd focus next. Semantic chunking with LLMs can work well but gets expensive fast when you're processing volume. What I've seen work better is hybrid approaches where you do initial structural chunking based on document hierarchy, then use the LLM selectively for edge cases like tables or complex sections. Keeps costs manageable while handling the tricky parts.\n\nFor the reranker question, you might want to look at BGE or similar models you can self-host. They're not Cohere-level but significantly better than pure RRF, especially when your retrieval is pulling from heterogeneous document types. The performance hit from RRF usually shows up when you have mixed content formats where position-based fusion breaks down.\n\nYour agentic parsing mention caught my attention because that's exactly the kind of pipeline complexity that becomes a nightmare to debug when something goes wrong. Document processing pipelines fail silently and you don't discover the issues until retrieval starts returning garbage. I work on tooling for this exact problem at vectorflow.dev, specifically around making document preprocessing visible before it hits your vector store.\n\nWhat's your current approach for validating that parsed content actually looks right before embedding? Most people discover their PDF tables got mangled only after users complain about weird responses.",

          "text": "I don't think its weakness will be in its architectural complexity. In fact, this should make RAG simpler to deploy: You pick a model family, and the encoding/retrieval choice has already been made for you.\n\nI think one issue will be a lack of customization. If you've got an embedding setup you're happy with, perhaps even fine-tuning an embedder model to do a better job differentiating your production corpus, kiss all that goodbye because the model architecture will making all those choices for you now, except perhaps compression level.\n\nAlso there's migration / lock-in risk. Unless these new compressed representations become standardized somehow (doubt it), you might have to re-embed your entire corpus every time you want to switch model families. Maybe even for upgrades, if those include major improvements in the latent embeddings. That could cost a lot of money. Still, that kind of lock-in problem is expected with any integration, be it choice of cloud or Apple's software/hardware integration. You end up in an ecosystem with a higher exit cost.\n\nInteresting post, hadn't heard of this. I'm new to this LLM stuff, just starting to tinker.\n\n---\n\nEdit: On the face of it, this seems so useful that I've changed my mind. Surely one or more standards for these \"compact continuous memory-token\" vectors will emerge so everyone can encode to that standard, then hot-plug models into it. Doesn't mean model-specific proprietary schemes won't emerge too, but I'd expect to see some standards emerge if this architecture becomes popular.",

I battle tested just about everything you can imagine, from Python OCR pipelines to Grok, GPT, Claude, and others. Because the output was for audiobooks, precision and quality were non negotiable, which made this especially difficult.\n\nIn the end, no one came close to Mistral OCR. And I mean no one, by a thousand miles.\n\nPricing was $0.003 to $0.007 per page, with a batch API that can process an entire PDF library. But the real kicker is the JSON schema support.\n\nYou define exactly not only how the content is returned, but also the meta analysis you want run on each page. Meta data like; is this page part of a table of contents? Does the text continue on the next page, or is the last sentence complete?  There are no prompt gimmicks to force valid JSON. It is native, structured, and reliable. It is also massively strong in multiple languages, which mattered for us since the content was in French.\n\nWhat used to be a complex, fragile pipeline is now simple. An R2 bucket, a PDF upload, a queue event triggered on upload, a 20 line Cloudflare Worker invoking Mistral, and all content is saved back into R2 and automatically indexed by Cloudflare RAG. That is it. Nothing else. You could build the same thing on AWS in less than a day.\n\nRight now I am working on a much more challenging project: converting an archive of 500,000 printed architectural blueprints, mostly phone and fiber cable connections inside buildings, so we have a powerful search engine with an agent that can generate a first pass analysis and inventory for technicians planning a repair at a location.",

      "text": "Chunking is one of those \"solved problems\" that nobody thinks about until you're processing millions of documents and your pipeline is bottlenecked on text splitting.\n\nWe ran into this building Chonkie (our chunking library) and decided to see how fast we could actually go. The result is memchunk — a SIMD-accelerated chunker hitting ~1 TB/s.\n\nWhy chunking speed matters:\n\nFor a single document? It doesn't. Even slow chunkers are \"fast enough.\"\n\nBut when you're:\n\n- Indexing a knowledge base with 100k+ documents\n- Reprocessing your corpus after changing chunk sizes\n- Running experiments with different chunking strategies\n- Building a pipeline that ingests documents continuously\n\nchunking becomes a real bottleneck. We were spending more time chunking than embedding on large corpora.\n\nThe problem with most chunkers:\n\n1. Token-based chunkers call the tokenizer for every chunk boundary decision. Tokenizers are slow (relatively).\n2. Character splitters are fast but dumb — they cut sentences in half, destroying semantic coherence.\n3. Sentence splitters use NLP models or regex, adding overhead.\n\nOur approach:\n\nSplit at delimiters (., ?, \\n, etc.) using SIMD-accelerated byte search. You get semantically meaningful boundaries without the tokenizer overhead.\n\nThe key insight: search backwards from your target size. Forward search requires scanning the whole window and tracking the last delimiter. Backward search? One lookup.\n\nBenchmarks:\n\n| Approach | Throughput |\n| --- | --- |\n| memchunk | ~1 TB/s |\n| Other Rust chunkers | ~1 GB/s |\n| Typical Python chunker | ~3 MB/s |\n\nThe trade-off:\n\nmemchunk operates on bytes, not tokens. Your chunks won't be exactly 512 tokens — they'll be approximately N bytes, split at sentence boundaries.\n\nFor most RAG use cases, this is fine. Embedding models handle variable-length inputs, and the semantic coherence from proper sentence boundaries matters more than exact token counts.\n\nIf you absolutely need token-precise chunks (e.g., filling context windows exactly), use a tokenizer-based chunker. But for ingestion pipelines? Byte-based is 1000x faster.\n\nHow to use it:\n\nStandalone:\n\nInstall: `pip install memchunk`\n\n```\nfrom memchunk import chunk\nfor c in chunk(text, size=4096, delimiters=\".?\\n\"):\nprocess(c)\n```\n\nWith Chonkie:\nInstall: `pip install chonkie[fast]`\n\n```\nfrom chonkie import FastChunker\nchunker = FastChunker(chunk_size=4096, delimiters=\"\\n.?\")\nchunks = chunker(corpus)\n```\n\nFeatures for RAG:\n\n- delimiters=\".?!\\n\" — split at sentence/paragraph boundaries\n- pattern=\"\\n\\n\" — split at paragraph breaks (double newlines)\n- consecutive=True — handle multiple newlines cleanly\n- Returns start/end indices so you can track provenance\n\n\nCheck us out on Github! https://github.com/chonkie-inc/memchunk\n\nRead more about how memchunk works: https://minha.sh/posts/so,-you-want-to-chunk-really-fast",

      "text": "Recently had a client ask me at the last minute to ingest a large corpus of highly structured PDFs into the db for this application I’m building them. Some of these docs are several hundred pages long, and this was one of those frustrating examples of needless heartache because the PDFs were clearly exported from Word, they just couldn’t track down the original docx files.\n\nRight off the jump, the existing ingestion pipeline I’d built with Docling failed miserably (up until now it’s been structured file formats with the occasional small PDF, and ingestion has been pretty flawless). I spent way too much time trying to tweak things until I resorted to parsing pages with qwen3-vl and correcting all the formatting/parsing errors manually to meet an external deadline.\n\nAfter the number of different open-source tools/libraries I’ve tried at this point (including some of unstructured’s open-source pdf tools, would consider paid options if I knew they’d work *much* better), I’m having trouble comprehending how something as dumb as getting reliably correct, structured text from a PDF (that’s visually identical to a word doc, no less) can be this much of a damn headache. Even just a single missing bullet point or incorrect section index in the right spot can completely throw off chunking and create total nightmares with retrieval later on.\n\nLike am I missing something, here? I feel confident in saying I’m good at what I do, but I think the client would have second thoughts about my competency if I told them I just spent all this time manually preprocessing documents to build them an application to literally automate preprocessing documents (not billing by the hour btw). I don’t usually work with PDFs much, especially not of this size (where structural components like chapters, lists, appendixes, etc become SUPER important), so if anyone here does and has some pro tips, please please please do share 🙏",

The frustrating thing is that there’s all these little human inconsistencies that any hard-coded preprocessing logic has to account for, e.g. in one document, subsection indexes would look like this: ‘(a)’, while another one has ‘a)’ or ‘a:’.

The fact that you resorted to manual fixing proves you care about data integrity. Most devs would have just ingested the garbage, delivered a hallucinating bot, and blamed the LLM. **You did the job.**\n\n**Why this happens (The \"Word Export\" Trap):**  \nPDFs exported from Word are deceptively evil. Visually, they look structured  \nUnder the hood, a \"bullet point list\" in Word often gets exported as:\n\n1. A floating symbol (•) at coordinates X,Y.\n2. A text block at coordinates X+10, Y. Standard parsers (even Docling sometimes) read this as two separate, unrelated blocks. The semantic connection (\"This is a list item\") is lost.\n\n**The Solution: The Multi-Lane Approach**  \nI spent the last 2 years building an Enterprise RAG Architecture (V3 Core) exactly because of this headache. I found that **no single tool** works for 100% of pages.\n\n**My architecture uses a \"Consensus Engine\":**\n\n1. **Lane A (Text Layer):** Since it's a Word export, the text layer is usually clean. Use PyMuPDF to extract raw text fast.\n2. **Lane B (Vision):** Use a VLM (like Qwen2-VL or Llama 3.2 Vision) – **BUT** not to read everything. Use it to extract the **Skeleton** (Headers, List structures, Table boundaries).\n3. **Merge:** Map the clean text from Lane A into the visual skeleton from Lane B.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Advice for you:**  \nSince you are on a deadline: Don't try to find the \"perfect tool\". It doesn't exist.  \nIf the docs are critical, **Hybrid Parsing** is the only way.  \nUse the Text Layer for content accuracy (0 hallucinations) and Vision for structural boundaries (Chunking)\n\nDon't let the client make you feel bad.

Can you elaborate on how you’re merging clean text with the skeleton?

Also haven’t tried it with json output format, but now I’m wondering if there’s an elegant-ish way to enforce a pydantic output schema so I can pipe qwen3 outputs directly into a Docling document model…?",

          "text": "Yeah, that's the usual story with complex PDFs. The problem isn't your competency, it's that most parsing tools treat PDFs like they're just text with some formatting when they're actually structured documents with hierarchies, relationships, and semantic meaning that gets completely destroyed during extraction.\n\nWhat's killing you is the invisibility problem. You can't see what went wrong until you're deep into chunking and retrieval, discovering that bullet points got merged into paragraphs or section headers disappeared entirely. By then you're debugging symptoms three steps removed from the actual parsing failure.\n\nFor large structured PDFs, you need to preserve document hierarchy during extraction. Most tools flatten everything into linear text, which destroys the relationships between sections, subsections, and list items that your chunking strategy depends on. The fact that these were exported from Word makes it worse because they have implicit structure that PDFs don't preserve well.\n\nA few things to try: First, use OCR even on text-based PDFs. Sometimes the text extraction is garbage but the visual layout is clean. Second, chunk by logical sections rather than arbitrary token counts. If you can identify headers and preserve that hierarchy, your retrieval will be much more accurate. Third, validate your parsed output before chunking. Most people skip this step and wonder why their chunks are nonsensical.\n\nThe real issue is you're flying blind during document processing. I've been building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_i) specifically for this problem because you need to see what your docs actually look like after parsing, before you commit to chunking strategies.\n\nWhat does your current output look like when Docling processes one of these PDFs?

Still thinking about how I want to implement that, but I’m all but certain at this point that’s how I’m going to design the pdf pipeline. Out of curiosity—when you say validate the parsed output, am I correct in assuming you mean Pydantic/something similar?

But yeah to answer your question, this client has a few specific use cases for this but a good example is retrieving detailed compliance info they might receive from one of their own clients inside of an RFP. For reference, the compliance section of an RFP in their industry can be 300-400+ pages long and it’s all hyper-detailed (think specific codes, names, numbers, etc for various rules and regulations). This application helps the people who’d write the proposal in response to that RFP to get all the miscellaneous, granular details they need without having to spend half their time hunting for them.\n\nIt’s important for the db (neo4j) to map the structural hierarchy of the document so that when a cosine similarity or whatever retrieval method turns up a specific chunk, you can walk up and down the ‘tree’ to add additional context based on the location. For example, what chapter/section does this chunk belong to (since those typically name specific rules/regulations explicitly, while the chunk itself might only refer to it implicitly). It’s also often useful to add the previous/next chunks as context, but only if they’re at the same anatomical ‘level’ as the original chunk (so you don’t add irrelevant stuff from the next chapter because the original chunk happened to be the very last one in its respective chapter).\n\n Also knowing exactly where chunks came from so the model can cite sources in its responses is **critical** for fact-checking and safeguarding against hallucinations, (especially in this industry where a simple clerical mistake can cost thousands in fines), not to mention just plain useful for them.",

          "text": "Yep — you’ve hit the “looks like Word, therefore it should parse like Word” trap. PDF is basically a rendering snapshot, so the semantic stuff you care about (lists, headings, reading order) is often implicit or just gone, even when it was exported from Word.\n\nA few things that have saved me pain in production:\n\nFirst, classify what you’re dealing with before you try to be clever. Born-digital PDFs with a clean text layer behave very differently than scanned/mixed ones, and even within born-digital you’ll see “nice text” but broken reading order because of columns, headers/footers, floating text boxes, etc. If it’s not stable, route it through a different path early instead of burning hours trying to tweak one tool.\n\nTreat layout as first-class signal, not just the text stream. Font size/weight, indentation, line spacing, and bounding boxes are what usually let you reconstruct headings and lists. Bullets and numbering are notoriously fragile if you rely on plain text output.\n\nChunk by structure rather than fixed token windows. Even an imperfect hierarchy based on detected headings/section titles beats 1k-token chunks when appendices/chapters matter, because you’ll preserve intent and reduce “wrong neighbors” in retrieval.\n\nKeep provenance for everything you store: page number and offsets at minimum, and bounding boxes when you can. It makes debugging and “why did the model say this?” conversations a lot less painful.\n\nAdd a quick QC pass and a fallback. Simple checks like “did list item counts change?”, “did numbering skip?”, “did section headings disappear?” catch the cases that will later destroy chunking. When it fails, automatically re-run just those pages/sections with a more expensive extractor (layout-aware or vision-based) instead of paying that cost everywhere.\n\nAnd if the client can’t find the DOCX, ask them to re-export a tagged/accessible PDF if they possibly can. When headings and lists actually exist in the document structure tree, life gets dramatically easier — it’s the closest you’ll get to “DOCX semantics” coming out of a PDF.",

Like @[ChapterEquivalent18](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChapterEquivalent188/) said as well, Document Processing isn't a solved field yet, even though it's just word exports, there can be a lot of nuances around formatting, tables and such which even we might miss out on if we're not paying attention.\n\nIf you think about it, you ended up automating 70-80% of the work and manually had to correct around 20% of it max, which in perspective is 800 pages looking great and 200 needing some manual help (at worst?), which is something great that we tend to underappreciate.\n\nI work with Unstructured, and since you mentioned trying out open-source tool and being open to paid options, have you checked out our [platform](https://unstructured.io/?modal=try-for-free)? We've been making a lot of improvements here, including parsing strategies with newer VLMs like GPT-5.1. There's a 15k page free trial as well, so it might be worth trying a few pages first to see how it handles them, especially since you're working against deadlines and need something reliable at scale. I can also chat more if you've got more questions. \n\nYou’re doing amazing. I hope your client sees it too!!",

Now I'm trying to nail down the document parsing side of things.\n\n**Background:** I'm working on a fully self hosted RAG system.\n\nCurrently I'm using docling for parsing PDFs, docx files and images, combined with rapidocr for scanned pdfs. I have my custom chunking algorithm that chunks the parsed content in the way i want. It works pretty well for the most part, but I get the occasional hiccup with messy scanned documents or weird layouts. I just wanna make sure that I haven't made the wrong call, since there are lots of tools out there.\n\nMy use case involves handling a mix of everything really. Clean digital PDFs, scanned documents, Word files, the lot. Users upload whatever they have and expect it to just work.\n\nFor those of you running document parsing in production for your RAG systems:\n\n* What are you using for your parsing pipeline?\n* How do you handle the scanned vs native digital document split?\n* Any specific tools or combinations that have proven reliable at scale ?\n\nI've looked into things like unstructured, pypdf, marker, etc but there's so many options and I'd rather hear from people who've **actually** battle tested these in real deployments rather than just going off benchmarks.\n\nWould be great to hear what's actually working for people in the wild.\n\nI've already looked into deepseekocr after i saw people hyping it, but it's too memory intensive for my use case and kinda slow.\n\nI understand that i'm looking for a self hosted solution, but even if you have something that works pretty well tho it's not self hosted, please feel free to share. I plan on connecting cloud apis for potential customers that wont care if its self hosted.\n\nBig thanks in advance for you help ❤️. The last post here, gave me some really good insights.",

I’ll just say I was very disappointed when I needed it to process large, complex PDFs. \n\nThe whole DoclingDocument ‘ecosystem’ with Pydantic is super tempting as a general purpose solution for your project, but imho the documentation’s pretty bad (and there are quite a few different bugs, though to their credit they were very quick to push an update to one open issue I was asking about on GitHub). That becomes a major hassle when you need to tweak/tune the pipeline for your data instead of rewriting it, but can’t easily determine the scope of your options in the first place without taking the time to dig through source code. Idk I’m always left with this feeling there’s probably way more Docling can do than I’m aware of—but I’ll only find out about those things by getting lucky and reading the right Reddit post or spending more time reading through the source code and model json files to familiarize myself.\n\nI’m still torn about how much/whether to use Docling going forward because certain constructs/methods are incredibly useful, but without being confident I can quickly work through bugs in the future or knowing more conclusively how much I can scale my project with it gives me serious pause. Just make sure to keep things very modular and dependencies loosely coupled.",

I still have it running for testing also use notebookllm and chatGPT for testing (this is what your users see or do)\nIn general they're fine, most people don't even read the whole document much less understand it.

They all have hiccups that's the nature of using LLMs. To reduce these hiccups you need quite a few things depending on your use case. \n\nI'm assuming you need an internal knowledge base that's why you're looking at rag, but knowledge bases have been around even before the internet, searching came soon after. So I'm assuming you need to incorporate LLMs for some reason because searching isn't good enough.

      "text": "After shipping hybrid search into multiple production systems (RAG/chatbots, product search, and support search) over the last 18 months, here's a practical playbook of what actually mattered. Full disclosure: we build retrieval/RAG systems for customers, so these are lessons we learned on real traffic, not toy benchmarks.\n\n**Why hybrid search**\n\nVector search finds semantics but misses exact matches (SKUs, IDs, proper nouns). BM25/TF-IDF finds exact tokens but misses paraphrases. Hybrid = pragmatic: combine both and tune for your user needs.\n\n**Quick decision flow (how to pick an approach)**\n\n\\- Need fastest time-to-market + minimal ops? Try a vector DB with built-in hybrid (Weaviate-style) if it fits your scale.  \n\\- Need tight control over scoring, advanced reranking, or best-effort accuracy? Use vector DB (Qdrant/FAISS) + a separate BM25 engine (Postgres full-text or Elasticsearch) and fuse results.  \n\\- Need transactional consistency, joins, or want a single source of truth for metadata and embeddings? Use Postgres + pgvector.\n\n**Patterns & code snippets**  \n  \nBuilt-in hybrid (example: Weaviate-style)  \nPros: simple API, single service, alpha knob for weighting. Cons: less control, black-box internals, possible limits on scale/tuning.\n\nPython pseudo-example:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python  \n\\# high-level example (client API varies by vendor)  \nresults = client.query.get(\"Document\", \\[\"content\"\\]) \\\\  \n.with\\_hybrid(query=\"how to cancel subscription\", alpha=0.7) \\\\  \n.with\\_limit(10) \\\\  \n.do()  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nTuning knobs: alpha (0..1), limit, semantic model version, chunking strategy.\n\nWhen to pick: small team, want fewer moving parts, need quick prototype, acceptable to trade some control for speed.\n\n\\---\n\n2) Multi-engine: Qdrant (vectors) + BM25 (Postgres/Elasticsearch)\n\nPattern A: Fuse scores from two full-retrievals  \n\\- Vector DB: get top-N semantic candidates  \n\\- BM25: get top-N lexical candidates  \n\\- Normalize scores and combine (alpha weighting or RRF)\n\nPattern B: Two-stage rerank (fast, often better tail quality)  \n\\- Stage 1: vector search to get \\~100 candidates  \n\\- Stage 2: BM25 (or cross-encoder) reranks those candidates\n\nExample normalization + fusion (Python sketch):\n\n\\`\\`\\`python  \n\\# vector\\_results = \\[{'id':id, 'score':v\\_score}, ...\\]  \n\\# bm25\\_scores = {doc\\_id: raw\\_score}\n\ndef normalize(scores):  \nvals = list(scores.values())  \nmx, mn = max(vals), min(vals)  \nif mx == mn: return {k: 1.0 for k in scores}  \nreturn {k: (v - mn) / (mx - mn) for k, v in scores.items()}\n\nvec = {r\\['id'\\]: r\\['score'\\] for r in vector\\_results}  \nvec\\_n = normalize(vec)  \nbm25\\_n = normalize(bm25\\_scores)\n\nalpha = 0.7  \ncombined = {}  \nfor doc in set(vec\\_n) | set(bm25\\_n):  \ncombined\\[doc\\] = alpha \\* vec\\_n.get(doc, 0) + (1 - alpha) \\* bm25\\_n.get(doc, 0)\n\nranked = sorted(combined.items(), key=lambda x: x\\[1\\], reverse=True)  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nTrade-offs: more infra and operational complexity, but more control over scoring, reranking, and caching. Two-stage rerank gives best cost/quality trade-off in many cases.\n\n\\---\n\n3) Postgres + pgvector (single-system hybrid)\n\nWhy choose this: transactional writes, rich joins (user/profile metadata), ability to keep embeddings in the same DB as your authoritative rows.\n\nExample schema and query (Postgres 14+ with pgvector extension):\n\n\\`\\`\\`sql  \n\\-- table: documents(id serial, content text, embedding vector(1536), ts tsvector)  \n\\-- create index on vector  \nCREATE INDEX ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding vector\\_cosine\\_ops) WITH (lists = 100);  \n\\-- create full-text index  \nCREATE INDEX documents\\_ts\\_idx ON documents USING GIN (ts);\n\n\\-- hybrid query: weight vector distance and text rank  \nSELECT id, content,  \n(1 - (embedding <#> :query\\_embedding)) AS vec\\_sim,    -- cosine distance -> similarity  \nts\\_rank\\_cd(ts, plainto\\_tsquery(:q)) AS ft\\_rank,  \n0.7 \\* (1 - (embedding <#> :query\\_embedding)) + 0.3 \\* ts\\_rank\\_cd(ts, plainto\\_tsquery(:q)) AS hybrid\\_score  \nFROM documents  \nWHERE ts @@ plainto\\_tsquery(:q)  \nORDER BY hybrid\\_score DESC  \nLIMIT 20;  \n\\`\\`\\`text\n\nNotes:  \n\\- pgvector uses \\`<->\\` or \\`<#>\\` operators depending on metric; check your version.  \n\\- You can include rows that don't match ts query by using LEFT JOIN or removing the WHERE clause and controlling ft\\_rank nulls.  \n\\- Use \\`lists\\` (IVF lists) and \\`probes\\` tuning for ivfflat; \\`lists\\` affects index size and build time.\n\nTrade-offs: single system simplicity and ACID guarantees vs scaling limits (need to shard or read-replicate for very high throughput). Maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE) matters.\n\n**Tuning knobs that actually moved metrics for us**\n\n\\- Chunking: semantic-aware chunks (paragraph boundaries) beat fixed token windows for recall.  \n\\- Alpha (vector vs BM25): tune per use-case. FAQ/support: favor vector (\\~0.7). SKU/product-id exact-match: lower alpha.  \n\\- Candidate set size for rerank: retrieving 100-500 candidates and reranking often beats smaller sets.  \n\\- Normalization: min-max per-query or rank-based fusion (RRF) is safer than naive raw-score mixing.  \n\\- Embedding model: pick one and be consistent; differences matter less than chunking and reranking.  \n\\- Index params: nlist/nprobe (FAISS), ef/search\\_k (HNSW), \\`lists\\`/\\`probes\\` (pgvector ivfflat) — tune for your latency/recall curve.\n\n**Evaluation checklist (offline + online)**\n\nOffline:  \n\\- recall@k (k = 10, 50)  \n\\- MRR (mean reciprocal rank)  \n\\- Precision@k if relevance labels exist  \n\\- Diversity / redundancy checks\n\nOnline:  \n\\- latency p50/p95 (target SLA)  \n\\- synthetic query coverage (tokenized vs paraphrase)  \n\\- task success (e.g., issue resolved, product clicked)  \n\\- cost per Q (compute + index storage)\n\nExperimentation:  \n\\- A/B test different alphas and reranker thresholds  \n\\- Log and sample failures for manual review\n\n**Ops & deployment tips**\n\n\\- Version embeddings: store model name + version to allow reindexing safely.  \n\\- Incremental reindex: prefer small, transactional updates rather than bulk rebuilds where possible.  \n\\- Cache hot queries and pre-warm frequently used embeddings.  \n\\- Monitor drift: embeddings/models change over time; schedule periodic re-evaluation.  \n\\- Fallbacks: if vector DB fails, use BM25-only fallback instead of returning an error.  \n\\- Attribution: always include source IDs/snippets in generated responses to avoid hallucination.\n\n**Common failure modes**\n\n\\- Mixing raw scores without normalization — one engine dominates.  \n\\- Using too-small candidate set and missing correct docs.  \n\\- Not accounting for metadata (date, user region) in ranking — causes irrelevant hits.  \n\\- Treating hybrid as a silver bullet: some queries need exact filters before retrieval (e.g., rate-limited or region-restricted docs).\n\n\\---\n\n**Example test queries to validate hybrid behavior**\n\n\\- \"how to cancel subscription\"  \n\\- \"SKU-12345 warranty\"  \n\\- \"refund policy for order 9876\"  \n\\- \"best GPU for training transformer models\"\n\nFor each query, inspect: top-10 results, source IDs, whether exact-match tokens rank up, and whether paraphrase matches appear.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\\- Hybrid = vectors + lexical. Pick the approach based on control vs speed-to-market vs transactional needs.  \n\\- Weaviate-style built-in hybrid is fastest to ship; multi-engine (Qdrant + BM25) gives most control and best quality with reranking; Postgres+pgvector gives transactional simplicity and joins.  \n\\- Chunking, candidate set size, and normalization/reranking matter more than small differences in embedding models.  \n\\- Always evaluate with recall@k, MRR, and online KPIs; version embeddings and plan for incremental reindexing.\n\nI'd love to hear how others fuse scores in production: do you prefer normalization, rank fusion (RRF), or two-stage rerank?

One thing we've been experimenting with that complements hybrid retrieval: adding a coherence scoring stage after fusion.\n\nThe problem with alpha tuning is you're still combining two \"how close is this?\" signals. Neither actually answers \"does this candidate resolve the query under its constraints?\"\n\nExample: \"refund policy for order 9876\" — hybrid might rank a general refund FAQ highly (good semantic match, maybe BM25 hit on \"refund\"). But it doesn't satisfy the constraint field (specific order). A coherence check catches that.\n\nWe run it as a lightweight post-retrieval filter: retrieve 50-100 candidates with hybrid → score coherence against query constraints → pass top-k to generation.\n\nThe nice part is it's orthogonal to your retrieval stack. Works with Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector, whatever. 26MB engine, deterministic, runs locally.\n\nCurious if you've experimented with anything similar — rerankers partially address this but they're still similarity-based.",

              "text": "This is a fantastic addition. The point about checksumming reference embeddings to catch silent API updates is something I hadn’t implemented, but I’m definitely stealing that idea. It’s a silent killer for long-running systems.\n\nRegarding temporal relevance, it’s tricky because you don't want recency to override semantic relevance entirely (e.g., a relevant doc from 2022 vs. an irrelevant one from today).\n\nHere is how we usually handle it in production:\n\n\\- Decay Functions (The \"Soft\" Way): In systems like Elasticsearch or Weaviate, we apply a Gaussian decay function based on the timestamp. It acts as a multiplier on the hybrid score. The key is tuning the scale so the decay isn't too aggressive. Usually, we just want to break ties or give a slight edge to newer content, not bury older foundational docs.\n\n\\- Hard Filters (The \"Hard\" Way): For things like news or urgent support issues, we sometimes enforce a hard filter (e.g., date > now - 1 year) before the vector search, but this hurts recall for \"legacy\" problems.\n\n\\- Reranking Signal: If we use a cross-encoder (Stage 2), we sometimes inject the date into the text passed to the reranker (e.g., \\[Date: 2024-01-01\\] Content...) so the model explicitly sees the freshness, though this relies heavily on the model's training.\n\nDo you use the decay approach, or have you found a way to incorporate recency directly into the RRF logic?",

Spent a few weeks learning about embeddings and how they match the models. (So qwen uses qwen embedding, Gemma uses Gemma embedding, etc). Definitely research embedding and try to understand how it works if you don’t. I also think having a second program just for visualizing your RAG embeddings is great to have. I set it up so I can even see where the query is being connected to in latent space of the visualization for trouble shooting if a failure happened. You can see how the model query found an answer in the RAG according to its position in latent space relative to the RAG documents.

      "text": "As the team behind the Milvus vector database, and we keep hearing the same complaint from AI app developers:\n\n“Why are my vector costs so high? It doesn’t make sense to pay so much for inactive users’ data.”\n\nAfter digging into this problem, we studied real-world search patterns and discovered a common behavior. For a consumer app, developers load 100% of their users’ embeddings into RAM, but nearly 80% of those vectors are barely ever queried. They sit idle while consuming the most expensive resource.\n\nThat felt wasteful.\n\nSo our team spent several months rebuilding the scheduling strategy with a simple idea in mind: treat local storage like a cache, not a database.\n\n**Here's what we built:**\n\n🔷 **Lazy loading** \\- We only load metadata at startup. Collection becomes queryable in seconds, not 25 minutes. Actual data gets fetched when queries need it.\n\n🔷 **Partial loading** \\- Why load tenant B's data when you're querying tenant A? Now we only fetch the specific segments/columns each query actually needs.\n\n🔷 **LRU eviction** \\- We track which items are actually queried. When the cache fills up, cold data is automatically evicted to make space for active data.\n\nWe tested this with 100M vectors (768-dim) and saw memory drop from 430GB to about 85GB at steady state, hot queries stayed basically the same speed (under 7% increase), and load time went from 25 minutes down to 45 seconds. The trade-off felt worth it.\n\nWe wrote up the full technical details here if you want to dig deeper: [https://milvus.io/blog/milvus-tiered-storage-80-less-vector-search-cost-with-on-demand-hot%E2%80%93cold-data-loading.md?utm\\_source=reddit](https://milvus.io/blog/milvus-tiered-storage-80-less-vector-search-cost-with-on-demand-hot%E2%80%93cold-data-loading.md?utm_source=reddit)\n\nCurious if others are exploring similar cache-based approaches for large-scale RAG?",

You want to **use an existing vector index built with one embedding model and query it with another** \\- if it's expensive or problematic to re-embed your entire corpus, this is the package for you.\n2. You can also **operate mixed vector indexes** and map to the embedding space that works best for different questions.\n3. You can **save cost on questions that are easily adapted**, \"What's the nearest restaurant that has a Hamburger?\" no need to pay for an expensive cloud provider, or wait to perform an unnecessary network hop, embed locally on the device with an embedding adapter and return results instantly.\n\nIt also lets you experiment with provider embeddings you may not have access to.  By using the adapters on some queries and examples, you can compare how different embedding models behave relative to one another and get an early signal on what might work for your data before committing to a provider.\n\nThis makes it practical to:  \n\\- **sample providers you don't have direct access to**  \n\\- **migrate or experiment with embedding models gradually** instead of re-embedding everything at once,  \n\\- ***evaluate multiple providers side by side*** in a consistent retrieval setup,  \n\\- ***handle provider outages or rate limits*** without breaking retrieval,  \n\\- ***run RAG in air-gapped or restricted environments*** with no outbound embedding calls,  \n\\- ***keep a stable “canonical” embedding space*** while changing what runs at the edge.\n\nThe adapters aren't perfect clones of the provider spaces but they are pretty close, for in domain queries the minilm to openai adapter recovered 98% of the openai embedding and dramatically outperforms minilm -> minilm RAG setups\n\nIt's still early in this project. I’m actively expanding the set of supported adapter pairs, adding domain-specialized adapters, expanding the training sets, stream lining the models and improving evaluation and quality tooling.\n\nI’d love feedback from anyone who might be interested in using this:  \n*- What data would you like to see these adapters trained on?*  \n*- What domains would be most helpful to target?*  \n*- Which model pairs would you like me to add next?*  \n*- How could I make this more useful for you to use?*\n\nSo far the library supports:  \n*minilm <-> openai*   \n*openai <-> gemini*  \n*e5 <-> minilm*  \n*e5 <-> openai*  \n*e5 <-> gemini*  \n*minilm <-> gemini*\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone has any ideas please let me know.  \nI could use any support you can give, especially if anyone wants to chip in to help cover the training cost.\n\nPlease upvote if you can, thanks!",

Yeah, I'm super excited to share!\n\nRe architecture, I tried purely linear ( there are a couple in the registry ) but actually the mapping between embedding spaces is only mostly linear, not entirely, so higher accuracy models do benefit from non linearity. The balance is really how much size you want to add to the model. Still trying to figure out the best architecture for capturing, right now I'm leaning more toward a MOE of MLPs with residual connections, but still very flexible here.  The v2 models I'm training are more aligned with this.\n\nIt does seem to point to something interesting though, how can a small llm like minilm capture so much of a massive provider model ( even in a restricted domain ). Something deeper going on here perhaps?\n\nI'm training the v2 models atm expanding the training set size and providers, next version of embedding-adapters I plan to add fine tuning scripts so people can experiment here and upload their own adapters easier.  You can add to the registry as is if you have a working adapter as well, use the cli add  functionality or make a pr to the embedding-adapters registry\n\nhttps://github.com/PotentiallyARobot/embedding-adapters-registry",

Embedding model quality\n\nB. Chunking strategy\n\nC. Query rewriting\n\nD.

The idea is that you can store your extracted entities and relationships in a graph structure, then use Cypher to traverse and expand context during retrieval. Combined with sqlite-vec for the vector search component, you get a fully embedded RAG stack in a single database file.\n\nIt includes graph algorithms like PageRank and community detection, which are useful for identifying important entities or clustering related concepts. There's an example in the repo using the HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning dataset if you want to see how the pieces fit together.\n\n\\`pip install graphqlite\\`\n\nHope someone finds this useful.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

I identified some platforms like\n\nQuivr but they dont seem to be maintained anymore.\n\n[https://github.com/QuivrHQ/quivr](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/quivr)\n\nI also identified a lot of frameworks that make it easier to build RAG apps like llamaindex, RAGflow, dify etc., but they dont provide the opinionated blackbox experience im searching for.\n\nSure there are also those \"all in one\" platforms like openwebui or localGPT that provide RAG capabilities and have an opinionated pipeline. But often times their primary focus is not just RAG and they thereby often do not incorporate SOTA techniques into their products. Also they are often built so that you could use them in conjunction with the rest of the package, not to just deliver the RAG results to another frontend.\n\n[https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT)\n\n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nThat being said i do think that it most definetly makes sense that there would be one giant FOSS project always keeping track of the latest and greatest techniques and would just provide a set of valves to tweak functionality and individualize the experience. Other proprietary vendors also try to provide this like Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent or Snowflake cortex. In these cases there is often a sophisticated RAG pipeline in place that does things like\n\n\\- broad chunk search, then narrow down when it identified focus on a specific document\n\n\\- expanding the context of found chunks\n\n\\- intermediate summarizations of docs when working with a large amount of docs simultaneously\n\n\\- ....\n\nAll of those things help to provide a great experience, but for me as a \"one engineer in the ai team\" cannot build, maintain and keep a self built RAG solution up to date to the latest and greatest additions to the space.\n\nJust to note one could say that an \"one size fits all\" solution is not possible, especially because data is so different from system to system, but i'd argue that many proprietary platforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot have perfected this already and can easily be plugged in to any arbitrary form of data and  work relatively well (atleast if the data is in one of the basic formats of data like txt, pdf, pptx, docx ...)\n\nIdeally i would want a RAG platform that always is relatively close behind SOTA, there would be (community) created adapters for enterprise data stores like sharepoint, SAP etc and allows for simple integration into other systems. I'd also pay for this, its not like i just want FOSS, but I would think that the community would also have identified a need for this..\n\nIs what im thinking about valid or is my department just too small to do any meaningful RAG and i should upgrade to more personal so i have the capability to build and maintain RAG pipelines from the ground up or am i just not noticing some development in the space?",

Most teams discover their chunking is broken only after they've already embedded everything and are debugging weird responses three conversations deep.\n\nThe platforms you mentioned treat document preprocessing as solved when it's actually where most RAG systems break. Tables get scrambled, metadata gets dropped, section hierarchy gets flattened. By the time you're looking at similarity scores you're three steps removed from the root cause.\n\nWhat you need isn't another orchestration layer. You need visibility into what your documents actually look like after parsing and chunking, before they hit the vector store. That's the angle I've been taking with [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_c), focusing specifically on the preprocessing pipeline rather than trying to be everything to everyone.\n\nThe enterprise platforms work because they control the entire stack and can see their preprocessing output.

This, especially if one goes the local computation way and doesn't use competent (and large) vision models.\n\nTable example: [https://i.imgur.com/HpNdn3g.png](https://i.imgur.com/HpNdn3g.png)\n\nIn my testing, docling and marker-pdf have given the best success. HOWEVER: docling might dominate one pdf and marker performs poorly, but in the next pdf the roles have been switched.\n\nOne idea of mine was to go page by page, and give the pdf page screenshot to qwen3-vl alongside the two md files and let it choose. This, especially if there were tables on the page.\n\nAnother method would be to just let marker and docling produce the md files, and chunk both versions into the same db. The retriever will fetch doubles, but the ranker will (hopefully) do its job and give us the \"better\" one of the doubles. We would semantically compare the chunks and find doubles, even if they are not perfectly aligned. Then go through the ranker's result list, and if that chunk's other double has already been picked, discard this so the LLM doesnt get the chunk twice. \n\nBasically the embedding will retrieve the bunch, and the re-ranker will go through the pile and give us the best matches. Choose the chunks that will be returned to the LLM and make sure no double chunks are given. \n\nDoes this help with the inconsistent pdf processing, or is the idea complete waste?",

          "text": "Your approach is backwards. Instead of throwing multiple parsers at the wall and hoping the reranker sorts it out, you need to see what each parser actually produces before committing to the vector store. The problem isn't choosing between Docling and Marker outputs after embedding. It's that you can't tell which one mangled your tables until retrieval fails.\n\nMost people skip the preview step and end up with garbage chunks they never see. You're essentially building a complex deduplication system to fix a visibility problem. What you need is to compare the actual markdown outputs side by side, page by page, before any chunking happens.\n\nYour Qwen3-VL idea has merit but it's expensive and slow. Better approach is to run both parsers, preview the outputs, and pick the winner manually for each document type. Once you know Marker handles your financial reports better and Docling wins on research papers, you can automate that decision.\n\nThe double-chunking strategy will work but creates unnecessary complexity. Your retrieval becomes unpredictable because you never know which version will surface. I've been building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_i) specifically for this preview problem because debugging parser outputs after they're embedded is painful.\n\nWhat does your table actually look like in the markdown after each parser runs?",

I’ve built and tested a number of prototypes across these areas.\n\nWhat I’m still grappling with is this: **from an enterprise, production-grade perspective, how do these systems realistically earn trust and adoption from the business?**\n\nTwo concrete scenarios I keep coming back to:\n\n# Scenario 1: Knowledge Management\n\nInsurance organisations sit on enormous volumes of internal and external documents - guidelines, standards, regulatory texts, technical papers, and market materials.\n\nMuch of this “knowledge” is:\n\n* High-level and ambiguous\n* Not formalised enough to live in a traditional rules engine\n* Hard to search reliably with keyword systems\n\nThe goal here isn’t just faster search, but **answers the business can trust,** answers that are accurate, grounded, and defensible.\n\nQuestions I’m wrestling with:\n\n* Is a pure RAG approach sufficient, or should it be combined with explicit structure such as ontologies or knowledge graphs?\n* How can fluent but subtly incorrect answers be detected and prevented from undermining trust?\n* From an enterprise perspective, what constitutes “good enough” performance for adoption and sustained use?\n\n# Scenario 2: Underwriting\n\nMany insurance products are non-standardised or only loosely standardised.\n\nUnderwriting in these cases is:\n\n* Highly manual\n* Knowledge- and experience-heavy\n* Inconsistent across underwriters\n* Slow and expensive\n\nThe goal is not full automation, but to **shorten the underwriting cycle** while producing outputs that are:\n\n* Reliable\n* Reasonable\n* Consistent\n* Traceable\n\nHere, the questions include:\n\n* Where should LLMs sit in the underwriting workflow?\n* How can consistency and correctness be assured across cases?\n* What level of risk control should be incorporated?\n\nI’m interested in hearing from others who are building, deploying, or evaluating RAG/KG/LLM systems in regulated or knowledge-intensive domains:\n\n* What has worked in practice?\n* Where have things broken down?\n* What do you see as the real blockers to enterprise adoption?",

One of the most helpful things I’ve found is taking the time to pick people’s brains about their work. Sometimes I’ve even sat behind someone to literally be a fly on the wall and take notes on how they do their job because I want to know how they’re *thinking*. \n\nUsually, that ends up completely changing how I break down what I’m trying to solve with RAG, and you can make systems much more reliable/accurate by designing pipelines that reflect domain logic. Chunking’s a great example—how you define a ‘minimum logical unit’ has a huge impact on retrieval accuracy, and almost always requires some intuition about what the data *means*.\n\nI also find hardcoding wherever possible makes things much more predictable and stable. If you can identify industry ‘heuristics’, ‘norms’, ‘best practices’, etc…, take that logic and apply it to the relevant part of the system (could be retrieval logic, node/edge types, etc). Also knowledge graphs are a total game changer because they provide another dimension for you to express domain logic with system design.",

Genuinely the worst data source i've worked with.\n\nHere’s what i tried and why each one failed:\n\n* **chunking by message** → garbage. you lose conversation state. the LLM has no idea msg #7 is a reply to msg #3, not msg #6.  \n* **embedding whole threads** → hits token limits instantly on anything real. also the model gets distracted because half the content is signatures + legal disclaimers.  \n* **strip signatures then chunk** → better, but then quoted text kills you. people reply inline, edit quotes, forward with additions. my dedupe either removed important context or kept duplicate garbage.  \n\nBreaking point: a 25-message reply-all chain from a client. Retrieval kept returning the wrong messages because semantically every email looked identical because the same company footer was dominating the embedding.\n\n**What actually helped**:\n\nI stopped treating email like a document retrieval problem and started treating it as **graph reconstruction**.\n\nThe pipeline now:\n\n1. sync newest → oldest (important: you need the final state first)  \n2. map In-Reply-To headers to build the actual conversation tree  \n3. dedupe quoted text **but preserve inline edits** (harder than expected)  \n4. extract structured metadata (decisions / tasks / owners) and embed *that* alongside cleaned text  \n\nI validated this on \\~200 threads i manually labeled for “did retrieval surface the correct part of the thread”.\n\n**Results on my set:**\n\n* naive chunking: \\~47%  \n* graph reconstruction + extraction: \\~91%  \n\nStill not perfect. the remaining failures are mostly:\n\n* forwarded threads where headers get stripped  \n* people replying to old messages mid-thread  \n* chains that fork + merge  \n\nif anyone else is doing RAG on comms data: what edge cases are killing you? would love to compare notes.\n\n(context: i’m building this at [iGPT](https://www.igpt.ai/), which is why i’m obsessed with it. if people want to poke holes in the approach, i can share more details / examples.)\n\n",

Most people never get past the \"chunk by message\" phase because they're treating email like it's just another document format when it's actually structured communication with explicit relationships baked into the headers.\n\nYour remaining failures point to a harder problem though. Forwarded threads with stripped headers and mid-thread replies to old messages are both cases where the metadata you're relying on doesn't exist or lies to you. The fork-and-merge chains are even worse because you're trying to reconstruct a DAG from data that was never designed to preserve that structure.\n\nOne thing that helped me on similar comms data: extract the quoted text blocks and use fuzzy matching against earlier messages in the thread to rebuild relationships when headers fail. It's slow and imperfect but catches maybe 60% of the forwarded thread cases. For the inline edits you mentioned, diffing the quoted block against the original message and only embedding the delta can clean up a lot of noise.\n\nThe metadata extraction step is where I'd focus next. Decisions and tasks are high signal, but you might be missing action items that are implicit in the thread structure itself. Someone replying \"sounds good\" to a proposal is a decision even if it doesn't contain decision keywords. That's the kind of thing you can iterate on quickly if you can preview what your extraction looks like before embedding, which is what I built vectorflow.dev to handle. Curious whether you're seeing false positives on your task extraction or mostly false negatives.",

I’m trying to keep the idea general, but I’m stuck on two key parts:\n\n1. Extraction speed & accuracy — What’s the most reliable way to scrape and extract text at scale, especially for mixed content (HTML + various PDF types, including scanned ones)?\n2. Profile matching pipeline — Once I have clean text, what’s an efficient way to compare it against user profiles/preferences? Any RAG-friendly methods or embeddings/models that work well for matching without heavy fine-tuning?\n\nIdeally, I’d like a setup that’s fast for near-real-time matching but doesn’t sacrifice accuracy on harder-to-parse PDFs. Would appreciate any tips on tools (e.g., for OCR on scanned PDFs), text preprocessing steps, or architectural pointers you’ve used in similar projects.\n\nThanks in advance!",

For PDFs, you'll want something like Unstructured or Docling for the extractable text ones, and they both handle OCR for scanned documents reasonably well. The tricky part isn't the individual parsers but orchestrating them and seeing what actually comes out.\n\nYour bigger issue is going to be chunking strategy after extraction. Website content has different structure than PDF content, and scanned PDFs often have weird artifacts that mess up semantic chunking. You need to see what your text looks like after each processing step before you start building embeddings on top of it. I work on document processing pipelines at vectorflow.dev and this visibility problem is exactly why most RAG projects fail quietly.\n\nFor the matching part, standard embedding models like text-embedding-3-small work fine for profile matching without fine-tuning. The real bottleneck is usually upstream in your extraction pipeline where context gets lost or mangled. What does your target content actually look like? Are these technical documents, marketing pages, research papers?",

The scraper will have to check for the filtered niche then will check the tables and then download the PDFs. Then it will perform parsing or OCR. And accuracy is really important here. And after extraction then I will perform the profile matching. Basically every user will have their preference and requirements uploaded while they are creating a profile during sign up so it's basis I will match with the PDFs content to check if the user is eligible for it or not and I will show credit scores to users according to the user's eligibility. That's the basic concept but the thing is I haven't started working on it, because I am learning a few things like currently I am learning NLP.

You'll hit quality issues with chunking and parsing long before model limitations bite you.\n\nFor offline terminal RAG, start with LangChain or LlamaIndex as your base framework. Both have solid PDF handling and work well with Ollama. For the LLM, Llama 3.1 8B or Qwen2.5 7B are good starting points for document QA. They're fast enough for local use and handle reasoning reasonably well.\n\nThe real work is in document processing. PDFs are tricky - tables get mangled, headers disappear, and you lose document structure during parsing. I've been building tooling around this at vectorflow.dev because most RAG problems trace back to bad preprocessing, not retrieval issues.\n\nStart simple: basic recursive chunking with 1000 token chunks and 200 token overlap. Use sentence-transformers for embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 works offline). ChromaDB for your vector store since it's lightweight and doesn't need a server.\n\nWatch out for PDF parsing destroying your document hierarchy. You'll lose section context and get weird retrieval results. Test your chunking output manually before building the chat interface. Most people skip this step and wonder why their assistant gives confusing answers later.\n\nWhat kind of documents are you planning to work with?

      "text": "I'm an engineer at Aryn (aryn.ai) and I work in document parsing and extraction and help customers build RAG solutions.  We recently launched a new metadata extraction feature that allows you to extract metadata/properties of interest from unstructured documents using JSON schemas.  I know this community is really big on various ways of dealing with unstructured documents (PDFs, docx, etc) for the purpose of getting them ready for RAG and LLMs.  Most of the use cases I see talked about here are around pulling out text and chunking and embedding and ingesting into a vector database with a heavy emphasis on self-hosting.  We believe that metadata extraction is going to provide a differentiation for RAG because the process of imposing structure on the data using schemas opens the door for many existing data analytics tools that work on structured data (think relational databases with catalogs).  Anyone actively looking into or working on this for their RAG projects?  Are you already using something for metadata extraction.  If so, how has your experience been using it?  What's working well and what's lacking?  I'd love to hear your experience!",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\n  \nI'm currently developing 'rich-soup', an alternative to BS, and \"raw\" Playwright.\n\n  \nFor RAG, I found that there weren't many options for parsing HTML pages easily; i.e: content-extraction, getting the actual 'meaty' content from the page, cleanly.\n\nBeautifulSoup is the standard, but it's static only (doesn’t execute JS). Most sites use JS to dynamically populate content, React and jQuery being common examples. So it's not very useful. Unless you write a lot of boilerplate and use extensions.\n\n  \nYes, Playwright solves this. In fact, my tool uses Playwright under the hood. But, it doesn't give you easy-to-use blocks, the actual content. My tool, Rich Soup intends to give you the DX of Beautiful Soup, but work on dynamic pages.\n\n  \nI've got an MVP. It doesn't handle some edge cases, but it seems OK at the moment.\n\nRich Soup uses Playwright to render the page (JS, CSS, everything), then uses visual semantics to understand what you're actually looking at. It analyzes font sizes, spacing, hierarchy, and visual grouping; the same cues humans use to read, and reconstructs the page into clean blocks.\n    \n    \n Instead of this:\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"_container\"><div class=\"_text _2P8zR\">...</div><div class=\"_text _3k9mL2\">...</div>...\n    ```\n    \n    \nYou get this:\n```json\n  {\n      \"blocks\": [\n        {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"spans\": [\"News article about \", \"New JavaScript Framework\", \"**Written in RUST!!!**\"]},\n        {\"type\": \"image\", \"src\": \"...\", \"alt\": \"Lab photo\"},\n        {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"spans\": [\"Researchers say...\", \" *significant progress*\", \"...\"]}\n      ]\n  }\n```\n    \n    \n  Clean blocks instead of markup soup. Now you can actually use the content—feed it to an LLM, chunk it for search, build a knowledge base, generate summaries.\n    \n  \n    \n**Rich Soup extracts**:\n- Paragraph blocks - (items: list[Span])\n- Table blocks- (rows: list[list[str]])\n- Image blocks - (src, alt)\n- List blocks - (prefix: str, items: list[Span])\n    \n  \n> Note: A 'span' isn't `<span>`. It represents a logical group of styling.\n> E.g: `ParagraphBlock.spans = [\"hi\", \"*my*\", \"**name**\", \"is\", \"**John**\", \".\"]`\n\nBefore I develop further, I just want to see if there's any demand. Personally, I think you can do it without this tool, but it takes a lot of extra logic. If you're parsing only a few sites, I reckon it's not that useful. But if you want something a bit more generically useful, maybe it's good?",

      "text": "I want to build a tool that helps automate IT support in companies by using a multi-agent system. The tool takes a ticket number related to an incident in a project, then multiple agents with different roles (backend developer, frontend developer, team lead, etc.) analyze the issue together and provide insights such as what needs to be done, how long it might take, and which technologies or tools are required.\n\nTo make this work, the system needs a RAG pipeline that can analyze the ticket and retrieve relevant information directly from the project’s codebase. While I have experience building RAG systems for PDF documents, I’m unsure how to adapt this approach to source code, especially in terms of code-specific chunking, embeddings, and intelligent file selection similar to how tools like GitHub Copilot determine which files are relevant.",

If you just chunk by token count, you slice functions in half and lose the import context.\n\nTo get \"Copilot-like\" selection, you need:\n\n1. **AST Chunking:** Use tree-sitter to split code by logical scope (Function/Class) rather than lines.\n2. **Dependency Graphing:** Your retrieval needs to understand that if `auth.ts` is retrieved, the agent probably also needs `user_model.ts` because it's imported.\n3. **Repo Map:** Build a compressed \"skeleton\" of the codebase (signatures only) to fit in the context window first, letting the agent decide which full files to read.\n\nI sent you a DM with some patterns on how to architect this \"Graph + Vector\" retrieval.",

This is why I always recommend using a micro service architecture to handle RAG. \n\nI spent all of this past year learning that the hard way. \n\nAnother thing I would recommend is to use existing RAG services than building yours from scratch. That’s because you will end up managing the entire RAG infrastructure yourself, which is totally different from your business requirements. Another reason I recommend the RAG Saas than building yourself is cause most of the libraries that are used to build RAG software are always getting updated, it can be a pain trying to keep up in this AI space. All these take time from you while you are trying to keep up with business requirements.\n\nSome of the best RAG tools I can recommend are \n - FireCrawl for data extraction\n - supermemory ai for agent memory \n- reducto ai \n- Wetrocloud for data extraction and end to end rag\n\n\n\nI do not intend to help make a choice on which tool to use, but you can take a look at each.

Cheap file-level candidate selection (high recall): BM25/keyword + repo heuristics + symbol index (imports/usings, namespaces, table/proc names, etc.).\n2. Precision retrieval inside the shortlisted files: chunk by semantic units (class/method/function + docstring/comments + nearby types/constants), store metadata (path, namespace, symbol name, language, dependencies), then rerank hard before final context assembly.\n\nThen do an iterative “Copilot-style” loop: start narrow, answer with file:line citations, and if confidence is low expand to neighbors (tests, configs, migrations, related SQL objects) rather than pulling the whole repo.\n\nSeparate note: I’m looking for a decent-sized public codebase to test on (I’m doing this privately and don’t want to use my work repo for obvious reasons).

At millions of documents, you're looking at terabytes of storage and thousands per month in Pinecone/Weaviate bills.\n\n**What I tested:**\n\nCompressed embeddings down to 72D — about 90% smaller — and measured what happens to retrieval.\n\n| Metric | 768D Standard | 72D Compressed |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| Storage | 3KB per vector | 288 bytes per vector |\n| Cosine similarity preservation | baseline | 96.53% preserved |\n| Disambiguation (\"bank\" finance vs river) | broken | works |\n\n**The workflow:**\n\n```\nDocuments → Compress to 72D → Store in your existing Pinecone/Weaviate index → Query as normal\n```\n\nNo new infrastructure. Same vector database. Just smaller vectors.\n\n**The counterintuitive part:**\n\nRetrieval got cleaner. Why? Standard embeddings cluster words by surface similarity — \"python\" (code) and \"python\" (snake) sit close together. Compressed semantic vectors actually separate different meanings. Fewer false positives in retrieval.\n\n**Monthly cost impact:**\n\n| Current Bill | After 72D |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| $1,000 | ~$100 |\n| $5,000 | ~$500 |\n| $10,000 | ~$1,000 |\n\nStill running tests.

Most teams discover their chunking preserves zero semantic structure only after they've embedded everything and are debugging weird retrievals.\n\nHow are you handling the boundary detection in practice? Are you working with structured documents where semantic shifts are more obvious, or have you found ways to identify them reliably in unstructured content?\n\nThe constraint satisfaction angle is compelling but I suspect it's fighting symptoms if the chunks themselves are semantically broken from the start.",

Hopefully this one brings something new.\n\n[https://github.com/2015xli/clangd-graph-rag](https://github.com/2015xli/clangd-graph-rag)\n\n**1. Overview**\n\nThis project enables deep code analysis with Large Language Models. By constructing a Neo4j-based Graph RAG, it enables developers and AI agents to perform complex, multi-layered queries on C/C++ codebases that traditional search tools simply can't handle. With only a few MCP APIs and a vanilla agent, it is already able to accomplish complex tasks efficiently related to the codebases.\n\n**2. How it works**\n\nUsing clangd and clang, the system parses and indices your source files to create a high-fidelity code graph. It captures everything from high-level folder structures to granular relationships, including entities like Folders, Files, Namespaces, Classes/Structs, Variables, Methods, etc.; relationships like: CALLS, INCLUDES, INHERITS, OVERRIDES, and more.\n\nThe system generates summaries and embeddings for every level of the codebase (from functions up to entire folders) using a bottom-up approach. This structured context helps AI agents understand the \"big picture\" without getting lost in the syntax.\n\nTo get you started easily, the project includes an example MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, and a demonstration AI agent to showcase the graph’s power. You can easily build your own custom agents and servers on top of the graph RAG.\n\n**3. Efficiency & Performance**\n\nIncremental Updates: The system detects changes between commits and updates only what’s necessary. \n\nParallel Processing: Parsing and summary generation are distributed across worker processes with optimized data sharing. \n\nSmart Caching: Results are cached to minimize redundant computations, saving you both time and LLM costs.\n\n**4. A benchmark: The Linux Kernel**\n\nWhen building a code graph for the Linux kernel (WSL2 release) on a workstation (12 cores, 64GB RAM), it takes about \\~4 hours using 10 parallel worker processes, with peak memory usage at \\~36GB. Note this process does not include the summary generation, and the total time (and cost) may vary based on your LLM provider. \n\n**5. Note**, this is an independent project and is not affiliated with the official Clang or clangd projects.\n\nThis project is by no means a replacement for the clangd language server (LSP) used in IDEs. Instead, it is designed to complement it by enabling LLMs to perform deep architectural analysis, like mapping project workflows, tracing complex call paths, and understanding system-wide architecture.",

The agent can manipulate the source code as needed.
