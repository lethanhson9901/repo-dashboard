Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

Having spent 13 years at Google Legal Discovery and 16 years as a computer forensic examiner, I can tell you from experience: raw email data is messy, and AI safety guardrails make it dangerously polite.\n\nMost AI models are trained to be agreeable, not skeptical. They won't naturally assume a group sounds criminal or is hiding something—they tend to treat document content as a \"fact\" by default. But in high-stakes truth-seeking, the text is often the smoke screen.\nIn my opinion, to make this truly groundbreaking, the RAG pipeline needs to incorporate a Dynamic Truth Table (a live Chronology), a people index that tracks people as objects so the system can do a better job of knowing J.E=Jeffery Epstein and also jevacation@gmail.com=Jeffery Epstein etc. \n\nThere are reports from back in the 90s that Trump would call into the news rooms under a fake name (always the same fake name) to spread rumors about himself and keep his name in the news cycle - something a living rolodex would help to normalize  \n\n\nWe’ve seen this play out in real-time with the 2026 investigations in the UK and Belarus. For years, people like Prince Andrew claimed they had no contact with Epstein after 2009, but the latest document trickles are proving that wasn't true. Storing facts like Prince Andrew claims he has not contacted Epstein since 2009 would hopefully be able to identify where the document trove conflicts with Prince Andrews claims.  \n\nIf you can build a pipeline that is \"living and breathing,\" you could feed it those new jurisdictions' findings, estate records, and community-sourced photos as they surface. By grounding the AI in a constantly updating chronology rather than just a static vector database, you give the agent a way to \"cross-examine\" the documents.\nWhen the machine has a verified timeline to push back against the raw text, it moves from being a simple search tool to a forensic powerhouse.\n\nKeep it up—this has the potential to be a world-class truth-seeking engine.",

      "text": "If you've built a RAG system, you've had the chunking conversation. Somebody on your team (or [a Medium post](https://medium.com/%40adnanmasood/chunking-strategies-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-a-comprehensive-guide-5522c4ea2a90)) told you to \"just use 512 tokens with 50-token overlap\" or \"semantic chunking is strictly better.\"\n\nWe (hello from the R&D team at Vecta!) decided to test these claims. We created a small corpus of real academic papers spanning AI, astrophysics, mathematics, economics, social science, physics, chemistry, and computer vision. Then, we ran every document through seven different chunking strategies and measured retrieval quality and downstream answer accuracy.\n\nCritically, we designed the evaluation to be **fair**: each strategy retrieves a different number of chunks, calibrated so that every strategy gets approximately **2,000 tokens of context** in the generation prompt. This eliminates the confound where strategies with larger chunks get more context per retrieval, and ensures we're measuring chunking quality, not context window size.\n\nThe \"boring\" strategies won. The hyped strategies failed. And the relationship between chunk granularity and answer quality is more nuanced than most advice suggests.\n\n# Setup\n\n# Corpus\n\nWe assembled a diverse corpus of 50 academic papers (905,746 total tokens) deliberately spanning similar disciplines, writing styles, and document structures: Papers ranged from 3 to 112 pages and included technical dense mathematical proofs pertaining to fundamental ML research. All PDFs were converted to clean markdown using [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown), with OCR artifacts and single-character fragments stripped before chunking.\n\n# Chunking Strategies Tested\n\n1. **Fixed-size, 512 tokens**, 50-token overlap\n2. **Fixed-size, 1024 tokens**, 100-token overlap\n3. **Recursive character splitting**, LangChain-style `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens\n4. **Semantic chunking**, embedding-based boundary detection (cosine similarity threshold 0.7)\n5. **Document-structure-aware**, splitting on markdown headings/sections, max 1024 tokens\n6. **Page-per-chunk**, one chunk per PDF page, using MarkItDown's form-feed (`\\f`) page boundaries\n7. **Proposition chunking**, LLM-decomposed atomic propositions following [Dense X Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06648) with the paper's exact extraction prompt\n\nAll chunks were embedded with `text-embedding-3-small` and stored in local ChromaDB. Answer generation used `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` via OpenRouter. We generated 30 ground-truth Q&A pairs using Vecta's synthetic benchmark pipeline.\n\n# Equal Context Budget: Adaptive Retrieval k\n\nMost chunking benchmarks use a fixed top-k (e.g., k=10) for all strategies. This is fundamentally unfair: if fixed-1024 retrieves 10 chunks, the generator sees \\~10,000 tokens of context; if proposition chunking retrieves 10 chunks at 17 tokens each, the generator gets \\~170 tokens. The larger-chunk strategy wins by default because it gets more context, not because its chunking is better.\n\nWe fix this by computing an **adaptive k** for each strategy. This targets \\~2,000 tokens of retrieved context for every strategy. The computed values:\n\n|Strategy|Avg Tokens/Chunk|Adaptive k|Expected Context|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Page-per-Chunk|961|2|\\~1,921|\n|Doc-Structure|937|2|\\~1,873|\n|Fixed 1024|658|3|\\~1,974|\n|Fixed 512|401|5|\\~2,007|\n|Recursive 512|397|5|\\~1,984|\n|Semantic|43|46|\\~1,983|\n|Proposition|17|115|\\~2,008|\n\nNow every strategy gets \\~2,000 tokens to work with. Differences in accuracy reflect genuine chunking quality, not context budget.\n\n# How We Score Retrieval: Precision, Recall, and F1\n\nWe evaluate retrieval at two granularities: **page-level** (did we retrieve the right pages?) and **document-level** (did we retrieve the right documents?). At each level, the core metrics are precision, recall, and F1.\n\nLet R be the set of retrieved items (pages or documents) and G be the set of ground-truth relevant items.\n\nPrecision measures: of everything we retrieved, what fraction was actually relevant? A retriever that returns 5 pages, 4 of which contain the answer, has a precision of 0.8. High precision means low noise in the context window.\n\nRecall measures: of everything that *was* relevant, what fraction did we find? If 3 pages contain the answer and we retrieved 2 of them, recall is 0.67. High recall means we're not missing important information.\n\nF1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It penalizes strategies that trade one for the other and rewards balanced retrieval.\n\n**Why two granularities matter.** Page-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling the right *passages*. Document-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling from the right *sources*. A strategy can score high page-level recall (finding many relevant pages) while scoring low document-level precision (those pages are scattered across too many irrelevant documents). As we'll see, the tension between these two levels is one of the main findings.\n\n# Results\n\n# The Big Picture\n\n[Figure 1: Complete metrics heatmap. Green is good, red is bad.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/metrics_heatmap.png)\n\n|Strategy|k|Doc F1|Page F1|Accuracy|Groundedness|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Recursive 512**|5|0.86|**0.92**|**0.69**|0.81|\n|**Fixed 512**|5|0.85|0.88|0.67|**0.85**|\n|**Fixed 1024**|3|**0.88**|0.72|0.61|0.86|\n|**Doc-Structure**|2|0.88|0.69|0.52|0.84|\n|**Page-per-Chunk**|2|0.88|0.69|0.57|0.81|\n|**Semantic**|46|0.42|0.91|0.54|0.81|\n|**Proposition**|115|0.27|**0.97**|0.51|**0.87**|\n\n**Recursive splitting wins on accuracy (69%) and page-level retrieval (0.92 F1).** The 512-token strategies lead on generation quality, while larger-chunk strategies lead on document-level retrieval but fall behind on accuracy.\n\n# Finding 1: Recursive and Fixed Splitting Often Outperforms Fancier Strategies\n\n[Figure 2: Accuracy and groundedness by strategy. Recursive and fixed 512 lead on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/generation_quality.png)\n\nLangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens achieved the highest accuracy (**69%**) across all seven strategies. Fixed 512 was close behind at 67%. Both strategies use 5 retrieved chunks for \\~2,000 tokens of context.\n\nWhy does recursive splitting edge out plain fixed-size? It tries to break at natural boundaries, paragraph breaks, then sentence breaks, then word breaks. On academic text, this preserves logical units: a complete paragraph about a method, a full equation derivation, a complete results discussion. The generator gets chunks that make semantic sense, not arbitrary windows that may cut mid-sentence.\n\nRecursive 512 also achieved the best page-level F1 (**0.92**), meaning it reliably finds the right pages *and* produces accurate answers from them.\n\n# Finding 2: The Granularity-Retrieval Tradeoff Is Real\n\n[Figure 3: Radar chart, recursive 512 (orange) has the fullest coverage. Large-chunk strategies skew toward doc retrieval but lose on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/radar_comparison.png)\n\nWith a 2,000-token budget, a clear tradeoff emerges:\n\n* **Smaller chunks (k=5)** achieve higher accuracy (67-69%) because 5 retrieval slots let you sample from 5 different locations in the corpus, each precisely targeted\n* **Larger chunks (k=2-3)** achieve higher document F1 (0.88) because each retrieved chunk spans more of the relevant document, but the generator gets fewer, potentially less focused passages\n\nFixed 1024 scored the best document F1 (**0.88**) but only 61% accuracy. With just k=3, you get 3 large passages, great for document coverage, but if even one of those passages isn't well-targeted, you've wasted a third of your context budget.\n\n# Finding 3: Semantic Chunking Collapses at Scale\n\n[Figure 4: Chunk size distribution. Semantic and proposition chunking produce extremely small fragments.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/chunk_size_distribution.png)\n\nSemantic chunking produced **17,481 chunks averaging 43 tokens** across 50 papers. With k=46, the retriever samples from 46 different tiny chunks. The result: only **54% accuracy** and **0.42 document F1**.\n\nHigh page F1 (0.91) reveals what's happening: the retriever *finds the right pages* by sampling many tiny chunks from across the corpus. But document-level retrieval collapses because those 46 chunks come from dozens of different documents, diluting precision. And accuracy suffers because 46 disconnected sentences don't form a coherent narrative for the generator.\n\n**The fundamental problem:** semantic chunking optimizes for retrieval-boundary purity at the expense of context coherence. Each chunk is a \"clean\" semantic unit, but a single sentence chunk may lack the surrounding context needed for generation.\n\n# Finding 4: The Page-Level Retrieval Story\n\n[Figure 5: Page-level precision-recall tradeoff. Recursive 512 achieves the best balance.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/precision_recall.png)\n\n[Figure 6: Page-level and document-level F1. The two metrics tell different stories.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/retrieval_f1.png)\n\nPage-level and document-level retrieval tell opposite stories under constrained context:\n\n* **Fine-grained strategies** (proposition k=115, semantic k=46) achieve high page F1 (0.91-0.97) by sampling many pages, but low doc F1 (0.27-0.42) because those pages come from too many documents\n* **Coarse strategies** (page-chunk k=2, doc-structure k=2) achieve high doc F1 (0.88) by retrieving fewer, more relevant documents, but lower page F1 (0.69) because 2 chunks can only cover 2 pages\n\n**Recursive 512 at k=5 hits the best balance**: 0.92 page F1 and 0.86 doc F1. Five chunks is enough to sample multiple relevant pages while still concentrating on a few documents.\n\n[Figure 7: Document-level precision, recall, and F1 detail. Large-chunk strategies lead on precision; fine-grained strategies lead on recall.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/document_level.png)\n\n# What This Means for Your RAG System\n\n# The Short Version\n\n1. **Use recursive character splitting at 512 tokens.** It scored the highest accuracy (69%), best page F1 (0.92), and strong doc F1 (0.86). It's the best all-around strategy on academic text.\n2. **Fixed-size 512 is a strong runner-up** with 67% accuracy and the highest groundedness among the top performers (85%).\n3. **If document-level retrieval matters most**, use fixed-1024 or page-per-chunk (0.88 doc F1), but accept lower accuracy (57-61%).\n4. **Don't use semantic chunking on academic text.** It fragments too aggressively (43 avg tokens) and collapses on document retrieval (0.42 F1).\n5. **Don't use proposition chunking for general RAG.** 51% accuracy isn't production-ready. It's only viable if you value groundedness over correctness.\n6. **When benchmarking, equalize the context budget.** Fixed top-k comparisons are misleading. Use adaptive k = round(target\\_tokens / avg\\_chunk\\_tokens).\n\n# Why Academic Papers Specifically?\n\nWe deliberately chose to saturate the academic paper region of the embedding space with 50 papers spanning 10+ disciplines. When your knowledge base contains papers that all discuss \"evaluation,\" \"metrics,\" \"models,\" and \"performance,\" the retriever has to make fine-grained distinctions. That's when chunking quality matters most.\n\nIn a mixed corpus of recipes and legal contracts, even bad chunking might work because the embedding distances between domains are large. Academic papers are the *hard case* for chunking, and if a strategy works here, it'll work on easier data too.\n\n# How We Measured This (And How You Can Too)\n\nMy team built [Vecta](https://www.runvecta.com/) specifically to meet the need for precise RAG evaluation software. It generates synthetic benchmark Q&A pairs across multiple semantic granularities, then measures precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and groundedness against your actual retrieval pipeline.\n\nThe benchmarks in this post were generated and evaluated using Vecta's SDK (`pip install vecta`)\n\n# Limitations, Experiment Design, and Further Work\n\nThis experiment was deliberately small-scale: 50 papers, 30 synthetic Q&A pairs, one embedding model, one retriever, one generator. That's by design. We wanted something reproducible that a single engineer could rerun in an afternoon, not a months-long research project. The conclusions should be read with that scope in mind.\n\n**Synthetic benchmarks are not human benchmarks.** Our ground-truth Q&A pairs were generated by Vecta's own pipeline, which means there's an inherent alignment between how questions are formed and how they're evaluated. Human-authored questions would be a stronger test. That said, Vecta's benchmark generation does produce complex multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information across multiple chunks and document locations, so these aren't trivially easy questions that favor any one strategy by default.\n\n**One pipeline, one result.** Everything here runs on `text-embedding-3-small`, ChromaDB, and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. Swap any of those components and the rankings could shift. We fully acknowledge this. Running the same experiment across multiple embedding models, vector databases, and generators would be valuable follow-up work, and it's on our roadmap.\n\n**The equal context budget is a deliberate constraint, not a flaw.** Some readers may object that semantic and proposition chunking are \"meant\" to be paired with rerankers, fusion, or hierarchical aggregation. But if a chunking strategy only works when combined with additional infrastructure, that's important to know. Equal context budgets ensure we're comparing chunking quality at roughly equal generation cost. A strategy that requires a reranker to be competitive is a more expensive strategy, and that should factor into the decision.\n\n**Semantic chunking was not intentionally handicapped.** Our semantic chunking produced fragments averaging 43 tokens, which is smaller than most production deployments would target. This was likely due to a poorly tuned cosine similarity threshold (0.7) rather than any deliberate sabotage. But that's actually the point: semantic chunking requires careful threshold tuning, merging heuristics, and often parent-child retrieval to work well. When those aren't perfectly dialed in, it degrades badly. Recursive splitting, by contrast, produced strong results with default parameters. The brittleness of semantic chunking under imperfect tuning is itself a finding.\n\n**What we'd like to do next:**\n\n* Rerun the experiment with human-authored Q&A pairs alongside the synthetic benchmark\n* Test across multiple embedding models (`text-embedding-3-large`, open-source alternatives) and generators (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama)\n* Add reranking and hierarchical retrieval stages, then measure whether the rankings change when every strategy gets access to the same post-retrieval pipeline\n* Expand the corpus beyond academic papers to contracts, documentation, support tickets, and other common RAG domains\n* Test semantic chunking with properly tuned thresholds, chunk merging, and sliding windows to establish its ceiling\n\nIf you run any of these experiments yourself, we'd genuinely like to see the results.\n\nHave a chunking strategy that worked surprisingly well (or badly) for you?

      "text": "The Problem:  \nAsked about \"max heating capacity of refrigerator\". Got a mixed answer combining V6, V8, and other refrigerator variants.\n\nThe Fix - 4 Simple Approaches:\n\n1. Force Clarification Before Searching Ambiguous query: Agent stops and asks. \"Refrigerator\" has 3 variants V4, V6 and V8 which one do you mean?\n2. No guessing. No assumptions.\n3. Query Decomposition: Break every request into required pieces (eg. sperate queries for heating and cooling capacity). Do parallel execution for each query and combine the unique results of dense and sparse.\n4. Filtering (most effective): Apply filters once the user confirms their product, filter documents BEFORE retrieval. Think \"search only in Building A, Floor 3\" instead of \"search the entire campus.\" Let the agent apply filters dynamically.\n5. Context Pruning: Long conversations hit token limits fast. Prune old search results. Drop the heavy intermediate retrieval data.\n\nThe Result: The agent now asks \"Which one?\" instead of making assumptions.\n\nCode snippet for the tool calling,\n\n    class SearchInput(BaseModel):\n        query: str = Field(description=\"The specific query to search for in the knowledge base., For complex requests, break this down into specific sub-queries.\")\n        target_directory: Optional[str] = Field(\n            description=(\n                \"Crucial for filtering. Apply precise folder paths based on the user's confirmed product category \"\n                \"(e.g., 'v6_idu/ac', 'v8_idu/wall_mounted', 'vrf_odu/side_discharge'). \"\n                \"Only leave empty if the user asks a broad, cross-category comparison question.\"\n            )\n        )\n    \n    @tool(args_schema=SearchInput, response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\n    async def knowledge_base_search(query: str, target_directory: Optional[str] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Executes a search within the technical documentation. \n        \n        Usage Guidelines:\n        1. **Precision:** Always apply the `target_directory` derived to exclude irrelevant product lines (e.g., filtering out 'V6' when the user asks for 'V8').\n        2. **Iteration:** Call this tool multiple times if the initial search results are missing required data points.\n        3. **Scope:** Returns raw documentation chunks relevant to the query and path.\n        \"\"\"\n\nI structured the product data in folders and sub-folders that represent a hierarchy. Something like this, for other type of data this can be done based on financial years /  companies / authors / product types.\n\n    VRF\n    ├── V6 IDU\n        ├── AC\n    ├── V8 IDU\n        ├── DC\n        ├── AC\n    └── VRF ODU\n        ├── AC\n        ├── V6R\n        ├── V8\n        │   ├── V8 Master\n        │   ├── V8 Pro\n        └── VC pro\n\nThis structure can be directly given in the system prompt, or if the structure is big then create a new \\`get\\_folder\\_structure\\` tool that uses fuzzy logic to get relevant paths.\n\nNow if we ask, What is the max cooling capacity of V8 IDU?  \nLLM will first ask whether you mean  V8 IDU AC or V8 IDU DC.",

Single explanation gets split across two chunks. Tables lose their structure. Headers separate from data. The chunks going into your vector DB are semantically incoherent.\n\nI've been testing semantic boundary detection instead where I use a model to find where topics actually change. Generate embeddings for each sentence, calculate similarity between consecutive ones, split when it sees sharp drops. The results are variable chunks but each represents a complete clear idea.\n\nThis alone gets 2-3 percentage points better recall but the bigger win for me was adding metadata. I pass each chunk through an LLM to extract time periods, doc types, entities, whatever structured info matters and store that alongside the embedding.\n\nThis metadata filters narrow the search space first, then vector similarity runs on that subset. Searching 47 relevant chunks instead of 20,000 random ones.\n\nFor complex documents with inherent structure this seems obviously better than fixed chunking. Anyway thought I should share. :)\n\n",

Context rot in my own applications at just 40–50k tokens. The ceiling isn't 1M. It's far lower.  \nMeanwhile, enterprise knowledge bases contain billions of tokens. The math doesn't work. You will never stuff your way to an answer.  \n  \nAgents aren't a silver bullet either.  \nProgressive disclosure lets agents traverse massive codebases and document sets, but every hop is a lossy compression. Information degrades. Reasoning quality drops. The growing wave of agentic workflows is itself a signal: frontier model improvements are slowing. The delta between model generations is shrinking. Future gains will come from agentic engineering around models, not from the models themselves.  \nSo if today's LLMs are roughly as good as it gets, how do you leverage massive knowledge bases? RAG. Still.  \nNot the naive RAG of 2023. Smarter retrieval. Better chunking. Hybrid search. Context engineering. Agentic. But the core idea of RAG is more important now than ever.

      "text": "Looks like it's a chunking day here. :) Let me add my 5 cents.\n\nMost “RAG accuracy” problems show up later as people tweak rerankers, prompts, models, etc.\n\nBut a huge % of failures start earlier: chunking.\n\nIf the right info can’t be retrieved cleanly, the model can’t “think” its way out. It’ll either hallucinate, or answer confidently from partial context.\n\nLet's start with the definition: A chunk is the smallest unit of meaning (!) that can answer a real question without needing its neighbors.\n\nToo big → you retrieve the answer plus extra junk → model gets distracted (precision drops). Too small → you retrieve fragments → missing context (recall drops). Wrong boundaries → meaning gets shredded (definitions, steps, tables…).\n\n# 3 common symptoms your chunking is broken\n\n1. Chunks too big: top-k retrieval contains the answer but also unrelated sections → the LLM free-associates.\n2. Chunks too small: the answer exists but is split across boundaries → retrieval misses it.\n3. Bad split points: tables, lists, procedures, “Definitions” sections → you split exactly where coherence matters.\n\n# There are actually 3 chunking modes that cover most real-world docs (NOT ALL of them, still)\n\n# Mode 1) Structure-first (best default)\n\nUse for: technical manuals, policies, specs, handbooks, wikis (anything with headings).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Chunk by heading hierarchy (H2/H3 sections)\n* Keep paragraphs intact\n* Keep lists/tables/code blocks intact\n* Store section\\_path metadata (e.g., Security > Access Control > MFA)\n\nWhy it works: your doc already has a map. Don’t throw it away.\n\n# Mode 2) Semantic windows (for messy conversational text)\n\nUse for: transcripts, email threads, Slack dumps, scraped webpages (weak structure, topic drift).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Build topic-coherent “windows” (don’t hard-split blindly)\n* Use adaptive overlap only when meaning crosses boundaries\n   * Q → A turns\n   * follow-ups (“what about…”, “as mentioned earlier…”)\n   * references to earlier context\n\nWhy it works: conversation doesn’t respect token boundaries.\n\n# Mode 3) Atomic facts + parent fallback (support/FAQ style)\n\nUse for: FAQs, troubleshooting, runbooks, support KBs (answers are small + repetitive).\n\nHow to do it:\n\n* Index atomic chunks (1–3 paragraphs or one step-group)\n* Store pointer to parent section\n* Retrieval policy:\n   * fetch atom first\n   * if answer looks incomplete / low confidence → fetch parent\n\nWhy it works: high precision by default, but you can pull context when needed.\n\n# Most useful tweaks\n\n# Overlap: use it like salt, not soup\n\nDon't do “20% overlap” everywhere.\n\nOverlap is for dependency, not tradition:\n\n* 0 overlap: self-contained sections\n* small overlap: narrative text\n* bigger overlap: procedures + conversational threads + “as mentioned above” content\n\n# Tables are special (many mess this up)\n\nDo not split tables mid-row or mid-header.\n\n* Store the whole table as one chunk + create a table summary chunk\n* Or chunk by row, but repeat headers + key columns in every row chunk\n\n# Metadata: the cheap accuracy boost people sometimes forget\n\nStore at least:\n\n* `doc_id`\n* `section_path`\n* `chunk_type` (policy / procedure / faq / table / code)\n* `version` / `effective_date` (if docs change)\n* `audience` (legal / support / eng)\n\nThis enables filtering before vector search and reduces “wrong-but-related” retrieval.\n\n# How to test chunking fast (with no fancy eval framework)\n\nTake 30 real user questions (not synthetic).\n\nFor each:\n\n* retrieve top-5\n* score: Does any chunk contain the answer verbatim or with minimal inference?\n\nInterpretation:\n\n* Often “no” → boundaries wrong / chunks too small / missing metadata filters\n* Answer exists but not ranked → ranking/reranker/metadata issue\n\nBonus gut-check: Take 10 questions and open the top retrieved chunk. If you keep thinking “the answer is almost here but needs the previous paragraph”… your chunk boundaries are wrong.\n\n# Practical starting defaults (if you just want numbers)\n\nThese aren’t laws, just decent baselines:\n\n* Manuals/policies/specs: structure-first, \\~300–800 tokens\n* Procedures: chunk by step groups, keep prerequisites + warnings with steps\n* FAQs/support: atomic \\~150–400 tokens + parent fallback\n* Transcripts: semantic windows \\~200–500 tokens + adaptive overlap\n\n# What we actually do for large-scale production use cases\n\nWe test extensively and automate the whole process\n\n* Chunking is automated per document type and ALWAYS considers document structure (no mid-word/sentence/table breaks)\n* For each document type there's more than one chunking approach\n* Evals are automated (created automatically and tested automatically on every pipeline change)\n* Extensive testing is the core. For each project different chunking strategies are tested and compared versus each other (here automated evals add velocity) As a result of these automations we receive good accuracy with little \"manual RAG drag\" and in a matter of days.",

Having an in-house pipeline makes things easier, as you know your data best, as well as you know your domain best, so you can anticipate end user interactions better.\n\nI have implemented a chunking strategy based (completely in-house), where you convert unstructured PDF data to markdown, and use OCR on figures. Then, creating chunks for sections and sub-sections, and creating separate chunks for figures and tables with cross-references in the main chunk. This allows to preserve to a large extent the hierarchy. \n\nSpending some time in the document preparation and processing stage has been quite fruitful. Although, nowadays most providers have the option to use in-built retrieval tools, it’s quite satisfying to see your own implementation working in a real world product.",

      "text": "I've been messing around with vectorless RAG lately and honestly it's kind of ridiculous how much we're leaving on the table by not using it properly.\n\nThe basic idea makes sense on paper. Just build document trees instead of chunking everything into embedded fragments, let LLMs navigate structure instead of guessing at similarity. But the way people actually implement this is usually pretty half baked. They'll extract some headers, maybe preserve a table or two, call it \"structured\" and wonder why it's not dramatically better than their old vector setup.\n\nThink about how humans actually navigate documents. We don't just ctrl-f for similar sounding phrases. We navigate structure. We know the details we want live in a specific section. We know footnotes reference specific line items. We follow the table of contents, understand hierarchical relationships, cross reference between sections.\n\nIf you want to build a vectorless system you need to keep all that in mind and go deeper than just preserving headers. Layout analysis to detect visual hierarchy (font size, indentation, positioning), table extraction that preserves row-column relationships and knows which section contains which table, hierarchical metadata that maps the entire document structure, and semantic labeling so the LLM understands what each section actually contains.\"\n\nTested this on a financial document RAG pipeline and the performance difference isn't marginal. Vector approach wastes tokens processing noise and produces low confidence answers that need manual follow up. Structure approach retrieves exactly what's needed and answers with actual citations you can verify.\n\nI think this matters more as documents get complex. The industry converged on vector embeddings because it seemed like the only scalable approach. But production systems are showing us it's not actually working. We keep optimizing embedding models and rerankers instead of questioning whether semantic similarity is even the right primitive for document retrieval.\n\nAnyway feels like one of those things where we all just accepted the vector search without questioning if it actually maps to how structured documents work.\n\n",

Most memory solutions follow this pattern:\n\n**Standard RAG approach (Mem0, Zep, etc.):**\n\n* Store memories in database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, whatever)\n* Query through APIs\n* To inspect: write code to query DB\n* To edit: call update endpoints\n* To migrate: export → transform → reimport\n\n**Alternative approach (inspired by OpenClaw):**\n\n* Store memories in markdown files\n* Embed and index in vector store (same as above)\n* Query through APIs (same as above)\n* To inspect: `cat memory/MEMORY.md`\n* To edit: vim/VSCode the file, auto-reindexes\n* To migrate: `cp -r memory/ new-system/`\n\nThe retrieval layer is identical - both use vector search + reranking. The only difference is the source of truth.\n\n**Why markdown seems better for memory:**\n\n**Debuggability** \\- When retrieval returns wrong context, you can grep through source files instead of writing DB queries. `rg \"Redis config\" memory/` beats SQL any day.\n\n**Version control** \\- `git log memory/MEMORY.md` shows you exactly when bad info entered the system. Database audit logs? Painful.\n\n**Chunk inspection** \\- See the actual document structure. Databases flatten everything into rows. Markdown preserves semantic boundaries (headings, paragraphs).\n\n**Hybrid search** \\- BM25 keyword search works naturally on markdown. On JSON in databases? Need full-text indexes and special config.\n\n**Cold start** \\- New developer? `git clone`, read the markdown, understand what the AI knows. Database? Need credentials, connection, schema knowledge.\n\n**The RAG perspective:**\n\nFrom a pure retrieval standpoint, markdown has advantages:\n\n* Semantic chunking is easier (split by headings/paragraphs)\n* Context preservation (you can read surrounding text naturally)\n* Deduplication is straightforward (content hash)\n* A/B testing embeddings is trivial (reindex from source)\n\n  \n==========================\n\n**So,,,, What I built:**\n\nGot so convinced by this I built \\`memsearch\\` , a memory package ready for agent memory usage.\n\nhttps://github.com/zilliztech/memsearch\n\nbasically proper RAG over markdown files with:\n\n* Hybrid search (vector + BM25, weighted fusion)\n* File watching + auto-indexing\n* Chunk deduplication (saves 20-30% on embedding costs)\n* Framework agnostic\n\n**My question to the community:**\n\nIs there a technical reason database-first is better that I'm missing? Or is it just convention?\n\nThe only argument I hear is \"scale\" but most agent memory is < 100MB even after months. That's nothing for modern RAG systems.\n\nWould love to hear from people who've built production RAG systems. What breaks when you use files instead of databases?",

      "text": "Some helpful insights from one of our senior software engineers, Muhammad Imtiaz.\n\n# Introduction\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a paradigm shift in how artificial intelligence systems access and utilize information. By combining the generative capabilities of large language models with dynamic information retrieval from external knowledge bases, RAG systems overcome the fundamental limitations of standalone language models—namely, their reliance on static training data and tendency toward hallucination.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive technical reference covering the essential concepts, components, and implementation patterns that form the foundation of modern RAG architectures. Each concept is presented with clear explanations, practical code examples in Go, and real-world considerations for building production-grade systems.\n\nWhether you are architecting a new RAG system, optimizing an existing implementation, or seeking to understand the theoretical underpinnings of retrieval-augmented approaches, this reference provides the knowledge necessary to build accurate, efficient, and trustworthy AI applications. The concepts range from fundamental building blocks like embeddings and vector databases to advanced techniques such as hybrid search, re-ranking, and agentic RAG architectures.\n\nAs the field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, RAG remains at the forefront of practical AI deployment, enabling systems that are both powerful and grounded in verifiable information.\n\n# Core Concepts and Implementation Patterns\n\n**Generator (Language Model)**\n\nThe component that generates the final answer using the retrieved context.\n\n**Retrieval**\n\nRetrieval is the process of identifying and extracting relevant information from a knowledge base before generating a response. It acts as the AI’s research phase, gathering necessary context from available documents before answering.\n\nRather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, retrieval enables the AI to access up-to-date, domain-specific information from documents, databases, or other knowledge sources.\n\nIn the example below, the retriever selects the top five most relevant documents and provides them to the LLM to generate the final answer.\n\n`relevantDocs := vectorDB.Search(query, 5) // top_k=5`  \n`answer := llm.Generate(query, relevantDocs)`\n\n**Embeddings**\n\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They convert words, sentences, or documents into dense vectors that preserve context and relationships.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to generate embeddings using the OpenAI API.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"context\"`  \n`\"github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`client := openai.NewClient(\"your-token\")`  \n`resp, err := client.CreateEmbeddings(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`openai.EmbeddingRequest{`  \n`Input: []string{\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\"},`  \n`Model: openai.SmallEmbedding3,`  \n`},`  \n`)`  \n`if err != nil {`  \n`log.Fatal(err)`  \n`}`  \n`vector := resp.Data[0].Embedding`\n\n# Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are specialized systems designed to store and query high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches, they use distance metrics to identify semantically similar content.\n\nThey support fast similarity searches across millions of documents in milliseconds, making them essential for scalable RAG systems.\n\nThe example below shows how to create a collection and add documents with embeddings using the Chroma client.\n\n`import \"github.com/chroma-core/chroma-go\"`  \n  \n`client := chroma.NewClient()`  \n`collection, _ := client.CreateCollection(\"docs\")`  \n  \n`// Generate embeddings for documents`  \n`docs := []string{\"RAG improves accuracy\", \"LLMs can hallucinate\"}`  \n`emb1 := embedder.Embed(docs[0])`  \n`emb2 := embedder.Embed(docs[1])`  \n  \n`// Add documents with their embeddings`  \n`collection.Add(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`chroma.WithIDs([]string{\"doc1\", \"doc2\"}),`  \n`chroma.WithEmbeddings([][]float32{emb1, emb2}),`  \n`chroma.WithDocuments(docs),`  \n`)`\n\n# Retriever\n\nA retriever is a component that manages the retrieval process. It converts a user query into an embedding, searches the vector database, and returns the most relevant document chunks.\n\nIt functions like a smart librarian, understanding the query and locating the most relevant information within a large collection.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic retriever implementation.\n\n`type Retriever struct {`  \n`VectorDB VectorDB`  \n`}`  \n  \n`func (r *Retriever) Retrieve(query string, topK int) []Result {`  \n`queryVector := Embed(query)`  \n`return r.VectorDB.Search(queryVector, topK)`  \n`}`\n\n# Chunking\n\nChunking is the process of dividing large documents into smaller, manageable segments called “chunks.” Effective chunking preserves semantic meaning while ensuring content fits within model context limits.\n\nProper chunking is essential, as it directly affects retrieval quality. Well-structured chunks improve precision and support more accurate responses.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a character-based chunking function with overlap support.\n\n`func ChunkText(text string, chunkSize, overlap int) []string {`  \n`var chunks []string`  \n`runes := []rune(text)`  \n`for start := 0; start < len(runes); start += (chunkSize - overlap) {`  \n`end := start + chunkSize`  \n`if end > len(runes) {`  \n`end = len(runes)`  \n`}`  \n`chunks = append(chunks, string(runes[start:end]))`  \n  \n`if end >= len(runes) {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n`return chunks`  \n`}`  \n  \n`chunks := ChunkText(document, 500, 50)`\n\n# Context Window\n\nThe context window is the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) an LLM can process in a single request. It defines the model’s working memory and the amount of context that can be included.\n\nContext windows range from 4K tokens in older models to over 200K in modern ones. Retrieved chunks must fit within this limit, making chunk size and selection critical.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to fit chunks within a token limit.\n\n`func FitContext(chunks []string, maxTokens int) []string {`  \n`var context []string`  \n`tokenCount := 0`  \n  \n`for _, chunk := range chunks {`  \n`chunkTokens := CountTokens(chunk)`  \n`if tokenCount + chunkTokens > maxTokens {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`context = append(context, chunk)`  \n`tokenCount += chunkTokens`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return context`  \n`}`\n\n# Grounding\n\nGrounding ensures AI responses are based on retrieved, verifiable sources rather than hallucinated information. It keeps the model anchored to real data.\n\nEffective grounding requires citing specific sources and relying only on the provided context to support claims. This reduces hallucinations and improves trustworthiness.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a grounding prompt template.\n\n`prompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Answer the question using ONLY the provided context.`  \n`Cite the source for each claim.`  \n`Context: %s`  \n  \n`Question: %s`  \n  \n`Answer with citations:`  \n`\\`, retrievedDocs, userQuestion)`  \n  \n`response := llm.Generate(prompt)`\n\n# Re-Ranking\n\nTwo-stage retrieval enhances result quality by combining speed and precision. First, a fast initial search retrieves many candidates (e.g., top 100). Then, a more accurate cross-encoder model re-ranks them to identify the best matches.\n\nThis approach pairs broad retrieval with fine-grained scoring for optimal results.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic re-ranking workflow.\n\n`// Initial fast retrieval`  \n`candidates := retriever.Search(query, 100)`  \n  \n`// Re-rank using a CrossEncoder`  \n`scores := reranker.Predict(query, candidates)`  \n  \n`// Sort candidates by score and take top 5`  \n`topDocs := SortByScore(candidates, scores)[:5]`\n\n# Hybrid Search\n\nHybrid search combines keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search. It leverages both exact term matching and meaning-based similarity to improve retrieval accuracy.\n\nBy blending keyword and semantic scores, it provides the precision of exact matches along with the flexibility of understanding conceptual queries.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a hybrid search implementation.\n\n`func HybridSearch(query string, alpha float64) []Result {`  \n`keywordResults := BM25Search(query)`  \n`semanticResults := VectorSearch(query)`  \n  \n`// Combine scores:`  \n`// finalScore = alpha * keywordScore + (1-alpha) * semanticScore`  \n`finalResults := CombineAndRank(keywordResults, semanticResults, alpha)`  \n  \n`return finalResults[:5]`  \n`}`\n\n# Metadata Filtering\n\nMetadata filtering narrows search results by using document attributes such as dates, authors, types, or departments before performing a semantic search. This reduces noise and improves precision.\n\nApplying filters like author: John Doe or document\\_type: report focuses the search on the most relevant documents.\n\nThe example below demonstrates metadata filtering in a vector database query.\n\n`results := collection.Query(`  \n`Query{`  \n`Texts: []string{\"quarterly revenue\"},`  \n`TopK: 10,`  \n`Where: map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"year\":       2024,`  \n`\"department\": \"sales\",`  \n`\"type\": map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"$in\": []string{\"report\", \"presentation\"},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`)`\n\n# Similarity Search\n\nThe retriever is the core search mechanism in RAG, identifying documents whose embeddings are most similar to a query’s embedding. It evaluates semantic closeness rather than just keyword matches.\n\nSimilarity is typically measured using cosine similarity (angle between vectors) or dot product, with higher scores indicating more relevant content.\n\nThe example below demonstrates cosine similarity using the Gonum library.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`func CosineSimilarity(vec1, vec2 []float64) float64 {`  \n`v1 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec1), vec1)`  \n`v2 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec2), vec2)`  \n  \n`dotProduct := mat.Dot(v1, v2)`  \n`norm1 := mat.Norm(v1, 2)`  \n`norm2 := mat.Norm(v2, 2)`  \n  \n`return dotProduct / (norm1 * norm2)`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Usage example`  \n`queryVec := Embed(query)`  \n`for _, docVec := range documentVectors {`  \n`score := CosineSimilarity(queryVec, docVec)`  \n`// Store score for ranking`  \n`}`\n\n# Prompt Injection\n\nPrompt injection is a security vulnerability where malicious users embed instructions in queries to manipulate AI behavior. Attackers may attempt to override system prompts or extract sensitive information.\n\nCommon examples include phrases like “ignore previous instructions” or “reveal your system prompt.” RAG systems must sanitize inputs to prevent such attacks.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic input sanitization function. In production, multiple defenses—such as regex patterns, semantic similarity checks, and output validation—are required.\n\n`func SanitizeInput(userInput string) (string, error) {`  \n`// Basic pattern matching - extend with regex for production use`  \n`dangerousPatterns := []string{`  \n`\"ignore previous instructions\",`  \n`\"disregard system prompt\",`  \n`\"reveal your instructions\",`  \n`\"ignore all prior\",`  \n`\"bypass security\",`  \n`}`  \n  \n`lowerInput := strings.ToLower(userInput)`  \n`for _, pattern := range dangerousPatterns {`  \n`if strings.Contains(lowerInput, pattern) {`  \n`return \"\", errors.New(\"invalid input detected\")`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Additional checks for production:`  \n`// - Regex for obfuscated patterns (e.g., \"ign0re\")`  \n`// - Semantic similarity to known attack phrases`  \n`// - Length and character validation`  \n  \n`return userInput, nil`  \n`}`\n\n# Hallucination\n\nGenerative AI can produce convincing but incorrect information, including false facts, fake citations, or invented details.\n\nRAG helps reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, though proper grounding and citation are essential to minimize risk.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a verification function that checks whether a response is supported by source documents. For higher reliability, consider using Natural Language Inference  models or extractive fact-checking, as relying on one LLM to verify another has limitations.\n\n`func IsSupported(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`verificationPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Response: %s`  \n`Source: %s`  \n  \n`Is this response fully supported by the source documents?`  \n`Answer yes or no.`  \n`\\`, response, sourceDocs)`  \n  \n`result := llm.Generate(verificationPrompt)`  \n`return strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(result)) == \"yes\"`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Alternative: Use NLI model for more reliable verification`  \n`func IsSupportedNLI(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`// NLI models classify as: entailment, contradiction, or neutral`  \n`result := nliModel.Predict(sourceDocs, response)`  \n`return result.Label == \"entailment\" && result.Score > 0.8`  \n`}`\n\n# Agentic RAG\n\nAgentic RAG is an advanced architecture where the AI actively plans, reasons, and controls its own retrieval strategy. Rather than performing a single search, the agent can conduct multiple searches, analyze results, and iterate.\n\nIt autonomously decides what information to retrieve, when to search again, which tools to use, and how to synthesize multiple sources—enabling complex, multi-step reasoning.\n\nThe example below demonstrates an agentic RAG implementation.\n\n`func (a *AgenticRAG) Answer(query string) string {`  \n`plan := a.llm.CreatePlan(query)`  \n  \n`for _, step := range plan.Steps {`  \n`switch step.Action {`  \n`case \"search\":`  \n`results := a.retriever.Search(step.Query)`  \n`a.context.Add(results)`  \n`case \"reason\":`  \n`analysis := a.llm.Analyze(a.context)`  \n`a.context.Add(analysis)`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return a.llm.Synthesize(a.context)`  \n`}`\n\n# Latency\n\nRAG latency is the total time from a user query to the final response, including embedding generation, vector search, re-ranking (if used), and LLM generation. Each step contributes to the delay.\n\nLatency directly impacts user experience and can be optimized by caching embeddings, using faster models, narrowing search scope, and parallelizing operations. Typical RAG systems aim for sub-second to a few seconds of latency.\n\nThe example below measures latency for each stage of the RAG pipeline.\n\n`import \"time\"`  \n  \n`func MeasureLatency(query string) {`  \n`start := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 1: Embed query`  \n`embedding := Embed(query)`  \n`t1 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 2: Search`  \n`results := vectorDB.Search(embedding)`  \n`t2 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 3: Generate`  \n`response := llm.Generate(query, results)`  \n`t3 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`fmt.Printf(\"Embed: %v | Search: %v | Generate: %v\\n\",`  \n`t1.Sub(start), t2.Sub(t1), t3.Sub(t2))`  \n`}`\n\n  \nHope this all helps!",

      "text": "bb25 v0.2.0 is out — a Python + Rust implementation of Bayesian BM25 that turns search scores into calibrated probabilities.\n\n[https://github.com/instructkr/bb25](https://github.com/instructkr/bb25)\n\nA week ago, I built bb25 that turns BM25 into a probability engine! In addition to the Rust-based implementation, the paper's author shipped his own implementation. Comparing the two taught me more than the paper itself.\n\nThe Bayesian BM25 paper does something elegant, in that applying Bayes' theorem to BM25 scores so they become real probabilities, not arbitrary numbers. This makes hybrid search fusion mathematically principled instead of heuristic.\n\nInstruct.KR's bb25 took a ground-up approach, tokenizer, inverted index, scorers, 10 experiments mapping to the paper's theorems, plus a Rust port. Jaepil's implementation took the opposite path, a thin NumPy layer that plugs into existing search systems.\n\nReading both codebases side by side, I found my document length prior has room to improvement (e.g. monotonic decay instead of symmetric bell curve), my probability AND suffered from shrinkage, and I further added automatic parameter estimation and online learning entirely.\n\nbb25 v0.2.0 introduces all four. One fun discovery along the way, my Rust code already had the correct log-odds conjunction, but I had never backported it to Python. Same project, two different AND operations.\n\nThe deeper surprise came from a formula in the reference material. Expand the Bayesian posterior and you get the structure of an artificial neuron! Think of weighted sum, bias, sigmoid activation. Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, Attention all have Bayesian derivations. A 50-year-old search algorithm leads straight to the mathematical roots of neural networks.\n\nAll creds to Jaepil and Cognica Team!",

You end up with higher latency, higher token costs, and a model that gets 'Lost in the Middle'. The latter won't happen in case the answer fits in 1 or 2 chunks, but with pushing more chunks into the answer and agentic workflows where context is bloated by all the instructions and tools, it will take a significant toll.\n\nBesides, by nature it's an endless optimization process. It must be based on evals to see, if it's a gain or a loss in your specific case. We automate experimentation and just find the mathematical 'sweet spot' for each specific use case.",

(Did they come asking for it, or did you identify the use case?)\n* What was the scope? (customer support, internal knowledge base, document search, etc.)\n\n**Delivery & Timeline:**\n\n* How long did the project take from discovery to delivery?\n* What were the biggest technical challenges you faced?\n* Did you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery?\n\n**Business Side:**\n\n* How did you find these clients? (freelance platforms, LinkedIn outreach, referrals, content marketing, etc.)\n* What did you charge? (ballpark is fine - just trying to understand market rates)\n* How did you structure pricing?

They asked us for a discovery meeting.  But they basically knew what solutions they want. We picked the most interesting one.\n\nWhat was the scope? - Some very specific document/outcome search. But not just semantics stuff, but some path dependent precedents + analytics. The LLM basically only summarizes the output. Traceability was most important. \n\n\n\nHow long did the project take from discovery to delivery? - \\~1 month from discovery to signing. Pilot delivery \\~6 weeks. A lot of follow ups needed.\n\nWhat were the biggest technical challenges you faced? - Preprocessing shitty data.\n\nDid you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery? - We handle maintenance if something breaks.\n\n\n\nHow did you find these clients? - Network / they found us.\n\nWhat did you charge? - Our deal was kinda different so any inside from me here will not reflect real market value. We did a research project for them at special conditions (highly profitable for both sides).\n\nHow did you structure pricing? - Fixed price per month for developing with 2 months of expected development time. We granted the option to exit the project after 1 month without paying for 2. If we would build in a different setting we surely would go for usual 30/40/30 splits.\n\n\n\nWere clients happy with the results? - Yes.\n\nDid you iterate/improve the system after launch? - Not yet but we do run market research to evaluate if this may fit a broader audience.\n\nAny lessons learned that you'd do differently next time? - Nothing we really did wrong but the project shifted my view on RAG, from \"some useless semantic search\" to a more broader, creative approach.   \nBut I will add that RAG can't to magic for LLMs. If your project scope is fundamentally not solvable by an LLM (for example writing high quality law stuff), RAG will not change it. \n\n",

(we went heavy on this)\n\nOn top of that, our API Discovery Engine with 23 protocol-specific detectors (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC-Web, Algolia, Elasticsearch, and more) and 8 cross-cutting analysis strategies automatically identifies how a site exposes its data  - often finding direct API access that eliminates the need for browser rendering altogether. The entire system is zero-template: you give it a URL and it dynamically analyzes complexity, detects protection layers, selects the optimal strategy, and extracts data — no selectors, no scripts, no site-specific configuration. This approach has held up over months of production use across e-commerce, enterprise authentication, SPAs, and protected sites, achieving 80-100% success rates where traditional Playwright setups were getting 1-5%.\n\nFollow the journey here and share your thoughts too 👇\n\n[https://x.com/kobeapidev](https://x.com/kobeapidev)",

Each feature has its own set of search queries and an extraction prompt.\n\nWorks reasonably well on shorter docs (\\~80 pages). On 500-700 page documents with mixed content (specs, contracts, schedules, drawings, BOQs), retrieval quality drops hard. The right information exists, but indexing and retrieval become difficult.\n\nThis feels like a fundamentally different problem from conversational QA. You're not answering one question, you're running 50 targeted extractions across a massive document set where the answer for each could be anywhere.\n\n**For those who've built something similar:** How do you approach retrieval when the document is huge, the features are predefined, and simple semantic search isn't enough?\n\nCurious about any strategies — chunking, retrieval, reranking, or completely different architectures.",

Worked great but poor with other languages depending on the POS ML model used (used spaCy NLP lib)\n\nFinally we need to aggregate all through either clustering or another llm call. \nHowever, this is only my personal experience I think there are more brilliant approaches.",

Typically first few pages.  \n2) At time of query, only expose the document titles and their TOCs either in the prompt, tools or MCP  \n3) The trick is to let the agent decide which documents (and/or pages) given are likely relevant to the user's query.  \n4) Let the agent scope and perform its RAG search filtered on the matched documents  \n5) Extend via deepsearch-like looping where the agent can repeat steps 2-4 until it finds a suitable answer\n\nThis approach differs by being top down as opposed to just diving straight into the contents and working out where you are is bottom up. Of course,  works better if the document has a TOC otherwise the alternative is parsing the documents to essentially generate your own TOC.\n\nAlso as a fellow enthusiast in handling large documents, would love some feedback on something I'm building [ragextract.com](http://ragextract.com) and how it compares to your pipeline (particularly interested in what you're doing for retrieval).

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have two announcements related to [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg): \n\n1. We released our new [comparative benchmarks](https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks). These have a slick UI and we have been working hard on them for a while now (more on this below), and we'd love to hear your impressions and get some feedback from the community!\n2. We released v4.3.0, which brings in a bunch of improvements including PaddleOCR as an optional backend, document structure extraction, and native Word97 format support. More details below.\n\n## What is Kreuzberg?\n\n[Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) is an open-source (MIT license) polyglot document intelligence framework written in Rust, with bindings for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (Node/Bun/WASM), PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Golang and Elixir. It's also available as a docker image and standalone CLI tool you can install via homebrew.\n\nIf the above is unintelligible to you (understandably so), here is the TL;DR: Kreuzberg allows users to extract text from 75+ formats (and growing), perform OCR, create embeddings and quite a few other things as well. This is necessary for many AI applications, data pipelines, machine learning, and basically any use case where you need to process documents and images as sources for textual outputs.\n\n## Comparative Benchmarks\n\nOur new comparative benchmarks UI is live here: https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks\n\nThe comparative benchmarks compare Kreuzberg with several of the top open source alternatives - Apache Tika, Docling, Markitdown, Unstructured.io, PDFPlumber, Mineru, MuPDF4LLM. In a nutshell - Kreuzberg is 9x faster on average, uses substantially less memory, has much better cold start, and a smaller installation footprint. It also requires less system dependencies to function (only __optional__ system dependency for it is onnxruntime, for embeddings/PaddleOCR).\n\nThe benchmarks measure throughput, duration, p99/95/50, memory, installation size and cold start with more than 50 different file formats. They are run in GitHub CI on ubuntu latest machines and the results are published into GitHub releases (here is an [example](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/benchmark-run-21923145045)). The [source code](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/tree/main/tools/benchmark-harness) for the benchmarks and the full data is available in GitHub, and you are invited to check it out.\n\n## V4.3.0 Changes\n\nThe v4.3.0 full release notes can be found here: https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0\n\nKey highlights:\n\n1. PaddleOCR optional backend - in Rust. Yes, you read this right, Kreuzberg now supports PaddleOCR in Rust and by extension - across all languages and bindings except WASM. This is a big one, especially for Chinese speakers and other east Asian languages, at which these models excel.\n\n2. Document structure extraction - while we already had page hierarchy extraction, we had requests to give document structure extraction similar to Docling, which has very good extraction. We now have a different but up to par implementation that extracts document structure from a huge variety of text documents - yes, including PDFs.\n\n3. Native Word97 format extraction - wait, what? Yes, we now support the legacy `.doc` and `.ppt` formats directly in Rust. This means we no longer need LibreOffice as an optional system dependency, which saves a lot of space. Who cares you may ask? Well, usually enterprises and governmental orgs to be honest, but we still live in a world where legacy is a thing.\n\n## How to get involved with Kreuzberg\n\n- Kreuzberg is an open-source project, and as such contributions are welcome. You can check us out on GitHub, open issues or discussions, and of course submit fixes and pull requests. Here is the GitHub: https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg\n- We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rzGzur3kj4) and you are all invited to join (and lurk)!\n\nThat's it for now. As always, if you like it -- star it on GitHub, it helps us get visibility!\n",

Think real-time meeting assistants or interview coaching tools where you need to retrieve and present context within 1-2 seconds while someone is still talking. The problem is that my current setup is too slow for real-time use. By the time the retrieval completes and the LLM generates a response, the conversation has already moved on. I am using Pinecone for vector search and GPT-4o for generation. Each query takes around 3-4 seconds end to end which is fine for async use cases but unusable for live assistance.\n\nI have tried a few things to speed it up. Like smaller chunks to reduce retrieval time, caching frequent queries, streaming the LLM response, switching to a faster model for generation. But I am still not hitting the latency standard I need. If someone has built low-latency RAG systems: what architecture actually works? Is it about optimizing each step incrementally, or do you need a fundamentally different approach for real-time scenarios?",

There's a couple things that have worked for me.\n\n\nFocusing just on latency for me did not work. The human ear is so attuned to even minor delays that the patient will generally start repeating themselves causing one of those frustrating voice agent loops.\n\n\nThe first step is to separate this into two separate processes. The speaking process and the processing thread. The speaking process needs to move forward even if it doesn't have the information. Think about a human operator saying \"let me look that up for you\". Or even something banal like \"okay I understand\". You've just bought yourself a couple seconds.\n\n\nThe second step is to use look ahead. You don't need to wait for the patient/customer to finish talking to have some idea what they're saying. Start looking up as soon as you get enough information to do so. \n\n\nThe third thing is we build an ontology on top of our rag database. So that lets us start segmenting the searchable space quicker. If you know the conversations about cardiovascular problems we don't need to look at all documents just the slice that are related to that. Smaller search space equals quicker queries.\n\n\nYou can combine more advanced techniques, such as non llm-based NLU with look ahead so that you're not paying the llm penalty at all and kicking off your searches much quicker. Just depends how much time you want to put into it.\n\n\nGood luck!",

There are endless permutations of techniques, standard and exotic, that can fall under this category. \n\nNot only that but fine tuning isn’t about retrieval so much as tone or understanding. You’re almost certainly not going to impart vast amounts of knowledge into a model, but you can make it align more with your expected outputs - be that email voice like a business/person, or classification of inputs for routing to the right ‘agent’ or tool. \n\nModels are so smart nowadays the answer is almost never fine tune and almost always context management and more robust and/or exotic retrieval techniques.",

If answer validation is less important, I can imagine one chooses to go with finetuning a model instead.\n\nAlso, if the knowledge base changes all the time, it is better in my opinion to have a pipeline where documents get chunked and embedded directly, rather than having to retrain LLM models all the time.",

For my use case (sonar theory and physics of sound) the documents helped but the llm still didn't understand what I needed exactly from the documents.  Cloud models couldnt handle it either.  So I took about 6 months and built a 140 million token dataset and trained llama3 8b-instruct on exactly what I needed.  \nNow I don't need the documents embedded and actually get more detailed responses without them influencing the models response.  \nIt's incredibly useful to fine tune a model in my opinion but it's not very intuitive and can be a chore to get it right",
