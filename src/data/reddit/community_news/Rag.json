Larger chunks = more context = better recall. That's a size effect, not a strategy effect.\n\n**When I controlled for actual chunk size (\\~3000 chars across strategies), token chunking matched or beat sentence chunking.**\n\n**Correlation between chunk size and recall: r=0.74 (HotpotQA), r=0.92 (Natural Questions).**\n\nCurious if others have seen similar results or if this breaks down on different datasets.",

      "text": "Hey :)\n\nSome time ago I wanted to learn the fundamentals of RAG, and I started with chunking. Greg Kamradt’s tool ([https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)) helped me understand the basics, and it was a great starting point.\n\nWhile digging deeper, especially when reading papers like [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997), I noticed that **semantic** and **agentic** chunking are showing up more often and are getting adopted in new research. But I couldn’t find any visualizers that supported those methods, so I tried to build one myself.\n\nI put together **Chunking-Vis**, a small web tool for anyone who wants to explore and learn how different chunking strategies behave. I think it can be especially helpful if you’re new to RAG and want to see how chunks are formed before they’re sent to an embedding model or retrieval pipeline.\n\n# What Chunking-Vis supports\n\n* Character-level chunking\n* Word-level chunking\n* Token-level chunking (GPT-4o tokenizer)\n* Recursive chunking\n* Semantic chunking\n* Agentic chunking (Phi-3 powered, available locally on CPU)\n\nThere’s also a **Snapshot** feature that lets you save and compare different chunking configurations side-by-side, which can make experimentation easier.\n\n# Live Demo\n\n[https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app](https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app)  \n(Agentic chunking is disabled in the demo due to compute limits.)\n\n# Github Repository\n\n[https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis](https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis)\n\nHope some of you find it useful — and if you have ideas, feedback, or suggestions, please let me know. Thank you!",

The user uploads documents in a live chat session and wants to interact with them immediately, correct?\n\nThis rules out time intensive approaches like embeddings or generating summaries or metadata with LLMs.\n\nThere are a few things that could work:\n\nGive the agent a search tool that is based on BM25. Create page chunks from the data (usually a good semantic boundary too), index it into open search or elastic search and let the agent search the index. This is fast and context efficient.\n\nOn top of that, you could add the first one or two pages of each file to the context window of the agent. Usually, the first pages give an indication of what a doc is about. With that knowledge, the agent could make targeted searches inside a specific doc by using a filter with the search queries.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could use the file system based approach that coding agents like Claude code use. Give the agent tools to grep through the files and to read slices of the document. You don’t have to use an actual file system, it could just be simulated with tools. The agent will grep and slice through the docs to answer questions. RLM is an advanced version of this approach: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24601v1",

In a document with 300 pages, any given query could require a fraction (maybe 10 - 20 pages) for a suitable answer. Could a better approach be to do the search (fast) first and extraction (slow) later - especially after the user is happy to confirm the context? Well, I hope so because this is what I'm building with [ragextract.com](http://ragextract.com) !\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. RAG would work as a way to try narrow the search space for the user query but for financial data, it's unlikely to be sufficient on its own. You'll still need to post-process the pages for accuracy - though you may sometime get away with just winging it with vision models.  \n2. Multimodal RAG works incredibly well if documents don't share a standardised layout ie different statements from different bank. You'd also might want to look at a more optimised retrieval system for pages.  \n3. In practical terms, not that I can think of. Search-first-parse-later is an alternative RAG approach I think is worth exploring in this scenario.  \n4. Best practices for large documents? You probably already know this but go (1) big, (2) async and (3) distributed!",

If the model never sees even a compressed view of the document, it’ll confidently answer based on vibes.\n\nWhat’s worked for me is separating understanding from storage. On ingestion, I generate a thin semantic layer, section summaries, key entities, numbers, obligations, relationships. That layer is small, fast, and always available to the agent. The heavy JSON stays out of the loop unless the agent explicitly needs to verify something.\nTrying to RAG directly over deeply nested extracted data is usually a dead end. It’s slow, and the signal to noise ratio is awful. Hierarchical retrieval helps a lot, first decide where to look, then pull only that slice, then answr. Latency stays low because most questions never touch the raw data.\n\nFor financial or forms heavy docs, I often skip RAG entirely and just query normalized fields. It’s boring, but it’s correct. RAG is great for “explain” questions, terrible for “calculate” ones.\n\nI’m building something in this space too, and the big unlock was treating documents like evolving knowledge objects, not blobs you fetch. Once the agent has a map of the document, it stops hallucinating and starts reasoning.",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nWe're a small team (not many engineers) building a RAG system for legal documents(contracts, NDAs, terms of service, compliance docs, etc.).\n\nThe multilingual challenge:\n\nOur documents span multiple languages (EN, FR, DE, ES, IT, etc.).\n\n·         Some tenants have docs in a single language (e.g., all French)\n\n·         Some tenants have mixed-language corpora\n\n·         Some individual documents are bilingual\n\n \n\nFor legal docs, hybrid search (FT search and dense vectors with re rank) seems to be a good candidate for retrieval. One issue I saw is that most implementations relies on language dependent solutions for FT search.\n\nApproaches I've seen discussed:\n\n·         Per-language BM25 indexes: Detect language, route to the right index with proper stemmer. Seems correct but adds complexity. How do you handle bilingual documents?\n\n·         Language-agnostic tokenization: Skip stemming, just split on whitespace. Loses morphological matching but works across languages.\n\n·         BGE-M3 sparse vectors: Supposedly handles 100+ languages natively for both dense and sparse. But does it require GPU? What's the cost/perf tradeoff vs traditional BM25?\n\n·         Translate everything to English: Normalize the knowledge base. Feels wrong for legal where original wording matters and adds a translation failure mode.\n\n·         Dense-only + reranker : Skip BM25 entirely, use strong multilingual embeddings (BGE-M3, multilingual-e5) and rerank. Loses exact keyword matching.\n\n·         Qdrant's native BM25 : Qdrant now has built-in BM25 with language configs. Anyone using this for multilingual? How does it compare to dedicated solutions?\n\n \n\nWe’d rather use managed services when available in the cloud provider we chose (scaleway).\n\nOur constraints:\n\n* Managed PostgreSQL for app data : only supports pgvector, not pg\\_search/ParadeDB. Would require to self-host a postgres for additional extensions.\n* Prefer simplicity: Leaning toward Qdrant over Milvus since it seems easier to operate.\n* Cost-conscious: GPU-heavy solutions for embeddings are a concern.\n* Multi-tenant: Each tenant's documents are typically in one consistent language, but not always.\n\nAnyone would like to share their experience or thoughts on this challenge?  \n",

So I’d just accept that and let **multilingual embeddings handle cross-lang**, and use BM25 for the “same language, exact wording” wins (which matters a ton in legal).\n\nAlso bilingual docs: don’t route by *document* language, route by **chunk**. Chunk it, detect lang per chunk, store `chunk_lang`. Then BM25 mostly hits same-lang chunks, dense can still pull cross-lang if needed.\n\nRe: translate everything to English… yeah no thx for legal. If you ever need translation, do it only as a *query expansion* (translate the query to a couple langs) not the whole corpus.\n\nGiven your Scaleway constraints, honestly **OpenSearch** for the text side is a pretty sane pick. Qdrant BM25 is nice but once you want analyzers/highlighting/etc you’ll end up in search-engine land anyway.\n\nKeep rerank small (top 20–50) and do embeddings async on ingestion so you’re not “GPU all day” 🔥.",

Some highlights from related threads:\n- Determinism & reproducibility as key to relational DB win (echoing why Graph DBs struggled).\n- Real prod experiences: keep graphs deterministic/auditable (e.g., calls/imports/FKs), avoid LLM-guessed edges clutter.\n- Links shared: [DDG preprint](https://zenodo.org/records/18373053) and [RoslynIndexer repo](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer) for deterministic code RAG.\n\n---\n\nr/RAG — GraphRAG hype (explicit graphs over vector RAG) feels like 70s graph DBs (IMS/CODASYL): explicit relations won benchmarks but lost to relational cuz upfront assumptions brittle.\n\n**Hype vs Reality**\nLLM infers entities/relations → persist edges → query traversal. Cool for global search, but edges = ingestion-time guesses → bias for new intents.\n\n**Core Brittleness**\nFrom my [r/programming post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pz6pj3/graphrag_is_just_graph_databases_all_over_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): Nodes=facts, edges=guesses. Scoped query-time inference (BM25+vectors+rerank) often better for ambiguous RAG (no freeze).\n\n**Pushback & Predictability**\nComments nailed it: auditable edges > opaque LLMs (prod win). Dynamic rebuilds? Viable, but maintenance cost high vs simple hybrid RAG.\n\nShines: stable domains (regs/code deps). Fails: intent-shifting queries.\n\nMedium breakdown:[Medium friend link](https://medium.com/sisai/graphrags-deja-vu-why-are-we-repeating-the-same-mistakes-f6852f54bde0?sk=2692c642e7dfb19e9d552162462384c4)\n\n\nProd experiences? GraphRAG beat baseline RAG on your corpus (e.g., multi-hop QA, latency)? Hybrid + dynamic graphs? Or stick to rerank?\n\nShare benchmarks!",

You’re sort of freezing assumptions that may not match what people will ask later.\n\nBut it’s very use-case dependent. For code, I honestly think a dependency graph is pretty much **non-optional**. Calls/imports/inheritance aren’t opinions — they’re real structure. Without graph expansion you often end up with random snippets, and vanilla RAG struggles badly with questions like “where does this start?” or “what does this change affect?”, because you’re missing the whole call chain.",

I’m trying to keep the *edges* deterministic + auditable (calls/imports/inheritance, ReadsFrom/WritesTo, FKs etc.), and I’m really trying to avoid freezing “LLM-guessed” relations during ingestion.\n\nI kind of treat vectors as *ranking / fuzzy recall*, but the graph as the closed-world structure that should rebuild the same way every time. For example I force stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and I also add missing TABLE nodes so the SQL graph is actually closed (nodes + edges), not half implicit.\n\nOne thing I’d highlight though: **heuristics ≠ inference**. I’m fine with fixed, testable heuristics (like inline SQL detection) — even if it’s not perfect, it’s still deterministic and you can regression-test it. What I’m trying to avoid is context-dependent enrichment that changes depending on the model/prompt or whatever the “best guess” is this week.\n\nIf you’re curious, this repo is just the **indexing part** (Roslyn/.NET side). The actual RAG pipeline / retrieval is in a separate project:  \n[https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer)\n\nAlso curious how you want to handle schema evolution / versioning for DDGs on big real repos — do you version the domain spec per build, kind of like a compiler?",

Will dive into it right away.\n\nu/RolandRu, super appreciate you sharing your setup and the RoslynIndexer repo! Exactly aligns with what I've been thinking: keep the graph as closed-world, deterministic structure (hard facts like calls/imports/inheritance/ReadsFrom/WritesTo/FKs), and treat vectors as fuzzy recall/ranking. Love the emphasis on heuristics (fixed, testable, regression-friendly) vs. context-dependent LLM guesses—that's the brittleness killer.Your approach to forcing stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and adding missing nodes for closed structure is smart—avoids the \"half implicit\" mess. Curious on a couple things:\n\n\\* How do you handle schema evolution/versioning in big repos? Per-build domain spec like a compiler, or something else?\n\n\\* Have you seen measurable wins on those chain-tracing queries (e.g., impact analysis) vs. vanilla RAG?\n\n\\* Any thoughts on hybrid with dynamic rebuilds for evolving code, or is pure deterministic the way?\n\nThis ties perfectly into what I'm exploring next: code itself as frozen presuppositions/dependencies, and debug as closing the gap to reality. If you're open, I'd love to reference/link your repo/preprint in upcoming posts (with credit, of course).\n\nThanks again—threads like this are why I love posting here!",

          "text": "Yeah, you’re basically on the right track. There’s no single perfect chunking or embedding strategy, it really depends on your data and what you’re trying to achieve. Keeping metadata separate is correct you should embed only the actual text content and store the metadata alongside it so you can filter or rank with it later. Embedding metadata usually just adds noise.\nChunking isn’t fixed either. Sometimes smaller chunks work better, sometimes larger ones, and semantic chunking is often the best option. It’s normal to tweak your chunking strategy as you see how your retrieval performs.\n\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right about retrieval. Don’t rely only on embeddings. Combining embeddings with metadata filtering, keyword or BM25 search, and then adding a reranking step gives much better results in most cases.\n\n\nSo yes, what you described is basically how strong RAG systems are built. we are following same for Zynfo AI to build out chatbot",

      "text": "One of the hardest lessons I learned while building n8n automations with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and AI agents is that the problem isn’t writing workflows its handling real-world chaos. I was helping a mid-sized e-commerce client who sold across Shopify, eBay, and YouTube and the volume of incoming customer questions, order updates and content requests was overwhelming their small team. The breakthrough came when we layered RAG on top of n8n: every new message or order triggers a workflow that first retrieves relevant historical context (past orders, previous customer messages, product FAQs) and then passes it to an AI agent that drafts a response or generates a content snippet. This reduced manual errors drastically and allowed staff to focus on exceptions instead of repetitive tasks. For example, a new Shopify order automatically pulled product specs, checked inventory, created a draft invoice in QuickBooks and even generated a YouTube short highlighting the new product without human intervention. The key insight: start with the simplest reliable automation backbone (parsing inputs → enriching via RAG → action via AI agents), then expand iteratively. If anyone wants to map their messy multi-platform workflows into a clean, intelligent n8n + RAG setup, I’m happy to guide and  to help get it running efficiently in real operations.",

Maybe another step would be to create detailed skill or rule for agent how to use this graph, because for LLM it is just graph, it doesn't know what to do with it and still reads the files to context for it's tasks.\nAs for me even better results was when I wrote spring documentation MCP, then even weak models become stronger.\n\nAnother though, you don't need to support All frameworks, java specific would be enough for commercial product, just choose this niche and keep going, enterprise clients will pay for it.\n\nFor patterns you need to ask LLM to write breaf reviews for graph chains, it could cost 20-100$, depending on repo and model. Also write custom wights algorithms, but it's rather doubtful, because it could work great for 1 project and can harm for another.\nI was participating in similar project for Cobol, and can say you are in the right direction and have similar problems ☺️",

I don't use standard graph databases anymore. I created a new type of graph database that can store the AST as well as the extracted rules together in one unified format. This helps the inference engine navigate back and forth between code and rules easily. It even helps with abstraction patterns. \n\n\nFor me the atomic unit is a prototype. And a graph of prototypes is called a prototype graph.\n\n\nThen instead of using extractors, I created a general object to graph framework with circular dependency detection and resolution. That lets me call ToPrototype on any object and have it serialized to a prototype graph which can be stored inside the graph database along with the rules. \n\n\nOne of the cool things of this approach is that the inference in learning engines can utilize graphs that contain natural language or code or data all in the same graph structure.",

Network latency will be a factor as well as thinking level. So a good test might be to test the NLI over the network, even if on a cloudflare tunnel to simulate cloud. Also test thinking/non-thinking variants of smaller cloud models. This way you can see where the cutoff in performance is. E.g., Can gpt-4o-mini perform just as well as gpt-5 on the dataset? And/Or maybe another cloud hallucination detector?\n\nThis might help ground the comparison and highlight the true benefits against systems people are already using.",

      "text": "Hey all, after seeing a few posts I'm curious as to if anyone has a tried and true favourite method for chunking.\n\nIf I set the scene as we're making an agentic RAG for contracts, ingesting with OCR, carrying out hybrid search (vector+BM25) and a re-ranker. My main concern is the ingestion/chunking process (garbage in, garbage out).\n\nLooking at OCR results I can see that a paragraph may have 1 line that lands on the next page, or that a bullet list goes across 2 pages or that structurally few headings are used.\n\nFor no good reason semantic chunking has stood out as something that makes logical sense as I just want chunks that in isolation make sense, and hopefully side-step the need for overlap etc. \n\nOne downside to this I can imagine however is that a chunk can be semantically complete, but could otherwise refer to an exception clause. Without both you could end up with poor context to feed an LLM when answering a user query.\n\n  \nSo back to the original question, for the stated use case does anyone have a pattern they would use here?",

It naturally produces larger chunks, which is exactly why it wins.\n\nThe caveat is cost and latency. Sentence chunking at 1024 config gives you \\~3500 char chunks. At top-k=5, that's 17,500 chars in your LLM context before you've added the prompt. If that's fine for your use case, go for it.\n\nTL;DR: Sentence chunking works. Now you know \\*why\\* it works.",
