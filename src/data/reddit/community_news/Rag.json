      "text": "I love playing around with RAG and AI, optimizing every layer to squeeze out better performance. Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

A lot of modern React/Next.js sites return empty HTML until the JavaScript runs. Standard scrapers often fail there.\n\nFastRAG uses a headless browser instance (Puppeteer) to fully hydrate the DOM before scraping, so you catch the content that only appears after JS execution. It’s overkill for simple docs, but necessary for a robust 'Chat with Any Website' SaaS.\n\n[fastrag.live](https://www.fastrag.live)",

No more context window panic. No more \"as I mentioned earlier\" when you definitely did not mention it earlier.\n\nSo naturally: \"Why do we even need RAG anymore??\"\n\nI actually dug into this and... It's not that simple (shocking, I know).\n\nBasically:\n\n* **Agent memory** = remembers what IT was doing (task state)\n* **RAG** = retrieves what THE WORLD knows (external facts)\n\nOne is your agent's personal journal. The other is the company wiki it keeps forgetting exists.\n\n**An agent** with perfect memory but no retrieval is like a coworker who remembers every meeting but never reads the docs. We've all worked with that guy.\n\n**A RAG system** with no memory is like that other coworker who reads everything but forgets what you talked about 5 minutes ago. Also that guy.\n\nTurns out the answer is: stack both. Memory for state, retrieval for facts, vector DB(Like Milvus) underneath.\n\nRAG isn't dead. It just got a roommate who leaves dishes in the sink.\n\n👉 Full breakdown here if you want the deep dive [https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md](https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md)\n\n**TL;DR:** Claude Cowork's memory is for tracking task state. RAG is for grounding the model in external knowledge. They're complementary, not competitive. We can all calm down (for now).",

Namely those that have the concerns:\n\n- Automatic retrieval of information \n- Injection of relevant information into a prompt for Autoregressive Causal Inference \n\n RAG does not mean \"embed and retrieve documents to guide an LLM at query time\"\n\nRather RAG is a broad topic of which \"embed and retrieve documents....\" is a member. \n\nKey word search is also RAG if you put the results into an LLM.\n\nRandom search is also RAG if you put the results into an LLM.\n\nHaving the system send an email to an office worker to ask for information at query time is still RAG (it's just not useful) \n\nRAG is not dead. It is a battle tested framework for designing systems. \n\nWhen people say \"RAG is dead\" to me that is a smell that tells me they've never written a line of code in their life and they are likely one of those jumped up sales people earning 250k per year for selling copilot licenses.",

Precision queries hit insights. Exploratory queries hit concepts/abstracts.\n\nI assume this works well beacuse LLMs during ingestion can spend *minutes* analyzing a document that gets used thousands of times. The upfront cost amortizes completely. And they're genuinely good at:\n\n* Disambiguating structure\n* Resolving implicit context\n* Normalizing varied phrasings into consistent forms\n* Cross-referencing\n\nTested this on a few projects involving financial document corpus : agent with distillation correctly identified which DOW companies were financial institutions, attributed specific risks with page-level citations, and supported claims with concrete figures. Naive chunking agent failed to even identify the companies reliably.\n\nThis is fully automatable with workflow-based pipelines:\n\n1. Table extraction (preserve structure via CV models)\n2. Text generation 1: insights from tables + text\n3. Text generation 2: concepts from insights\n4. Text generation 3: abstracts from concepts\n5. Text generation 4: table schema analysis for SQL generation\n\nEach component receives previous component's output. Final JSON contains original data + all distillation layers.\n\nAnyway figure this is one of those things where the industry is converging on the wrong abstraction and we should probably talk about it more.",

That's how we started making the search possible with AI. \n\nBut as the LLMs got so better, I feel we should take a step back and appreciate the simple text search tools as well. In one of my projects, it was doing good with just semantic search. Recently got an issue where it could not find information about code related question.\n\nThe text was right there, but you know the semantic search stuff, it doesn't pick it up if there is no enough information even though it is just there. That's when I took a step back and just did a regular text base regex search tools.\n\nPoint it, the LLMs are a lot better and they try multiple combinations and eventually they find out as we expect them to. This for sure helps in codebases because there it is more of keywords. I immediately made this improvement live and its giving amazing results.\n\nAnybody did this already? any thoughts?",

You can create a few different approaches to searching:   \n \\- Use find to get a directory structure, then ask it to use targeted greps using this directorry structure to find valid files and get surround chunks.   \n \\- Simple regex grep on everything in a shotgun blast approach with multiple combinations of what it could be: For example if you ask \"How does auth work here\" You'll want it to break down into stuff like \"auth\" \"authorization\" \"login\" \"token\", to get a wide breadth of information.",

Users don't tell you \"use keyword search\" - they ask questions and expect answers.\n\nThe problem compounds: query X needs semantic, query Y needs keyword, query Z needs both. LLM tries combinations and \"eventually finds it\" means wasted retrieval calls and latency. More importantly, when it still fails after trying combinations, you can't debug why without logging what each method returned and why the LLM chose path A over B.\n\nWe saw this exact issue. Added BM25 alongside vector search. Results improved but incidents became harder to debug. \"It found the wrong doc\" doesn't tell you which retrieval method failed or why fusion chose incorrectly.\n\nFor production RAG: are you capturing retrieval results from both methods plus fusion decisions?

A cheaper/faster model is usually sufficient.\n\nCommon best practice we’ve seen work well:\n\n- Spend compute on retrieval quality (chunking, filters, re-ranking), not the final generator.\n- Use a fast default generator, and only escalate to a stronger model when signals suggest it’s needed (low relevance scores, sparse matches, high ambiguity, multi-doc synthesis).\n- Treat generation as a formatting + synthesis step, not the place to “fix” weak retrieval.\n\nIn other words: if you need a very powerful model to get good answers, that’s often a retrieval problem, not a generation one.",

I'm so grateful for this community's help.  \nI ended up trying a few solutions with my team, and we finally tried [openmark.ai](https://www.openmark.ai) like someone mentioned for automated testing, we managed to find models that perform better for every step of the agentic flows, and that are much more cost efficient, with fallbacks if necessary.

The Input (Vectorization)  \n\nMy Flask backend captures the user's text question.  \nBGE-M3 Hugging face (Local Embedding Model).  \nwhat happens: The model converts the English sentence into a 1024-dimensional vector, which is a list of numbers. It does not comprehend the text; it transforms it into a mathematical point in space.  \nWhy this choice? Running this locally guarantees under 100 milliseconds latency and no cost since it's on hugging face backend (free plan).  \n\n2. The Retrieval\nThe system searches my database for relevant information.  \nFAISS.  \nFAISS calculates the Cosine Similarity between the user's question vector and the 130,000+ chunks of text in mine database. It retrieves the Top 3-5 chunks that are mathematically closest to the query. FAISS is designed for speed. It can scan millions of vectors in milliseconds, even on a CPU which is available on hugging face free plan.  \n\n3. The Prompt Construction  \nThe system creates a large prompt for the AI.  \nThe Logic: It combines three components:  \nRole: \"You are a strict Singapore Law Expert…”  \nContext: The 3-5 text chunks retrieved by FAISS.  \nQuery: The user's original question.  \n\n4. The Generation (Te \"triplefailover\" brain)  \n The prompt is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a human-like answer.  \nA reliable \"Chain of Command\":  \nPrimary: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Fastest, High Context).  \nFailover 1: If Gemini fails due to rate limit or error, it switches to Arcee AI trinity large preview(via OpenRouter).  \nFailover 2: If that fails, it switches to Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq).  \nThis guarantees 99.9% uptime.\n\n5. The Output\nAction: The text response streams back to the frontend.  \nReact + Framer Motion.\n The answer appears in  my chat window and thats it I hope this enough explanation also I didn't even invest a single cent in this\nIf you found this helpful thank you very much ☺️😁",

I have a much smaller corpus but three layers of authoritative source (canonical, expert opinion, user organisation override). I got better retrieval results by splitting the parent chunks into child chunks with a small token count, and embedding those. Being smaller, a cheap encoding model can be used, and they work better with specific queries anyway. But embedding is a one time cost, and this approach uses the child chunks to find and retrieve a parent chunk so it doesn't save actual tokens when answering queries, except that perhaps it does better retrieval which is also an optimisation (my retrieval is a BM25/vectorisation hybrid which some hand-coded domain-specific assistance provided to BM25). [together.ai](http://together.ai) has a list of recommended models which do well. I allow the user to swap to kimi-2.5 which lets them paste/upload images to their prompt ... however, each user has a quota so if they do more expensive things, they exhaust their quota more quickly, which is a thinking outside the box solution, perhaps.

      "text": "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** has become the dominant paradigm for grounding large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Among RAG approaches, **vector-based retrieval**—which embeds documents and queries into a shared semantic space and retrieves the most semantically similar chunks—has emerged as the de facto standard.\n\nThis dominance is understandable: vector RAG is simple, scalable, and fits naturally into existing information-retrieval pipelines. However, as LLM systems evolve from single-turn question answering toward multi-turn, agentic, and reasoning-driven applications, the limitations of vector-based RAG are becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nMany of these limitations are well known. Others are less discussed, yet far more fundamental. This article argues that **context blindness**, the inability of vector-based retrieval to condition on full conversational and reasoning context, is the most critical limitation of vector-based RAG, and one that fundamentally constrains its role in modern LLM systems.\n\n# Commonly Discussed Limitations of Vector-Based RAG\n\n**The Limitations of Semantic Similarity**\n\nVector-based retrieval assumes that semantic similarity between a query and a passage is a reliable proxy for relevance. This assumption breaks down in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, similarity-based retrieval often misses what should be retrieved (false negatives). User queries typically express intent rather than the literal surface form of the supporting evidence, and the information that satisfies the intent is often implicit, procedural, or distributed across multiple parts of a document. As a result, truly relevant evidence may share little semantic overlap with the query and therefore fails to be retrieved by similarity search, creating a **context gap** between what the user is trying to retrieve and what similarity search can represent.\n\nSecond, similarity-based retrieval often returns what should not be retrieved (false positives). Even when retrieved passages appear highly similar to the query, similarity does not guarantee relevance, especially in domain-specific documents such as financial reports, legal contracts, and technical manuals, where many sections share near-identical language but differ in critical details such as numerical thresholds, applicability conditions, definitions, or exceptions. Vector embeddings tend to blur these distinctions, creating **context confusion**: passages that appear relevant in isolation are retrieved despite being incorrect given the actual scope, constraints, or exceptions. In professional and enterprise settings, this failure mode is particularly dangerous because it grounds confident answers in plausible but incorrect evidence.\n\n**The Limitations of Embedding Models**\n\nEmbedding models transform passages into vector representations. However, the input length limits of the embedding model force documents to be split into chunks, disrupting their structure and introducing information discontinuities. Definitions become separated from constraints, tables from explanations, and exceptions from governing rules. Although often cited as the main limitation of vector-based RAG, chunking is better viewed as a secondary consequence of deeper architectural constraints.\n\n# The Under-Discussed Core Problem: Context Blindness\n\nA core limitation of vector-based RAG that is rarely discussed is its **context blindness**: the retrieval query cannot carry the full context that led to the question. In modern LLM applications, queries are rarely standalone. They depend on prior dialogue, intermediate conclusions, implicit assumptions, operational context, and evolving user intent. Yet vector-based retrieval operates on a short, decontextualized query that must be compressed into one or more fixed-length vectors.\n\nThis compression is not incidental — it is fundamental. A vector embedding has limited representational capacity: it must collapse rich, structured reasoning context into a dense numerical representation that cannot faithfully preserve dependencies, conditionals, negations, or conversational state. As a result, vector-based retrieval is inherently **context-independent**. Documents are matched against a static semantic representation rather than the full reasoning state of the system. This creates a structural disconnect: the LLM reasons over a long, evolving context, while the vector retriever operates on a minimal, compressed, and flattened signal. In other words, **the LLM reasoner is stateful, while the vector retriever is not.** Even with prompt engineering, query expansion, multi-vector retrieval, or reranking, this mismatch persists, because the limitation lies in the representational bottleneck of vectors themselves. The vector retriever remains blind to the very context that determines what “relevant” means.\n\n# Paradigm Shift: From Context-Independent Semantic Similarity to Context-Dependent Relevance Classification\n\nThe solution to context blindness is not a better embedding model or a larger vector database, but a change in how retrieval itself is formulated. Instead of treating retrieval as a semantic similarity search performed by an external embedding model, retrieval should be framed as a **relevance classification problem** executed by an LLM that has access to the **full reasoning context**.\n\nIn this formulation, the question is no longer “Which passages are closest to this query in embedding space?”, but rather “Given everything the system knows so far—user intent, prior dialogue, assumptions, and constraints—is this piece of content relevant or not?” Relevance becomes an explicit decision conditioned on context, rather than an implicit signal derived from vector proximity.\n\nBecause modern LLMs are designed to reason over long, structured context, they are naturally well-suited to this role. Unlike embedding models, which must compress inputs into fixed-length vectors and inevitably discard structure and dependencies, LLM-based relevance classification can directly condition on the entire conversation history and intermediate reasoning steps. As a result, retrieval becomes context-aware and adapts dynamically as the user’s intent evolves.\n\nThis shift transforms retrieval from a standalone preprocessing step into part of the reasoning loop itself. Instead of operating outside the LLM stack as a static similarity lookup, retrieval becomes tightly coupled with decision-making, enabling RAG systems that scale naturally to multi-turn, agentic, and long-context settings.\n\n# Scaling Relevance Classification via Tree Search\n\nA common concern with context-dependent, relevance-classification-based retrieval is token efficiency. **Naively classifying relevance over the entire knowledge base via brute-force evaluation is token-inefficient and does not scale.** However, token inefficiency is not inherent to relevance-classification-based retrieval; it arises from flat, brute-force evaluation rather than **hierarchical classification**.\n\nIn **PageIndex**, retrieval is implemented as a **hierarchical relevance classification** over document structure (sections → pages → blocks), where relevance is evaluated top-down and entire subtrees are pruned once a high-level unit is deemed irrelevant. This transforms retrieval from exhaustive enumeration into selective exploration, focusing computation only on promising regions. The intuition resembles systems such as **AlphaGo**, which achieved efficiency not by enumerating all possible moves, but by navigating a large decision tree through learned evaluation and selective expansion. Similarly, PageIndex avoids wasting tokens on irrelevant content, enabling context-conditioned retrieval that is both more accurate and more efficient than flat vector-based RAG pipelines that depend on large candidate sets, reranking, and repeated retrieval calls.\n\n# The Future of RAG\n\nThe rise of frameworks such as **PageIndex** signals a broader shift in the AI stack. As language models become increasingly capable of planning, reasoning, and maintaining long-horizon context, the responsibility for finding relevant information is gradually **moving** **from the database layer to the model layer**.\n\nThis transition is already evident in the coding domain. Agentic tools such as **Claude Code** are moving beyond simple vector lookups toward active codebase exploration: navigating file hierarchies, inspecting symbols, following dependencies, and iteratively refining their search based on intermediate findings. Generic document retrieval is likely to follow the same trajectory. As tasks become more multi-step and context-dependent, passive similarity search increasingly gives way to structured exploration driven by reasoning.\n\nVector databases will continue to have important, well-defined use cases, such as recommendation systems and other settings, where semantic similarity **is the objective**. However, their historical role as the default retrieval layer for LLM-based systems is becoming less clear. As retrieval shifts from similarity matching to context-dependent decision-making, agentic systems increasingly demand mechanisms that can reason, adapt, and operate over structure, rather than relying solely on embedding proximity.\n\nIn this emerging paradigm, retrieval is no longer a passive lookup operation. It becomes an integral part of the model’s reasoning process: executed by the model, guided by intent, and grounded in context.",

AI is executing work, not just answering prompts\n\nEnterprises are already running AI-powered, end-to-end workflows for billing, customer support, document processing, reporting, and internal ops.\n\nThis isn’t experimentation or demos anymore — it’s workflow automation at scale.\n\n\n\n2. RAG is becoming the default architecture\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation isn’t optional if you care about accuracy, grounding, or compliance.\n\nConnecting LLMs to internal documents, databases, and vector stores significantly reduces hallucinations and makes AI usable in regulated environments.\n\n\n\n3. LLM progress is about reasoning, not raw size\n\nModel scale mattered early on, but real value now comes from context management, domain awareness, and multi-step reasoning — not just parameter count.\n\n\n\n4. AI agents are the real inflection point\n\nAgentic systems don’t just generate text — they plan, use tools, call APIs, and execute multi-step tasks across systems.\n\nLess “chatbot”, more junior employee with supervision and guardrails.\n\n\n\n5. Enterprise AI has moved into production\n\nWe’re past pilots and proofs-of-concept. Teams are measuring latency, cost, reliability, and productivity gains — and AI is starting to affect real KPIs.\n\n\n\n6. Multimodal and domain-specific models are winning\n\nText-only AI is limiting. The future is multimodal systems that understand documents, images, audio, and structured data — often fine-tuned or adapted for specific industries.\n\n7. Governance, trust, and compliance are first-class concerns\n\nAudit trails, explainability, bias mitigation, access controls, and data residency are no longer “nice to have” — they’re required for production AI.\n\n8. Edge AI is quietly becoming important\n\nOn-device and local inference unlock lower latency, better privacy, and reduced cloud costs — especially for personal and enterprise use cases.\n\nTo me, the takeaway is simple:\n\nThe AI revolution isn’t coming — it’s already operational.\n\nThe winners won’t be the ones chasing hype, but the ones building reliable, grounded, agent-driven systems that actually work.\n\nI wrote a longer breakdown here:\n\n [https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026](https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026)",

Send only top-5/top-10 to the model\n\nThe point: stop feeding the LLM garbage context.\n\n# When rerankers are actually worth it\n\nYou likely need a reranker if:\n\n* The correct chunk is often in top-50, but not in top-5\n* Your corpus has near-duplicates (policy versions, templates, “same doc but updated”)\n* Queries are long / multi-intent (“compare A vs B, cite the latest policy, exclude legacy”)\n* Dense retrieval returns “related” chunks but not the *answer-bearing* chunk\n* Increasing k makes answers worse (more context → more confusion)\n\nIf your data is small and clean and top-5 is already precise, rerankers can be extra latency for little gain.\n\n# The main reranker approaches (practical overview)\n\n# 1) Cross-encoder rerankers (most common “quality win”)\n\nScores each *(query, chunk)* pair by reading them together.\n\n* ✅ Best precision (biggest improvement to answer quality)\n* ❌ More compute than embeddings\n* Best pattern: retrieve top-50 → cross-encoder → keep top-5\n\n# 2) Embedding similarity (bi-encoder) (baseline, not really “reranking”)\n\nThis is what most people mean by “vector search”.\n\n* ✅ Fast, scales well\n* ❌ Weaker at fine-grained intent (“which chunk actually answers?”)\n* Best use: candidate generator before a stronger reranker\n\n# 3) Hybrid (BM25 + dense)\n\nCombine lexical matching with embeddings.\n\n* ✅ Great for IDs, error codes, names, exact terms\n* ✅ More robust across weird queries\n* ❌ Requires tuning weights / mixing logic\n\n# 4) LLM-as-reranker (works, but don’t start here)\n\nAsk an LLM to rank chunks (sometimes with custom rules).\n\n* ✅ Very flexible (“prefer newest doc”, “must include citation”, etc.)\n* ❌ Slower + expensive + can be inconsistent unless tightly constrained\n* Use when you need domain rules that models don’t capture well\n\n# 5) Domain-tuned rerankers\n\nFine-tune a reranker on your own relevance data.\n\n* ✅ Big gains in specialized corpora\n* ❌ Needs training data + evaluation discipline\n* Worth it when retrieval quality is core to your product\n\n# A simple setup that usually works\n\n* Retrieve top-50\n* Cross-encoder rerank → pick top-5\n* Apply filters **before reranking** when possible (permissions, time, doc type)\n* Track metrics like: “answer present in top-N” and final answer accuracy\n\nThat’s it. Reranking isn’t a silver bullet — it’s just the cleanest way to convert “the answer is somewhere in there” into “the model actually sees it.”\n\n",

I’ve been obsessing over how to run decent RAG pipelines on my consumer laptop (GTX 1650, 4GB VRAM) without relying on any cloud APIs.\n\n​I quickly realized that \"one size fits all\" doesn't work when you have limited VRAM. So I ended up building two completely different RAG architectures for my projects, and I’d love to get some feedback on them.\n\n​1. The \" HIERARCHICAL AGENTIC RAG WITH HYBRID SEARCH (VRCTOR SEARCH + KNOWLEDGE GRAPH)\" (WiredBrain)::\n\n​The Goal: Handle massive scale (693k chunks) without crashing my RAM.\n\n​The Problem: Standard HNSW indexes were too RAM-heavy and got slow as the dataset grew.\n\n​My Solution: I built a Hierarchical 3-Address Router. Instead of searching everything, it uses a lightweight classifier to route the query to a specific \"Cluster\" (Domain -> Topic -> Entity) before doing the vector search.\n\n​The Result: It cuts the search space by ~99% instantly. I’m using pgvector to keep the index on system RAM so my GPU is free for generation.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/WiredBrain-Hierarchical-Rag\n\n​2. The \"Speed Demon\" (Axiom Voice Agent)\n\n​The Goal: <400ms latency for a real-time voice assistant.\n​The Problem: Even the optimized Graph RAG was too slow for a fluid conversation.\n\n​My Solution: I built a pure JSON-based RAG. It bypasses the complex graph lookups and loads a smaller, highly specific context directly into memory for immediate \"reflex\" answers. It’s strictly for the voice agent where speed > depth.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/axiom-voice-agent",

For audit: there's an append only log of all data accessed by the user, directly or via search or chat, and logs of all chat interactions. \nThe biggest challenge on building the graph was data acquisition and mapping: we've over 50 data sources integrated in this project from all sorts of internal databases, and building a cohesive view of the data took some time. But it is also done incrementally, continuously throughout the project development and ongoing production usage.\nIt's all using traditional NLP approaches, we don't use LLMs for building the graph in this project both due to cost limitations (traditional NLP handles 100,000s of files/s and enables very quick reprocessing once new datasets are added).\nThe access model is one of the big challenges: it's at the 3 levels (data type, entity level and field level access enforcement - last one we're just adding to the product). And yes the use-case requires it (many data repositories each with it's own rules), strict export control requirements, etc...",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nA few Days back, I talked about my pet project, which is a RAG-based search engine on Singaporean laws and acts (Scraping 20,000 pages/sec) with an Apple-inspired user interface.\n\nThis project is open source meaning anyone can use my backend logic but do read the license provided in the GitHub.(Star the repo if you liked it.)\n\nThe community posed some fantastic and challenging questions on answer consistency, complex multi-law queries, and hallucinations. These questions were just incredible. Rather than addressing these questions or issues with patches and fixing them superficially, I decided to revisit the code and refactor significant architectural changes.This version also includes reference to page number of the pdf while answering i have achieved that using metadata while I also building the vector database.\n\nI look forward to sharing with you Version 2.\n\nThe following are specific feedback that I received, and how I went about engineering the solutions:\n\nThe Problem: \"How do you ensure answer quality doesn't drop when the failover switches models?\"\n\nThe Feedback: My back-end has a \"Triple Failover\" system (three models, triple the backups!). I was concerned that moving from a high-end model to a backup model would change the \"answer structure\" or \"personality,\" giving a \"jarring\" effect to the user. The V2 Fix: Model-Specific System Instructions. I have no ability to alter the underlying intelligence of my backup models, so I had to normalize the output of my back-end models. I implemented a dynamic instruction set. If the back-end should fail over to Model B, I inject a specific \"system prompt\" to encourage Model B to conform to the same structure as Model A.\n\n2. The Problem: \"Single queries miss the bigger picture (e.g., 'Starting a business' involves Tax, Labor, AND Banking laws).\"\n\nThe Feedback: A simple semantic search for “starting a business” could yield the Companies Act but completely overlook the Employment Act or Income Tax Act. The V2 Fix: Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR). I decided the cost of computation for MQR was worth it. What we now do is, when you pose an open-ended question, an LLM catches the question and essentially breaks it down into sub-questions that could be “Business Registration,” “Corporate Taxation,” “Hiring Regulations,” etc. It's a more computationally intensive process, but the depth of the answer is virtually night and day from V1.\n\n3. The Problem: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out (Hallucinations)\n\nThe Feedback: If the search results contain an irrelevant document, the LLM has two choices: either hallucinate an answer or say \"I don't know.\"\nThe V2 Fix: Re-Ranking with Cross-Encoders: I decided to introduce an additional validation layer. Once the initial vector search yields the primary results, the Cross-Encoder model \"reads\" them to ensure that they're indeed relevant to the query before passing them along to the LLM. If they're irrelevant, the results are discarded immediately, greatly reducing the incidence of hallucinations and \"confidently wrong\" answers.\n\n4. The Problem: Agentic Capabilities\n\nAgentic Behavior: I’ve improved the backend logic so that it is less passive. It is moving towards becoming an agent that can interpret the “intent” behind the search terms, not just match words.\n\nVersioning: This is the hardest nut to crack, but I've begun to organize the data to enable versioning in subsequent updates.\n\nTech Stack Recap\n\nFrontend: Apple-inspired minimalist design.\n\nUsing: BGE-M3 as text embedder\n\nBackend: Triple Failover System - 3 AI Models\n\nNew in V2: FAISS + Cross-Encoder Re-ranking + Multi-Query Retrieval. I'm still just a student and learning every day. The project is open source, and I would love it if you could tear it apart again so that I could create Version 3.

The mechanism operates in three stages: first, it computes the geometric mean to find the baseline tendency; second, it performs a Log-Odds Transformation to map the bounded probability space to the unbounded log-odds space; and third, it adds a bonus proportional to the logarithm of the number of signals.\n\nThis works because probability space is bounded by 1.0, preventing simple addition. By transforming to log-odds space, we remove this ceiling. Instead of the score shrinking to 0.49, the logic applies an additive bonus for agreeing signals, resulting in amplification where the final score becomes roughly 0.83.\n\nThis implementation is the proof that this structure is not merely a heuristic. The paper demonstrates that rigorous Bayesian inference over multiple signals produces a computational structure formally isomorphic to a feedforward neural network.\n\nThis work proves that the Sigmoid activation function is a mathematical necessity that emerges when converting Bayesian evidence into probability, rather than an arbitrary design choice. Consequently, this implementation demonstrates that a neural network is the natural structure of correct probabilistic reasoning.\n\nThe introduction of Log-Odds Conjunction has yielded measurable improvements on the SQuAD v2.0 benchmark compared to the standard Hybrid OR approach marking a +1.2% improvement.\n\nThis confirms that properly modeling the agreement between text and vector signals yields better ranking performance than simple score summation or probabilistic multiplication. I would like to extend our gratitude to Jaepil for deriving these proofs and contributing the code to bb25.",

That is an excellent question and shows you’ve read the theorem carefully.\n\nYou are correct that **Theorem 4.3.1** guarantees monotonicity (order-preservation) relative to BM25, but this holds strictly **'for a fixed prior p'**.\n\nHowever, in practice (as detailed in **Section 4.2**), we often apply a **Composite Prior** that incorporates term frequency and document length signals. Because this prior varies dynamically per document, it introduces a Bayesian re-ranking effect that can slightly alter the order compared to raw BM25.\n\nFurthermore, even if the text-only order were identical, the **non-linear sigmoid transformation** changes the *relative distribution* of scores. In a hybrid setting, this calibrated distribution interacts differently with vector scores compared to unbounded BM25 scores, which naturally leads to different (and often improved) ranking metrics.",

Here’s the **short roadmap** that finally made it click for me:\n\n**1. Start with embeddings**  \nIf you don’t understand how text becomes vectors and how similarity search works, nothing else matters.\n\n**2. Use a vector database properly**  \nStore embeddings, not raw text. Learn indexing, filtering, and why top-k retrieval isn’t magic.\n\n**3. Chunking is everything**  \nMost vague or wrong answers come from poor chunking, not the LLM. This step is underrated.\n\n**4. Retrieval > model choice**  \nA smaller model with clean, relevant context beats a larger model with noisy retrieval.\n\n**5. Treat RAG like a system, not a demo**  \nLogging, evaluation, failure cases, and feedback loops matter more than fancy prompts.\n\nThis mindset shift helped me understand why many “LLM apps” look great in demos but fall apart in real use.\n\nI wrote a **fully detailed article** breaking this down step by step   \n[https://www.loghunts.com/rag-in-ai-ml-practical-learning-roadmap](https://www.loghunts.com/rag-in-ai-ml-practical-learning-roadmap)  \nIf anything here is wrong or oversimplified, I’m very open to corrections — happy to update the article.\n\n",

The problem is, I’m not really sure how to approach that yet.\n\nHere’s what I’ve built so far:\n\nI created a RAG-based model for companies that can be integrated into their app or website. The idea is that employees or anyone interested can use it to research and ask questions about the company. The data it handles includes:\n\n* Company policies (long, formal documents)\n* HR documents (rule-based and structured)\n* FAQs (short Q&A format)\n* Financial summaries (number-heavy content)\n* Product documentation (technical text and details about previous projects)\n* CSV structured data (tabular format)\n* Website content (marketing and general information)\n\nSince I’m a second-year student, I can’t afford paid services, so I’m planning to run everything locally. Right now, I’m considering using **baai/bge-m3** for embeddings and retrieval, and **Qwen3–1.7B-MLX-8bit** for answer generation.\n\nI also have a question about deployment. I’m planning to dockerize the entire system for a live demo on my resume. If I run the LLM locally, will it still work for someone accessing it from another device? Or would they also need the model running on their own machine?\n\nI’d really appreciate any guidance or suggestions. Thanks!",

So instead of putting everything into a db you add metadata like faq vs HR vs policy. Then an agent can do something like a filtered search. Oh this question is likely about policy let me check policy specific documents. Lots of ways to execute that's just a basic example of using metadata to limit the search space and improve results. These filters are usually applied pre-re-ranker so go nuts!",

      "text": "Been working on this for a few months. The problem: evaluating RAG pipelines locally without sending data to OpenAI.\n\nRAGAS requires API keys. Giskard is heavy and crashes mid-scan (lost my progress too many times). So I built my own thing.\n\n**The main goal: keep everything on your machine.**\n\n**No data leaving your network, no external API calls, no compliance headaches. If you're working with sensitive data (healthcare, finance, legal & others) or just care about GDPR, you shouldn't have to choose between proper evaluation and data privacy.**\n\n**What it does:**\n\n\\- Retrieval metrics (precision, recall, MRR, NDCG),\n\n\\- Generation evaluation (faithfulness, relevance, hallucination detection),\n\n\\- Synthetic test set generation from your docs,\n\n\\- Checkpointing (crash? resume where you left off) ,\n\n\\- 100% local with Ollama.\n\n**v1.2 addition — LLM-as-Judge:**\n\nSomeone on [r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/) pointed out that vanilla 7B models aren't great judges. Fair point. So I integrated Prometheus 2 — a 7B model fine-tuned specifically for evaluation tasks.\n\nNot perfect, but way better than zero-shot judging with a general model.\n\nRuns on 16GB RAM with Q5 quantization (\\~5GB model). About 20-30s per evaluation on my M2.\n\n**Honest limitations:**\n\n\\- Still slower than cloud APIs (that's the tradeoff for local)\n\n\\- Prometheus 2 is conservative in scoring (tends toward 3/5 instead of 5/5),\n\n\\- Multi-hop reasoning evaluation is limited (on the roadmap)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/2501Pr0ject/RAGnarok-AI](https://github.com/2501Pr0ject/RAGnarok-AI)\n\nPyPI: pip install ragnarok-ai\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback. Built this because I needed it — hope others find it useful too.",

No— best local alternative for the moment. Is it good enough for most use cases where local matters? I'd argue yes.",

It doesn't replace Manticore, Qdrant, or any vector store. It evaluates RAG pipelines that use them.\n\nThe problem it solves: you've built a RAG with Manticore (or whatever stack):\n\n\\- How do you know it works well?   \n\\-How do you measure retrieval quality?   \n\\- How do you detect hallucinations in generated answers?\n\nThat's what it does.  \nSo it's actually complementary to tools like Manticore — you build your RAG with the stack you want, then evaluate it with RAGnarok-AI.  \nDoes that make more sense?",

                  "text": "And honestly, you raise a fair point about the \"new RAG every week\" fatigue. The space is getting crowded.\n\nBut I'd push back a bit on the framing. The issue isn't that there are too many tools — it's that too many of them lock you into paid tiers or cloud dependencies for basic functionality.\n\nLook at what happened with workflow automation: Zapier charges per task, Make charges per operation... then n8n comes along and says \"here, self-host it, own your data, no per-execution fees.\" Same capability, different philosophy.\n\nThat's kind of what I'm going for here. RAGAS is great but requires OpenAI. Giskard has an open-source version but pushes you toward their cloud. Most \"RAG evaluation\" content out there assumes you'll just send your data to GPT-4 and call it a day.\n\nIf you're a solo dev or a small team working with sensitive data, that's not always an option. Sometimes you just want to run \\`pip install something\\` and have it work on your machine, with your models, without asking permission or paying per API call.\n\nThat's the gap I'm trying to fill. Not \"yet another RAG\".\n\n  \nIl mean Look at what's happening with workflow automation: people pay for n8n for example... when they could just learn LangChain/LangGraph and build exactly what they need. Own their stack, understand how it works, no monthly fees, no vendor lock-in.\n\nMaybe the space doesn't need it, Maybe some people don't care about data sovereignty. But with GDPR enforcement ramping up, healthcare AI under scrutiny, and more companies realizing their competitive data shouldn't flow through third-party APIs — I'd bet the \"local-first\" crowd is growing, not shrinking.\n\nBut I needed it, so I built it. If others find it useful, great. If not, at least I seriously learned a ton building it.",
