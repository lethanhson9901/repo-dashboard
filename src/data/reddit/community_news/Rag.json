Here's what I've found so far:\n\n**GitHub Repos to Star:**\n- LangChain / LlamaIndex (obviously, but they've evolved a lot)\n- Ragas - for RAG evaluation metrics\n- Chroma / Weaviate / Qdrant - vector DB options with great docs\n- RAGFlow - end-to-end RAG framework\n- Haystack by deepset\n\n**AI Startups to Watch:**\n- Pinecone (vector search infrastructure)\n- Cohere (embeddings + reranking)\n- ZeroEntropy (SoTA Rerankers & Embeddings)\n- Vectara (RAG-as-a-service)\n- LlamaIndex (now a company, not just OSS)\n\n**Communities:**\n- r/RAG (obviously lol)\n- r/LocalLLaMA (great for self-hosted RAG setups)\n- LangChain Discord\n- Context Engineers Discord\n- MLOps Community\n\n**Learning Resources:**\n- LlamaIndex docs (actually really good tutorials)\n- Pinecone learning center\n- \"Building RAG Applications\" courses popping up everywhere\n\nWhat am I missing? Especially interested in:\n1. Any lesser-known GitHub repos that are actually good?\n2. New startups doing interesting RAG work?\n3. YouTube channels or podcasts focused on RAG?\n\nDrop your favorites below 👇",

The gap: when retrieval is wrong, proving what was retrieved requires more than better embeddings or reranking. You need capture of actual chunks, doc versions, timestamps.\n\nWe use similar stack (LlamaIndex, Chroma, rerankers). When Legal asks \"what docs informed this decision,\" the tools retrieved successfully but we can't verify: were chunks stale, which doc version, why these over others.\n\nResources for building RAG are plentiful. Resources for making RAG auditable are scarce. That's the actual production blocker - not accuracy, but provability.\n\nWhat resources exist for RAG evidence capture and incident replay?",

      "text": "Every few months someone declares RAG is dead and I have to update my resume again.\n\nThis time it's because **Claude Cowork** (and similar long-running agents) can \"remember\" stuff across sessions. No more context window panic. No more \"as I mentioned earlier\" when you definitely did not mention it earlier.\n\nSo naturally: \"Why do we even need RAG anymore??\"\n\nI actually dug into this and... It's not that simple (shocking, I know).\n\nBasically:\n\n* **Agent memory** = remembers what IT was doing (task state)\n* **RAG** = retrieves what THE WORLD knows (external facts)\n\nOne is your agent's personal journal. The other is the company wiki it keeps forgetting exists.\n\n**An agent** with perfect memory but no retrieval is like a coworker who remembers every meeting but never reads the docs. We've all worked with that guy.\n\n**A RAG system** with no memory is like that other coworker who reads everything but forgets what you talked about 5 minutes ago. Also that guy.\n\nTurns out the answer is: stack both. Memory for state, retrieval for facts, vector DB(Like Milvus) underneath.\n\nRAG isn't dead. It just got a roommate who leaves dishes in the sink.\n\n👉 Full breakdown here if you want the deep dive [https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md](https://milvus.io/blog/is-rag-become-outdated-now-long-running-agents-like-claude-cowork-are-emerging.md)\n\n**TL;DR:** Claude Cowork's memory is for tracking task state. RAG is for grounding the model in external knowledge. They're complementary, not competitive. We can all calm down (for now).",

Namely those that have the concerns:\n\n- Automatic retrieval of information \n- Injection of relevant information into a prompt for Autoregressive Causal Inference \n\n RAG does not mean \"embed and retrieve documents to guide an LLM at query time\"\n\nRather RAG is a broad topic of which \"embed and retrieve documents....\" is a member. \n\nKey word search is also RAG if you put the results into an LLM.\n\nRandom search is also RAG if you put the results into an LLM.\n\nHaving the system send an email to an office worker to ask for information at query time is still RAG (it's just not useful) \n\nRAG is not dead. It is a battle tested framework for designing systems. \n\nWhen people say \"RAG is dead\" to me that is a smell that tells me they've never written a line of code in their life and they are likely one of those jumped up sales people earning 250k per year for selling copilot licenses.",

If you're scraping static documentation or PDFs, tools like Docling or standard parsers work perfectly.\n\nThe specific use case FastRAG solves is Client-Side Rendered (SPA) websites. A lot of modern React/Next.js sites return empty HTML until the JavaScript runs. Standard scrapers often fail there.\n\nFastRAG uses a headless browser instance (Puppeteer) to fully hydrate the DOM before scraping, so you catch the content that only appears after JS execution. It’s overkill for simple docs, but necessary for a robust 'Chat with Any Website' SaaS.\n\n[fastrag.live](https://www.fastrag.live)",

      "text": "OpenClaw, 145k stars in 10 weeks. Everyone's talking about MCP - how agents dynamically discover tools, decide when to use them, etc.\n\nI connected a local RAG to OpenClaw via MCP. My agent now knows when to search my docs vs use its memory.\n\n**The problem:** it was searching at the right time, but bringing back garbage.\n\n**MCP solves the WHEN, not the WHAT**\n\nMCP is powerful for orchestration:\n\n* Agent discovers tools at runtime\n* Decides on its own when to invoke `query_documents` vs answer directly\n* Stateful session, shared context\n\nBut MCP doesn't care about the quality of what your tool returns. If your RAG brings back 10 chunks and 7 are noise, the agent will still use them.\n\n**MCP = intelligence on WHEN to search** **Context Engineering = intelligence on WHAT goes into the prompt**\n\nBoth need to work together.\n\n**The WHAT: reranking**\n\nMy initial setup: hybrid search (vector + BM25), top 10 chunks, straight into context.\n\nResult: agent found the right docs but cited wrong passages. Context was polluted.\n\nThe fix: **reranking**.\n\nAfter search, a model re-scores chunks by actual relevance. You keep only top 3-5.\n\nI use **ZeroEntropy**. On enterprise content (contracts, specs), it goes from \\~40% precision to \\~85%. Classic cross-encoders (ms-marco, BGE) work for generic stuff, but on technical jargon ZeroEntropy performs better.\n\n**The full flow**\n\n    User query via WhatsApp\n        ↓\n    OpenClaw decides: \"I need to search the docs\" (MCP)\n        ↓\n    My RAG tool receives the query\n        ↓\n    Hybrid search → 30 candidates\n        ↓\n    ZeroEntropy reranking → top 3\n        ↓\n    Only these 3 chunks enter the context\n        ↓\n    Precise answer with correct citations\n\nAgent is smart about WHEN to search (MCP). Reranking ensures what it brings back is relevant (Context Engineering).\n\n**Stack**\n\n* **MCP server:** custom, exposes `query_documents`\n* **Search:** hybrid vector + BM25, RRF fusion\n* **Reranking:** ZeroEntropy\n* **Vector store:** ChromaDB\n\n**Result**\n\nBefore: agent searched at the right time but answers were approximate.\n\nAfter: WhatsApp query \"gardening obligations in my lease\" → 3 sec → exact paragraph, page, quote. Accurate.\n\n**The point**\n\nMCP is one building block. Reranking is another.\n\nMost MCP + RAG setups forget reranking. The agent orchestrates well but brings back noise.\n\nContext Engineering = making sure every token entering the prompt deserves its place. Reranking is how you do that on the retrieval side.\n\nShootout to some smart folks i met on this discord server who helped me figuring out a lot of things: [Context Engineering](https://discord.gg/F9VNyJzb)",

When the agent cites wrong passage despite reranking, can you replay what was actually in those top 3 chunks?\n\nWe use reranking too. Helps accuracy but doesn't solve the debugging problem. Agent extracts wrong data, we know reranking happened, but can't verify: were those top 3 chunks stale? Did reranking score change between dev and prod? What version of the docs were retrieved?\n\nMCP orchestration plus reranking gives better answers. Still can't answer \"prove what the agent saw at 2:47am on case #4521\" because logs show reranking executed, not what content passed through.\n\nFor WhatsApp queries this works great. For production agents where Legal asks for evidence, the gap is: can you capture and verify the actual retrieved content, not just that retrieval happened?\n\nDoes your setup store the reranked chunks with timestamps for replay, or just return them to the agent?",

The \"toy\" setups like basic MCP or vanilla LangChain wrappers just fall apart the second you feed them high-density documents.\n\nIn my experience, if you aren't obsessing over the retrieval pipeline before the query even hits the LLM, you're just building a very expensive hallucination machine. A few things I’ve learned the hard way:\n\n1. **Hybrid search is the only way out.** If you rely only on vector embeddings for factual stuff (like specific dates or IDs in a 500-page report), you’re going to get \"semantic blurring.\" You need BM25 keyword matching running alongside your vectors with a tunable alpha. It’s the only way to catch those \"needle in a haystack\" moments.\n2. **Rerankers are double-edged swords.** I’ve seen Rerankers actually kill the correct result because the threshold was a hair too tight. Now I just pull a wider window (Top-K 20) and let the reranker sort the Top-5 without hard-filtering. It’s safer and much more consistent.\n3. **Small chunks > Big chunks.** We moved to 600-char chunks with a decent overlap and the \"contextual precision\" shot up. Big chunks just add too much noise and confuse the model.\n4. **Stop the \"vibe-checks.\"** You can’t tell if a RAG is good just because the answer \"sounds professional.\" I had to build a full eval pipeline to realize my \"best sounding\" model was actually making up half the citations.\n\nEnterprise RAG isn't about which LLM is smarter, it's about how much you can control the data flow.",

      "text": "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** has become the dominant paradigm for grounding large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Among RAG approaches, **vector-based retrieval**—which embeds documents and queries into a shared semantic space and retrieves the most semantically similar chunks—has emerged as the de facto standard.\n\nThis dominance is understandable: vector RAG is simple, scalable, and fits naturally into existing information-retrieval pipelines. However, as LLM systems evolve from single-turn question answering toward multi-turn, agentic, and reasoning-driven applications, the limitations of vector-based RAG are becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nMany of these limitations are well known. Others are less discussed, yet far more fundamental. This article argues that **context blindness**, the inability of vector-based retrieval to condition on full conversational and reasoning context, is the most critical limitation of vector-based RAG, and one that fundamentally constrains its role in modern LLM systems.\n\n# Commonly Discussed Limitations of Vector-Based RAG\n\n**The Limitations of Semantic Similarity**\n\nVector-based retrieval assumes that semantic similarity between a query and a passage is a reliable proxy for relevance. This assumption breaks down in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, similarity-based retrieval often misses what should be retrieved (false negatives). User queries typically express intent rather than the literal surface form of the supporting evidence, and the information that satisfies the intent is often implicit, procedural, or distributed across multiple parts of a document. As a result, truly relevant evidence may share little semantic overlap with the query and therefore fails to be retrieved by similarity search, creating a **context gap** between what the user is trying to retrieve and what similarity search can represent.\n\nSecond, similarity-based retrieval often returns what should not be retrieved (false positives). Even when retrieved passages appear highly similar to the query, similarity does not guarantee relevance, especially in domain-specific documents such as financial reports, legal contracts, and technical manuals, where many sections share near-identical language but differ in critical details such as numerical thresholds, applicability conditions, definitions, or exceptions. Vector embeddings tend to blur these distinctions, creating **context confusion**: passages that appear relevant in isolation are retrieved despite being incorrect given the actual scope, constraints, or exceptions. In professional and enterprise settings, this failure mode is particularly dangerous because it grounds confident answers in plausible but incorrect evidence.\n\n**The Limitations of Embedding Models**\n\nEmbedding models transform passages into vector representations. However, the input length limits of the embedding model force documents to be split into chunks, disrupting their structure and introducing information discontinuities. Definitions become separated from constraints, tables from explanations, and exceptions from governing rules. Although often cited as the main limitation of vector-based RAG, chunking is better viewed as a secondary consequence of deeper architectural constraints.\n\n# The Under-Discussed Core Problem: Context Blindness\n\nA core limitation of vector-based RAG that is rarely discussed is its **context blindness**: the retrieval query cannot carry the full context that led to the question. In modern LLM applications, queries are rarely standalone. They depend on prior dialogue, intermediate conclusions, implicit assumptions, operational context, and evolving user intent. Yet vector-based retrieval operates on a short, decontextualized query that must be compressed into one or more fixed-length vectors.\n\nThis compression is not incidental — it is fundamental. A vector embedding has limited representational capacity: it must collapse rich, structured reasoning context into a dense numerical representation that cannot faithfully preserve dependencies, conditionals, negations, or conversational state. As a result, vector-based retrieval is inherently **context-independent**. Documents are matched against a static semantic representation rather than the full reasoning state of the system. This creates a structural disconnect: the LLM reasons over a long, evolving context, while the vector retriever operates on a minimal, compressed, and flattened signal. In other words, **the LLM reasoner is stateful, while the vector retriever is not.** Even with prompt engineering, query expansion, multi-vector retrieval, or reranking, this mismatch persists, because the limitation lies in the representational bottleneck of vectors themselves. The vector retriever remains blind to the very context that determines what “relevant” means.\n\n# Paradigm Shift: From Context-Independent Semantic Similarity to Context-Dependent Relevance Classification\n\nThe solution to context blindness is not a better embedding model or a larger vector database, but a change in how retrieval itself is formulated. Instead of treating retrieval as a semantic similarity search performed by an external embedding model, retrieval should be framed as a **relevance classification problem** executed by an LLM that has access to the **full reasoning context**.\n\nIn this formulation, the question is no longer “Which passages are closest to this query in embedding space?”, but rather “Given everything the system knows so far—user intent, prior dialogue, assumptions, and constraints—is this piece of content relevant or not?” Relevance becomes an explicit decision conditioned on context, rather than an implicit signal derived from vector proximity.\n\nBecause modern LLMs are designed to reason over long, structured context, they are naturally well-suited to this role. Unlike embedding models, which must compress inputs into fixed-length vectors and inevitably discard structure and dependencies, LLM-based relevance classification can directly condition on the entire conversation history and intermediate reasoning steps. As a result, retrieval becomes context-aware and adapts dynamically as the user’s intent evolves.\n\nThis shift transforms retrieval from a standalone preprocessing step into part of the reasoning loop itself. Instead of operating outside the LLM stack as a static similarity lookup, retrieval becomes tightly coupled with decision-making, enabling RAG systems that scale naturally to multi-turn, agentic, and long-context settings.\n\n# Scaling Relevance Classification via Tree Search\n\nA common concern with context-dependent, relevance-classification-based retrieval is token efficiency. **Naively classifying relevance over the entire knowledge base via brute-force evaluation is token-inefficient and does not scale.** However, token inefficiency is not inherent to relevance-classification-based retrieval; it arises from flat, brute-force evaluation rather than **hierarchical classification**.\n\nIn **PageIndex**, retrieval is implemented as a **hierarchical relevance classification** over document structure (sections → pages → blocks), where relevance is evaluated top-down and entire subtrees are pruned once a high-level unit is deemed irrelevant. This transforms retrieval from exhaustive enumeration into selective exploration, focusing computation only on promising regions. The intuition resembles systems such as **AlphaGo**, which achieved efficiency not by enumerating all possible moves, but by navigating a large decision tree through learned evaluation and selective expansion. Similarly, PageIndex avoids wasting tokens on irrelevant content, enabling context-conditioned retrieval that is both more accurate and more efficient than flat vector-based RAG pipelines that depend on large candidate sets, reranking, and repeated retrieval calls.\n\n# The Future of RAG\n\nThe rise of frameworks such as **PageIndex** signals a broader shift in the AI stack. As language models become increasingly capable of planning, reasoning, and maintaining long-horizon context, the responsibility for finding relevant information is gradually **moving** **from the database layer to the model layer**.\n\nThis transition is already evident in the coding domain. Agentic tools such as **Claude Code** are moving beyond simple vector lookups toward active codebase exploration: navigating file hierarchies, inspecting symbols, following dependencies, and iteratively refining their search based on intermediate findings. Generic document retrieval is likely to follow the same trajectory. As tasks become more multi-step and context-dependent, passive similarity search increasingly gives way to structured exploration driven by reasoning.\n\nVector databases will continue to have important, well-defined use cases, such as recommendation systems and other settings, where semantic similarity **is the objective**. However, their historical role as the default retrieval layer for LLM-based systems is becoming less clear. As retrieval shifts from similarity matching to context-dependent decision-making, agentic systems increasingly demand mechanisms that can reason, adapt, and operate over structure, rather than relying solely on embedding proximity.\n\nIn this emerging paradigm, retrieval is no longer a passive lookup operation. It becomes an integral part of the model’s reasoning process: executed by the model, guided by intent, and grounded in context.",

I have a much smaller corpus but three layers of authoritative source (canonical, expert opinion, user organisation override). I got better retrieval results by splitting the parent chunks into child chunks with a small token count, and embedding those. Being smaller, a cheap encoding model can be used, and they work better with specific queries anyway. But embedding is a one time cost, and this approach uses the child chunks to find and retrieve a parent chunk so it doesn't save actual tokens when answering queries, except that perhaps it does better retrieval which is also an optimisation (my retrieval is a BM25/vectorisation hybrid which some hand-coded domain-specific assistance provided to BM25). [together.ai](http://together.ai) has a list of recommended models which do well. I allow the user to swap to kimi-2.5 which lets them paste/upload images to their prompt ... however, each user has a quota so if they do more expensive things, they exhaust their quota more quickly, which is a thinking outside the box solution, perhaps.

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m a 1st-year CSE student. I’ve been obsessing over how to run decent RAG pipelines on my consumer laptop (GTX 1650, 4GB VRAM) without relying on any cloud APIs.\n\n​I quickly realized that \"one size fits all\" doesn't work when you have limited VRAM. So I ended up building two completely different RAG architectures for my projects, and I’d love to get some feedback on them.\n\n​1. The \" HIERARCHICAL AGENTIC RAG WITH HYBRID SEARCH (VRCTOR SEARCH + KNOWLEDGE GRAPH)\" (WiredBrain)::\n\n​The Goal: Handle massive scale (693k chunks) without crashing my RAM.\n\n​The Problem: Standard HNSW indexes were too RAM-heavy and got slow as the dataset grew.\n\n​My Solution: I built a Hierarchical 3-Address Router. Instead of searching everything, it uses a lightweight classifier to route the query to a specific \"Cluster\" (Domain -> Topic -> Entity) before doing the vector search.\n\n​The Result: It cuts the search space by ~99% instantly. I’m using pgvector to keep the index on system RAM so my GPU is free for generation.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/WiredBrain-Hierarchical-Rag\n\n​2. The \"Speed Demon\" (Axiom Voice Agent)\n\n​The Goal: <400ms latency for a real-time voice assistant.\n​The Problem: Even the optimized Graph RAG was too slow for a fluid conversation.\n\n​My Solution: I built a pure JSON-based RAG. It bypasses the complex graph lookups and loads a smaller, highly specific context directly into memory for immediate \"reflex\" answers. It’s strictly for the voice agent where speed > depth.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/axiom-voice-agent",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nA few Days back, I talked about my pet project, which is a RAG-based search engine on Singaporean laws and acts (Scraping 20,000 pages/sec) with an Apple-inspired user interface.\n\nThis project is open source meaning anyone can use my backend logic but do read the license provided in the GitHub.(Star the repo if you liked it.)\n\nThe community posed some fantastic and challenging questions on answer consistency, complex multi-law queries, and hallucinations. These questions were just incredible. Rather than addressing these questions or issues with patches and fixing them superficially, I decided to revisit the code and refactor significant architectural changes.This version also includes reference to page number of the pdf while answering i have achieved that using metadata while I also building the vector database.\n\nI look forward to sharing with you Version 2.\n\nThe following are specific feedback that I received, and how I went about engineering the solutions:\n\nThe Problem: \"How do you ensure answer quality doesn't drop when the failover switches models?\"\n\nThe Feedback: My back-end has a \"Triple Failover\" system (three models, triple the backups!). I was concerned that moving from a high-end model to a backup model would change the \"answer structure\" or \"personality,\" giving a \"jarring\" effect to the user. The V2 Fix: Model-Specific System Instructions. I have no ability to alter the underlying intelligence of my backup models, so I had to normalize the output of my back-end models. I implemented a dynamic instruction set. If the back-end should fail over to Model B, I inject a specific \"system prompt\" to encourage Model B to conform to the same structure as Model A.\n\n2. The Problem: \"Single queries miss the bigger picture (e.g., 'Starting a business' involves Tax, Labor, AND Banking laws).\"\n\nThe Feedback: A simple semantic search for “starting a business” could yield the Companies Act but completely overlook the Employment Act or Income Tax Act. The V2 Fix: Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR). I decided the cost of computation for MQR was worth it. What we now do is, when you pose an open-ended question, an LLM catches the question and essentially breaks it down into sub-questions that could be “Business Registration,” “Corporate Taxation,” “Hiring Regulations,” etc. It's a more computationally intensive process, but the depth of the answer is virtually night and day from V1.\n\n3. The Problem: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out (Hallucinations)\n\nThe Feedback: If the search results contain an irrelevant document, the LLM has two choices: either hallucinate an answer or say \"I don't know.\"\nThe V2 Fix: Re-Ranking with Cross-Encoders: I decided to introduce an additional validation layer. Once the initial vector search yields the primary results, the Cross-Encoder model \"reads\" them to ensure that they're indeed relevant to the query before passing them along to the LLM. If they're irrelevant, the results are discarded immediately, greatly reducing the incidence of hallucinations and \"confidently wrong\" answers.\n\n4. The Problem: Agentic Capabilities\n\nAgentic Behavior: I’ve improved the backend logic so that it is less passive. It is moving towards becoming an agent that can interpret the “intent” behind the search terms, not just match words.\n\nVersioning: This is the hardest nut to crack, but I've begun to organize the data to enable versioning in subsequent updates.\n\nTech Stack Recap\n\nFrontend: Apple-inspired minimalist design.\n\nUsing: BGE-M3 as text embedder\n\nBackend: Triple Failover System - 3 AI Models\n\nNew in V2: FAISS + Cross-Encoder Re-ranking + Multi-Query Retrieval. I'm still just a student and learning every day. The project is open source, and I would love it if you could tear it apart again so that I could create Version 3.

You'll hit this when auditors ask \"what regulation informed this decision?\"\n\nWe use BGE-large for similar formal documents. Works well for semantic search. But when extraction is wrong, embeddings don't help you debug. Vector DB logs show query embedding, not what chunks were returned or if they were current versions.\n\nFor your use case, beyond embedding choice: how will you verify retrieved content later? Manufacturing compliance means \"prove this safety decision used regulation version X dated Y.\" Embeddings find relevant chunks, but you need to capture which chunks, from which doc version, retrieved when.\n\nPractical advice: test BGE-large vs E5-large on your actual compliance docs, not benchmarks. More important: design your RAG to store retrieval decisions (chunk IDs, doc versions, timestamps) not just return results. You'll need that evidence trail.\n\nWhat's your plan for handling doc version control when regulations update?",

There is a evaluation dashboard that shows you which embedding models perform best for certain tasks, and you should definitely use it. \n\n[https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)\n\nlately for my personal projects I have been using the Qwen .6b with their Qwen .6b reranker for the cross encoder stage and lastly the Qwen 3 Next 80B for synthesis. So far its been great!. I would also suggest you experiment with different embedding models. In my earlier years I did a lot of experimentation with embedding models, and BGE models performed well given they produced better results than the E5/GTR models, but the speed didn't come close to the MiniLM models. I have built many RAG systems in production for very long Health Care related documents, with varying complexity. Your biggest challenges will be handling the PII/PHI data, How to embed different document types, handling complex document structures, like nested tables in PDF files, image references etc, but you can use a vision model / ocr model to handle some of that. If you have questions just IM me directly, and I would be happy to help. ",

      "text": "Over the last few years, most AI conversations revolved around bigger models, benchmarks, and chatbots.\n\nBut looking ahead to 2026, the real shift isn’t just smarter LLMs — it’s how AI is actually being used in production. AI is moving from assistive software to something closer to a digital workforce.\n\nHere’s what’s standing out to me 👇\n\n1. AI is executing work, not just answering prompts\n\nEnterprises are already running AI-powered, end-to-end workflows for billing, customer support, document processing, reporting, and internal ops.\n\nThis isn’t experimentation or demos anymore — it’s workflow automation at scale.\n\n\n\n2. RAG is becoming the default architecture\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation isn’t optional if you care about accuracy, grounding, or compliance.\n\nConnecting LLMs to internal documents, databases, and vector stores significantly reduces hallucinations and makes AI usable in regulated environments.\n\n\n\n3. LLM progress is about reasoning, not raw size\n\nModel scale mattered early on, but real value now comes from context management, domain awareness, and multi-step reasoning — not just parameter count.\n\n\n\n4. AI agents are the real inflection point\n\nAgentic systems don’t just generate text — they plan, use tools, call APIs, and execute multi-step tasks across systems.\n\nLess “chatbot”, more junior employee with supervision and guardrails.\n\n\n\n5. Enterprise AI has moved into production\n\nWe’re past pilots and proofs-of-concept. Teams are measuring latency, cost, reliability, and productivity gains — and AI is starting to affect real KPIs.\n\n\n\n6. Multimodal and domain-specific models are winning\n\nText-only AI is limiting. The future is multimodal systems that understand documents, images, audio, and structured data — often fine-tuned or adapted for specific industries.\n\n7. Governance, trust, and compliance are first-class concerns\n\nAudit trails, explainability, bias mitigation, access controls, and data residency are no longer “nice to have” — they’re required for production AI.\n\n8. Edge AI is quietly becoming important\n\nOn-device and local inference unlock lower latency, better privacy, and reduced cloud costs — especially for personal and enterprise use cases.\n\nTo me, the takeaway is simple:\n\nThe AI revolution isn’t coming — it’s already operational.\n\nThe winners won’t be the ones chasing hype, but the ones building reliable, grounded, agent-driven systems that actually work.\n\nI wrote a longer breakdown here:\n\n [https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026](https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026)",

The jump from \"this works in my demo\" to \"this runs reliably for 10k users\" is where most teams hit the wall.\n\nWhat you said about measuring latency, cost, and reliability is spot on. The problem is most teams only find out their agents are brittle after users start hitting edge cases in production. By then you're firefighting instead of building.\n\nThe governance piece (point 7) ties directly into this—you can't just deploy an agent that \"mostly works\" when it's handling regulated data or making consequential decisions. You need to know how it behaves across thousands of scenarios before it touches real users.\n\nWe've been working on simulating agent workflows at scale before deployment to catch these issues early. Helps surface the difference between \"works on my machine\" and \"works in production under load with real user chaos.\"",

That’s robust to scale mismatch, but it can discard useful confidence information and flatten large gaps between documents, which matters when one signal is clearly stronger.\n\n\\## Experiments\n\n    Setup\n    - Dataset: SQuAD\n    - Metrics: NDCG@10, MRR@10\n    - Dense model: BGE-M3\n    - Compared: weighted-sum (WS) hybrid vs RRF\n    \n    Results\n    - WS (bb25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.9149, MRR@10 0.8850\n    - WS (BM25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.9051, MRR@10 0.8717\n    - RRF (BM25 + Dense): NDCG@10 0.8874, MRR@10 0.8483\n\nBayesian BM25 maps BM25 scores into calibrated probabilities using a likelihood and prior model.

In production, retrieval fails for reasons metrics don't capture: stale index, query typos, edge case queries, domain drift after model updates.\n\nWhen retrieval returns wrong documents, you need to know: which fusion method chose this, what were the raw scores, why did BM25 rank differently than dense, what would different weights have returned? Bayesian probabilities help fusion accuracy but don't help incident debugging.\n\nWe hit this with hybrid search on document intake. Metrics looked good, but specific customer queries failed mysteriously. Couldn't reconstruct why fusion chose document A over B without logging raw scores, fusion weights, and retrieval timestamps. Calibrated probabilities make fusion more principled but debugging still requires evidence capture.\n\nFor production systems: are you logging fusion decisions (raw scores, calibrated probs, final ranking) in a way that's replayable later? Or just optimizing for eval metrics?",

      "text": "[https://github.com/instructkr/bb25/pull/1](https://github.com/instructkr/bb25/pull/1)\n\nTo the Information Retrieval Community:  \nA significant update has been merged into the Bayesian BM25 (bb25) repository today!\n\nThis update addresses a fundamental flaw in hybrid search known as Conjunction Shrinkage by introducing a Log-Odds Conjunction framework.\n\nIn traditional probabilistic retrieval, calculating the probability that multiple signals are simultaneously satisfied typically relies on the Naive Product Rule.\n\nFor instance, if a document is relevant based on keyword search with a probability of 0.7 and also relevant based on vector semantic search with a probability of 0.7, the standard approach multiplies these to yield 0.49.\n\nIntuitively, however, if two independent pieces of evidence both suggest a document is relevant, our confidence should increase beyond 0.7.\n\nThe product rule causes the final score to decrease toward zero as more signals are added, violating the intuition that corroborating evidence should amplify confidence.\n\nThe solution implemented in this PR resolves this by shifting the calculation from probability space to log-odds space. The mechanism operates in three stages: first, it computes the geometric mean to find the baseline tendency; second, it performs a Log-Odds Transformation to map the bounded probability space to the unbounded log-odds space; and third, it adds a bonus proportional to the logarithm of the number of signals.\n\nThis works because probability space is bounded by 1.0, preventing simple addition. By transforming to log-odds space, we remove this ceiling. Instead of the score shrinking to 0.49, the logic applies an additive bonus for agreeing signals, resulting in amplification where the final score becomes roughly 0.83.\n\nThis implementation is the proof that this structure is not merely a heuristic. The paper demonstrates that rigorous Bayesian inference over multiple signals produces a computational structure formally isomorphic to a feedforward neural network.\n\nThis work proves that the Sigmoid activation function is a mathematical necessity that emerges when converting Bayesian evidence into probability, rather than an arbitrary design choice. Consequently, this implementation demonstrates that a neural network is the natural structure of correct probabilistic reasoning.\n\nThe introduction of Log-Odds Conjunction has yielded measurable improvements on the SQuAD v2.0 benchmark compared to the standard Hybrid OR approach marking a +1.2% improvement.\n\nThis confirms that properly modeling the agreement between text and vector signals yields better ranking performance than simple score summation or probabilistic multiplication. I would like to extend our gratitude to Jaepil for deriving these proofs and contributing the code to bb25.",

I don’t know their inner workings but I use NotebookLM as a RAG for my personal notes/documents.  The company has also given us personal RAG spaces, but they don’t work nearly as good as NotebookLM.",

The company provided one was more clinical and while it technically contains a correct response.  e.g. I asked it to explain the history and development of a requirement and it responded with the history of the previous revisions of the document.  NLM not only gave me that information but also went on to describe the backstory of the document.. Not sure if it is a backend LLM difference, ingesting/chunking, or Quantization issue but the work one is always a bit lacking.",
