From what we’ve seen in the open-source community, some people have used it for web-agent–like tasks with pretty solid results — which honestly surprised us as well.\n\nThanks again for your interest and support!",

      "text": "So i spent the last month losing my mind building a personal coding tutor agent.\n\nWhe problem:\n\nWhe goal was simple: an agent that remembers my skill level, current project, and coding style (like 'i hate list comprehensions, just give me loops'). i did the standard thing: pinecone, chunking, and a RAG pipeline\n\nIt worked for like an hour. by day 3, the agent was a complete mess. it would retrieve code snippets from a project i finished two weeks ago. or worse, i'd tell it 'im switching to rust now', and it would still pull python examples because they were 'semantically similar' to my query. its honestly such a pain.\n\nWhat i tried:\n\ni tried everything to fix this:\n\n* crammed the context window: got expensive fast, and the model got 'lost in the middle'.\n* summarization chains: tried summarizing old convos, but it lost the specific details (like WHY i chose a specific library).\n* metadata filtering: helps, but managing that manually is a nightmare.\n\nthe breakthrough:\n\ni realized i was treating memory like a static library, but human memory is dynamic. we dont remember everything with equal weight. some things need to be forgotten, some need to be merged, and some only matter when they're actually relevant.\n\nthis might sound obvious in hindsight, but i realized i wasn’t missing a better database — i was missing an operating system for memory.\n\nwhat i’m experimenting with:\n\nSo i built (and open sourced) something called MemOS.\n\nits a memory management layer that sits between your LLM and your storage. instead of just dumping text into a vector store, it treats memory with a lifecycle:\n\n* generated: raw info comes in\n* activated: relevant stuff is pulled into 'Working Memory' (RAM)\n* merged: repeated or evolving preferences get collapsed instead of duplicated.\n* activated: only stuff that actually matters *now* gets pulled into working memory.\n\nit also separates Facts (what happened) from Preferences (what i like). this was the real game changer for me. now, when i ask for a hotel recommendation, it checks my PREFERENCES (cheap, clean) and searches FACTS (hotels in the area).\n\nIm really trying to make this solid for production use, not just a toy demo\n\nthe repo is here: [https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS](https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS)\n\ndocs/cloud trial if you dont want to self-host: [https://memos-docs.openmem.net/cn](https://memos-docs.openmem.net/cn)\n\nWould love to hear how you guys are handling long-term user state vs static RAG. is anyone else trying to build an 'OS' layer for this?\n\nCheers!",

Tables, references, nested sections all get scrambled during ingestion, and you won't discover this until retrieval returns garbage.\n\nLlamaIndex and Haystack handle orchestration well enough, but they won't fix upstream problems. If your parsing mangles a critical study methodology or splits dosage information across chunks, no amount of sophisticated retrieval will recover that context. You need visibility into what your documents actually look like after processing.\n\nR2R has decent observability features, which helps with debugging retrieval issues. But the real problems usually trace back to chunking strategy and how you're handling document structure. Medical papers aren't just text blocks. They have hierarchies, cross-references, and metadata that needs to survive the processing pipeline.\n\nI've been building vectorflow.dev to tackle exactly this visibility problem, letting teams preview their processed documents before committing to a pipeline configuration. For your use case, I'd focus on getting document processing right first, then layer whichever orchestration framework fits your infrastructure constraints.\n\nWhat does your medical literature look like? PDFs with complex formatting, or cleaner structured documents?",

I tried tools like Docling, which worked okay to parse the data, but were too slow for my use case, and tended to flatten the hierarchy. Everything ended up on the same level, which killed context for citations and retrieval.\n\nI needed something which could track deep nesting like this:\n\n* \\# Article II THE MERGER\n* \\## 2.7 Effect on Capital Stock  \n* \\### (b) Statutory Rights of Appraisal  \n* \\#### (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary…\n\nAfter a bunch of tweaking, I ended up writing my own parsing + chunking logic that:\n\n* Traverses the document hierarchy tree and attaches the complete heading path to every chunk (so you can feed the full path to the LLM for precise citations)\n* Links chunks by chunk\\_id and parent\\_chunk\\_id — at inference time you can easily pull parent chunks or siblings for extra context\n* Only splits on structural boundaries, so each chunk is semantically clean and there are basically 0 mid-sentence cuts\n\nIt worked really well for my project, so I wrapped it in a small frontend and published it as DocSlicer.\n\nTry it here: [https://www.docslicer.ai/](https://www.docslicer.ai/)\n\nJust drop in a PDF or URL, no sign-up needed. Export to json or parquet.\n\nIt's still early and I'm actively improving it, but it already works nicely for long financial or legal docs.

Majorly, it involves reading financial documents(more specifically, DCF models, MIS in Excel).\n\n\n\n\n\nI am using the Claude/GPT 5.1 models for my extraction agent (LLMS running in a Loop) and have in place chunking and indexing with Azure OCR and Azure Search (which provide indexing and searching).\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, PDF extraction is working better, but with Excel I am facing many issues where LLMs mix data, such as saying data is for FY21 when it is for FY22(after getting the chunk data) or not able to find the exact related chunks.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that, in Excel, it is very number-heavy (like a 100\\* 50 type table). Also, structurally, it is a finance document and is created by different individuals, so I really do not control the structures, so lots of spaces or themes, so it is really not like CSV, where columns and rows are well defined.\n\n\n\nMajor Problem:\n\n1. By chunking the data, it loses a lot of context, like headers or information is missing if a single table is divided into multiple chunks, and hence, the context is missing, like what that column is like, the year, and the type.\n\n2. If I keep the table big, it is not going to fit sometimes in context as well.\n\n\n\n3. Also, as these tables are mostly number-heavy, creating chunks really does not make sense much (based on my understanding, as in vector embedding, the number itself does not have much context with text).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease suggest if someone has worked with Excel and what has helped them to get the data in the best possible way.",

      "text": "Hey guys! I am new to the world of knowledge graphs and RAGs, and am very interested in exploring it!\n\n  \nI am currently looking at using property graphs (neo4j to be specific) as the 'knowledge base' for RAG implementations since I've read that they're more powerful than the alternative of RDFs\n\n  \nWhat confuses me is about how one should go about generating the knowledge graph in the first place. neo4j's own blog and various others propose using LLMs to extract the data for you, and construct a JSON/csv-esque format which is then ingested to create the knowledge graph\n\n  \nExcept it feels like I am poisoning the well here so to speak? If I have tons of text-based documents as my corpora, won't using LLMs to do the job of data extraction and graph generation have issues?\n\nOff the top of my head, I can think of the following issues:\n\n1) The LLM could generate duplicates of entities across documents/chunks (For example, the word \"White House\" is present in a bunch of various documents in various levels of described detail? The LLM could very well extract out multiple such 'White House' entities\n\nI did have an idea of pre-defining all entity types and relations and forcing he LLM to stick with that, as well do an NLP-based deduplication technique, though I am not sure if it'll work well\n\n  \n2) The LLM could just up and hallucinate up data. Bad for obvious reasons, since I don't want a garbage in = garbage out problem for the resultant rag\n\n  \n3) It could just generate wonky results with incorrect 'syntax'. Bad for obvious reasons\n\n  \n4) Manually extracting data and writing the appropriate CYPHER queries? Yeah, won't work out feasibly\n\n5) Using an NLP-based entity and relation extractor? Faster and cheaper compute-wise, but the duplication issue still remains. It does solve issue 3)\n\nWith all these issues comes the extra issue of validating the output graph. Feels like I'm biting off more than I can chew, since all of this is VERY hard to pack into a pipeline unless I make my own bespoke one for the domain I am focusing on. Is there a better way of doing things?",

          "text": "Knowledge graphs definitely aren't for the faint of heart. The reason everyone recommends using llms to generate the graph is because the alternatives involve significantly more effort. Stanford maintains the CoreNLP library which you can use and is deterministic so no hallucination risk. It's very easy to try out and once you see it's default hot mess you'll see why people risk it with llms.  \n  \nNowadays the risk of improper extraction is fairly low with the llm but the cost is obviously very high. For many RAG setups retrieval corpus's are large and queries are sparse. This can mean you are paying to have a llm generate a mostly unused graph which can hurt at scale.  \n[](https://alb.reddit.com/cr?za=ierAezmqakjkPaVDWKzCA3tCEIV4aCCC0bCRBCF5670AiSndpd2SMNGrxPD7pIs6QF_4_YGz223SK1eDI9NQaF3Bknih3JiBtO6-hq5KNJJm-M01GGJkGTYSSFvK9a--Ar68SJTzwWNl4P85wKLFZdf16OlAlcuEW3bQ8uXOYDazxjJfRvbl32NUYNgzANollM-JxDrxA9w5Y12eNTUmO27Ryo87KWbIfQIfJGpcpepJNJAFeDTsF2g3zJADNX9DoiMdVapRNgCzoQJ7qVHCxGrTGszYBwTzOhewPPUg97EFuriNOiSlKB8mgqfSm7Y6VBddMqH2m3j8H5TviyJQqm9pkBWo1-bQzRQvzseTDrb640e94Gk5GLcfiwM2rq0HtTVmaCwYyVGZ3xCSnsAe9uGOTYk9_rGGRR-AacQb5Mt_CAbs4yf7K4tOwLzW0Gf54Qf2tO_sJQF39wH8Ze8qdBof95qtUiZTkvswn5SQCJ_mUXzAHEUmOh-XA2Sl598ax2cyd-oM1T3oPMMf7m85Q99cXlzhY_Fp23SrxgpqwblimxUIWyD84KxrrgRU2ZpYBN3gxww2U4FwY6Rij4hIWQ7s-xTHsBcaSUSThgeUcd4XuZj5OATt&zp=EhBBaNqSZnW-BP4gOIznz82pQlrRYlfvaCNcyBIhs7wTVfWQDkGmlXivkNxEMtVXgXrymn3Wp2-145A4MY8bevLzVp1T2C9RxQn5ZonalUJpLtqYJENT7XBECPofmqZoSYN6dRcQs05mbKpeONZg3gNhIuibc7o_A9zb46C_7iccXXMOH2yC0cwG6bnT-efJDN_tqMYjKd2etZfrO3Y8GCROkZrxPUnmC--M3iUkc79mq0cOkoRo2W8LVfPMGq6mhq1oAyQ_hbSV6sOcq946_PtUYjPmN3kr4meSycYg_NXUQQfmxr99tsjBBv25tnzoWhw3hJHyQf_N6XQMXqpOhRCRm55i8xSv3PhZYuijg7qfIfRZ5LPyr2gvl21sBitjPlEmA2UuICjDB7Kypxrts7lNzRc-eCtDEuPDpGBHV3KpsXB30tBvlbVpNyhx2uMiFpeS4c3pn-Dii9nkkcviACMwawKXj0mue16rI3_gKxMWYnnStQ&a=598359&b=565262&be=383828&c=382514&d=568613&e=378211&ea=379178&eb=353934&f=352953&r=10&g=1&i=1768835127842&t=1768835729084&o=1&q=1&h=212&w=732&sh=864&sw=1536)  \nYou also identified the other issue which is canonicalization.

The problem is even a small typo without post processing will faultily create a new node.   \n  \nIf you really want knowledge graph like quality without all the extra hassle then knowledge graph embeddings are a great place to look.",

CIE closed information extraction models take a predefined schema + set of relationships and reliably pull what you need at much lower cost than an llm. For example Gliner2, UIE, REBEL(ish) can likely do the job cleanly without the coreNLP noise. You have some options.",

Native support for everything I need matters more, so the next step will be migrating to Weaviate and testing it in real use.\n\nAt the same time I will keep FAISS as a nice option for people who want to run the project quickly without setting up a container and configuring Weaviate.\n\nSo Weaviate — **if someone thinks this is a mistake, please let me know** 🙂",

The system needs to support:\n\n* Keyword search\n* Vector similarity search (embeddings)\n* Filtering on metadata (jurisdiction, document type, status, etc.)\n* Reasonable relevance out of the box (I’d rather not hand-roll ranking logic)\n\nThe content itself is mostly static (guides and reference documents), and traffic is currently low since this is still early days  - but the search quality matters because it feeds into an LLM for AI-assisted answers.\n\n# What we’ve implemented so far\n\n* Elasticsearch as the search layer\n* Hybrid search (keyword + vector)\n* Semantic-style retrieval for RAG workflows\n* Minimal custom scoring or tuning - mostly relying on built-in capabilities\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Elasticsearch works well. From a **cost perspective**, it feels hard to justify right now.\n\n# The problem\n\nEven at low usage, the baseline pricing and add-ons start to add up quickly. I’m trying to keep infrastructure spend sensible until there’s clearer traction, without completely downgrading search quality.\n\n# What I’m hoping to find\n\n* A more startup-friendly alternative to Elasticsearch\n* Supports keyword + vector search (or a realistic hybrid approach)\n* Can handle filters and structured metadata cleanly\n* Prefer managed or low-ops solutions\n* Not looking to fully custom-build a search engine unless there’s a strong reason\n\nIf you’ve built something similar (hybrid search feeding LLMs) and had to balance cost vs relevance, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I do **not** need passage retrieval, summaries, or generated answers. Once I get the article ID, I fetch the full article from my primary database.\n\nEach article represents a single topic (e.g. driver’s license, banking, immigration, housing) and is scoped by metadata such as city, state, language, and immigration status (country-wide content).\n\nTypical article titles look like:\n\n* *Using Your Driver’s Licence in {some city}*\n* *Senior Support Services in {some city} for Citizens*\n* *Financial Help for Refugee Claimants in {some state}*\n\nTypical user queries look like:\n\n* “drivers license in {some city}”\n* “how to open bank account”\n* “documents to become student”\n\nI’m currently deciding **what exactly should be embedded** in the vector database:\n\n**Option A:** Embed only the article **title**  \n**Option B:** Embed the **title + structured metadata** (city, state, status)  \n**Option C:** Embed the **full article text + metadata**\n\nKey constraints:\n\n* This is **pure semantic search**, not RAG\n* One result should map to **one article ID**\n* Articles are authoritative and static\n* Precision matters more than generating answers\n* Queries are often short and loosely phrased\n\nI’d love to hear:\n\n* What tends to work best in practice for this kind of lookup?\n* Is embedding full article content overkill if I only need ID-level retrieval?\n* Are there proven patterns for “semantic title search” with metadata?\n* Any gotchas with similarity thresholds or false positives?\n\nI have around 55k articles in total.\n\nThanks!",

In my project, topics are a lot fuzzier. Since you have precise metadata, I’d try hard filtering results with a basic keyword search between the query and your metadata fields. Inserting them into your article before embedding *might* help find the correct article, but it will not prevent finding the wrong one. \n\nIn my experience, reranking is essential. You’ll have to do the math on cost here though. Something like Zerank-2 is on the affordable end of the spectrum but still performs very well as far as I can see. It costs $0.025 per million tokens. So if passing 10 full 1.5K token articles to be reranked is an acceptable cost to you, then you’re good to go. If you need to cut costs, then you could see about chunking down so that the reranker needs to see less text. Zerank-2 can be run locally, so you can test all you want before setting up a paid API.\n\nI think a quick and cheap first test for you would be to embed each article as a whole with the title and everything. On query, filter by your metadata fields and then retrieve by vector search and BM25. Combine with RRF and then rerank the top 10 and see how that works for you. \n\nBefore sending stuff to the reranker, you could even prioritize that metadata by including it and the article title inside <context> … </context> tags at the beginning if you’re using Zerank-2. It’s also instruction following, so you could experiment with  instructions like “Prioritize geographical relevance” or something like that. \n\nOn second thought, if you do end up chunking, absolutely include the relevant metadata and article title at the beginning of each chunk before embedding. Anthropic calls this contextual chunking and it might help a lot to improve both precision and recall since I suspect you’ll have a lot of cases where individual chunks look relevant but might not restate the location the parent article is about. You could even look into Late Chunking, but that’s a whole other ball of wax. \n\nJust start with a simple vector + bm25 search and reranking and metadata filtering and see how that works for you\n\nEDIT: I promise Zerank isn’t paying me lol. It’s just that new API rerankers that are also available open source are hard to find",
