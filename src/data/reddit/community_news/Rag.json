      "text": "RAG is not dead.  \n  \nThe context window ceiling is real. Context rot is real.  \nClaude, GPT-4.1, Gemini — all sitting at 1M tokens. Impressive on a slide. Less impressive in production. Research shows that performance degrades as context grows and this effect becomes significant beyond 100k tokens \\[[Context Rot: How Increasing Input Tokens Impacts LLM Performance, Hong, Troynikov & Huber, Chroma, 2025](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)\\]  \nI've felt this firsthand. Context rot in my own applications at just 40–50k tokens. The ceiling isn't 1M. It's far lower.  \nMeanwhile, enterprise knowledge bases contain billions of tokens. The math doesn't work. You will never stuff your way to an answer.  \n  \nAgents aren't a silver bullet either.  \nProgressive disclosure lets agents traverse massive codebases and document sets, but every hop is a lossy compression. Information degrades. Reasoning quality drops. The growing wave of agentic workflows is itself a signal: frontier model improvements are slowing. The delta between model generations is shrinking. Future gains will come from agentic engineering around models, not from the models themselves.  \nSo if today's LLMs are roughly as good as it gets, how do you leverage massive knowledge bases? RAG. Still.  \nNot the naive RAG of 2023. Smarter retrieval. Better chunking. Hybrid search. Context engineering. Agentic. But the core idea of RAG is more important now than ever. Retrieve what's relevant, discard what isn't.  \n  \nRAG isn't a workaround. It's a non-trivial part of the architecture.",

          "text": "I have said it before, and I will say it again, learn the process. I swear 80% of the posts in this community are either self promotions/ selling opensource architecture as something new or novel, or not understanding what makes a good Rag. This post is another example, and you might be doing your company a disservice, and should probably hire someone who knows what they are doing.\n\n\"But the answers are shit, Not sure why....\" really? you would think we would have tools / math to answer your question, and you would be right. Look up what precision / recall / MRR / NDCG, and Recall@k / cosine similarity mean\n\nFirst understand which embeddings are good for which tasks. Confused? use this. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)\n\nThen learn some basic math, understand mathematical distances, there are many, some work well on normalized embeddings, and some don't. Most embeddings are normalized these days so by default they use cosine similarity. confused? read this. [https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05440v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05440v1), or any calculus/ linear algebra book and search cosine similarity.\n\nNext understand clustering, and search spaces. Understand what HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is and how it works, what are the parameters and how they effect your search space. Read about (M, ef\\_construction, ef\\_search). This has a huge impact on your result quality\n\nbi-encoder / cross-encoders? if you don't know these terms, time to learn them. confused? read this [https://sbert.net/examples/cross\\_encoder/applications/README.html](https://sbert.net/examples/cross_encoder/applications/README.html)\n\nunderstand how FAISS works, and understand how different vector databases work, do you know what makes weaviate different from azure search vs qdrant vs milvus? if not time to learn that. In some cases there are significant differences that can impact your search results.\n\nAll of these things will answer why your answers are shit.\n\nNext before you embed anything you have to have a good ingestion pipeline. While its true that your pdfs are getting ingested into the RAG, do you understanding how your ingestion happens? If not, you should understand that process. RAG is not a dumping exercise, its a science and an art. PDFs can be very complex, they have images, tables, nested structures, broken/ malformed pdfs, how do you handle all that? I can guarantee you there is not a single best approach that can handle pdfs, you need to make sure that you have multiple ways to extract/ parse your pdf data, if these terms don't make sense to you, you need to understand them - (OCR, Vision Models, JSON structure, chunking, overlapping, chunk strategy, markdown). confused? read this [https://www.docling.ai/](https://www.docling.ai/)  \n[https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document\\_loaders](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders)  \nor you can build your own from scratch.\n\nre-ranking stage, if you don't know what a re-ranker is then you should learn that too. check the sbert link I posted above, you can also build it from scratch if you are inclined to do so. It is also OK to build this stage with an LLM based re-ranker, provided that you have some examples that your LLM can learn from or train an LLM from scratch for this task.\n\nNext understanding what your rag actually needs, instead of dumping vectors, understand if your rag needs vector search / semantic search / keyword search / BM25 / Metadata filtering / KG etc., or a combination of all.\n\n**Extra credit:** you get extra credit if you figure out how to reduce prompt injections/ hijacking from nefarious users, which can further impact retrieval quality. Wait till you find that a pdf can contain nefarious instructions that get passed to your LLM at synthesis stage, or users trying embedding space manipulation with their search queries. Maybe add query rewriting? (there are many ways to do it, and your document can itself reword the query to add more relevancy to the search query) \n\nOnce you have all these pieces then tell us how your rag performed, and what you found.\n\nLastly do you understand your data quality, and data structure. (this should also be the first thing you do, and the reason why I didn't mention it earlier is because I assume that you are doing due diligence and at least have trust in your data quality, it would be highly unlikely that you are asking questions about \"how to make a good rag\" from your company documents when your company documents talk about company finances. I honestly think your company needs to a hire a person who does this for a living, and understands how RAG systems work at scale / production level, don't just wing it, and then not understanding why it gives you poor results. This type of negligence puts AI and researchers in a bad light.",

Just doing simple character based chunking is not enough for many projects. It really does depend on what you are trying to do: \n\nExample: if you embed all Epstein files and ask for the names of everybody in there, you won't get any good responses. \"What are the names of people here\", when converted to embeddings will not make any useful matches.\n\nI had a project where the best option was to 'summarize' not chunk. For investigative journalism.\n\nAnother project, where only entity extraction/graph RAG would do it.  (like in the Epstein example).\n\nin some cases, you get lucky which agentic RAG and offering some tools, not just vector search. \n\nIf you share more about what you are building, I can give you some tips. Specially: what type of content are you ingesting and what type of question are people most likely to ask. \n\nCheers",

Print out 10 chunks and read them yourself. If you see page numbers in the middle of sentences, or section references that got split from their content, that's your problem right there. No amount of model tuning fixes bad source data.\n\nFor legal docs specifically, keeping the section hierarchy intact during extraction makes a huge difference.

If a clause or an \"if/then\" condition is split in half, the LLM loses the logic. Are you using a simple splitter or a recursive one?\n\nMetadata vs. Pure Vector: For legal stuff, simple semantic search is too \"fuzzy.\" I found that I had to extract metadata (dates, entities, specific article numbers) first and use them to \"anchor\" the search. Without structured metadata, the LLM starts hallucinating connections that aren't there.\n\nContext Injection: Legal files should be treated as the \"Ground Truth.\" I had to tweak my prompt and retrieval to make sure the legal guidance acts as a hard constraint for the project files.\n\nTo give you a hand, what are your current parameters?\n\nWhat Chunk Size and Overlap are you using?

      "text": "Some helpful insights from one of our senior software engineers, Muhammad Imtiaz.\n\n# Introduction\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a paradigm shift in how artificial intelligence systems access and utilize information. By combining the generative capabilities of large language models with dynamic information retrieval from external knowledge bases, RAG systems overcome the fundamental limitations of standalone language models—namely, their reliance on static training data and tendency toward hallucination.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive technical reference covering the essential concepts, components, and implementation patterns that form the foundation of modern RAG architectures. Each concept is presented with clear explanations, practical code examples in Go, and real-world considerations for building production-grade systems.\n\nWhether you are architecting a new RAG system, optimizing an existing implementation, or seeking to understand the theoretical underpinnings of retrieval-augmented approaches, this reference provides the knowledge necessary to build accurate, efficient, and trustworthy AI applications. The concepts range from fundamental building blocks like embeddings and vector databases to advanced techniques such as hybrid search, re-ranking, and agentic RAG architectures.\n\nAs the field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, RAG remains at the forefront of practical AI deployment, enabling systems that are both powerful and grounded in verifiable information.\n\n# Core Concepts and Implementation Patterns\n\n**Generator (Language Model)**\n\nThe component that generates the final answer using the retrieved context.\n\n**Retrieval**\n\nRetrieval is the process of identifying and extracting relevant information from a knowledge base before generating a response. It acts as the AI’s research phase, gathering necessary context from available documents before answering.\n\nRather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, retrieval enables the AI to access up-to-date, domain-specific information from documents, databases, or other knowledge sources.\n\nIn the example below, the retriever selects the top five most relevant documents and provides them to the LLM to generate the final answer.\n\n`relevantDocs := vectorDB.Search(query, 5) // top_k=5`  \n`answer := llm.Generate(query, relevantDocs)`\n\n**Embeddings**\n\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They convert words, sentences, or documents into dense vectors that preserve context and relationships.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to generate embeddings using the OpenAI API.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"context\"`  \n`\"github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`client := openai.NewClient(\"your-token\")`  \n`resp, err := client.CreateEmbeddings(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`openai.EmbeddingRequest{`  \n`Input: []string{\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\"},`  \n`Model: openai.SmallEmbedding3,`  \n`},`  \n`)`  \n`if err != nil {`  \n`log.Fatal(err)`  \n`}`  \n`vector := resp.Data[0].Embedding`\n\n# Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are specialized systems designed to store and query high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matches, they use distance metrics to identify semantically similar content.\n\nThey support fast similarity searches across millions of documents in milliseconds, making them essential for scalable RAG systems.\n\nThe example below shows how to create a collection and add documents with embeddings using the Chroma client.\n\n`import \"github.com/chroma-core/chroma-go\"`  \n  \n`client := chroma.NewClient()`  \n`collection, _ := client.CreateCollection(\"docs\")`  \n  \n`// Generate embeddings for documents`  \n`docs := []string{\"RAG improves accuracy\", \"LLMs can hallucinate\"}`  \n`emb1 := embedder.Embed(docs[0])`  \n`emb2 := embedder.Embed(docs[1])`  \n  \n`// Add documents with their embeddings`  \n`collection.Add(`  \n`context.Background(),`  \n`chroma.WithIDs([]string{\"doc1\", \"doc2\"}),`  \n`chroma.WithEmbeddings([][]float32{emb1, emb2}),`  \n`chroma.WithDocuments(docs),`  \n`)`\n\n# Retriever\n\nA retriever is a component that manages the retrieval process. It converts a user query into an embedding, searches the vector database, and returns the most relevant document chunks.\n\nIt functions like a smart librarian, understanding the query and locating the most relevant information within a large collection.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic retriever implementation.\n\n`type Retriever struct {`  \n`VectorDB VectorDB`  \n`}`  \n  \n`func (r *Retriever) Retrieve(query string, topK int) []Result {`  \n`queryVector := Embed(query)`  \n`return r.VectorDB.Search(queryVector, topK)`  \n`}`\n\n# Chunking\n\nChunking is the process of dividing large documents into smaller, manageable segments called “chunks.” Effective chunking preserves semantic meaning while ensuring content fits within model context limits.\n\nProper chunking is essential, as it directly affects retrieval quality. Well-structured chunks improve precision and support more accurate responses.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a character-based chunking function with overlap support.\n\n`func ChunkText(text string, chunkSize, overlap int) []string {`  \n`var chunks []string`  \n`runes := []rune(text)`  \n`for start := 0; start < len(runes); start += (chunkSize - overlap) {`  \n`end := start + chunkSize`  \n`if end > len(runes) {`  \n`end = len(runes)`  \n`}`  \n`chunks = append(chunks, string(runes[start:end]))`  \n  \n`if end >= len(runes) {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n`return chunks`  \n`}`  \n  \n`chunks := ChunkText(document, 500, 50)`\n\n# Context Window\n\nThe context window is the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) an LLM can process in a single request. It defines the model’s working memory and the amount of context that can be included.\n\nContext windows range from 4K tokens in older models to over 200K in modern ones. Retrieved chunks must fit within this limit, making chunk size and selection critical.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how to fit chunks within a token limit.\n\n`func FitContext(chunks []string, maxTokens int) []string {`  \n`var context []string`  \n`tokenCount := 0`  \n  \n`for _, chunk := range chunks {`  \n`chunkTokens := CountTokens(chunk)`  \n`if tokenCount + chunkTokens > maxTokens {`  \n`break`  \n`}`  \n`context = append(context, chunk)`  \n`tokenCount += chunkTokens`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return context`  \n`}`\n\n# Grounding\n\nGrounding ensures AI responses are based on retrieved, verifiable sources rather than hallucinated information. It keeps the model anchored to real data.\n\nEffective grounding requires citing specific sources and relying only on the provided context to support claims. This reduces hallucinations and improves trustworthiness.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a grounding prompt template.\n\n`prompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Answer the question using ONLY the provided context.`  \n`Cite the source for each claim.`  \n`Context: %s`  \n  \n`Question: %s`  \n  \n`Answer with citations:`  \n`\\`, retrievedDocs, userQuestion)`  \n  \n`response := llm.Generate(prompt)`\n\n# Re-Ranking\n\nTwo-stage retrieval enhances result quality by combining speed and precision. First, a fast initial search retrieves many candidates (e.g., top 100). Then, a more accurate cross-encoder model re-ranks them to identify the best matches.\n\nThis approach pairs broad retrieval with fine-grained scoring for optimal results.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic re-ranking workflow.\n\n`// Initial fast retrieval`  \n`candidates := retriever.Search(query, 100)`  \n  \n`// Re-rank using a CrossEncoder`  \n`scores := reranker.Predict(query, candidates)`  \n  \n`// Sort candidates by score and take top 5`  \n`topDocs := SortByScore(candidates, scores)[:5]`\n\n# Hybrid Search\n\nHybrid search combines keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search. It leverages both exact term matching and meaning-based similarity to improve retrieval accuracy.\n\nBy blending keyword and semantic scores, it provides the precision of exact matches along with the flexibility of understanding conceptual queries.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a hybrid search implementation.\n\n`func HybridSearch(query string, alpha float64) []Result {`  \n`keywordResults := BM25Search(query)`  \n`semanticResults := VectorSearch(query)`  \n  \n`// Combine scores:`  \n`// finalScore = alpha * keywordScore + (1-alpha) * semanticScore`  \n`finalResults := CombineAndRank(keywordResults, semanticResults, alpha)`  \n  \n`return finalResults[:5]`  \n`}`\n\n# Metadata Filtering\n\nMetadata filtering narrows search results by using document attributes such as dates, authors, types, or departments before performing a semantic search. This reduces noise and improves precision.\n\nApplying filters like author: John Doe or document\\_type: report focuses the search on the most relevant documents.\n\nThe example below demonstrates metadata filtering in a vector database query.\n\n`results := collection.Query(`  \n`Query{`  \n`Texts: []string{\"quarterly revenue\"},`  \n`TopK: 10,`  \n`Where: map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"year\":       2024,`  \n`\"department\": \"sales\",`  \n`\"type\": map[string]interface{}{`  \n`\"$in\": []string{\"report\", \"presentation\"},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`},`  \n`)`\n\n# Similarity Search\n\nThe retriever is the core search mechanism in RAG, identifying documents whose embeddings are most similar to a query’s embedding. It evaluates semantic closeness rather than just keyword matches.\n\nSimilarity is typically measured using cosine similarity (angle between vectors) or dot product, with higher scores indicating more relevant content.\n\nThe example below demonstrates cosine similarity using the Gonum library.\n\n`import (`  \n`\"gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat\"`  \n`)`  \n  \n`func CosineSimilarity(vec1, vec2 []float64) float64 {`  \n`v1 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec1), vec1)`  \n`v2 := mat.NewVecDense(len(vec2), vec2)`  \n  \n`dotProduct := mat.Dot(v1, v2)`  \n`norm1 := mat.Norm(v1, 2)`  \n`norm2 := mat.Norm(v2, 2)`  \n  \n`return dotProduct / (norm1 * norm2)`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Usage example`  \n`queryVec := Embed(query)`  \n`for _, docVec := range documentVectors {`  \n`score := CosineSimilarity(queryVec, docVec)`  \n`// Store score for ranking`  \n`}`\n\n# Prompt Injection\n\nPrompt injection is a security vulnerability where malicious users embed instructions in queries to manipulate AI behavior. Attackers may attempt to override system prompts or extract sensitive information.\n\nCommon examples include phrases like “ignore previous instructions” or “reveal your system prompt.” RAG systems must sanitize inputs to prevent such attacks.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a basic input sanitization function. In production, multiple defenses—such as regex patterns, semantic similarity checks, and output validation—are required.\n\n`func SanitizeInput(userInput string) (string, error) {`  \n`// Basic pattern matching - extend with regex for production use`  \n`dangerousPatterns := []string{`  \n`\"ignore previous instructions\",`  \n`\"disregard system prompt\",`  \n`\"reveal your instructions\",`  \n`\"ignore all prior\",`  \n`\"bypass security\",`  \n`}`  \n  \n`lowerInput := strings.ToLower(userInput)`  \n`for _, pattern := range dangerousPatterns {`  \n`if strings.Contains(lowerInput, pattern) {`  \n`return \"\", errors.New(\"invalid input detected\")`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Additional checks for production:`  \n`// - Regex for obfuscated patterns (e.g., \"ign0re\")`  \n`// - Semantic similarity to known attack phrases`  \n`// - Length and character validation`  \n  \n`return userInput, nil`  \n`}`\n\n# Hallucination\n\nGenerative AI can produce convincing but incorrect information, including false facts, fake citations, or invented details.\n\nRAG helps reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents, though proper grounding and citation are essential to minimize risk.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a verification function that checks whether a response is supported by source documents. For higher reliability, consider using Natural Language Inference  models or extractive fact-checking, as relying on one LLM to verify another has limitations.\n\n`func IsSupported(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`verificationPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(\\``  \n`Response: %s`  \n`Source: %s`  \n  \n`Is this response fully supported by the source documents?`  \n`Answer yes or no.`  \n`\\`, response, sourceDocs)`  \n  \n`result := llm.Generate(verificationPrompt)`  \n`return strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(result)) == \"yes\"`  \n`}`  \n  \n`// Alternative: Use NLI model for more reliable verification`  \n`func IsSupportedNLI(response, sourceDocs string) bool {`  \n`// NLI models classify as: entailment, contradiction, or neutral`  \n`result := nliModel.Predict(sourceDocs, response)`  \n`return result.Label == \"entailment\" && result.Score > 0.8`  \n`}`\n\n# Agentic RAG\n\nAgentic RAG is an advanced architecture where the AI actively plans, reasons, and controls its own retrieval strategy. Rather than performing a single search, the agent can conduct multiple searches, analyze results, and iterate.\n\nIt autonomously decides what information to retrieve, when to search again, which tools to use, and how to synthesize multiple sources—enabling complex, multi-step reasoning.\n\nThe example below demonstrates an agentic RAG implementation.\n\n`func (a *AgenticRAG) Answer(query string) string {`  \n`plan := a.llm.CreatePlan(query)`  \n  \n`for _, step := range plan.Steps {`  \n`switch step.Action {`  \n`case \"search\":`  \n`results := a.retriever.Search(step.Query)`  \n`a.context.Add(results)`  \n`case \"reason\":`  \n`analysis := a.llm.Analyze(a.context)`  \n`a.context.Add(analysis)`  \n`}`  \n`}`  \n  \n`return a.llm.Synthesize(a.context)`  \n`}`\n\n# Latency\n\nRAG latency is the total time from a user query to the final response, including embedding generation, vector search, re-ranking (if used), and LLM generation. Each step contributes to the delay.\n\nLatency directly impacts user experience and can be optimized by caching embeddings, using faster models, narrowing search scope, and parallelizing operations. Typical RAG systems aim for sub-second to a few seconds of latency.\n\nThe example below measures latency for each stage of the RAG pipeline.\n\n`import \"time\"`  \n  \n`func MeasureLatency(query string) {`  \n`start := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 1: Embed query`  \n`embedding := Embed(query)`  \n`t1 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 2: Search`  \n`results := vectorDB.Search(embedding)`  \n`t2 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`// Step 3: Generate`  \n`response := llm.Generate(query, results)`  \n`t3 := time.Now()`  \n  \n`fmt.Printf(\"Embed: %v | Search: %v | Generate: %v\\n\",`  \n`t1.Sub(start), t2.Sub(t1), t3.Sub(t2))`  \n`}`\n\n  \nHope this all helps!",

This feature exists largely because people were clear about what wasn’t working and what would actually make the product useful.\n\nStill early, but it’s moving in a much more practical direction.\n\nIf you deal with document-heavy workflows and care about reliable, structured outputs.

Extraction runs as an agentic workflow where retrieval, validation, and re-checks happen iteratively based on schema needs. So that helps a little.\n\nSchema drift is handled by keeping schemas intent-based rather than layout-dependent. Missing or ambiguous fields are allowed instead of forcing guesses. Multi-table PDFs are handled as independent units. Cross-page references are resolved by expanding retrieval when required. But still,  no matter how robust we make it, there're always some outlier PDFs which don't properly fit into this. \n\nOCR is supported for scanned PDFs and images and works well, with quality depending on input. OCR noise reduction is a problem we're focusing on now. I'm trying to involve LLMs as little as possible to make this more robust and generalised and to reduce token usage ofcourse. Also actively working on improving OCR for handwritten documents. Many teams asked specifically if they can use this on legacy handwritten documents, especially in the manufacturing domain.",

In addition to the Rust-based implementation, the paper's author shipped his own implementation. Comparing the two taught me more than the paper itself.\n\nThe Bayesian BM25 paper does something elegant, in that applying Bayes' theorem to BM25 scores so they become real probabilities, not arbitrary numbers. This makes hybrid search fusion mathematically principled instead of heuristic.\n\nInstruct.KR's bb25 took a ground-up approach, tokenizer, inverted index, scorers, 10 experiments mapping to the paper's theorems, plus a Rust port. Jaepil's implementation took the opposite path, a thin NumPy layer that plugs into existing search systems.\n\nReading both codebases side by side, I found my document length prior has room to improvement (e.g. monotonic decay instead of symmetric bell curve), my probability AND suffered from shrinkage, and I further added automatic parameter estimation and online learning entirely.\n\nbb25 v0.2.0 introduces all four. One fun discovery along the way, my Rust code already had the correct log-odds conjunction, but I had never backported it to Python. Same project, two different AND operations.\n\nThe deeper surprise came from a formula in the reference material. Expand the Bayesian posterior and you get the structure of an artificial neuron! Think of weighted sum, bias, sigmoid activation. Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, Attention all have Bayesian derivations. A 50-year-old search algorithm leads straight to the mathematical roots of neural networks.\n\nAll creds to Jaepil and Cognica Team!",

However, there is no API for retrieving our specific data set, only an online service. We had to scrape a sufficient data set. Technically, we solved that challenge, but the terms of use prohibit or at least severely restrict scraping. ",

          "text": "legal graph RAG is one of the harder setups because the relationships between documents actually matter for correctness — you can't just do similarity search and hope for the best.\n\n  \non architecture: go agentic over static. in legal you constantly need to trace things like \"this clause was amended by X statute on Y date\" or \"this ruling cites and partially overrules case Z.\" a static graph can't adapt to these multi-hop paths well because the traversal pattern changes based on the query type. an agentic approach where the model decides which edges to follow based on the question gives you much better citation chains.\n\n  \nfor chunking: clause-level is the way to go for legal. section-level loses the granularity you need for citation accuracy (you want to point to the exact clause, not a whole section). but keep the section hierarchy as metadata so you can still navigate up/down the document structure.\n\n  \non relations — cross-reference edges + temporal links are probably the highest-impact combo. statutes constantly reference each other and get amended over time. NLI edges are cool in theory but expensive to compute at scale and contradiction detection accuracy in legal language is still sketchy.\n\n  \nfor eval: curated multi-hop Q&A sets with lawyer review on the citations is the gold standard. automated metrics alone won't catch hallucinated citations that look plausible.",

Typically first few pages.  \n2) At time of query, only expose the document titles and their TOCs either in the prompt, tools or MCP  \n3) The trick is to let the agent decide which documents (and/or pages) given are likely relevant to the user's query.  \n4) Let the agent scope and perform its RAG search filtered on the matched documents  \n5) Extend via deepsearch-like looping where the agent can repeat steps 2-4 until it finds a suitable answer\n\nThis approach differs by being top down as opposed to just diving straight into the contents and working out where you are is bottom up. Of course,  works better if the document has a TOC otherwise the alternative is parsing the documents to essentially generate your own TOC.\n\nAlso as a fellow enthusiast in handling large documents, would love some feedback on something I'm building [ragextract.com](http://ragextract.com) and how it compares to your pipeline (particularly interested in what you're doing for retrieval).

While your case is different than mine, I think Page Index can truly help here, as there is a TOC / Hierarchy involved here, but as I have said before PDFs are as messy as they come, so the ingestion pipeline itself needs to be solid if your data has tabular items embedded, or images. Honestly there are multiple ways to tackle this. A lot of times people are using RAG outside of its intended purpose. I gets requests daily where someone wants to semantically search a RAG with 20 million records, because for some reason they want to see each and every record containing \"blah. blah. blah\". RAG is not designed for queries like that. If you think that's the way people want to use your RAG DM me and I can help. I might be slow to respond, but there are architectures that can help with your problem here, and the broad search problem. \n\n[https://docs.pageindex.ai/](https://docs.pageindex.ai/)",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe’ve been working on a local-first memory engine for RAG pipelines and wanted to share it here for feedback.\n\nA lot of RAG setups today rely on cloud vector databases, which works, but can add latency, cost, and operational overhead. We wanted something simpler that runs entirely locally and gives predictable retrieval for retrieval-heavy workflows.\n\nSo we built **Synrix**, plus a small Python RAG SDK on top of it.\n\nAt a high level:\n\n* Everything runs locally (no cloud dependency)\n* You can store chunks + metadata and retrieve deterministically\n* Queries scale with matching results rather than total dataset size\n* Designed for agent memory and RAG-style recall\n* Python SDK to make ingestion + querying straightforward\n\nThe RAG SDK basically handles:\n\n* ingesting documents / chunks\n* attaching metadata (source, tags, IDs, etc.)\n* querying memory for relevant context\n* returning results in a format that’s easy to feed back into your LLM\n\nWe’ve been testing on local datasets (\\~25k–100k nodes) and seeing microsecond-scale prefix lookups on commodity hardware. Benchmarks are still being formalized, but it’s already usable for local RAG experiments.\n\nGitHub is here if anyone wants to try it:  \n[https://github.com/RYJOX-Technologies/Synrix-Memory-Engine]()\n\nThis is still early, and we’d genuinely love feedback from people building RAG systems:\n\n* How are you handling retrieval today?\n* What pain points do you hit with vector DBs?\n* What would you want to see benchmarked or improved?\n\nHappy to answer questions, and thanks in advance for any thoughts 🙂",

That seems like a category error in terms of comparison, as essentially all of the major DBs have efficient prefix lookups as well. These include many DBs that are open source and can be run locally or even in process. I’d be more interested in seeing side by side comparisons of equivalent search methods against some major open source DBs.  \n\nAlso, a search scaling only with the top-k result count sounds impossible, unless you’re talking about simple hash lookup on a key. But if that’s what you’re talking about then you need to already know a priori the exact piece of data you want to lookup. And even then in practice B-trees will be more efficient for ID lookups than using a hash on large DBs (so also not independent of DB size).\n\nMaybe you can clarify your intentions, your claims, or how things work since nothing on your repo or your website really provide any explanation, technical detail, examples, or actual benchmarks/comparisons.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHave you ever had that *false confidence* when an LLM answers a technical question — only to later realize it confidently cited something incorrect? In legal domains, that confidence is the *number one danger*.\n\nWhile experimenting with a standard RAG setup, the system confidently quoted a statute that seemed plausible… until we realized that provision was **repealed in 2013**. The issue wasn’t just old training data — it was that the system relied on *frozen knowledge* or poorly verified external sources.\n\nThis was something I had seen mentioned multiple times in other posts where people shared examples of legal documents with entirely fabricated statutes. That motivated me — as an Italian developer — to solve this problem in the context of **Italian law, where the code is notoriously messy and updates are frequent**.\n\nTo address this structural failure, I built **Juris AI**.\n\n\n\n# The Problem with Frozen Knowledge\n\nMost RAG systems are static: you ingest documents once and *hope* they stay valid. That rarely works for legal systems, where legislation evolves constantly.\n\nJuris AI tackles this with two key principles:\n\n**Dynamic Synchronization**  \nEvery time the system starts, it performs an incremental alignment of its sources to ensure the knowledge base reflects the *current state of the law*, not a stale snapshot.\n\n**Data Honesty**  \nIf a norm is repealed or lacks verified text, the system does not guess. It *reports the boundary of verification* instead of hallucinating something plausible but wrong.\n\n\n\n# Under the Hood\n\nFor those interested in the architecture but not a research paper:\n\n**Hybrid Graph-RAG**  \nWe represent the legal corpus as a *dependency graph* (KuzuDB + LanceDB). Think of this as a connected system where each article knows the law it belongs to and its references.\n\n**Deterministic Orchestration Layer**  \nA proprietary logic layer ensures generation *follows validated graph paths*.  \nFor example, if the graph marks an article as “repealed,” the system is *blocked from paraphrasing* outdated text and instead reports the current status.\n\n\n\n# Results (Benchmark Highlights)\n\nIn stress tests against traditional RAG models:\n\n* **Zero hallucinations on norm validation** — e.g., on articles with suffixes like *Art. 155-quinquies*, where standard models often cite repealed content, Juris AI always identified the correct current status.\n* **Cross-Database Precision** — in complex scenarios such as linking aggravated theft (Criminal Code *Art. 625*) to civil liability norms (Civil Code *Art. 2043+*), Juris AI reconstructed the entire chain with literal text, while other systems fell back to general paraphrase.\n\n\n\n# Why I’m Sharing This Here\n\nThis is *not* a product pitch. It’s a technical exploration and I’m curious:\n\n**From your experience with RAG systems, in which scenarios does a deterministic validation approach become** ***essential*** **versus relying on traditional semantic retrieval alone?**",

If Update X modifies Law Y, our Deterministic Orchestrator validates this link at the graph level, effectively 'flagging' the outdated version.\nEssentially, we don't let the LLM 'guess' applicability through semantic probability.

It’s a specialized Legal Intelligence engine built specifically to tackle the structural mess of Italian Law.\n\nThe main issue with generic PDF-to-chat tools is that they rely entirely on the file's content and the LLM's 'creativity'—which is a massive liability in the legal domain. We built a **Hybrid Graph-RAG architecture (KuzuDB + LanceDB)** that enforces a deterministic gatekeeper logic. If a statute in the document has been repealed or modified, my system cross-references it with the graph's metadata and kills the hallucination before it even reaches the user. A standard PDF chat tool would simply parrot back whatever is in the file, even if it's legally dead.\n\nGreat for casual use, but professional legal-tech requires structured logical constraints and real-time validity checks, not just basic semantic search.",

      "text": "# tl;dr\n\nWe’re releasing [**Legal RAG Bench**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/legal-rag-bench), a new reasoning-intensive benchmark and evaluation methodology for assessing the end-to-end, real-world performance of legal RAG systems.\n\nOur evaluation of state-of-the-art embedding and generative models on Legal RAG Bench reveals that information retrieval is the primary driver of legal RAG performance rather than reasoning. We find that the [Kanon 2 Embedder](https://isaacus.com/blog/introducing-kanon-2-embedder) legal embedding model, in particular, delivers an average accuracy boost of 17 points relative to Gemini 3.1 Pro, GPT-5.2, Text Embedding 3 Large, and Gemini Embedding 001.\n\nWe also infer based on a statistically robust hierarchical error analysis that most errors attributed to hallucinations in legal RAG systems are in fact triggered by retrieval failures.\n\nWe conclude that information retrieval sets the ceiling on the performance of modern legal RAG systems. While strong retrieval can compensate for weak reasoning, strong reasoning often cannot compensate for poor retrieval.\n\nIn the interests of transparency, we have openly released Legal RAG Bench on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/legal-rag-bench), added it to the [Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB)](https://isaacus.com/mleb), and have further presented the results of all evaluated models in an interactive explorer shown towards the end of this blog post. We encourage researchers to both scrutinize our data and build upon our novel evaluation methodology, which leverages full factorial analysis to enable hierarchical decomposition of legal RAG errors into hallucinations, retrieval failures, and reasoning failures.\n\n**Source:** [**https://isaacus.com/blog/legal-rag-bench**](https://isaacus.com/blog/legal-rag-bench)",

The methodology uses a factorial experiment, where each embedder and LLM is paired together, allowing for the estimation of the causal effect of each component in terms of the outcome variables of correctness and groundedness. \n\nThis type of estimation is only statistically sound if you can establish interlinked ground-truths for both the retriever and LLM at the question level. So if a RAG pipeline gets an answer wrong, we can examine whether the retreiver failed to get the 'gold passage' (this would plausibly explain the failure at the pipeline level), and if it did get the gold passage, how come the LLM was unable to come up with the correct answer despite having  all of the relevant context to do so. In the latter case, we can infer that the LLM's reasoning abilities are at fault, allowing for a clear decomposition, at the pipeline level, between reasoning and retrieval errors.\n\nJust because an intuition exists as popular advice, does not mean it is supported by the science or evidence. There's value in conclusively proving something that seems obvious, particularly if you can better understand the causal pattern and mechanics, allowing you to draw more sophistacted inferences from that seemingly obvious assumption.",

      "text": "Hey r/RAG,\n\nI've been working on retrieval systems for a while now and wanted to share some insights from building Denser Retriever, an end-to-end retrieval platform.\n\n**The problem we kept hitting:**\n\nPure vector search misses exact matches (product IDs, error codes, names). Pure keyword search misses semantic meaning. Most RAG setups use one or the other, or bolt them together awkwardly.\n\n**Our approach — triple-layer retrieval:**\n\n1. **Keyword search** (Elasticsearch BM25) — handles exact matches, filters, structured queries\n2. **Semantic search** (dense vector embeddings) — catches meaning even when wording differs\n3. **Neural reranking** (cross-encoder) — takes the combined candidates and re-scores them with full query-document attention\n\n**Key learnings:**\n\n* Chunk size matters more than embedding model choice. We use 2000-character chunks with 10% overlap (200 characters). This gives\n* For technical docs, keyword search still wins \\~30% of the time over pure semantic. Don't drop it.\n* Reranking top-50 candidates is the sweet spot between latency and accuracy for most use cases.\n* Document parsing quality is the silent killer. Garbage in = garbage out, no matter how good your retrieval is.\n\n**Architecture:**\n\nUpload docs → Parse (PDF/DOCX/HTML → Markdown) → Chunk → Embed → Index into Elasticsearch (both BM25 and dense vector)\n\nAt query time: BM25 retrieval + vector retrieval → merge → neural rerank → top-K results\n\nWe've open-sourced the core retriever logic and also have a hosted platform at [retriever.denser.ai](http://retriever.denser.ai) if you want to try it without setting up infrastructure.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture or share more specific benchmarks.",

      "text": "I've been researching RAG failure patterns for a few months and one thing kept coming up: most pipeline failures I looked at didn't trace back to the generation model. They traced back to how the data was chunked before retrieval even happened.\n\nThe pattern looks like this: vector search returns chunks that score high on relevance. The LLM generates a confident, well-formatted answer. But the answer is wrong because the chunk boundary split a piece of context that needed to stay together. Swapping in a stronger model doesn't help here. It just produces more convincing hallucinations from the same incomplete context.\n\nThree patterns that consistently helped in the systems I studied:\n\n**Parent-child chunking:** You index small child chunks for retrieval precision, but at generation time you pass the larger parent chunk so the model gets surrounding context. LlamaIndex has a good implementation of this with their `AutoMergingRetriever`. This alone caught a big chunk of \"almost right but wrong\" failures.\n\n**Hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25):** Pure embedding search misses exact-match terms. Product names, error codes, config values, specific IDs. Running BM25 keyword search alongside vector retrieval and merging results (Reciprocal Rank Fusion works well here) picks up what embeddings miss. Langchain and Haystack both support this pattern out of the box.\n\n**Self-correcting retrieval loops:** Before returning a response, the pipeline evaluates whether the answer is actually grounded in the retrieved chunks. If groundedness scores low, it reformulates the query and retries. The original Self-RAG paper by Asai et al. (2023) covers this well, and CRAG (Corrective RAG) by Yan et al. (2024) extends it further.\n\nI am just curious what others here have run into.   \nWhat has been your worst chunking or retrieval failure?   \nThe kind where everything looked fine on the retrieval side until you actually checked the output against the source documents.",

          "text": "The one that burned me the worst was splitting on fixed token counts without checking for structural boundaries. Had a pipeline where table rows kept getting split across two chunks. The embedding for each chunk was technically relevant to the query, retrieval scored it high, but the model was generating answers from half a table row. Took weeks to trace because the outputs looked confident and formatted correctly.\n\nThe fix wasn't a better chunking strategy though. It was fixing what went into the chunker. The source data was markdown with navigation elements, breadcrumbs, and related links all mixed in with the actual content. Once I switched to extracting just the content with typed fields (paragraphs, tables as arrays, headings as hierarchy), the chunking almost didn't matter anymore because each field was already a meaningful unit.\n\nSecond one was overlapping chunks that shared boilerplate text. Footer content appearing in 40% of chunks meant the embedding space was polluted. Retrieval kept returning chunks that scored high because they all shared the same footer, not because they were actually relevant.",
