Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

Having spent 13 years at Google Legal Discovery and 16 years as a computer forensic examiner, I can tell you from experience: raw email data is messy, and AI safety guardrails make it dangerously polite.\n\nMost AI models are trained to be agreeable, not skeptical. They won't naturally assume a group sounds criminal or is hiding something—they tend to treat document content as a \"fact\" by default. But in high-stakes truth-seeking, the text is often the smoke screen.\nIn my opinion, to make this truly groundbreaking, the RAG pipeline needs to incorporate a Dynamic Truth Table (a live Chronology), a people index that tracks people as objects so the system can do a better job of knowing J.E=Jeffery Epstein and also jevacation@gmail.com=Jeffery Epstein etc. \n\nThere are reports from back in the 90s that Trump would call into the news rooms under a fake name (always the same fake name) to spread rumors about himself and keep his name in the news cycle - something a living rolodex would help to normalize  \n\n\nWe’ve seen this play out in real-time with the 2026 investigations in the UK and Belarus. For years, people like Prince Andrew claimed they had no contact with Epstein after 2009, but the latest document trickles are proving that wasn't true. Storing facts like Prince Andrew claims he has not contacted Epstein since 2009 would hopefully be able to identify where the document trove conflicts with Prince Andrews claims.  \n\nIf you can build a pipeline that is \"living and breathing,\" you could feed it those new jurisdictions' findings, estate records, and community-sourced photos as they surface. By grounding the AI in a constantly updating chronology rather than just a static vector database, you give the agent a way to \"cross-examine\" the documents.\nWhen the machine has a verified timeline to push back against the raw text, it moves from being a simple search tool to a forensic powerhouse.\n\nKeep it up—this has the potential to be a world-class truth-seeking engine.",

Precision queries hit insights. Exploratory queries hit concepts/abstracts.\n\nI assume this works well beacuse LLMs during ingestion can spend *minutes* analyzing a document that gets used thousands of times. The upfront cost amortizes completely. And they're genuinely good at:\n\n* Disambiguating structure\n* Resolving implicit context\n* Normalizing varied phrasings into consistent forms\n* Cross-referencing\n\nTested this on a few projects involving financial document corpus : agent with distillation correctly identified which DOW companies were financial institutions, attributed specific risks with page-level citations, and supported claims with concrete figures. Naive chunking agent failed to even identify the companies reliably.\n\nThis is fully automatable with workflow-based pipelines:\n\n1. Table extraction (preserve structure via CV models)\n2. Text generation 1: insights from tables + text\n3. Text generation 2: concepts from insights\n4. Text generation 3: abstracts from concepts\n5. Text generation 4: table schema analysis for SQL generation\n\nEach component receives previous component's output. Final JSON contains original data + all distillation layers.\n\nAnyway figure this is one of those things where the industry is converging on the wrong abstraction and we should probably talk about it more.",

No reranker changes needed. The hierarchy gives you natural chunk boundaries instead of arbitrary token windows.\n\nThe part about knowledge distillation at ingestion time is interesting.

That's how we started making the search possible with AI. \n\nBut as the LLMs got so better, I feel we should take a step back and appreciate the simple text search tools as well. In one of my projects, it was doing good with just semantic search. Recently got an issue where it could not find information about code related question.\n\nThe text was right there, but you know the semantic search stuff, it doesn't pick it up if there is no enough information even though it is just there. That's when I took a step back and just did a regular text base regex search tools.\n\nPoint it, the LLMs are a lot better and they try multiple combinations and eventually they find out as we expect them to. This for sure helps in codebases because there it is more of keywords. I immediately made this improvement live and its giving amazing results.\n\nAnybody did this already? any thoughts?",

You can create a few different approaches to searching:   \n \\- Use find to get a directory structure, then ask it to use targeted greps using this directorry structure to find valid files and get surround chunks.   \n \\- Simple regex grep on everything in a shotgun blast approach with multiple combinations of what it could be: For example if you ask \"How does auth work here\" You'll want it to break down into stuff like \"auth\" \"authorization\" \"login\" \"token\", to get a wide breadth of information.",

Users don't tell you \"use keyword search\" - they ask questions and expect answers.\n\nThe problem compounds: query X needs semantic, query Y needs keyword, query Z needs both. LLM tries combinations and \"eventually finds it\" means wasted retrieval calls and latency. More importantly, when it still fails after trying combinations, you can't debug why without logging what each method returned and why the LLM chose path A over B.\n\nWe saw this exact issue. Added BM25 alongside vector search. Results improved but incidents became harder to debug. \"It found the wrong doc\" doesn't tell you which retrieval method failed or why fusion chose incorrectly.\n\nFor production RAG: are you capturing retrieval results from both methods plus fusion decisions? Or just measuring end result quality?\n\nMulti-method retrieval helps accuracy. Evidence capture makes failures debuggable.",

A cheaper/faster model is usually sufficient.\n\nCommon best practice we’ve seen work well:\n\n- Spend compute on retrieval quality (chunking, filters, re-ranking), not the final generator.\n- Use a fast default generator, and only escalate to a stronger model when signals suggest it’s needed (low relevance scores, sparse matches, high ambiguity, multi-doc synthesis).\n- Treat generation as a formatting + synthesis step, not the place to “fix” weak retrieval.\n\nIn other words: if you need a very powerful model to get good answers, that’s often a retrieval problem, not a generation one.",

      "text": "Over the last few years, most AI conversations revolved around bigger models, benchmarks, and chatbots.\n\nBut looking ahead to 2026, the real shift isn’t just smarter LLMs — it’s how AI is actually being used in production. AI is moving from assistive software to something closer to a digital workforce.\n\nHere’s what’s standing out to me 👇\n\n1. AI is executing work, not just answering prompts\n\nEnterprises are already running AI-powered, end-to-end workflows for billing, customer support, document processing, reporting, and internal ops.\n\nThis isn’t experimentation or demos anymore — it’s workflow automation at scale.\n\n\n\n2. RAG is becoming the default architecture\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation isn’t optional if you care about accuracy, grounding, or compliance.\n\nConnecting LLMs to internal documents, databases, and vector stores significantly reduces hallucinations and makes AI usable in regulated environments.\n\n\n\n3. LLM progress is about reasoning, not raw size\n\nModel scale mattered early on, but real value now comes from context management, domain awareness, and multi-step reasoning — not just parameter count.\n\n\n\n4. AI agents are the real inflection point\n\nAgentic systems don’t just generate text — they plan, use tools, call APIs, and execute multi-step tasks across systems.\n\nLess “chatbot”, more junior employee with supervision and guardrails.\n\n\n\n5. Enterprise AI has moved into production\n\nWe’re past pilots and proofs-of-concept. Teams are measuring latency, cost, reliability, and productivity gains — and AI is starting to affect real KPIs.\n\n\n\n6. Multimodal and domain-specific models are winning\n\nText-only AI is limiting. The future is multimodal systems that understand documents, images, audio, and structured data — often fine-tuned or adapted for specific industries.\n\n7. Governance, trust, and compliance are first-class concerns\n\nAudit trails, explainability, bias mitigation, access controls, and data residency are no longer “nice to have” — they’re required for production AI.\n\n8. Edge AI is quietly becoming important\n\nOn-device and local inference unlock lower latency, better privacy, and reduced cloud costs — especially for personal and enterprise use cases.\n\nTo me, the takeaway is simple:\n\nThe AI revolution isn’t coming — it’s already operational.\n\nThe winners won’t be the ones chasing hype, but the ones building reliable, grounded, agent-driven systems that actually work.\n\nI wrote a longer breakdown here:\n\n [https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026](https://www.loghunts.com/rag-llm-agentic-ai-guide-2026)",

By then you're firefighting instead of building.\n\nThe governance piece (point 7) ties directly into this—you can't just deploy an agent that \"mostly works\" when it's handling regulated data or making consequential decisions. You need to know how it behaves across thousands of scenarios before it touches real users.\n\nWe've been working on simulating agent workflows at scale before deployment to catch these issues early. Helps surface the difference between \"works on my machine\" and \"works in production under load with real user chaos.\"",

      "text": "If your RAG feels like it’s “almost there” — rerankers are usually the missing piece.\n\nA reranker sits between retrieval and the LLM:\n\n1. Retrieve a larger candidate set (e.g., top-50)\n2. Rerank those candidates by relevance\n3. Send only top-5/top-10 to the model\n\nThe point: stop feeding the LLM garbage context.\n\n# When rerankers are actually worth it\n\nYou likely need a reranker if:\n\n* The correct chunk is often in top-50, but not in top-5\n* Your corpus has near-duplicates (policy versions, templates, “same doc but updated”)\n* Queries are long / multi-intent (“compare A vs B, cite the latest policy, exclude legacy”)\n* Dense retrieval returns “related” chunks but not the *answer-bearing* chunk\n* Increasing k makes answers worse (more context → more confusion)\n\nIf your data is small and clean and top-5 is already precise, rerankers can be extra latency for little gain.\n\n# The main reranker approaches (practical overview)\n\n# 1) Cross-encoder rerankers (most common “quality win”)\n\nScores each *(query, chunk)* pair by reading them together.\n\n* ✅ Best precision (biggest improvement to answer quality)\n* ❌ More compute than embeddings\n* Best pattern: retrieve top-50 → cross-encoder → keep top-5\n\n# 2) Embedding similarity (bi-encoder) (baseline, not really “reranking”)\n\nThis is what most people mean by “vector search”.\n\n* ✅ Fast, scales well\n* ❌ Weaker at fine-grained intent (“which chunk actually answers?”)\n* Best use: candidate generator before a stronger reranker\n\n# 3) Hybrid (BM25 + dense)\n\nCombine lexical matching with embeddings.\n\n* ✅ Great for IDs, error codes, names, exact terms\n* ✅ More robust across weird queries\n* ❌ Requires tuning weights / mixing logic\n\n# 4) LLM-as-reranker (works, but don’t start here)\n\nAsk an LLM to rank chunks (sometimes with custom rules).\n\n* ✅ Very flexible (“prefer newest doc”, “must include citation”, etc.)\n* ❌ Slower + expensive + can be inconsistent unless tightly constrained\n* Use when you need domain rules that models don’t capture well\n\n# 5) Domain-tuned rerankers\n\nFine-tune a reranker on your own relevance data.\n\n* ✅ Big gains in specialized corpora\n* ❌ Needs training data + evaluation discipline\n* Worth it when retrieval quality is core to your product\n\n# A simple setup that usually works\n\n* Retrieve top-50\n* Cross-encoder rerank → pick top-5\n* Apply filters **before reranking** when possible (permissions, time, doc type)\n* Track metrics like: “answer present in top-N” and final answer accuracy\n\nThat’s it. Reranking isn’t a silver bullet — it’s just the cleanest way to convert “the answer is somewhere in there” into “the model actually sees it.”\n\n",

It does not comprehend the text; it transforms it into a mathematical point in space.  \nWhy this choice? Running this locally guarantees under 100 milliseconds latency and no cost since it's on hugging face backend (free plan).  \n\n2. The Retrieval\nThe system searches my database for relevant information.  \nFAISS.  \nFAISS calculates the Cosine Similarity between the user's question vector and the 130,000+ chunks of text in mine database. It retrieves the Top 3-5 chunks that are mathematically closest to the query. FAISS is designed for speed. It can scan millions of vectors in milliseconds, even on a CPU which is available on hugging face free plan.  \n\n3. The Prompt Construction  \nThe system creates a large prompt for the AI.  \nThe Logic: It combines three components:  \nRole: \"You are a strict Singapore Law Expert…”  \nContext: The 3-5 text chunks retrieved by FAISS.  \nQuery: The user's original question.  \n\n4. The Generation (Te \"triplefailover\" brain)  \n The prompt is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a human-like answer.  \nA reliable \"Chain of Command\":  \nPrimary: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Fastest, High Context).  \nFailover 1: If Gemini fails due to rate limit or error, it switches to Arcee AI trinity large preview(via OpenRouter).  \nFailover 2: If that fails, it switches to Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq).  \nThis guarantees 99.9% uptime.\n\n5.

I have a much smaller corpus but three layers of authoritative source (canonical, expert opinion, user organisation override). I got better retrieval results by splitting the parent chunks into child chunks with a small token count, and embedding those. Being smaller, a cheap encoding model can be used, and they work better with specific queries anyway. But embedding is a one time cost, and this approach uses the child chunks to find and retrieve a parent chunk so it doesn't save actual tokens when answering queries, except that perhaps it does better retrieval which is also an optimisation (my retrieval is a BM25/vectorisation hybrid which some hand-coded domain-specific assistance provided to BM25). [together.ai](http://together.ai) has a list of recommended models which do well. I allow the user to swap to kimi-2.5 which lets them paste/upload images to their prompt ... however, each user has a quota so if they do more expensive things, they exhaust their quota more quickly, which is a thinking outside the box solution, perhaps.

Different models tokenize the *same* context very differently, so an “8k token” chunk in your mental math can quietly turn into a much more expensive prompt depending on the model family. At scale, that gap explodes your bill.\n\nThis happens to a ton of teams who only benchmark on:\n\n* price per 1M tokens\n* synthetic prompts\n* happy-path tests\n\nand not on their *actual* RAG pipeline.\n\nNice move pivoting to real-world evaluation. Running automated benchmarks on your **real prompts + docs + agentic flows** is pretty much the only reliable way to balance quality vs cost. The fact that you also set up fallbacks is huge — that’s how you avoid future surprises when traffic spikes or providers change behavior.\n\nFor anyone else reading this:  \ndon’t trust theoretical costs. Measure **effective cost per query** on your own data, or you *will* get burned.\n\nOut of curiosity, which models ended up being your main winners in prod?

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m a 1st-year CSE student. I’ve been obsessing over how to run decent RAG pipelines on my consumer laptop (GTX 1650, 4GB VRAM) without relying on any cloud APIs.\n\n​I quickly realized that \"one size fits all\" doesn't work when you have limited VRAM. So I ended up building two completely different RAG architectures for my projects, and I’d love to get some feedback on them.\n\n​1. The \" HIERARCHICAL AGENTIC RAG WITH HYBRID SEARCH (VRCTOR SEARCH + KNOWLEDGE GRAPH)\" (WiredBrain)::\n\n​The Goal: Handle massive scale (693k chunks) without crashing my RAM.\n\n​The Problem: Standard HNSW indexes were too RAM-heavy and got slow as the dataset grew.\n\n​My Solution: I built a Hierarchical 3-Address Router. Instead of searching everything, it uses a lightweight classifier to route the query to a specific \"Cluster\" (Domain -> Topic -> Entity) before doing the vector search.\n\n​The Result: It cuts the search space by ~99% instantly. I’m using pgvector to keep the index on system RAM so my GPU is free for generation.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/WiredBrain-Hierarchical-Rag\n\n​2. The \"Speed Demon\" (Axiom Voice Agent)\n\n​The Goal: <400ms latency for a real-time voice assistant.\n​The Problem: Even the optimized Graph RAG was too slow for a fluid conversation.\n\n​My Solution: I built a pure JSON-based RAG. It bypasses the complex graph lookups and loads a smaller, highly specific context directly into memory for immediate \"reflex\" answers. It’s strictly for the voice agent where speed > depth.\n\n​Repo: https://github.com/pheonix-delta/axiom-voice-agent",

But it is also done incrementally, continuously throughout the project development and ongoing production usage.\nIt's all using traditional NLP approaches, we don't use LLMs for building the graph in this project both due to cost limitations (traditional NLP handles 100,000s of files/s and enables very quick reprocessing once new datasets are added).\nThe access model is one of the big challenges: it's at the 3 levels (data type, entity level and field level access enforcement - last one we're just adding to the product).

      "text": "I've been building memory systems for agents and noticed something weird. Most memory solutions follow this pattern:\n\n**Standard RAG approach (Mem0, Zep, etc.):**\n\n* Store memories in database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, whatever)\n* Query through APIs\n* To inspect: write code to query DB\n* To edit: call update endpoints\n* To migrate: export → transform → reimport\n\n**Alternative approach (inspired by OpenClaw):**\n\n* Store memories in markdown files\n* Embed and index in vector store (same as above)\n* Query through APIs (same as above)\n* To inspect: `cat memory/MEMORY.md`\n* To edit: vim/VSCode the file, auto-reindexes\n* To migrate: `cp -r memory/ new-system/`\n\nThe retrieval layer is identical - both use vector search + reranking. The only difference is the source of truth.\n\n**Why markdown seems better for memory:**\n\n**Debuggability** \\- When retrieval returns wrong context, you can grep through source files instead of writing DB queries. `rg \"Redis config\" memory/` beats SQL any day.\n\n**Version control** \\- `git log memory/MEMORY.md` shows you exactly when bad info entered the system. Database audit logs? Painful.\n\n**Chunk inspection** \\- See the actual document structure. Databases flatten everything into rows. Markdown preserves semantic boundaries (headings, paragraphs).\n\n**Hybrid search** \\- BM25 keyword search works naturally on markdown. On JSON in databases? Need full-text indexes and special config.\n\n**Cold start** \\- New developer? `git clone`, read the markdown, understand what the AI knows. Database? Need credentials, connection, schema knowledge.\n\n**The RAG perspective:**\n\nFrom a pure retrieval standpoint, markdown has advantages:\n\n* Semantic chunking is easier (split by headings/paragraphs)\n* Context preservation (you can read surrounding text naturally)\n* Deduplication is straightforward (content hash)\n* A/B testing embeddings is trivial (reindex from source)\n\n  \n==========================\n\n**So,,,, What I built:**\n\nGot so convinced by this I built \\`memsearch\\` , a memory package ready for agent memory usage.\n\nhttps://github.com/zilliztech/memsearch\n\nbasically proper RAG over markdown files with:\n\n* Hybrid search (vector + BM25, weighted fusion)\n* File watching + auto-indexing\n* Chunk deduplication (saves 20-30% on embedding costs)\n* Framework agnostic\n\n**My question to the community:**\n\nIs there a technical reason database-first is better that I'm missing? Or is it just convention?\n\nThe only argument I hear is \"scale\" but most agent memory is < 100MB even after months. That's nothing for modern RAG systems.\n\nWould love to hear from people who've built production RAG systems. What breaks when you use files instead of databases?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nA few Days back, I talked about my pet project, which is a RAG-based search engine on Singaporean laws and acts (Scraping 20,000 pages/sec) with an Apple-inspired user interface.\n\nThis project is open source meaning anyone can use my backend logic but do read the license provided in the GitHub.(Star the repo if you liked it.)\n\nThe community posed some fantastic and challenging questions on answer consistency, complex multi-law queries, and hallucinations. These questions were just incredible. Rather than addressing these questions or issues with patches and fixing them superficially, I decided to revisit the code and refactor significant architectural changes.This version also includes reference to page number of the pdf while answering i have achieved that using metadata while I also building the vector database.\n\nI look forward to sharing with you Version 2.\n\nThe following are specific feedback that I received, and how I went about engineering the solutions:\n\nThe Problem: \"How do you ensure answer quality doesn't drop when the failover switches models?\"\n\nThe Feedback: My back-end has a \"Triple Failover\" system (three models, triple the backups!). I was concerned that moving from a high-end model to a backup model would change the \"answer structure\" or \"personality,\" giving a \"jarring\" effect to the user. The V2 Fix: Model-Specific System Instructions. I have no ability to alter the underlying intelligence of my backup models, so I had to normalize the output of my back-end models. I implemented a dynamic instruction set. If the back-end should fail over to Model B, I inject a specific \"system prompt\" to encourage Model B to conform to the same structure as Model A.\n\n2. The Problem: \"Single queries miss the bigger picture (e.g., 'Starting a business' involves Tax, Labor, AND Banking laws).\"\n\nThe Feedback: A simple semantic search for “starting a business” could yield the Companies Act but completely overlook the Employment Act or Income Tax Act. The V2 Fix: Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR). I decided the cost of computation for MQR was worth it. What we now do is, when you pose an open-ended question, an LLM catches the question and essentially breaks it down into sub-questions that could be “Business Registration,” “Corporate Taxation,” “Hiring Regulations,” etc. It's a more computationally intensive process, but the depth of the answer is virtually night and day from V1.\n\n3. The Problem: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out (Hallucinations)\n\nThe Feedback: If the search results contain an irrelevant document, the LLM has two choices: either hallucinate an answer or say \"I don't know.\"\nThe V2 Fix: Re-Ranking with Cross-Encoders: I decided to introduce an additional validation layer. Once the initial vector search yields the primary results, the Cross-Encoder model \"reads\" them to ensure that they're indeed relevant to the query before passing them along to the LLM. If they're irrelevant, the results are discarded immediately, greatly reducing the incidence of hallucinations and \"confidently wrong\" answers.\n\n4. The Problem: Agentic Capabilities\n\nAgentic Behavior: I’ve improved the backend logic so that it is less passive. It is moving towards becoming an agent that can interpret the “intent” behind the search terms, not just match words.\n\nVersioning: This is the hardest nut to crack, but I've begun to organize the data to enable versioning in subsequent updates.\n\nTech Stack Recap\n\nFrontend: Apple-inspired minimalist design.\n\nUsing: BGE-M3 as text embedder\n\nBackend: Triple Failover System - 3 AI Models\n\nNew in V2: FAISS + Cross-Encoder Re-ranking + Multi-Query Retrieval. I'm still just a student and learning every day. The project is open source, and I would love it if you could tear it apart again so that I could create Version 3.

The mechanism operates in three stages: first, it computes the geometric mean to find the baseline tendency; second, it performs a Log-Odds Transformation to map the bounded probability space to the unbounded log-odds space; and third, it adds a bonus proportional to the logarithm of the number of signals.\n\nThis works because probability space is bounded by 1.0, preventing simple addition. By transforming to log-odds space, we remove this ceiling. Instead of the score shrinking to 0.49, the logic applies an additive bonus for agreeing signals, resulting in amplification where the final score becomes roughly 0.83.\n\nThis implementation is the proof that this structure is not merely a heuristic. The paper demonstrates that rigorous Bayesian inference over multiple signals produces a computational structure formally isomorphic to a feedforward neural network.\n\nThis work proves that the Sigmoid activation function is a mathematical necessity that emerges when converting Bayesian evidence into probability, rather than an arbitrary design choice. Consequently, this implementation demonstrates that a neural network is the natural structure of correct probabilistic reasoning.\n\nThe introduction of Log-Odds Conjunction has yielded measurable improvements on the SQuAD v2.0 benchmark compared to the standard Hybrid OR approach marking a +1.2% improvement.\n\nThis confirms that properly modeling the agreement between text and vector signals yields better ranking performance than simple score summation or probabilistic multiplication.

That is an excellent question and shows you’ve read the theorem carefully.\n\nYou are correct that **Theorem 4.3.1** guarantees monotonicity (order-preservation) relative to BM25, but this holds strictly **'for a fixed prior p'**.\n\nHowever, in practice (as detailed in **Section 4.2**), we often apply a **Composite Prior** that incorporates term frequency and document length signals. Because this prior varies dynamically per document, it introduces a Bayesian re-ranking effect that can slightly alter the order compared to raw BM25.\n\nFurthermore, even if the text-only order were identical, the **non-linear sigmoid transformation** changes the *relative distribution* of scores. In a hybrid setting, this calibrated distribution interacts differently with vector scores compared to unbounded BM25 scores, which naturally leads to different (and often improved) ranking metrics.",

      "text": "I've been messing around with vectorless RAG lately and honestly it's kind of ridiculous how much we're leaving on the table by not using it properly.\n\nThe basic idea makes sense on paper. Just build document trees instead of chunking everything into embedded fragments, let LLMs navigate structure instead of guessing at similarity. But the way people actually implement this is usually pretty half baked. They'll extract some headers, maybe preserve a table or two, call it \"structured\" and wonder why it's not dramatically better than their old vector setup.\n\nThink about how humans actually navigate documents. We don't just ctrl-f for similar sounding phrases. We navigate structure. We know the details we want live in a specific section. We know footnotes reference specific line items. We follow the table of contents, understand hierarchical relationships, cross reference between sections.\n\nIf you want to build a vectorless system you need to keep all that in mind and go deeper than just preserving headers. Layout analysis to detect visual hierarchy (font size, indentation, positioning), table extraction that preserves row-column relationships and knows which section contains which table, hierarchical metadata that maps the entire document structure, and semantic labeling so the LLM understands what each section actually contains.\"\n\nTested this on a financial document RAG pipeline and the performance difference isn't marginal. Vector approach wastes tokens processing noise and produces low confidence answers that need manual follow up. Structure approach retrieves exactly what's needed and answers with actual citations you can verify.\n\nI think this matters more as documents get complex. The industry converged on vector embeddings because it seemed like the only scalable approach. But production systems are showing us it's not actually working. We keep optimizing embedding models and rerankers instead of questioning whether semantic similarity is even the right primitive for document retrieval.\n\nAnyway feels like one of those things where we all just accepted the vector search without questioning if it actually maps to how structured documents work.\n\n",

The problem is, I’m not really sure how to approach that yet.\n\nHere’s what I’ve built so far:\n\nI created a RAG-based model for companies that can be integrated into their app or website. The idea is that employees or anyone interested can use it to research and ask questions about the company. The data it handles includes:\n\n* Company policies (long, formal documents)\n* HR documents (rule-based and structured)\n* FAQs (short Q&A format)\n* Financial summaries (number-heavy content)\n* Product documentation (technical text and details about previous projects)\n* CSV structured data (tabular format)\n* Website content (marketing and general information)\n\nSince I’m a second-year student, I can’t afford paid services, so I’m planning to run everything locally. Right now, I’m considering using **baai/bge-m3** for embeddings and retrieval, and **Qwen3–1.7B-MLX-8bit** for answer generation.\n\nI also have a question about deployment. I’m planning to dockerize the entire system for a live demo on my resume. If I run the LLM locally, will it still work for someone accessing it from another device? Or would they also need the model running on their own machine?\n\nI’d really appreciate any guidance or suggestions. Thanks!",

          "text": "for the chunking honestly dont overthink it at the start. use something like recursive character splitting with \\~500-800 tokens and some overlap (\\~100 tokens). the key thing most people miss is that different doc types need different chunk sizes -> FAQs should stay as complete Q&A pairs, policies can be chunked by section headers, and CSV data you probably want to convert to natural language sentences before embedding\n\n  \nbge-m3 is a solid choice for embeddings especially since its multilingual. for deployment if you dockerize it and host it on a VPS or even a free tier cloud instance the LLM runs server-side so anyone can access it through the API... they dont need anything on their machine. just be aware that Qwen 1.7B is going to be pretty limited for complex questions tho",

Oh this question is likely about policy let me check policy specific documents. Lots of ways to execute that's just a basic example of using metadata to limit the search space and improve results.

A few things that helped me when I was working on something similar.\n\nPDFs and Word docs, convert to markdown first so you have consistent formatting. For web content, strip everything except the actual body content before chunking. Navigation, headers, footers, all of that pollutes your embeddings.\n\nFor chunk size, 500 to 800 tokens with 100 token overlap is a safe starting point. But the real win comes from respecting document structure. Split on headings and section boundaries instead of arbitrary character counts. A chunk that starts mid-paragraph and ends mid-sentence will retrieve poorly regardless of your embedding model.\n\nAlso, storing metadata alongside chunks (source document, section heading, document type) lets you filter at query time which makes a bigger difference than most retrieval tricks.",
