Headings, line numbers, citations, parties, proposed order, etc. Stack on a categorizer and add its results to the structure. Build a specific schema that has enough flexibility that you don’t end up with edge cases everywhere. Once you have semi structured data, then populate an old school database and build an API. Lastly, create the skills the AI needs to “intelligently,” use the API. \n\nGranted, even if vibed all the way to the end, this is likely a 9 to 12 month endeavor.

I swear 80% of the posts in this community are either self promotions/ selling opensource architecture as something new or novel, or not understanding what makes a good Rag. This post is another example, and you might be doing your company a disservice, and should probably hire someone who knows what they are doing.\n\n\"But the answers are shit, Not sure why....\" really? you would think we would have tools / math to answer your question, and you would be right. Look up what precision / recall / MRR / NDCG, and Recall@k / cosine similarity mean\n\nFirst understand which embeddings are good for which tasks. Confused? use this. [https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)\n\nThen learn some basic math, understand mathematical distances, there are many, some work well on normalized embeddings, and some don't. Most embeddings are normalized these days so by default they use cosine similarity. confused? read this. [https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05440v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05440v1), or any calculus/ linear algebra book and search cosine similarity.\n\nNext understand clustering, and search spaces. Understand what HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is and how it works, what are the parameters and how they effect your search space. Read about (M, ef\\_construction, ef\\_search). This has a huge impact on your result quality\n\nbi-encoder / cross-encoders? if you don't know these terms, time to learn them. confused? read this [https://sbert.net/examples/cross\\_encoder/applications/README.html](https://sbert.net/examples/cross_encoder/applications/README.html)\n\nunderstand how FAISS works, and understand how different vector databases work, do you know what makes weaviate different from azure search vs qdrant vs milvus? if not time to learn that. In some cases there are significant differences that can impact your search results.\n\nAll of these things will answer why your answers are shit.\n\nNext before you embed anything you have to have a good ingestion pipeline. While its true that your pdfs are getting ingested into the RAG, do you understanding how your ingestion happens? If not, you should understand that process. RAG is not a dumping exercise, its a science and an art. PDFs can be very complex, they have images, tables, nested structures, broken/ malformed pdfs, how do you handle all that? I can guarantee you there is not a single best approach that can handle pdfs, you need to make sure that you have multiple ways to extract/ parse your pdf data, if these terms don't make sense to you, you need to understand them - (OCR, Vision Models, JSON structure, chunking, overlapping, chunk strategy, markdown). confused? read this [https://www.docling.ai/](https://www.docling.ai/)  \n[https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document\\_loaders](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders)  \nor you can build your own from scratch.\n\nre-ranking stage, if you don't know what a re-ranker is then you should learn that too. check the sbert link I posted above, you can also build it from scratch if you are inclined to do so. It is also OK to build this stage with an LLM based re-ranker, provided that you have some examples that your LLM can learn from or train an LLM from scratch for this task.\n\nNext understanding what your rag actually needs, instead of dumping vectors, understand if your rag needs vector search / semantic search / keyword search / BM25 / Metadata filtering / KG etc., or a combination of all.\n\n**Extra credit:** you get extra credit if you figure out how to reduce prompt injections/ hijacking from nefarious users, which can further impact retrieval quality. Wait till you find that a pdf can contain nefarious instructions that get passed to your LLM at synthesis stage, or users trying embedding space manipulation with their search queries. Maybe add query rewriting? (there are many ways to do it, and your document can itself reword the query to add more relevancy to the search query) \n\nOnce you have all these pieces then tell us how your rag performed, and what you found.\n\nLastly do you understand your data quality, and data structure. (this should also be the first thing you do, and the reason why I didn't mention it earlier is because I assume that you are doing due diligence and at least have trust in your data quality, it would be highly unlikely that you are asking questions about \"how to make a good rag\" from your company documents when your company documents talk about company finances. I honestly think your company needs to a hire a person who does this for a living, and understands how RAG systems work at scale / production level, don't just wing it, and then not understanding why it gives you poor results. This type of negligence puts AI and researchers in a bad light.",

For investigative journalism.\n\nAnother project, where only entity extraction/graph RAG would do it.  (like in the Epstein example).\n\nin some cases, you get lucky which agentic RAG and offering some tools, not just vector search. \n\nIf you share more about what you are building, I can give you some tips. Specially: what type of content are you ingesting and what type of question are people most likely to ask. \n\nCheers",

If your PDFs are getting converted to text with headers, footers, page numbers, and formatting artifacts mixed into the content, your embeddings are going to be noisy. Retrieval will return chunks that scored high because of shared boilerplate, not because they contain the answer.\n\nBefore touching the RAG config I'd check what the actual text looks like after extraction. Print out 10 chunks and read them yourself. If you see page numbers in the middle of sentences, or section references that got split from their content, that's your problem right there. No amount of model tuning fixes bad source data.\n\nFor legal docs specifically, keeping the section hierarchy intact during extraction makes a huge difference. A clause that says \"subject to section 4.2\" needs section 4.2 to be retrievable as a unit, not split across three chunks.",

I started with a \"Community\" approach too, and I faced exactly the same frustration: great LLM (Gemini 2.0), great embeddings (Google 004), but \"shit\" answers.\n\nThe problem isn't your stack; Gemini and SurrealDB are solid. The issue is usually how the information is \"orchestrated\" before reaching the LLM. In my experience, to make a RAG work with legal and project files, you have to move away from the standard \"out-of-the-box\" approach.\n\nHere are the 3 main issues I had to solve to get precise answers:\n\nThe Chunking Trap: Standard fixed-size chunking (like splitting every 500-1000 tokens) is a disaster for legal docs. If a clause or an \"if/then\" condition is split in half, the LLM loses the logic. Are you using a simple splitter or a recursive one?\n\nMetadata vs. Pure Vector: For legal stuff, simple semantic search is too \"fuzzy.\" I found that I had to extract metadata (dates, entities, specific article numbers) first and use them to \"anchor\" the search. Without structured metadata, the LLM starts hallucinating connections that aren't there.\n\nContext Injection: Legal files should be treated as the \"Ground Truth.\" I had to tweak my prompt and retrieval to make sure the legal guidance acts as a hard constraint for the project files.\n\nTo give you a hand, what are your current parameters?\n\nWhat Chunk Size and Overlap are you using? (This is usually the #1 culprit)\n\nHow many chunks (Top-K) are you feeding to Gemini for each query?\n\nAre you using any kind of Reranker or just raw vector search?\n\nDon't scrap it yet. Usually, a \"shit\" RAG is just a RAG that needs better data orchestration, not a different LLM.",

The main work was making the outputs more deterministic and structured (fields, tables, clean exports) rather than conversational.\n\nThe result is that you can now pull usable data from PDFs and long documents without manually hunting through them or post-processing chat responses.\n\nHuge thanks to the beta users who tested early versions and gave thoughtful, honest feedback. This feature exists largely because people were clear about what wasn’t working and what would actually make the product useful.\n\nStill early, but it’s moving in a much more practical direction.\n\nIf you deal with document-heavy workflows and care about reliable, structured outputs.

              "text": "Fully agree. The main challenge is document structure, not the model.\n\nThe RAG pipeline is not linear. Extraction runs as an agentic workflow where retrieval, validation, and re-checks happen iteratively based on schema needs. So that helps a little.\n\nSchema drift is handled by keeping schemas intent-based rather than layout-dependent. Missing or ambiguous fields are allowed instead of forcing guesses. Multi-table PDFs are handled as independent units. Cross-page references are resolved by expanding retrieval when required. But still,  no matter how robust we make it, there're always some outlier PDFs which don't properly fit into this. \n\nOCR is supported for scanned PDFs and images and works well, with quality depending on input. OCR noise reduction is a problem we're focusing on now. I'm trying to involve LLMs as little as possible to make this more robust and generalised and to reduce token usage ofcourse. Also actively working on improving OCR for handwritten documents. Many teams asked specifically if they can use this on legacy handwritten documents, especially in the manufacturing domain.",

That’s usually where teams escape brittle template logic.\n\nWhere we’ve seen systems start breaking at scale isn’t in normal schema drift, it’s in entropy stacking:\nSo for example:\n- OCR noise + table fragmentation\n- Cross-page references + partial retrieval windows\n- Handwritten sections embedded in typed forms\n- Similar fields with subtly different semantics (“Order Date” vs “Invoice Date”)\n- Tables that change structure mid-document\n\nIndividually manageable. Together, they compound.\nThe teams that harden this layer well usually build a structured document stress corpus across entropy gradients:\n- Clean digital PDFs\n- Semi-structured exports\n- Table-dense multi-page financial docs\n- Low-res scanned contracts\n- OCR-heavy manufacturing forms\n- Handwritten annotations layered over structured layouts\n\nThen they version-test extraction fidelity across those buckets.\n\nEspecially if you’re minimizing LLM reliance, that corpus becomes your real regression harness.\n\nIf you’re moving into legacy + handwritten domains, that’s exactly where a coverage-controlled dataset saves months of reactive debugging.\n\nHappy to compare notes if you’re formalizing that layer, this is the kind of system that benefits massively from deliberate entropy coverage early.",

NLI edges are cool in theory but expensive to compute at scale and contradiction detection accuracy in legal language is still sketchy.\n\n  \nfor eval: curated multi-hop Q&A sets with lawyer review on the citations is the gold standard. automated metrics alone won't catch hallucinated citations that look plausible.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHave you ever had that *false confidence* when an LLM answers a technical question — only to later realize it confidently cited something incorrect? In legal domains, that confidence is the *number one danger*.\n\nWhile experimenting with a standard RAG setup, the system confidently quoted a statute that seemed plausible… until we realized that provision was **repealed in 2013**. The issue wasn’t just old training data — it was that the system relied on *frozen knowledge* or poorly verified external sources.\n\nThis was something I had seen mentioned multiple times in other posts where people shared examples of legal documents with entirely fabricated statutes. That motivated me — as an Italian developer — to solve this problem in the context of **Italian law, where the code is notoriously messy and updates are frequent**.\n\nTo address this structural failure, I built **Juris AI**.\n\n# The Problem with Frozen Knowledge\n\nMost RAG systems are static: you ingest documents once and *hope* they stay valid. That rarely works for legal systems, where legislation evolves constantly.\n\nJuris AI tackles this with two key principles:\n\n**Dynamic Synchronization**  \nEvery time the system starts, it performs an incremental alignment of its sources to ensure the knowledge base reflects the *current state of the law*, not a stale snapshot.\n\n**Data Honesty**  \nIf a norm is repealed or lacks verified text, the system does not guess. It *reports the boundary of verification* instead of hallucinating something plausible but wrong.\n\n# Under the Hood\n\nFor those interested in the architecture but not a research paper:\n\n**Hybrid Graph-RAG**  \nWe represent the legal corpus as a *dependency graph*. Think of this as a connected system where each article knows the law it belongs to and its references.\n\n**Deterministic Orchestration Layer**  \nA proprietary logic layer ensures generation *follows validated graph paths*.  \nFor example, if the graph marks an article as “repealed,” the system is *blocked from paraphrasing* outdated text and instead reports the current status.\n\n# Results (Benchmark Highlights)\n\nIn stress tests against traditional RAG models:\n\n* **Zero hallucinations on norm validation** — e.g., on articles with suffixes like *Art. 155-quinquies*, where standard models often cite repealed content, Juris AI always identified the correct current status.\n* **Cross-Database Precision** — in complex scenarios such as linking aggravated theft (Criminal Code *Art. 625*) to civil liability norms (Civil Code *Art. 2043+*), Juris AI reconstructed the entire chain with literal text, while other systems fell back to general paraphrase.\n\n# Why I’m Sharing This Here\n\nThis is *not* a product pitch. It’s a technical exploration and I’m curious:\n\n**From your experience with RAG systems, in which scenarios does a deterministic validation approach become** ***essential*** **versus relying on traditional semantic retrieval alone?**",

If Update X modifies Law Y, our Deterministic Orchestrator validates this link at the graph level, effectively 'flagging' the outdated version.\nEssentially, we don't let the LLM 'guess' applicability through semantic probability.

We built a **Hybrid Graph-RAG architecture (KuzuDB + LanceDB)** that enforces a deterministic gatekeeper logic. If a statute in the document has been repealed or modified, my system cross-references it with the graph's metadata and kills the hallucination before it even reaches the user.

Pure keyword search misses semantic meaning. Most RAG setups use one or the other, or bolt them together awkwardly.\n\n**Our approach — triple-layer retrieval:**\n\n1. **Keyword search** (Elasticsearch BM25) — handles exact matches, filters, structured queries\n2. **Semantic search** (dense vector embeddings) — catches meaning even when wording differs\n3. **Neural reranking** (cross-encoder) — takes the combined candidates and re-scores them with full query-document attention\n\n**Key learnings:**\n\n* Chunk size matters more than embedding model choice. We use 2000-character chunks with 10% overlap (200 characters). This gives\n* For technical docs, keyword search still wins \\~30% of the time over pure semantic. Don't drop it.\n* Reranking top-50 candidates is the sweet spot between latency and accuracy for most use cases.\n* Document parsing quality is the silent killer. Garbage in = garbage out, no matter how good your retrieval is.\n\n**Architecture:**\n\nUpload docs → Parse (PDF/DOCX/HTML → Markdown) → Chunk → Embed → Index into Elasticsearch (both BM25 and dense vector)\n\nAt query time: BM25 retrieval + vector retrieval → merge → neural rerank → top-K results\n\nWe've open-sourced the core retriever logic and also have a hosted platform at [retriever.denser.ai](http://retriever.denser.ai) if you want to try it without setting up infrastructure.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture or share more specific benchmarks.",

We find that the [Kanon 2 Embedder](https://isaacus.com/blog/introducing-kanon-2-embedder) legal embedding model, in particular, delivers an average accuracy boost of 17 points relative to Gemini 3.1 Pro, GPT-5.2, Text Embedding 3 Large, and Gemini Embedding 001.\n\nWe also infer based on a statistically robust hierarchical error analysis that most errors attributed to hallucinations in legal RAG systems are in fact triggered by retrieval failures.\n\nWe conclude that information retrieval sets the ceiling on the performance of modern legal RAG systems. While strong retrieval can compensate for weak reasoning, strong reasoning often cannot compensate for poor retrieval.\n\nIn the interests of transparency, we have openly released Legal RAG Bench on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/legal-rag-bench), added it to the [Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB)](https://isaacus.com/mleb), and have further presented the results of all evaluated models in an interactive explorer shown towards the end of this blog post. We encourage researchers to both scrutinize our data and build upon our novel evaluation methodology, which leverages full factorial analysis to enable hierarchical decomposition of legal RAG errors into hallucinations, retrieval failures, and reasoning failures.\n\n**Source:** [**https://isaacus.com/blog/legal-rag-bench**](https://isaacus.com/blog/legal-rag-bench)",

The methodology uses a factorial experiment, where each embedder and LLM is paired together, allowing for the estimation of the causal effect of each component in terms of the outcome variables of correctness and groundedness. \n\nThis type of estimation is only statistically sound if you can establish interlinked ground-truths for both the retriever and LLM at the question level. So if a RAG pipeline gets an answer wrong, we can examine whether the retreiver failed to get the 'gold passage' (this would plausibly explain the failure at the pipeline level), and if it did get the gold passage, how come the LLM was unable to come up with the correct answer despite having  all of the relevant context to do so. In the latter case, we can infer that the LLM's reasoning abilities are at fault, allowing for a clear decomposition, at the pipeline level, between reasoning and retrieval errors.\n\nJust because an intuition exists as popular advice, does not mean it is supported by the science or evidence. There's value in conclusively proving something that seems obvious, particularly if you can better understand the causal pattern and mechanics, allowing you to draw more sophistacted inferences from that seemingly obvious assumption.",

This breaks completely on structured documents like research papers.\n\nTraditional approach extracts PDFs into text strings (tables become garbled, figures disappear), then chunks into 512-token blocks with arbitrary boundaries. Ask \"What methodology did the authors use?\" and you get three disconnected paragraphs from different sections or papers.\n\nThe problem is research papers aren't random text. They're hierarchically organized (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion). Each section answers different question types. Destroying this structure makes precise retrieval impossible.\n\nI've been using structure-first extraction where documents get converted to JSON objects (sections, tables, figures) enriched with metadata like section names, content types, and semantic tags. The JSON gets flattened to natural language only for embedding while metadata stays available for filtering.\n\nThe workflow uses Kudra for extraction (OCR → vision-based table extraction → VLM generates summaries and semantic tags). Then LangChain agents with tools that leverage the metadata. When someone asks about datasets, the agent filters by content\\_type=\"table\" and semantic\\_tags=\"datasets\" before running vector search.\n\nThis enables multi-hop reasoning, precise citations (\"Table 2 from Methods section\" instead of \"Chunk 47\"), and intelligent routing based on query intent. For structured documents where hierarchy matters, metadata enrichment during extraction seems like the right primitive.\n\nAnyway thought I should share since most people are still doing naive chunking by default.",

      "text": "I've been researching RAG failure patterns for a few months and one thing kept coming up: most pipeline failures I looked at didn't trace back to the generation model. They traced back to how the data was chunked before retrieval even happened.\n\nThe pattern looks like this: vector search returns chunks that score high on relevance. The LLM generates a confident, well-formatted answer. But the answer is wrong because the chunk boundary split a piece of context that needed to stay together. Swapping in a stronger model doesn't help here. It just produces more convincing hallucinations from the same incomplete context.\n\nThree patterns that consistently helped in the systems I studied:\n\n**Parent-child chunking:** You index small child chunks for retrieval precision, but at generation time you pass the larger parent chunk so the model gets surrounding context. LlamaIndex has a good implementation of this with their `AutoMergingRetriever`. This alone caught a big chunk of \"almost right but wrong\" failures.\n\n**Hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25):** Pure embedding search misses exact-match terms. Product names, error codes, config values, specific IDs. Running BM25 keyword search alongside vector retrieval and merging results (Reciprocal Rank Fusion works well here) picks up what embeddings miss. Langchain and Haystack both support this pattern out of the box.\n\n**Self-correcting retrieval loops:** Before returning a response, the pipeline evaluates whether the answer is actually grounded in the retrieved chunks. If groundedness scores low, it reformulates the query and retries. The original Self-RAG paper by Asai et al. (2023) covers this well, and CRAG (Corrective RAG) by Yan et al. (2024) extends it further.\n\nI am just curious what others here have run into.   \nWhat has been your worst chunking or retrieval failure?   \nThe kind where everything looked fine on the retrieval side until you actually checked the output against the source documents.",

Had a pipeline where table rows kept getting split across two chunks. The embedding for each chunk was technically relevant to the query, retrieval scored it high, but the model was generating answers from half a table row. Took weeks to trace because the outputs looked confident and formatted correctly.\n\nThe fix wasn't a better chunking strategy though. It was fixing what went into the chunker. The source data was markdown with navigation elements, breadcrumbs, and related links all mixed in with the actual content. Once I switched to extracting just the content with typed fields (paragraphs, tables as arrays, headings as hierarchy), the chunking almost didn't matter anymore because each field was already a meaningful unit.\n\nSecond one was overlapping chunks that shared boilerplate text. Footer content appearing in 40% of chunks meant the embedding space was polluted. Retrieval kept returning chunks that scored high because they all shared the same footer, not because they were actually relevant.",

So I thought I’d share what worked, what didn’t, and where the remaining gains likely are.\n\nEvaluation & Known Limits\n\nEvaluation was conducted on the 150 public FinanceBench questions.\n\n# Overall outcome\n\n* \\~76% (114 questions) answered correctly\n* 36 failures total\n\n# Failure breakdown\n\n* **24 / 36 failures** were caused by incorrect evidence retrieval\n* **12 / 36 failures** occurred despite correct evidence being retrieved (reasoning / interpretation errors)\n\n# Failure patterns by question type\n\n* **Domain-relevant:** 18 failures\n* **Novel generated:** 14 failures\n* **Metrics-generated:** 4 failures\n\n# Key takeaway\n\n* Most errors stem from missing or noisy retrieval rather than generation quality.\n* When the correct evidence is retrieved, the system answers correctly in most cases, with remaining failures concentrated in interpretive or multi-step financial reasoning.\n* This outperforms the paper’s Shared Vector Store setup (\\~19%) and approaches Long Context performance (\\~79%) while staying within realistic retrieval constraints.\n\n# What didn’t work for me\n\n* Multi-query expansion and HYDE mostly introduced noise.\n* RRF fusion didn’t help because the individual retrievers weren’t strong enough to begin with.\n* Cross-encoder and LLM rerankers didn’t separate relevance well at larger candidate sizes.\n* Retrieving directly on raw page text performed worse than using summaries.\n\n# What did work\n\n* API-based embedding models performed noticeably better than open-source ones in this domain.\n* **Page summaries outperformed raw page text** because they compressed the financial signal (entities, metrics, events) into dense semantic form.\n* Moving from separate retrievers (BM25 + dense) to Qdrant hybrid search helped slightly, likely due to better score fusion and indexing behavior.\n\n# Current pipeline\n\n1. Receive user query\n2. Extract company names and relevant year window\n3. Rewrite the query into a retrieval-friendly form using an LLM\n4. Perform hybrid retrieval over **page-level summaries**\n5. Pass retrieved pages through an **LLM relevance judge** to remove clearly irrelevant evidence\n\nThis setup gives \\~72% exact page retrieval at top\\_k = 10.\n\nWhy I think 80–84% is reachable\n\nThe generator currently uses a simple zero-shot prompt. In about 12 cases, the system retrieved the correct evidence but still failed to produce the answer.  \nI expect stronger prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) would resolve many of these cases, but I wasn’t able to test this further due to token limits.\n\nI would love to hear some suggestion how I can make the retrieval even better, if you have any suggestion please do post it.\n\nI’m also applying for RAG / LLM internships right now, would appreciate any perspective on how teams view projects like this. - please do give feedback.\n\nlink - [https://github.com/aquib8112/FinanceBench\\_RAG](https://github.com/aquib8112/FinanceBench_RAG)",

I need your guys advice on the following architecture to ensure my RAG is not only just working but the answers are actually good.\n\nHere's my architecture flow:\n\n1. User will ask a question about some app, then have a router which uses keyword matching initially, falling back to LLM-based routing to determine which data source is the best one.\n2. Then do I need a query transformation like multi-querying and step back to get a better phrased question. Is this step necessary or its just a overhead?\n3. Then using [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) for vector database which will embed the documents/databases/links on start-up(currently basically creates a snapshot of the data on initial app start-up) and basically do semantic search  using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings.\n4. Cross-encoder model to score and filter documents from retrieved documents, based on query-document relevance, reducing hallucinations by excluding low-confidence results , taking the top 8 docs since creating a local version of my age old pc.\n5. Answer Generation\n6. On start-up, the application exports database tables and Confluence pages to JSON documents, which are then chunked into 512 even sized chunks with text overlapping and embedded into Qdrant alongside static JSON documents. Is this static method of snapshotting the DB or better creating a pipeline which will repeat after some days\n\n6)Here are my model choices are they good for my self hosted application\n\n* LLM: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`\n* Embedding: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n* Reranker: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6-v2` If not, what alternatives would you suggest?\n\nAny suggestions or things i can improve upon would be appreciated!",

After the initial key word match, you are going to send to LLM to determine which one is the best answer, but how a LLM knows?

Multi-source RAG needs per-source access controls and input validation before it's safe for internal users. The static snapshotting question is secondary to whether you have observability on retrieval failures and data freshness. Sent you a DM with more detail.",

      "text": "Recently, I built a workflow for a consulting firm that leverages AI combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fully automate knowledge management, transforming a fragmented document system into a centralized, actionable intelligence hub. The pipeline begins by ingesting structured and unstructured client reports, internal documents and market research into a vector database, then AI agents retrieve the most relevant information dynamically, reason over it and generate concise, actionable summaries or recommendations. By layering persistent memory, validation loops and workflow orchestration, the system doesn’t just fetch data it contextualizes it for consultants, flags potential conflicts, and tracks follow-ups automatically. This approach drastically reduced time spent searching across multiple tools, eliminated duplication errors and improved decision-making speed. What made it successful is the combination of semantic search, structured reasoning and AI-driven content validation, ensuring that consultants always have the most accurate, up-to-date insights at their fingertips. The outcome: higher productivity, faster client delivery and a knowledge system that scales with the firm’s growth.\nIf AI can summarize thousands of consulting documents in minutes, how much more value could your team create by focusing only on insights instead of searching for them?",

The responses are correct, just... robotic.\n\nI'm now considering adding a humanization layer as a post-processing step after the LLM generates responses but before they're sent to users. The goal would be adjusting tone and sentence flow so responses sound more natural and less like automated FAQ answers, while keeping the accuracy intact (same facts, same information).\n\n**What I'm exploring:**\n\n* Dedicated humanization tools (UnAIMyText, Rephrasy, Phrasly etc.)\n* Custom post-processing scripts that adjust sentence structure\n* Fine-tuning the LLM specifically on conversational responses\n* Different prompting strategies I might have missed\n\nThe main concern is latency, if a humanization step adds 200-300ms, is that acceptable for customer-facing chat?
