We build filling machinery to spec for major companies. We have unique models, so it’s hard to have service techs who know all lines. This knowledge gap is challenging when only one person knows a machine and its models. A group usually has to figure out what’s wrong when one person would know. I want a comprehensive knowledge base of our manuals, service reports, BOMs, and recorded calls that we’ll summarize. I’d love to get our cad drawings in there. \n\nWhat trusted sources did you use during your learning journey? What sources would you avoid if you knew then? Can’t wait to look your gits over. Thanks again\n\nEdit: it’s a mix of PDFs, solidworks slddrw > PDF, scanned pdf, and a lot of manuals are paper Belden the year 2008? lol we have been around a lot longer but there is a cutoff bc they went digital at some point. \n\nWe also ingested 4-5 companies in the last decade.",

Just good old RAG and good engineering around these constraints. Yet decent enough latency. \n\nStarted with naive RAG at 50%, ended at 91% on FinanceBench. The biggest wins in order:\n\n1. Separating text and table retrieval\n2. Cross-encoder reranking after aggressive retrieval (100 chunks down to 20)\n3. Hierarchical search over SEC sections instead of the full document\n4. Switching to agentic RAG with iterative retrieval and memory, each iteration builds on the previous answer\n\nThe constraint that shaped everything. To compensate I retrieved more chunks, use re ranker, and used a strong open source model.\n\nBenchmarked with LLM-as-judge against FinanceBench golden truths. The judge has real failure modes (rounding differences, verbosity penalties) so calibrating the prompt took more time than expected.\n\nFull writeup: [https://kamathhrishi.substack.com/p/building-agentic-rag-for-financial](https://kamathhrishi.substack.com/p/building-agentic-rag-for-financial)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/kamathhrishi/finance-agent](https://github.com/kamathhrishi/finance-agent)",

How do you handle xbrl and pure numeric tasks?\n\n\"Yet enough latency\" I wouldn't care too much about this. Given your stack, you are already normal-high latency, which isn't a bad thing because it's a research product (that I'd compare to smth like claude finance, right?)\n\nSeperating text and tables makes sense, as long as you don't lose the context (e.g. footnote(s) x table(s))\n\nThe hard part is to detect malformed tables, and tables that should be tables, but use divs etc.\n\nWhy do you use openai? It's not SOTA on what matters in  your stack\n\nOptimized pgvector becomes a bottleneck.\n\nDo you have a migration plan, or does it run smooth at 5M+ for you?",

              "text": "Very good questions. First let me clarify this is an open source project, not a product. There will be compromises. People pay $$$$$$ for these kinds of AI tools just because those AI tools source quality data too. 1) open source parser? I can’t spend $$$$ for all filings to make sure everything is a hundred percent accurate? I don’t have the budget. I am a indie developer who did this on the side. Processing all companies sec filings and making it available is a full time job which I don’t have the money and bandwidth for 2) I use the cheapest one api ninjas. They are decent. Never really saw any issues so far. It’s usually delay in publishing the transcript that makes it an issue. 3) maintaining your own news service is very very difficult 4) yes, it’s actually much easier to do that. In fact it’s much easier for those tasks, I had a parser that just pulled these up from tables before. That was mostly for stock screening. Also because it reduces latency since now it searches raw sec 10k filings and so on. 5) yes pg vector works smoothly 6) I dint use OpenAI, I used qwen235B. But, I might use Gemini/openai soon. You can always switch the models and use your own version. I did try running with Claude but it’s very expensive for me to maintain and run the benchmarks or even test in general.",

      "text": "I've been building a chatbot product (bestchatbot.io, works on Discord and websites) where users upload their docs and the bot answers questions from that content. Wanted to share some stuff I learned going from \"cool demo\" to \"people are actually paying for this\" because the gap between those two is way bigger than I expected.\n\n**Vanilla RAG gets you maybe 30% of the way there (no joke)**\n\nWhen I started I did the standard thing. Chunk docs, embed them, retrieve top-k, stuff into context, generate. It worked great on demos. Then real users uploaded real docs and it fell apart. The problem isn't retrieval in isolation, it's that real documents have structure, context, and relationships between sections that get destroyed when you just chunk and embed.\n\n**What actually mattered in production**\n\nWithout going too deep into our specific implementation, here's what moved the needle the most:\n\n* **Document quality > retrieval sophistication.** I spent weeks tweaking retrieval and got maybe 10% better. Then I added better doc preprocessing and got a bigger jump overnight. Garbage in garbage out is painfully real.\n* **Evaluation is everything.** You can't improve what you can't measure. I built a testing interface where I could ask questions and see exactly which sources the bot cited. That feedback loop was more valuable than any architecture change.\n* **Users don't care about your retrieval method.** They care about two things: did it answer correctly, and how fast. Our response time is 10-20 seconds which people complain about constantly. Nobody has ever asked me what embedding model we use.\n* **The knowledge base needs to be treated as a living thing.** We added a system where the bot learns from moderator corrections in Discord automatically. That continuous improvement loop has been surprsingly impactful compared to just static doc retrieval.\n\nMost of the accuracy gains came from boring stuff. Better chunking, better preprocessing, better prompting, testing obsessively. The architecture matters but it's maybe 30% of the outcome. The other 70% is everything around it.\n\nCurious what other people building production RAG systems have found. What moved the needle most for your accuracy?",

      "text": "We all know AI agents suffer from memory problems. Not the kind where they forget between sessions but something like context dilution. I kept running into this with my agents (it's very annoying tbh). Early in the conversation everything's sharp but after enough back and forth the model just stops paying attention to early context. It's buried so deep it might as well not exist.\n\nSo I started building a four-layer memory system that treats conversations as structured knowledge instead of just raw text. The idea is you extract what actually matters from a convo, store it in different layers depending on what it is, then retrieve selectively based on what the user is asking (when needed).\n\nDifferent questions need different layers. If someone asks for an exact quote you pull from verbatim. If they ask about preferences you grab facts and summaries. If they're asking about people or places you filter by entity metadata.\n\nI used workflows to handle the extraction automatically instead of writing a ton of custom parsing code. You just configure components for summarization, fact extraction, and entity recognition. It processes conversation chunks and spits out all four layers. Then I store them in separate ChromaDB collections.\n\nBuilt some tools so the agent can decide which layer to query based on the question. The whole point is retrieval becomes selective instead of just dumping the entire conversation history into every single prompt.\n\nTested it with a few conversations and it actually maintains continuity properly. Remembers stuff from early on, updates when you tell it something new that contradicts old info, doesn't make up facts you never mentioned.\n\nAnyway figured I'd share since context dilution seems like one of those problems everyone deals with but nobody really talks about.",

If you have a GPU `bge-large` is a noticeable step up\n\nVector DB -Chroma to get started fast, Qdrant if you want something closer to production behavior. At small scale both are fine, FAISS works too but you end up writing more boilerplate around it\n\nLLM: Ollama + Mistral 7B or Llama 3 8B locally is way more sustainable than chasing free hosted tiers that rate limit you quickly once you start iterating. If your machine can't run it, Groq's free tier is a decent hosted fallback if you can live with the limits\n\nIngestion: [Unstructured.io](http://Unstructured.io) (open source) for PDFs and web pages, recursive splitting around 500 tokens (\\~1-2k chars) with some overlap as a starting point.\n\nThis stack works well for static documents but where it falls apart is conversational data like email threads, Slack exports etc. Standard chunking destroys who said what and when, so you get chunks that look right but your LLM starts confidently attributing decisions to the wrong person or resurfacing stuff that was walked back three messages later. I work on this exact problem at iGPT (igpt.ai), happy to share notes if that's relevant to what you're building.\n\nFor repos, LangChain's `rag-from-scratch` series and LlamaIndex's starter tutorials are both solid walkthroughs.",

This effectively \"chokes\" the LLM’s context window with redundant data, leaving no room for actual diverse information.\n\nIn my latest write-up, I break down the architecture to move past this:\n\n* **The Problem:** Why kNN/Cosine Similarity alone creates a retrieval bottleneck.\n* **The Fix:** Implementing Hybrid Search (**BM25 + kNN**) for better keyword/semantic balance.\n* **Diversity:** Using Maximal Marginal Relevance (**MMR**) to ensure the top-k results aren't just 5 versions of the same paragraph.\n* **Implementation:** How to leverage the native Vector functionality in **Elasticsearch** to handle this at scale.\n\nI’ve included some benchmarks and sample code for those looking to optimize their retrieval layer.\n\n**Full technical breakdown here:**[https://medium.com/@dhairyapandya2006/going-beyond-cosine-similarity-hidden-bottleneck-for-production-grade-r-a-g-437ae0eaafa5](https://medium.com/@dhairyapandya2006/going-beyond-cosine-similarity-hidden-bottleneck-for-production-grade-r-a-g-437ae0eaafa5)\n\nI’d love to hear how others are handling diversity in their retrieval- are you guys sticking to Re-rankers, or are you seeing better ROI by optimizing the initial search query?",

If your system intends to solve QA, technical/code based data retrieval most likely BM25 will provide better results, but if use case is enterprise/business questions then shifting towards semantic will make more sense. These stuff you can test on golden dataset during configuration and find out what’s the best parameters for customer given dataset. \n\nLast system i tested provided ndcg 0.74 on retrieving information and we gained very small to almost none improvement by applying rerankers thus plug out that component in order to reduce latency.. again data and/or user requirements dependent.\n\n\nChunk size.. again dependent on input data a lot. Are you working with long law-based documents or are you working with small-FAQ type of data. Each size will have its pros and cons depending on the problem you are trying to solve. Don’t believe if people say 1024 is best or 512 is best. You have to experiment. \n\nLastly, hyde will not cause latency issues if you apply it right, hope above points help you",

Was that already with hybrid retrieval, or on top of pure vector? I'm wondering if there's a ceiling effect where if your initial retrieval is already good enough, reranking just adds latency for marginal gains.\n\nAnd good call on golden datasets — I've been building mine manually but it's tedious.

      "text": "Hey everyone! I've been working on **Agentic RAG for Dummies**, an open-source project that shows how to build a modular Agentic RAG system with LangGraph — and today I'm releasing v2.0.\n\nThe goal of the project is to bridge the gap between basic RAG tutorials and real, extensible agent-driven systems. It supports any LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and includes a step-by-step notebook for learning + a modular Python project for building.\n\n## What's new in v2.0\n\n🧠 **Context Compression** — The agent now compresses its working memory when the context exceeds a configurable token threshold, keeping retrieval loops lean and preventing redundant tool calls. Both the threshold and the growth factor are fully tunable.\n\n🛑 **Agent Limits & Fallback Response** — Hard caps on tool invocations and reasoning iterations ensure the agent never loops indefinitely. When a limit is hit, instead of failing silently, the agent falls back to a dedicated response node and generates the best possible answer from everything retrieved so far.\n\n## Core features\n\n- Hierarchical indexing (parent/child chunks) with hybrid search via Qdrant\n- Conversation memory across questions\n- Human-in-the-loop query clarification\n- Multi-agent map-reduce for parallel sub-query execution\n- Self-correction when retrieval results are insufficient\n- Works fully local with Ollama\n\nThere's also a Google Colab notebook if you want to try it without setting anything up locally.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/GiovanniPasq/agentic-rag-for-dummies",

      "text": "Recently, I built a workflow for a consulting firm that leverages AI combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fully automate knowledge management, transforming a fragmented document system into a centralized, actionable intelligence hub. The pipeline begins by ingesting structured and unstructured client reports, internal documents and market research into a vector database, then AI agents retrieve the most relevant information dynamically, reason over it and generate concise, actionable summaries or recommendations. By layering persistent memory, validation loops and workflow orchestration, the system doesn’t just fetch data it contextualizes it for consultants, flags potential conflicts, and tracks follow-ups automatically. This approach drastically reduced time spent searching across multiple tools, eliminated duplication errors and improved decision-making speed. What made it successful is the combination of semantic search, structured reasoning and AI-driven content validation, ensuring that consultants always have the most accurate, up-to-date insights at their fingertips. The outcome: higher productivity, faster client delivery and a knowledge system that scales with the firm’s growth.\nIf AI can summarize thousands of consulting documents in minutes, how much more value could your team create by focusing only on insights instead of searching for them?",

In my opinion, you can create a test dataset from your exam or even from your knowledge of the docs (corpus). Then, run testing on GPT 5.2 and get the answers and also with your system. Now you have benchmark from gpt or other models and your system, so you can check if the results are good or not. We call it the test phase or making a test dataset. This gives you the power to assess your system. (Usually, you can see the baselines on the academic papers that they need to improve the baseline to compete with other approaches.)\n\nAlso, I would recommend using Knowledge Graph if you have relational data, such as something belongs to one paper/book, and there is some other evidence on the other resources.\n\n  \nSome tips and tricks to increase the retrieval phase:\n\n1. Use task-specific embedding models such as [https://huggingface.co/abhinand/MedEmbed-base-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/abhinand/MedEmbed-base-v0.1)\n\n2. Use other vector DBs like Milvus. Vector DB is so easy to set up, but it does not provide good accuracy.\n\n3. Check the knowledge graph.",

Mostly legal and compliance docs so accuracy actually matters for my use case.\n\nMy offline eval was looking pretty solid. RAGAS scores were decent, faithfulness sitting around 0.87, context recall above 0.9. I shipped it feeling good about it.\n\nThen users started flagging answers. The pipeline was pulling the right chunks but still getting conclusions wrong sometimes. Not obvious hallucinations, more like the model was connecting retrieved context incorrectly for certain document structures. My benchmark never caught it because my test set didn't really reflect the docs users were actually uploading.\n\nThat's the thing nobody tells you. Your test set is a snapshot. Production keeps changing.\n\nHere's what I went through trying to fix it:\n\n**Manual test set curation** - I started reviewing failing queries and adding them to my golden dataset. Helped a bit but honestly didn't scale at all.\n\n**Langfuse** - added tracing so I could actually see which chunks were being retrieved per query. This alone was a big deal for debugging. Still needed manual review to spot patterns though.\n\n**Confident AI** - started running faithfulness and relevance metrics directly on live traces. The thing that actually saved me time was failing traces getting auto-flagged and curated into a dataset automatically so I wasn't doing it by hand.\n\n**Prompt tweaking** - turned out a lot of failures were fixable once I could actually see the pattern clearly.\n\nHonestly even just adding proper tracing was the biggest unlock for me. Going in blind was the real problem. Evaluation on top just made it less random.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this on domain specific or inconsistent document formats?",

      "text": "I chose Elasticsearch over Pinecone for RAG. Here's the honest breakdown.\n\nEveryone building a RAG app hits the same fork: dedicated vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate) or just use Elasticsearch?\n\nMost tutorials default to Pinecone. I went a different direction and want to share why.\n\nThe core problem with dedicated vector DBs\n\nRAG isn't purely a vector search problem. In practice you need:\n\n\\- Semantic similarity (vectors)\n\n\\- Keyword relevance (BM25)\n\n\\- Metadata filtering\n\nPinecone gives you vectors + basic filters. The moment you need hybrid search and you will, because pure vector retrieval misses exact matches constantly, you're bolting on another system.\n\nElasticsearch does all three natively in one query using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. No extra infrastructure, no glue code.\n\nThe black box problem\n\nWhen Pinecone retrieval is bad, your options are: tweak embeddings, adjust top\\_k, and hope. You can't inspect query execution or see why documents scored the way they did.\n\nElasticsearch shows its work. You can see BM25 vs vector score contributions, profile queries, set up Kibana dashboards. When something breaks you can actually debug it.\n\nElastic Cloud removes the old objection\n\nThe classic knock on Elasticsearch was ops pain — shard management, rolling upgrades, cluster tuning. Elastic Cloud handles all of that. Autoscaling, automated snapshots, one-click upgrades. You get the power without babysitting a cluster.\n\nPinecone scales well too, but it only scales your vector index. Everything else still needs separate infrastructure.\n\nGCovers hybrid search setup, kNN index config, and a working RAG query in \\~15 minutes on Elastic Cloud.\n\nCurious if anyone else has gone this route or stuck with Pinecone what pushed your decision?",

      "text": "Every other post in this sub is \"my RAG pipeline hallucinates\" and the replies are always the same: try a different chunking strategy, use a better embedding model, add reranking, etc.\n\nNobody ever says \"go look at what your PDF parser actually output.\"\n\nI did. I took 3,830 real-world PDFs (veraPDF corpus, Mozilla pdf.js tests, DARPA SafeDocs) and ran them through the major Python parsers. Not cherry-picked -- government filings, academic papers, scanned forms, edge cases from the 90s, encrypted files, CJK text, the works.\n\n    Library      Mean     p99      Pass rate\n    ──────────────────────────────────────────\n    pdf_oxide    0.8ms     9ms     100%\n    PyMuPDF      4.6ms    28ms     99.3%\n    pypdfium2    4.1ms    42ms     99.2%\n    pdfminer    16.8ms   134ms     98.8%\n    pdfplumber  23.2ms   189ms     98.8%\n    pypdf       12.1ms    97ms     98.4%\n\nHere's the thing nobody talks about: a 98.4% pass rate on 3,830 docs means \\~60 documents that silently fail. They crash, hang, or return empty strings. Those docs never enter your vector store. When a user asks about content from one of those documents, the retrieval step finds nothing relevant, so the LLM fills in the gap with a confident hallucination.\n\nYou debug the prompt. You debug the retrieval. You never think to check whether the document was even indexed.\n\nI built pdf\\_oxide (Rust, Python bindings) partly because I kept running into this. The thing that made the biggest difference for me wasn't the speed, it was the Markdown output with heading detection:\n\n        from pdf_oxide import PdfDocument\n    \n        doc = PdfDocument(\"paper.pdf\")\n        md = doc.to_markdown(0, detect_headings=True)\n\nYou get actual structure back. Headings, paragraphs, sections. Chunk on section boundaries instead of arbitrary token windows. Each chunk ends up being about one topic instead of the tail end of one section glued to the beginning of another. Retrieval precision went up noticeably for me once I switched to heading-based splits.\n\nBuilt-in OCR too (PaddleOCR via ONNX Runtime). It auto-detects scanned pages and falls back. No Tesseract, no subprocess shelling out, no extra config.\n\n        pip install pdf_oxide\n\nMIT licensed. No AGPL. Runs entirely locally.\n\nLimitations I won't hide: table extraction is basic compared to pdfplumber. There are \\~10 edge-case PDFs that still have minor extraction issues (tracked on GitHub). WASM support isn't done yet.\n\n[github.com/yfedoseev/pdf\\_oxide](http://github.com/yfedoseev/pdf_oxide)   \nDocs: [oxide.fyi](http://oxide.fyi)\n\nGenuine question for this sub: how many of you have actually diffed your parser's output against the source PDF? I'm starting to think a lot of the \"retrieval quality\" problems people debug for weeks are just garbage going in at step one.",

      "text": "I’m looking for a \"no-BS\" reality check from anyone running RAG on top of large Document Management Systems (100k+ files).\n\nWe are looking at existing agents like M-Files Aino. Will test this in a few weeks. For another more custom eQMS system (with well-developed API endpoints), we are looking at a custom solution to manage a large repository of around 200k pdfs. My concern is whether the tech is actually there to support high-stakes QMS workflows \n\nIs the current tech stack (RAG/Agentic) actually precise enough for \"needle-in-a-haystack\" queries? If a user asks for a specific tolerance value in a 50-page spec, does it reliably find it, or does it give a \"semantic hallucination\"?\n\nAuthorization: How do you handle document permissions? If I have 100k files with complex authorizations, how do you sync those permissions to the AI's vector index in real-time so users don't \"see\" data they aren't cleared?\n\nAll in all, is the tech there for this or should we wait another year?",

Then you have to translate the needs to measurable metrics If you have no measurable metric you cannot determine the quality at all.\n\nPerceived quality in information retrieval heavily depends on both the users' needs and the data you have. Long, windy, technical manuals are very different to process than e.g. Xwitter data or Reddit posts.\n\nParticularly for technical manuals you may consider not using RAG at all, but instead use vector (or, usually better: hybrid) search instead. So, you let the user decide what search result is the right one, but improve the search quality by going hybrid.\n\nAnother very important point that many engineers somehow miss: Design the UI first before thinking about quality of the information retrieval system. Why you should do that is: Almost always you can have users apply filters and those filters will remove a large part of the documents in your search space. Obviously, if you cut down 200k docs to only 5k ones, that's a massive gain in reduction of the search space, and it helps your information retrieval system massively in finding the right answer. The more filter people set, the easier it gets.\n\nRAG on gigantic datasets ***can*** work. That's what [Perplexity.ai](http://Perplexity.ai) shows us. But be prepared to have to put a lot of work into engineering. Engineering must be hypothesis-based, and hypotheses must be tested, measured, and then either rejected or accepted. That's an iterative, measured approach. Typically in RAG setups, 20% is the technology setup itself, and 80% is understanding and tweaking the data and indexes.",

My advice for you is determining who your core ICP is first and REALLY stress testing that before figuring out effective GTM channels. Document intelligence is very important, especially in an age when non-technical founders are vibe coding vertical software in a weekend that work great in demos but fail spectacularly in production. Even within that domain though you can segment your market to figure out who exactly you want to sell to: non-technical folks? CTOs? Legal tech companies? Construction? etc. The answer to these questions is a combination of your product's strengths and your comforts as a salesperson. As a seemingly qualified MLE, you might prefer to sell to other engineers, or maybe you feel you'd fare better with other audiences - all that is your call. Happy to discuss some more and brainstorm if you'd like to DM me - we infra folk need to stick together! Wishing you the best.",
