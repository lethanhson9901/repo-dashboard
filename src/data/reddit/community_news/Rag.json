Larger chunks = more context = better recall. That's a size effect, not a strategy effect.\n\n**When I controlled for actual chunk size (\\~3000 chars across strategies), token chunking matched or beat sentence chunking.**\n\n**Correlation between chunk size and recall: r=0.74 (HotpotQA), r=0.92 (Natural Questions).**\n\nCurious if others have seen similar results or if this breaks down on different datasets.",

      "text": "Hey :)\n\nSome time ago I wanted to learn the fundamentals of RAG, and I started with chunking. Greg Kamradt’s tool ([https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)) helped me understand the basics, and it was a great starting point.\n\nWhile digging deeper, especially when reading papers like [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997), I noticed that **semantic** and **agentic** chunking are showing up more often and are getting adopted in new research. But I couldn’t find any visualizers that supported those methods, so I tried to build one myself.\n\nI put together **Chunking-Vis**, a small web tool for anyone who wants to explore and learn how different chunking strategies behave. I think it can be especially helpful if you’re new to RAG and want to see how chunks are formed before they’re sent to an embedding model or retrieval pipeline.\n\n# What Chunking-Vis supports\n\n* Character-level chunking\n* Word-level chunking\n* Token-level chunking (GPT-4o tokenizer)\n* Recursive chunking\n* Semantic chunking\n* Agentic chunking (Phi-3 powered, available locally on CPU)\n\nThere’s also a **Snapshot** feature that lets you save and compare different chunking configurations side-by-side, which can make experimentation easier.\n\n# Live Demo\n\n[https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app](https://chunkingvis-production.up.railway.app)  \n(Agentic chunking is disabled in the demo due to compute limits.)\n\n# Github Repository\n\n[https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis](https://github.com/MichalZnalezniak/Chunking-Vis)\n\nHope some of you find it useful — and if you have ideas, feedback, or suggestions, please let me know.

You can deploy your fine-tuned model anywhere: transformers, LangChain, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp etc.\n\nFine-tuning embedding models can improve retrieval & RAG by aligning vectors to your domain-specific notion of similarity, improving search, clustering, and recommendations on your data.\n\nWe provided many free notebooks with 3 main use-cases to utilize. \n\n* Try the [EmbeddingGemma notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/EmbeddingGemma_(300M).ipynb) in a free Colab T4 instance\n* We support ModernBERT, Qwen Embedding, Embedding Gemma, MiniLM-L6-v2, mpnet, BGE and all other models are supported automatically!\n\n⭐ Guide + notebooks: [https://unsloth.ai/docs/new/embedding-finetuning](https://unsloth.ai/docs/new/embedding-finetuning)\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)\n\nThanks so much guys! :)\n\n",

If the model never sees even a compressed view of the document, it’ll confidently answer based on vibes.\n\nWhat’s worked for me is separating understanding from storage. On ingestion, I generate a thin semantic layer, section summaries, key entities, numbers, obligations, relationships. That layer is small, fast, and always available to the agent. The heavy JSON stays out of the loop unless the agent explicitly needs to verify something.\nTrying to RAG directly over deeply nested extracted data is usually a dead end. It’s slow, and the signal to noise ratio is awful. Hierarchical retrieval helps a lot, first decide where to look, then pull only that slice, then answr. Latency stays low because most questions never touch the raw data.\n\nFor financial or forms heavy docs, I often skip RAG entirely and just query normalized fields. It’s boring, but it’s correct. RAG is great for “explain” questions, terrible for “calculate” ones.\n\nI’m building something in this space too, and the big unlock was treating documents like evolving knowledge objects, not blobs you fetch.

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nWe're a small team (not many engineers) building a RAG system for legal documents(contracts, NDAs, terms of service, compliance docs, etc.).\n\nThe multilingual challenge:\n\nOur documents span multiple languages (EN, FR, DE, ES, IT, etc.).\n\n·         Some tenants have docs in a single language (e.g., all French)\n\n·         Some tenants have mixed-language corpora\n\n·         Some individual documents are bilingual\n\n \n\nFor legal docs, hybrid search (FT search and dense vectors with re rank) seems to be a good candidate for retrieval. One issue I saw is that most implementations relies on language dependent solutions for FT search.\n\nApproaches I've seen discussed:\n\n·         Per-language BM25 indexes: Detect language, route to the right index with proper stemmer. Seems correct but adds complexity. How do you handle bilingual documents?\n\n·         Language-agnostic tokenization: Skip stemming, just split on whitespace. Loses morphological matching but works across languages.\n\n·         BGE-M3 sparse vectors: Supposedly handles 100+ languages natively for both dense and sparse. But does it require GPU? What's the cost/perf tradeoff vs traditional BM25?\n\n·         Translate everything to English: Normalize the knowledge base. Feels wrong for legal where original wording matters and adds a translation failure mode.\n\n·         Dense-only + reranker : Skip BM25 entirely, use strong multilingual embeddings (BGE-M3, multilingual-e5) and rerank. Loses exact keyword matching.\n\n·         Qdrant's native BM25 : Qdrant now has built-in BM25 with language configs. Anyone using this for multilingual? How does it compare to dedicated solutions?\n\n \n\nWe’d rather use managed services when available in the cloud provider we chose (scaleway).\n\nOur constraints:\n\n* Managed PostgreSQL for app data : only supports pgvector, not pg\\_search/ParadeDB. Would require to self-host a postgres for additional extensions.\n* Prefer simplicity: Leaning toward Qdrant over Milvus since it seems easier to operate.\n* Cost-conscious: GPU-heavy solutions for embeddings are a concern.\n* Multi-tenant: Each tenant's documents are typically in one consistent language, but not always.\n\nAnyone would like to share their experience or thoughts on this challenge?  \n",

Cool for global search, but edges = ingestion-time guesses → bias for new intents.\n\n**Core Brittleness**\nFrom my [r/programming post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pz6pj3/graphrag_is_just_graph_databases_all_over_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): Nodes=facts, edges=guesses. Scoped query-time inference (BM25+vectors+rerank) often better for ambiguous RAG (no freeze).\n\n**Pushback & Predictability**\nComments nailed it: auditable edges > opaque LLMs (prod win). Dynamic rebuilds? Viable, but maintenance cost high vs simple hybrid RAG.\n\nShines: stable domains (regs/code deps).

You’re sort of freezing assumptions that may not match what people will ask later.\n\nBut it’s very use-case dependent. For code, I honestly think a dependency graph is pretty much **non-optional**. Calls/imports/inheritance aren’t opinions — they’re real structure. Without graph expansion you often end up with random snippets, and vanilla RAG struggles badly with questions like “where does this start?” or “what does this change affect?”, because you’re missing the whole call chain.",

That thread, along with related discussions, helped isolate the issue to what seems like a missing graph category.\n\nInteresting to see this resurfacing now. I’ve just published a timestamped preprint defining a *Deterministic Domain Graph (DDG)* category:  \n[https://zenodo.org/records/18373053](https://zenodo.org/records/18373053)\n\nI’m currently working on a framework to construct DDGs in practice, and early experiments suggest this is feasible even for large real-world codebases.",

              "text": "Thanks for sharing the article — honestly pretty interesting read.\n\nThis is actually close to where I ended up while building a **code RAG** system. I’m trying to keep the *edges* deterministic + auditable (calls/imports/inheritance, ReadsFrom/WritesTo, FKs etc.), and I’m really trying to avoid freezing “LLM-guessed” relations during ingestion.\n\nI kind of treat vectors as *ranking / fuzzy recall*, but the graph as the closed-world structure that should rebuild the same way every time. For example I force stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and I also add missing TABLE nodes so the SQL graph is actually closed (nodes + edges), not half implicit.\n\nOne thing I’d highlight though: **heuristics ≠ inference**. I’m fine with fixed, testable heuristics (like inline SQL detection) — even if it’s not perfect, it’s still deterministic and you can regression-test it. What I’m trying to avoid is context-dependent enrichment that changes depending on the model/prompt or whatever the “best guess” is this week.\n\nIf you’re curious, this repo is just the **indexing part** (Roslyn/.NET side). The actual RAG pipeline / retrieval is in a separate project:  \n[https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer](https://github.com/RusieckiRoland/RoslynIndexer)\n\nAlso curious how you want to handle schema evolution / versioning for DDGs on big real repos — do you version the domain spec per build, kind of like a compiler?",

Will dive into it right away.\n\nu/RolandRu, super appreciate you sharing your setup and the RoslynIndexer repo! Exactly aligns with what I've been thinking: keep the graph as closed-world, deterministic structure (hard facts like calls/imports/inheritance/ReadsFrom/WritesTo/FKs), and treat vectors as fuzzy recall/ranking. Love the emphasis on heuristics (fixed, testable, regression-friendly) vs. context-dependent LLM guesses—that's the brittleness killer.Your approach to forcing stable outputs (sorted nodes/edges) and adding missing nodes for closed structure is smart—avoids the \"half implicit\" mess. Curious on a couple things:\n\n\\* How do you handle schema evolution/versioning in big repos? Per-build domain spec like a compiler, or something else?\n\n\\* Have you seen measurable wins on those chain-tracing queries (e.g., impact analysis) vs. vanilla RAG?\n\n\\* Any thoughts on hybrid with dynamic rebuilds for evolving code, or is pure deterministic the way?\n\nThis ties perfectly into what I'm exploring next: code itself as frozen presuppositions/dependencies, and debug as closing the gap to reality. If you're open, I'd love to reference/link your repo/preprint in upcoming posts (with credit, of course).\n\nThanks again—threads like this are why I love posting here!",

Adds slight latency (Cerebras is nice if you can use it), but managing context windows is the name of the game. \n\nOf course that’s after data ingestion pipes. I recommend doing it multiple ways. For PDFs, for example, we break it into 3 page chunks, have an LLM do semantic chunking of the extracted text, we turn those same 3 page chunks into images and have a vLM create semantic chunks, a few other tricks… then we use a small model to coalesce them (same with PowerPoints, word docs, architectural/engineering drawings), and then vectorize those semantic chunks after it’s been been viewed a few different ways along with a set of questions that might be asked of those chunks based on the industry/business/workflows you have… then graph them… we also use KBLaM and a few other custom models with dynamic knowledge base loading based on the query (the KBs are built dynamically also)\n\nThis is gold. Complicated gold, but gold nonetheless. Write it down 🤣🙃. Otherwise it’s magic. Works better than anything else we’ve tested. I’m leaving a lot out but there’s a lot there also.\n\nDiffMem and MemVid are interesting. RAG at scale is one of the few things in life where more complicated is better. Sigh… lol so hard.",

Models are becoming commodities; *context engineering* isn’t.\n\nCurious if others are measuring success with task completion / decision confidence rather than traditional IR metrics?",

Basically lets you do document search and context retrieval entirely offline, no cloud APIs required by default.\n\nIt uses local embeddings so you don't have to pay OpenAI or Cohere, and it's built on this fast storage engine that does O(1) lookups. Performance seems decent - about 5x faster than what I was getting with cloud alternatives when I tested it.\n\nCompared to cloud services like Pinecone that charge $70-200/month, this is completely free. Plus you get better speed since everything runs locally and your data never leaves your machine. + no cloud cost \n\nThe main issue I was trying to solve is that if you want privacy with your RAG setup, you usually end up with something slow or complicated. This keeps everything local but still performs pretty well.\n\nWould people actually use something like this? I feel like most RAG tutorials just assume you'll use Pinecone + OpenAI, but maybe there's demand for a local option that doesn't suck.\n\nDownsides: local embeddings aren't as good as the latest OpenAI models, and it depends on your hardware. But no monthly bills and your data stays private.\n\nWhat do you think - overkill or actually useful? Have you run into the privacy vs performance trade-off with RAG?",

The \"non-vector\" retrieval options (Langextract, PageIndex etc), right now frequently fail on production data (complex tables are a good example of something thats still a very hard problem and something I have spent a non-trivial amount of time solving for my system).",

Maybe another step would be to create detailed skill or rule for agent how to use this graph, because for LLM it is just graph, it doesn't know what to do with it and still reads the files to context for it's tasks.\nAs for me even better results was when I wrote spring documentation MCP, then even weak models become stronger.\n\nAnother though, you don't need to support All frameworks, java specific would be enough for commercial product, just choose this niche and keep going, enterprise clients will pay for it.\n\nFor patterns you need to ask LLM to write breaf reviews for graph chains, it could cost 20-100$, depending on repo and model. Also write custom wights algorithms, but it's rather doubtful, because it could work great for 1 project and can harm for another.\nI was participating in similar project for Cobol, and can say you are in the right direction and have similar problems ☺️",

My main concern is the ingestion/chunking process (garbage in, garbage out).\n\nLooking at OCR results I can see that a paragraph may have 1 line that lands on the next page, or that a bullet list goes across 2 pages or that structurally few headings are used.\n\nFor no good reason semantic chunking has stood out as something that makes logical sense as I just want chunks that in isolation make sense, and hopefully side-step the need for overlap etc. \n\nOne downside to this I can imagine however is that a chunk can be semantically complete, but could otherwise refer to an exception clause. Without both you could end up with poor context to feed an LLM when answering a user query.\n\n  \nSo back to the original question, for the stated use case does anyone have a pattern they would use here?",

At top-k=5, that's 17,500 chars in your LLM context before you've added the prompt. If that's fine for your use case, go for it.\n\nTL;DR: Sentence chunking works. Now you know \\*why\\* it works.",
