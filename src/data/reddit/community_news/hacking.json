Hackers stole my accounts and I would make new ones consistently creating content on the early days of the internet at a super young age for 21 years about now. I created emails and intellectual property connected to those emails  knowing I’d be rich. I had it all stolen. Billions. I used to be Shedletsky, all his alts. Over 63 people stole my accounts and impersonated me. I created Sol’s RNG. I used to run the Bloxy Awards. I have had full account takeover by the cybercriminal organizations to the extreme lengths. My name is Alex. I used to be AbstractAlex. Rukiryo, ninjabart122, Stickmasterluke (while admin because Eric and Dave found out who I was.) i have periodically got hacked and had times where I logged back into my accounts and it would be a huge big thing but in reality it is the biggest coverup in history for stolen IP. I desperately need people to expose the truth because all the authorities are trying to cover it up it seems. Please help me. I was Telamon on Roblox.

Excellent work!\n\nI have a a few ideas about the image recognition `1` vs `l` task.  \n\nIt reminds me very much of a \"Raven's Progressive Matrices\" project where I was provided a matrix of shapes (each entry in the matrix referring to a `.png`) and the goal was to predict the final shape in the given matrix, containing an implicit sequence. \n\n As such, one of the sub-tasks was \"how do you compare two shapes (images) for similarity?\"  \n\nAs a simple example, consider two characters surrounded by a field of white-space and comparing them by how much they \"overlap\" -- the best candidates have the most overlap (intersection of pixels between two pixel matrices (images)).  \n\nTo do this quickly you can use Jaccard Similarity (but there are other techniques as well).  `J(A,B) = |A∩B| / |A∪B|`\n\n\nPerhaps there could be some forward path here.  In your case, you can produce two \"ground truths\" for comparison since you know the type face.  At a minimum, it seems like it could reduce some amount of ambiguity.",

It's a RAT called NetSupport, it ultimately will callback to the attacker and give them complete access to your machine. So keep that in mind as you're evaluating what you want to do next. Again, I think Bitdefender probably did its job but you can judge your own risk profile. neservice.exe is evading Bitdefender on VirusTotal, so if it got to that stage you may be infected. I would emphasize that if the PowerShell execution got blocked, you got very lucky because the final payload \\*would\\* likely have gotten you and you'd be completely pwned.",

          "text": "TLDR: We're securing it now and the quantum era where RSA is \"broken\" is a ways out still, especially for RSA 4096. Also AES can't be broken by quantum.\n\nSo stuff like RSA 2048 is at risk but the industry has long since recommended against its use in the early 2010s. It would take about 20 million qubits to crack a 2048 bit RSA key using Shor's if I remember correctly; gotta have a bunch of qubits for error correction. RSA 3072 and 4096 would require significantly more and are still considered quantum resistant because of it. Shor's also isn't a constant time algorithm so the more bits in the number you're trying to factor the more operations you have to perform, it's something on the order of O(n^3), so billions of ops for 2048 and tens of billions of ops for 4096. For a single quantum computer that means months to years for scale, you have to parallelize massively to get that down to days or weeks. Microsoft has a quantum computer that can \"in theory\" scale up to a million qubits but I don't think they've achieved that yet in practice.\n\nNow consider that every website in the world has a unique certificate. Even with quantum supremecy you're not going to crack them all in a reasonable amount of time. TLS certs also expire so for one website the key changes every year or two. In the case of people using letsencrypt they could be changing their cert on a monthly basis. For actors working on the \"save now decrypt later\" tactic, they could be saving stuff protected with RSA 2048 and that would potentially be decryptable years from now. That could include stuff like immutable PII like SSNs and the like...but...why do that when traditional hacks, phishing and data leaks don't require a quantum computer at all?\n\nI've been following post quantum since the mid 2010's. The NIST started a program to seek out quantum resistant algorithms a long time ago and the final set of post quantum algorithms have been finalized and are starting to be implemented; I work for a large bank and there's an internal team working that stuff right now.\n\nSymmetric key is also agnostic to all this. There is no quantum algorithm that can break AES, so zip/7z archives or other stuff encrypted with a symmetric key are safe. If an encryption algorithm doesn't have a \"trap door function\" then quantum isn't a threat to it.",

In order for Grover's to search the space, it needs to know what the decrypted solution might look like, inferring a need for at least a partial plaintext attack.\n\n> An essential component needed in Grover’s algorithm is a circuit which on input a candidate key |K> indicates if this key is equal to the secret target key or not. To do so, the idea is to simply encrypt some (fixed) plaintext under the candidate key and compare the result with the (assumed to be known) corresponding ciphertext under the secret target key. - [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04965)\n\nGrover's basically can take y = f(x) and find an x value given a y. For AES what this paper is doing is given a ct = AES(pt, key), the key can be derived given ct and pt. It solves for the key but given a known plaintext.\n\nYes that means the 'key' can be derived using quantum and that is an interesting finding. But to put that into practice to produce an algorithm that only takes in the ciphertext and somehow produces the key or the plaintext doesn't follow. It is possible under AES to have two different plaintext and key combinations produce the same ciphertext, so without a known plaintext, you can't just produce the key and without the key you can't produce the plaintext (which if you have the key, then you're already done). If it can be estimated what kind of file is being encrypted or what the first 128-256 bits of data is encrypted then this could be a possible solution in a partial plaintext attack. It is easy to counter this by simply adding a high-entropy one-time-pad of bits at the start of the plaintext that you then just discard during decryption. Quantum only provides a partial plaintext attack vector, it doesn't 'break' the algorithm as a whole.\n\nGrover's would have to be enhanced to detect a drop in entropy if a known plaintext is not available. Even if that enhancement does come about, a simple mitigation would just be to encrypt it once, to get a high entropy data stream, and then encrypt it again with two separate keys.",

This works for TCP and UDP\n2) Added the option to ignore certain ports when  proxying traffic with transparent proxies. Helps when you run services like kafka but do not want this traffic go through your proxy\n3) Updated dependency to golang 1.25.6\n4) Switched license from MIT to GPLv3\n\n[gohpts](https://github.com/shadowy-pycoder/go-http-proxy-to-socks)",
