We did not receive any customer inquiries regarding the interruption.\" An AWS spokesperson added: \"It was a coincidence that AI tools were involved.\"\n\nSeems like the AI had it's own role, was in supervised mode (not autopilot, which is the other mode for Kiro). Supervised mode asks someone to verify actions, in piecemeal, or 'do everything'. Maybe the reason they are blaming the dev was because the Dev allowed 'do everything', not realizing that \"I'm gonna burn yo' shit down and rebuild it\" was on line 35 of the changes it would do?\n\nFrom: [https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/](https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/)\n\n\"Supervised mode\n\nIn supervised mode, Kiro works interactively with the user, requiring their approval and guidance at each step:\n\n* Kiro suggests actions such as file creation, modification and deletion, but waits for user confirmation before proceeding\n* Kiro asks clarifying questions when needed\n* You can review and approve each generated document or code change, thus maintaining full control over the development process\n\nWhen operating in either of these modes, you can view individual or all file changes made by the agent by selecting **View all changes** in the **Chat** module. Additionally, you can also select **Revert all changes** or revert to a [checkpoint](https://kiro.dev/docs/chat/checkpoints) to restore your files to their previous state in the filesystem locally.\"\n\nIf the human blindly trusts the AI and 'allow all', is it not on the human? Do we blame the firewall for the \"any any\" rule added?",

One of the ways to exploit using that driver which youve attributed in your project was to run the killing of processes in a loop.

What im saying is the reason why it was failing in the first place is because you only have terminate process primitive in that vulnerable driver, and you cannot terminate a PPL process with that so the reasoning behind why it was failing against EDR products is not because its functions were hooked, but rather you do not have sufficient protection level even in kernel mode to disable a PPL process like \\`endpoint.exe\\` for EDRs\n\n",

              "text": "This, but with some practical complications and limitations.\n\nFirst, the \"good-faith security research\" from the CFAA only applies when considering criminal liability, **but not civil liability.** This means that you, the security researcher, don't necessarily have carte blanche to go hack whatever you want to without incurring civil liability for your actions - if you cause damages to a private company or violate existing legal terms you agreed upon, they can hold you accountable.\n\nIn addition to the quantifiable damages we might be familiar with as hackers (e.g., creating DoS conditions, stealing intellectual property/data/money, other criminal and malicious activities), compensation for intangible damages can also be pursued - you publicly lied about finding a vulnerability (defamation), you publicize an article about a vulnerability without carefully verifying your claims (negligent misrepresentation).\n\nSpeaking practically and from experience, whether or not a company will pursue civil legal action against you comes down to: do they know, and do they care? And both of these depend on what you're actually doing. \n\nIf you're pulling apart binaries to hunt for vulnerabilities on your private computer, no one's going to know until you decide to do something with what you find, and how you go about that process determines what criminal and/or civil liability you open yourself up to. You avoid this by being smart and responsible, lawyering up, and only making calculated moves.\n\nIf you're actively touching remote systems you don't own (e.g., live testing a company's web application whom you do not work for, querying a database that's not yours, or connecting to a private network with a banner stating as much) **- I cannot emphasize this enough - it DOES NOT MATTER if they have a bug bounty program - THIS IS NOT IMMUNITY - YOU CAN INCUR CIVIL LIABILITY.** Bug bounty programs are not a legally binding contract with you. The company can still pursue legal action against you, even if you follow all of the rules and stay in scope, simply because they don't like you. It's happened to people. It can happen to you. There's literally nothing but reputation standing in the way. \n\nThe only way to minimize personal liability is to work under a company (like an LLC), lawyer up, and have said lawyer draft a contract in line with a clear statement of work from your customer. If you don't have a signed contract between both parties, you're acquiring legal liability as your profession.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, companies sue anyone and everyone all of the time, for any reason, even when they know they can't win. Be a professional - always wear (legal) protection.\n\nSource: I've been personally sued for contributing to a bug bounty program, my various employers have been sued on my behalf, I've been sued for responsibly and privately disclosing vulnerabilities, I've had friends in this industry argue with me that bug bounty programs are safe and protected who were then sued by the company after submitting their findings (lol), my lawyers have successfully defended me from liability against a very large and wealthy network infrastructure company that didn't like my 0-day (they're still mad), I've had clients with contracts try to sue me because they didn't like how right I was after they paid me to be right, and I did it all without developing a criminal record (so far).",

If the prosecutor intends to charge a case contrary to CCIPS’s written recommendation, she must inform the Deputy Attorney General’s office before charging and, in some cases, seek approval.\n\nThere is language included that touches on monetary gain and extortion. This is why you’ll see people strongly urge others not to “cold-call” organizations asking for a reward that don’t have a bounty program after finding a vulnerability \n\nDOJ memos & guidelines with respect to how much weight they carry is whole other can of worms.

See also some of the more famous whistleblowers that leaked US internal or secret information such as Maning and Assange.\n\nAs for any means of distributing the info yourself, I'm fairly certain you'd fail if the info was \"big\" enough. Maybe a Tor hidden service could get you some of the way, but it's also common knowledge that many (most?) Tor relay nodes are actually controlled by the government.

Just using HTTPS would be enough.\n\nThe reason Tor exists is to \"prevent any single point on the internet (other than the user's device) from being able to view both where traffic originated from and where it is ultimately going to at the same time\" (as written on wikipedia).\n\nIf enough relay nodes are under control of the same organization, it is highly probable that they'd be able to deanonymize traffic given enough time. Note that I'm not saying \"decrypt\". The contents of your communications will still largely be secure, but the metadata (such as source and destination IP, date / time of communications, etc) wouldn't be. These different data points could be correlated with each other to further decrease your anonymity and confidentiality. For instance, if you'd post on a forum at a specific time / date a few times.\n\nAs far as I know though, there's never been a court case or other evidence that any organization can actually do this.

People will know about it, eventually that information will make its way to world powers. If you control access to it to a trusted group of individuals there's still a chance that will happen if they spread such information around. You're proposing the impossible here. The best way to keep a secret is for the secret to never be uttered to anyone else which defeats what you're going for here.\n\nB: Not everything on the internet is forever. Link rot is a thing, not everything gets archived and even if it does, sometimes it's in some private collection in a goon cave that goes nowhere. If you wanted to get something out, post about it on various sites, maybe buy advertisements for it. Make videos about it, make a website about it. Archive everything you've made on public archives. Make a torrent of it too and keep that thing seeded and spread the magnet link around. If people agree it's important, they will keep it alive. You can also give the information to reputable journalists as well.\n\nC: The above also defeats your purpose as none of this will keep it hidden from world powers. What you should take away from this is that you're attempting a contradictory task. Opsec is about reducing the potential harms of whatever it is you're doing being compromised and that changes greatly depending on what it is you're doing. There is no perfect magic bullet solution, only good practices and a lot of fail safes. You can't stop everything.\n\nD: This is to your first sentence, people claim to have all sorts of information.

Since you've got settings access, you might want to grab the APKs directly from /data/app/ using adb over USB and decompile them with jadx to see what's actually running under the hood—Miko robots typically have some aggressive telemetry and the stock app usually has hardcoded endpoints you can block at the firewall level. If Google Play Store won't install, it's probably because the device is missing Play Services or has a restricted signature—try sideloading the microG variant instead, which is stripped down and won't fight as hard against the locked-down ROM. Also worth checking if ADB is enabled in developer options; if it is, you can skip the OTG keyboard entirely next time and just push APKs directly over USB. The blank privacy policy is a solid tell that they're intentionally limiting user agency on the device, which is worth documenting if you plan to write this up anywhere.",

      "text": "Im looking for advice on where to start on getting some data out of a piece of hardware. I have a piece of hardware which connects to my local network thru wifi. You then can load the software which connects to the hardware thru the network and that software then gives you the data. The company has since locked the hardware that was purchased behind a subscription model, yes I would now have to pay them to use the hardware I purchased outright. I guess I have two questions.    \n1. Would it be feasible to just grab the data directly and have a little program that just spit that out? I did install wireshark and was able to intercept packets. I do also have a LLM and installed private-gpt to try and send that data to the LLM to try to decode it, wasnt successful yet! I assume in this situation there would have to be some sort of handshake? Maybe the box just constantly sends data?  \n2. I did also try to use radare2 and r2ai/decai to try to make the software more friendly to me. Those tho seem to be really aimed at linux and this is a windows app. I am also not a great programmer, I know just enough to get myself in trouble. Is there somewhere I could browse to find people more accomplished at at task like that? Removing certain parts of software?    \nThis seems to skirt a couple of the sub rules, hopefully its ok :)",

Data captured over the wire is often of very little utility as even the cruddiest shenzen IOT tat runs basic crypto on payloads in this day and age. \n\n\nEspecially companies who just put their stuff behind a paywall. \n\nThe normal first paths to reverse engineering is to understand what the device is doing.. UART/TTL headers offer interesting insights during boot and/or operation. Dumping any 25c or other flash storage and doing binwalk , extracting any filesystem's (or squashes) and see what can be dine that way. And then there's jtag. Knowing what the memory and CPU are doing in real time, for example. \n\n\nBut if you just expect to wireshare pcap a packet, pipe it to an LLM and be hacking.. Yeah, good luck with that. That's the longest of long shots. You might get lucky. Then again, you might mint a BTC on a gpu from 2012 too. Not impossible. Just highly highly improbable",
