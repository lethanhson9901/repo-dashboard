Use chatgpt to help you with this.\n\nKeep in mind that, while this obfuscation is very weak, there is no guarantee the final payload is not more sophisticated and engaging in evasion. Bitdefender probably did work here, but that doesn't mean nothing malicious executed.\n\nEDIT: I pulled the final payload and this is a pretty nasty one. It's a RAT called NetSupport, it ultimately will callback to the attacker and give them complete access to your machine. So keep that in mind as you're evaluating what you want to do next. Again, I think Bitdefender probably did its job but you can judge your own risk profile. neservice.exe is evading Bitdefender on VirusTotal, so if it got to that stage you may be infected. I would emphasize that if the PowerShell execution got blocked, you got very lucky because the final payload \\*would\\* likely have gotten you and you'd be completely pwned.",

There's basically a law here according to which you cannot use any phone on cellular networks unless you pay the one time tax calculated according to the msrp of the phone. (the tax is often 70% of the msrp of the phone) \n\nThe solution? (illegally) change the phone's imei to one of a cheap 4g enabled phone so that you can use the expensive phone on cellular networks. This is very commonly used solution even if you're buying an S24 ultra or a pixel 9 pro. (this doesn't work on iPhones, obviously)",

I have been doing some research and I haven't found what I've been looking for, maybe because it doesn't exist, I don't know. But I thought I'd ask you guys.\n\n  \nDo you know if there's any situation in which the government/any state agency has hired an independent hacker/organization \\*without knowing their identity\\* ? By that I mean, if they've hired hackers just by contacting them online, no official contracts on the hacker's real name. Is that even possible? I know of Evgeniy Bogachev's virus being taken advantage of by Russia but there is no proof that they hired him before knowing his identity/real name.\n\n  \nAny example or info in this matter would be of great help!\n\n  \n",

You're solving multiple problems at once, likely 1-2 people solving one at a time. \n\nMeanwhile a Government throws loads of money and people at these problems. They're more efficient and can solve far more complex problems. They have the scale to do so. \n\nThat being said there obviously is the exploit markets, except I hazard a guess to say it's cheaper to buy an exploit that it is to research and develop it at scale. \n\nBut hackers?

In the case of Russia, however, its laws are designed to make rogue hackers recruit-able for the government. By law, it's legal to hack foreign governments or foreign citizens, as long as it's not a former Sovjet state. That's why pretty much all malware has Russian checks in it, e.g. if system language or geolocation hints towards a former Sovjet state.\n\nThat's also literally what they had to modify in the NotPetya malware \"variant\" when they did that strike in 2014. If you compare the binary with the Petya ransomware, you can see that also the language and system checks have changed for this very purpose, just as a fun fact. Same for the original Zeus botnet, same for the Mirai botnet, same for the respawns/reallocations of Mirai's resources after the FSB/SVR/GRU branches took over their parts of the botnet.\n\nIt's pretty interesting seeing malware implants and their modifications after government \"acqui-hires\" or takeovers.",

Can the coupon be reused?\n2. Can another user apply it?\n3. Can it be applied to a different product?\n4. Can checkout / refund be abused to get money back?\n\nIt does this by replaying and mutating the same requests you already made, and it only reports an issue if it can prove its theories to be correct.\n\nIts also basically zero-friction, since it runs in your own browser, works based on your flow, and won't flood you with false positives.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Would you use something like this?\n2. Would you pay for it?",
