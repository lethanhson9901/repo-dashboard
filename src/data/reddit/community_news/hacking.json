Threat actors are adapting too, and one of the most common techniques malware is using nowadays is Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).\n\nMalware is simply piggybacking on signed but vulnerable kernel drivers to get kernel level access to tamper with protection and maybe disable it all together as we can see in my example!\n\nThe driver I dealt with exposes unprotected IOCTLs that can be accessed by any usermode application. This IOCTL code once invoked, will trigger the imported kernel function ZwTerminateProcess which can be abused to kill any target process (EDR processes in our case).\n\nNote:\n\nThe vulnerability was publicly disclosed a long time ago, but the driver isn’t blocklisted by Microsoft.\n\nhttps://github.com/xM0kht4r/AV-EDR-Killer",

      "text": "USA captured the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuelan security officers who survived that military operation described the incoming attack starting with all their radar systems suddenly turning off without any explanation, and that they had never experienced anything of the like before. The media says that their radar systems were jammed, but that is not how the survivors described the event. They specifically said that their systems basically just shut down by themselves. That indicates a cyber attack, instead of radar jamming technology. Most probably hardware backdoors were used to machinate that part of the attack.\n\nHardware backdoors have been pushed into mass market CPUs and motherboards for a long time now. To make things worse, Windows 11 made it mandatory to have TPM 2.0 for the user to \"upgrade\" their OS to the latest version. So if hardware backdoors are being forced on the consumers and governments, that's an easy delivery system to gain technological power over countries and their infrastructures.\n\nSo if USA and its closest allies have been concentrating on building such a cyberwarfare infrastructure for decades, that's a major national security threat for all the other countries. If one country can basically just \"push a button\" to turn off all the modern technology dependent systems of their targeted countries and their militaries and infrastructures, that can instantly create major chaos and destruction in the targeted country. \"Don't want to co-operate with our demands? Well we just turn off all your infrastructures.\" How do you fix that? Buy a new CPU, motherboard or a computer? How? You can't order it online without a working computer. Maybe by going to the computer store near you? They can't sell it to you as their computers are down too. They can't order new ones for the same reason. They also can't accept payments because their credit card system is also down. What about cash? Well the bank infrastructures are also dependent on the same systems and are also down, so no luck there either. And also cash has been on its way out for a long time now and banks don't have much cash these days, so it's becoming unobtanium. Hospitals? Patient records are not accessible without a computer. Medical factories and industrial factories? Down also for the same reason. Water delivery infrastructure? Problems there too. Food production and delivery? Mostly down too. That's a large scale life threatening situation for the targeted countries who should experience that type of an attack. And no one can do anything to fix the situation as long as their infrastructures are dependent on such backdoored hardware and/or software.\n\nThe safest way out such a problem would probably be for every country to have their own CPU manufacturing. But that is such a high technology undertaking and very expensive to get started, that it would be a massive long term investment from each country. Developing and manufacturing much lower tech CPUs would be possible for individual countries. For example RISC-V based computers could probably be manufactured at scale for the use of government infrastructures and systems. But then there's also the high demand for all sorts of entertainment and convenience products and systems people have made themselves dependent on, such as Youtube, video games, etc. Those drive the sales of such high tech backdoored hardware. But as long as those entertainment systems are kept completely separate from the important government systems, the countries could stay mostly operational in the event of such potential cyber attacks.\n\nJust my 2 cents...",

A condition of his bail was that he remain under the supervision of his mother at all times, Mr. Cottle said.\n\nIn 2021, hackers who claimed to be affiliated with Anonymous gained access to the Texas GOP website by first infiltrating web-hosting company Epik. They defaced the party’s website, replacing its banner with cartoon characters, a pornographic image and a music video, and then downloaded personal identifying information from the party’s web server and shared it online, according to U.S. court documents.",

By that I mean, if they've hired hackers just by contacting them online, no official contracts on the hacker's real name. Is that even possible? I know of Evgeniy Bogachev's virus being taken advantage of by Russia but there is no proof that they hired him before knowing his identity/real name.\n\n  \nAny example or info in this matter would be of great help!\n\n  \n",

You're solving multiple problems at once, likely 1-2 people solving one at a time. \n\nMeanwhile a Government throws loads of money and people at these problems. They're more efficient and can solve far more complex problems. They have the scale to do so. \n\nThat being said there obviously is the exploit markets, except I hazard a guess to say it's cheaper to buy an exploit that it is to research and develop it at scale. \n\nBut hackers? Hackers are just a cog in the wheel that is far more easy to come by.",

But it turned out that they were being used to spy on journalists and dissidents. When it comes to governments using hackers for espionage you aren’t going to find much information out there.

And DiskCryptor looks more like the interface I used.  I'm pretty sure it had a GUI.)   \n  \nFunny situation that you've probably heard dozens of times before:  \n  \nI have a drive I put a password on a while ago.  I -know- the password (lol).  And yet, it doesn't work.  \n\nI'm not a coder of any kind, I don't know any programming languages.  It's a windows 11 pc and the drive is external.  The password was put on several years/versions ago.\n\nWhat I'm mainly wondering is if a program could be made to 'brute force' within a specific set of parameters.    \n  \nSpecifically: Like I said, I know what the password should be.  It's a long passphrase.  So let's say for example that the password has a set of words, a set of numbers and a couple special characters.  In a specific, set order.\n \nI know what the order is supposed to be.  The parameters I'm thinking of are-  Varying upper and lower case for the words.  Adding a character that maybe is part of the word, like (W for Virginia/WVirginia).  Stuff like that.  Varying the special character.  The password is, let's say, 35 characters long.  \n  \nI'm thinking if something like a brute force script that goes from, whatever, 33-35 characters, uses these known words and numbers, but varies some of the places where upper/lower case might matter, the special characters, etc.  Maybe playing with the word order which *should* be set, but at this point who knows.  \n  \nEither way I think I'm looking at what, maybe a hundred or so different variations?  When the actual variation shouldn't be more than a dozen or so, but I've tried those dozen, so I'm expanding out.\n  \nHow possible/impossible is this?  How might one go about doing that?  \n  \nFollow up question - is there any reason that a newer version of DCrypt would work with a drive encrypted with an older version?  And the pc used would be different than the one trying to get in, if that makes a difference.",

          "text": "DriveCrypt specifically has anti-brute-force mechanisms built in that dramatically slow down password attempts. This is intentional, the software is designed to make dictionary and brute force attacks extremely time-consuming. Even with a limited search space like you're describing (100-ish variations), if the software rate-limits to something like one attempt per few seconds, you're looking at potentially hours or days just for those variations.\n\nAlso, if you're talking about DriveCrypt (the commercial one from SecurStar), there's no official API or scripting interface for automated password attempts. You'd have to interact with the GUI or reverse engineer how it communicates with the driver, which is way beyond not knowing any programming languages territory.\n\nThe brute force script, in theory, yeah, you could make a script that tries variations. Python would be the easiest for this if the software had a command-line interface. But there is a problem  that most disk encryption software doesn't expose a simple command-line mount option that accepts password input programmatically, specifically to prevent exactly what you're trying to do.\n\nYou'd need to either find or write something that can interact with DriveCrypt's interface programmatically, which requires programming knowledge and possibly violates the CFAA depending on jurisdiction since you're essentially trying to circumvent security measures (even on your own drive).\n\nNewer versions of DriveCrypt are supposed to be backwards compatible with containers created by older versions (4.6 and above according to their docs). But there are some format differences like older versions used something called \"Summer\" format which newer versions can read but requires enabling a compatibility mode. If your drive was encrypted with a really old version and you're trying to mount it with current software, there might be compatibility issues. The PC being different shouldn't matter, the encryption is tied to the password/keyfile, not the specific hardware.\n\nBefore going down the brute force rabbit hole, have you tried enabling legacy format support if the software has that option? DriveCrypt has a \"Summer\" compatibility mode for older containers. Check if there's a setting for that in the current version.\n\nDid you use any kind of keyfile in addition to the password? Some encryption software lets you use a file as part of the authentication. If you set that up years ago and forgot, the password alone won't work.\n\nIf the data is critical, you might want to consult a professional before trying anything that could potentially corrupt the container. Some disk encryption formats have header backups, but if you screw something up trying to brute force it, you might make recovery impossible even if you eventually remember the correct password.",

                  "text": "DiskCryptor changes things significantly actually. It's open source and way more accessible than what I thought you were dealing with.\n\nSo yeah, DiskCryptor has a command-line tool called dccon.exe that can mount volumes programmatically. You can absolutely script password attempts with it. The syntax is something like dccon -mount with the device and password flags. So in theory you could write a script that loops through your password variations and tries mounting with each one until something works.\n\nDiskCryptor uses a pretty low iteration count for its key derivation function, only about 1,000 PBKDF2 iterations. For context, modern secure encryption like VeraCrypt uses 200,000 to 500,000+ iterations. The low iteration count means each password attempt is computationally cheaper to test, which is good for you trying limited variations. Could be seconds to minutes depending on your system.\n\nBackwards compatibility should be fine. DiskCryptor has been pretty stable with format compatibility over versions. If you encrypted it years ago with DiskCryptor and you're using current DiskCryptor, that shouldn't be the issue I believe.\n\nThe practical approach would be a script that takes your known password components, generates the variations you think are likely, loops through trying to mount with each one, and stops when it succeeds. Python would probably be easiest for this if you or someone you know can code. The logic is straightforward, like generate password variations based on your rules, try each one, check if mount succeeded, move to next if it failed.\n\nSince you said you don't know programming. You're gonna need to either learn enough Python to write this yourself, which honestly isn't that hard for something this simple, or find someone who can help you. There are communities like r/learnpython where you could describe what you need without revealing your actual password and someone might point you in the right direction. Or if the data is valuable enough, pay someone to write it, though be very careful about who you trust with that kind of access.\n\nBig warning here though, **work on a copy** of the drive first, not the original. Even though DiskCryptor doesn't have explicit lockout features, you don't want to risk corrupting the only copy of your data through repeated failed mount attempts or script errors. Make an image of the encrypted drive and test on that. If something goes wrong with the copy, you still have the original.\n\nAlso be strategic about which variations you try. If you start doing all possible case combinations for a long passphrase, the permutations explode exponentially. Like if you have 10 letters that could be upper or lower case, that's over 1000 combinations just for case variations alone. Focus on the specific variations that seem most likely based on how you think you might have entered it, like if you always capitalize proper nouns, or if you tend to use exclamation marks instead of other special characters, that kind of thing.\n\nIf you're wrong about the password structure entirely, like if there's a word you're not remembering or the order is completely different than you think, this approach won't help. DiskCryptor's weak key derivation means it's theoretically more brute-forceable than modern encryption, but that requires specialized hardware and a lot of time if the search space is large. Your best bet is that you're very close to the right password and just need to find the exact variation.\n\nSo yeah, it's scriptable and potentially doable. Just make absolutely sure you're working on a copy, not the original encrypted drive, and be realistic about whether your 100 variations actually cover the likely possibilities or if you're still guessing.",

Because it lacks controlled acquisition, verified provenance, chain of custody, and forensic time precision, it’s generally not independently admissible in court.

If you have a computer that you use and is wired with Ethernet, you can connect to the Orbit via WiFi, but you may need to move your router from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.10.x or elsewhere. I did that and can now access the rayhunter at 192.168.1.1 since that IP cannot be changed. \n\nThen you can use ntfy to send you a message if there’s a positive ID.",

Since you cannot change the IP of the Orbit, if you want to connect the Orbit to a local computer and have access to ntfy without paying for a SIM plan, you need to change your home wifi to be on x.x.10.x \n\nAfter I did that, I had to power cycle everything in my home to get it to rejoin the network correctly.",
