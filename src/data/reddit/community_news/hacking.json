Use chatgpt to help you with this.\n\nKeep in mind that, while this obfuscation is very weak, there is no guarantee the final payload is not more sophisticated and engaging in evasion. Bitdefender probably did work here, but that doesn't mean nothing malicious executed.\n\nEDIT: I pulled the final payload and this is a pretty nasty one. It's a RAT called NetSupport, it ultimately will callback to the attacker and give them complete access to your machine. So keep that in mind as you're evaluating what you want to do next. Again, I think Bitdefender probably did its job but you can judge your own risk profile. neservice.exe is evading Bitdefender on VirusTotal, so if it got to that stage you may be infected. I would emphasize that if the PowerShell execution got blocked, you got very lucky because the final payload \\*would\\* likely have gotten you and you'd be completely pwned.",

Threat actors are adapting too, and one of the most common techniques malware is using nowadays is Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).\n\nMalware is simply piggybacking on signed but vulnerable kernel drivers to get kernel level access to tamper with protection and maybe disable it all together as we can see in my example!\n\nThe driver I dealt with exposes unprotected IOCTLs that can be accessed by any usermode application. This IOCTL code once invoked, will trigger the imported kernel function ZwTerminateProcess which can be abused to kill any target process (EDR processes in our case).\n\nNote:\n\nThe vulnerability was publicly disclosed a long time ago, but the driver isn’t blocklisted by Microsoft.\n\nhttps://github.com/xM0kht4r/AV-EDR-Killer",

          "text": "The branches of the government you're talking about are strictly military branches, as they need the mandate to operate on foreign soil.\n\nThe optimum military efficiency is defined as minimum collateral (civilian) damage, while still being able to execute a surgical strike.\n\nThat's the opposite of Russia's strategy, who want to dominate the enemy through fear and destruction. In the case of Russia, however, its laws are designed to make rogue hackers recruit-able for the government. By law, it's legal to hack foreign governments or foreign citizens, as long as it's not a former Sovjet state. That's why pretty much all malware has Russian checks in it, e.g. if system language or geolocation hints towards a former Sovjet state.\n\nThat's also literally what they had to modify in the NotPetya malware \"variant\" when they did that strike in 2014. If you compare the binary with the Petya ransomware, you can see that also the language and system checks have changed for this very purpose, just as a fun fact. Same for the original Zeus botnet, same for the Mirai botnet, same for the respawns/reallocations of Mirai's resources after the FSB/SVR/GRU branches took over their parts of the botnet.\n\nIt's pretty interesting seeing malware implants and their modifications after government \"acqui-hires\" or takeovers.",

Purely a program I built to find things I don't think I would have normally found myself.\n\nWhat it is:\n\n* A browser extension\n* You log in (or not), browse the app normally\n* Click “record”, perform your usual workflow, testing, etc., click “stop”\n* It captures the exact API calls you made\n\nThen the tool tries to break logic assumptions that emerged from your own flow.\n\nExample:\n\n* You apply a coupon\n* Cart total changes\n* Checkout succeeds\n\nThe tool then asks things like:\n\n1. Can the coupon be reused?\n2. Can another user apply it?\n3. Can it be applied to a different product?\n4. Can checkout / refund be abused to get money back?\n\nIt does this by replaying and mutating the same requests you already made, and it only reports an issue if it can prove its theories to be correct.\n\nIts also basically zero-friction, since it runs in your own browser, works based on your flow, and won't flood you with false positives.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Would you use something like this?\n2. Would you pay for it?",
