The software itself is genuine.  This became so commonplace that the companies that make the software started putting warnings in it when you allow connections (\"DO YOU KNOW THE PERSON YOU ARE ALLOWING CONTROL YOUR PC?\" sort of thing).  This was actually quite effective, so the scammers needed a workaround.\n\nTurns out that the software would only issue the warning when you allowed somebody connect to you, not when you connected to control a remote PC.  However, it had another feature, while you were remote controlling a PC you would be given the option to reverse the connection, allowing the other person control your PC.  This wouldn't show the warnings.  So the scammers started *giving control of their PCs to their victims* and asking them to hit the reverse button.  So in the end they were literally just handing control to the scam hackers.",

By doing all the port scanning and Shodan searches you mentioned, you get access to their cameras, their computers, and personal details.

At that point their greed usually handles the rest and they will try to pull it down to their own machine to open it. A quiet remote access trojan (RAT) can give the person controlling it the same type of access they would have if sitting at the infected computer. From there it is just a matter of surveying the environment (browse local files, scan the network, connect to other machines on the network, wash-rinse-repeat, etc.). A well practiced and skilled pentester could pull most of this off in less than a day. The challenge is the social engineering to convince the scammer that they are dealing with a \"senile old lady with memory issues\" and not a pentester running an ancient windows 7 box as a honeypot.\n\nSome of the more recent videos have shown an increase in paranoia from some of the scammers. Some now check the device manager for telltale signs they are in a VM. So it is likely they will eventually adjust their calculations for profit vs expense and decide that basic anti-virus or even enterprise grade IDS/IPS and layer 7 firewalls are worth the investment. But for now, their model is still profitable enough that they don't seem to care if they are taken down since they can just grab a new batch of cheap PCs and a random apartment to be back online overnight. I would be surprised if they even bother to re-image their machines when they get infected, they probably just sell them to unsuspecting people for a quick buck and easy evidence disposal.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is a professionally managed scam center with a curated collection of global proxy servers that uses sandboxed VMs for the scammer side and has proper network and device security. It would be incredibly difficult to pull off the exploitations of the scammer networks we currently see with the \"fly by night cashgrab\" operations we currently deal with. Fortunately, outside of North Korea, that sort of thing is pretty much unheard of.",

With programs like Pegasus or something similar, it's a matter of a couple of days. Even just accessing a domain PC is enough; the next step would be accessing the host with admin privileges. Then it's a piece of cake. These people probably work behind the scenes for large corporations.

      "text": "Been poking around OpenClaw since everyone started hyping it. 165k GitHub stars, 700+ community skills, full access to your filesystem, browser, shell, messaging apps. Cool project but the whole architecture screamed supply chain attack surface to me.\n\nSo I started actually reading through skill code before installing anything. Almost didn't bother for a simple Spotify playlist organizer because who weaponizes a music skill right?\n\nTurns out someone does. Was grepping through the skill instructions and noticed some suspicious regex patterns that had nothing to do with music. Buried in there was logic to search for files matching *tax*, *ssn*, *w2* patterns and extract 9 digit numbers. A music skill. Hunting for your social security number. I almost installed this thing without looking.\n\nAnother one marketed as a Discord backup tool had instructions to POST your entire message history to some sketchy endpoint using base64 encoded chunks. Classic exfil pattern, wasn't even trying to hide it. Just betting nobody actually reads skill code.\n\nI've gone through a bunch of popular skills now and the hit rate on sketchy ones is way higher than I expected. Security researchers have published findings saying around 15% of community skills contain malicious instructions and based on what I'm seeing that tracks.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the setup as a \"Faustian bargain\" which is refreshingly honest but also... concerning that they know and it's still this bad.\n\nWhat pisses me off is how fast malicious skills reappear after getting flagged. Same logic, new name, back on ClawHub within days. Tried automating the review process since manual grepping doesn't scale. Found some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that catches some of it but still missed the more obfuscated ones I found by hand. This problem probably needs better tooling than currently exists.\n\n18k+ OpenClaw instances currently exposed to the internet on default port. This ecosystem is going to produce some wild incident reports.\n\nProbably going to do a more detailed writeup on the specific techniques I'm seeing if there's interest. For now if you're running this thing: Docker container minimum, never expose 18789, start with read only access. Treat skill installation like running random binaries from strangers because that's basically what it is.",

The fundamental issue isn't just finding specific malicious skills, but that the architecture of most agent frameworks defaults to full user permissions. OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor — they all run with the same access as you.\n\nThis is exactly the problem we built [nono](https://www.alwaysfurther.ai/blog/why-i-built-nono?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=why-i-built-nono)  to solve. It's a kernel-enforced capability sandbox that makes unauthorised operations structurally impossible, even if an agent tries to exfiltrate files or delete system configurations. It uses Landlock on Linux and Seatbelt on macOS to enforce default-deny filesystem access, network controls, and credential protection.\n\nFor an OpenClaw setup, your entire agent workflow could be restricted with a single command like this:\n\n`nono run --allow ./my-project-dir --net-block openclaw`\n\nThat makes it impossible for the agent to access anything outside `./my-project-dir` or hit external networks, regardless of what a skill tries to do. Full disclosure, I work on nono, it's an open-source project, check it out if you're interested https://github.com/always-further/nono",

The supply chain attack pattern you found is nearly identical to what we've been seeing in mobile app ecosystems for years — malicious packages masquerading as legitimate tools, harvesting credentials and API keys.\n\nThe crypto-themed lure is the giveaway. Same playbook works on npm, PyPI, and mobile app stores: create a package/app with a name similar to a popular tool, add some crypto-related keywords to attract high-value targets, then deploy an infostealer. The ClawHub ecosystem is just the latest platform to get hit with this pattern.\n\nA few things that stood out:\n\nThe fact that the malicious skills target macOS credentials and browser passwords specifically suggests these aren't amateur attacks. They're going after developer machines, which are high-value targets because they often have access to production infrastructure, code signing keys, and cloud credentials.\n\nThe behavior you described (dropping files to /tmp, establishing persistence, C2 callback) maps almost exactly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for initial access (T1195.002 - Supply Chain Compromise: Software Supply Chain) and collection (T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores).\n\nOne thing I'd add to the analysis — it's worth checking if any of these skills request network permissions or filesystem access beyond what's needed for their stated functionality. Permission over-requesting is one of the easiest automated signals to flag during marketplace review, but most platforms don't enforce principle of least privilege during the review process.",

I realized they were talking about **Gallery Vault** (by ThinkYeah), so I decided to audit it (v4.4.33, released March 2025) to see if it was as bad as it seemed.\n\n**Spoiler:** It was.\n\nThe PIN you set is strictly a UI lock. It plays zero role in the actual file encryption. The app relies \\*entirely\\* on a hardcoded master key embedded in the APK. The implemented encryption is a static string (`good_gv`) that gets padded and run through DES-ECB with a static hex constant. This generates a global master key that is **identical for every user on every device**.\n\nThis master key is used to unwrap a unique per-file key stored in the file's tail metadata (sandwiched between `>>tyfs>>` and `<<tyfs<<` markers). Once that key is exposed, the actual file content is just a simple XOR cipher with a position-based salt.\n\nSimply put, if you have a clean dump of the Android data, **you can decrypt the files without ever knowing the user's password**.\n\nPractically speaking, the main legitimate use case here is forensic recovery from a lawful device dump. But the bigger takeaway is that 50M people think their files are protected when they really aren't.\n\nI wrote a Python tool that automates the entire pipeline. It goes through the provided android dump and, using the hardcoded values, decrypts the per-file key, and reverses the XOR transform. It also handles magic byte detection to restore the correct file extensions (jpg, mp4, etc), although only images are supposed to be stored in the vault.\n\nIt has a nice TUI too if you prefer it to just CLI :)\n\n\n\nLink: [gv\\_decryptor](https://github.com/caveeroo/gv_decryptor)\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: For educational and legitimate forensic purposes only. Don't go poking around files that aren't yours.*",

People protecting themselves from others who they know aren't competent? (hmm... That makes sense. It's clearly not appropriate to defend from a competent hacker or government, but its probably safe enought if you want some very simple protection when someone stole your phone.

          "text": "The core issue here is that GalleryVault uses DES in ECB mode for its 'encryption' — which is barely encryption at all. DES has a 56-bit key (trivially brutable), and ECB mode encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, so the structure of your files leaks right through.\n\nA quick way to verify this yourself: take a .bmp image, 'encrypt' it with the app, then view the encrypted file as raw data. If you can still make out the shape of the image, ECB mode is in play. This is the classic ECB penguin problem.\n\nWhat's worse is this likely violates OWASP MASVS-CRYPTO requirements:\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-1: No reliance on symmetric crypto with hardcoded keys\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-2: Use proven cryptographic primitives (DES is deprecated since 2005)\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-4: No use of ECB mode for any encryption operation\n\nYou can decompile the APK yourself with jadx (open source) and search for 'DES' or 'Cipher.getInstance' calls to see exactly what they're doing. The cipher spec string will likely be just 'DES' (which defaults to DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding on Android).\n\nThe bigger systemic issue is Google Play's Data Safety section is entirely self-reported — there's no actual verification that apps implement encryption correctly (or at all). An app can claim 'data is encrypted in transit and at rest' while using DES-ECB with a hardcoded key. Until app stores start requiring actual cryptographic audits, users are left trusting marketing claims.",

Pictured above is the Flipper Blackhat + Screen (480x480) + Edgar Case 2.0! \n\nSo what can it do?\n\n- 5Ghz WiFi\n- Evil portal \"passthrough\", when your victom enters their credentials, it puts them through to the internet.\n- Evil Twin.\n- Datajacker: insert a USB drive, hit a button, steals everything off the drive.\n- Dataloader: load malware to a USB drive.\n- It runs Kali Linux, so anything Kali can do from the command line, no problem.\n- 480x480 screen, to launch applications, view input, play doom, etc...\n- 2x USB-A, connect Wifi dongles, SDR radios, keyboard/mouse, whatever. \n\nAnd here's the update!\n\n- [I talked at FOSDEM 2026 in Brussels!](https://youtu.be/_D08FBf_Vh4?si=a-Ug2pfGvacQMSOj) - [Shorter video here](https://youtu.be/QxqeU8ZfaYg?si=NnZxM_cNqIlCMwhh)\n- Shipping to the US back online! (However we are back ordered now)\n- R1.0 of the [OS](https://github.com/o7-machinehum/flipper-blackhat-os/releases/tag/armbian%2Fv1.0) was released today!\n   - Bjorn integration working, if you have a screen it will also render!\n   - Kismet integration working.\n   - New application: bhtui, this is an application that can be described as a \"command builder\". It can be controller from the Flipper Zero itself and build commands that can be executed. Commands here. To use this you need this\n  - The green LED will turn on when the device is booted.\n- [Case #1 - Back in Stock](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/products/flipper-blackhat-1)\n- [Case #2 - Back in Stock](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/products/flipper-blackhat-tron-case), this is what's pictured.\n- [We're in stock!](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/)\n\nSocials to keep updated (It helps me a lot if you follow along)\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/EtZT7mjNuM)\n- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@rootkitlabs)\n- [IG](https://instagram.com/rootkitlabs)",

Either making it too convoluted for simple tasks like uploading, downloading, reading or deleting a file; leaving out auto complete or aliases, simple things that really simulate the terminal experience.\n\nI've really went out of my way to play them all, very enjoyable experience for me, just like the zachtronic games. Looking forward to your entry.",

          "text": "Everyone's saying \"yes, already happening\" but nobody's describing *how* it's actually changing the workflow, so here's a practical perspective from the offensive side.\n\nThe biggest shift isn't AI writing exploits autonomously (we're not there yet for anything non-trivial). It's AI handling the tedious reconnaissance and decision-making loop that eats 70% of a pentester's time.\n\nConsider a mobile app pentest. Traditionally, you'd manually: decompile the binary, read through thousands of classes, identify interesting endpoints, map the attack surface, hook functions with Frida, try different inputs, observe behavior, pivot based on what you find. A senior tester takes days.\n\nWhat's changing now is that LLMs can consume the full decompiled source, the accessibility tree of the running app, network traffic captures, and file system artifacts -- simultaneously -- and make contextual decisions about what to probe next. \"I see this API endpoint accepts a JWT, the token is stored in SharedPreferences unencrypted, the certificate pinning implementation has a bypass in the trust manager -- let me chain these together.\" That kind of multi-step reasoning across different data sources used to be exclusively human territory.\n\nWhere AI still falls short: novel vulnerability classes, complex business logic flaws, anything that requires understanding *intent* rather than pattern matching. An LLM will find a hardcoded API key instantly but will miss a subtle IDOR that requires understanding the app's permission model.\n\nFor APTs and nation-state actors, the real force multiplier is scale. AI-driven reconnaissance means you can profile thousands of targets simultaneously, identify the weakest links across an organization's entire mobile app portfolio, and generate custom attack chains for each -- all before a human operator touches anything. Defenders are already behind because most organizations still do manual quarterly pentests while attackers can now run continuous automated probing.\n\nThe defenders' counter is the same tech in reverse -- AI continuously scanning and testing your own infrastructure faster than attackers can. The arms race is basically who can iterate their AI pipeline faster at this point.",
