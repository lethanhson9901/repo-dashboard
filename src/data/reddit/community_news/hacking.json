We did not receive any customer inquiries regarding the interruption.\" An AWS spokesperson added: \"It was a coincidence that AI tools were involved.\"\n\nSeems like the AI had it's own role, was in supervised mode (not autopilot, which is the other mode for Kiro). Supervised mode asks someone to verify actions, in piecemeal, or 'do everything'. Maybe the reason they are blaming the dev was because the Dev allowed 'do everything', not realizing that \"I'm gonna burn yo' shit down and rebuild it\" was on line 35 of the changes it would do?\n\nFrom: [https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/](https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/)\n\n\"Supervised mode\n\nIn supervised mode, Kiro works interactively with the user, requiring their approval and guidance at each step:\n\n* Kiro suggests actions such as file creation, modification and deletion, but waits for user confirmation before proceeding\n* Kiro asks clarifying questions when needed\n* You can review and approve each generated document or code change, thus maintaining full control over the development process\n\nWhen operating in either of these modes, you can view individual or all file changes made by the agent by selecting **View all changes** in the **Chat** module. Additionally, you can also select **Revert all changes** or revert to a [checkpoint](https://kiro.dev/docs/chat/checkpoints) to restore your files to their previous state in the filesystem locally.\"\n\nIf the human blindly trusts the AI and 'allow all', is it not on the human?

The only problem is that you don't seem to know how to implement and deliver such work properly. You also don't seem to have tested it properly, and I suspect you don't know what problems powerful malware has to solve in the real world. The PoC argument seems superficial when you appear to be trying to adapt it to the real world. Like modern malware, your development approach should also be more modular and cover every aspect of deployment. This doesn't just take weeks, it can take months. You will have to deal with several issues in depth before you have a finished product. I hope you can take something away from my comment, and I hope you stick with it, because malware development is very interesting and educational.",

That’s deliberate security testing. So who authorized you to actively test the app?\n\nAnd let’s be real!!  16 findings in a few hours, with multiple “critical” auth flaws? Either you’re exaggerating severity, misunderstanding impact, or just labeling everything critical for drama.\n\nIf even ONE of those was truly critical — broken auth, exposed user data, account deletion without auth — it would stand on its own. You could have reported that properly and it wouldn’t be closed as N/A.\n\nWhy bundle 16 together? Why not report the most severe separately with clear proof of impact? That’s how serious vulnerabilities get traction.\n\nIf all 16 were marked N/A, that raises questions about scope, duplication, misunderstanding of intended behavior, or just poor classification.\n\nAnd if this was really about protecting 18,000+ users, public posting before coordinated disclosure doesn’t help them  it just creates noise and reputational pressure.\n\nYou can’t say “I’m not a security researcher” while performing structured vulnerability discovery and then be surprised when the process doesn’t go the way you expect.",

It didn't just find \"bugs\". it found critical logic bypasses and injection points that standard scanners completely missed.\n\n### The Findings:\n[Environment Variable Injection](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-82g8-464f-2mv7)\n\n\n[ACP permission auto-approval bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-7jx5-9fjg-hp4m)\n\n\n[File-existence oracle info disclosure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-6c9j-x93c-rw6j)\n\n\n[safeBins stdin-only bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-4685-c5cp-vp95)\n\nThe project is still heavily in progress, but the fact that it's already pulling in multiple vulnerabilities and other CVEs I reported using mid-tier/older models shows its strength over traditional static analysis.\n\nIf you're building in the offensive AI space I’d love for you to put this through its paces. I'm actively looking for contributors to help sharpen the scanning logic and expand the toolkitPRs and feedback are more than welcome.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)",

The key is to distribute it quickly and widely and being able to deal with the fallout.\n\nThere's little you can to protect yourself against companies or governments if they decide to become petty about the whole thing and just want to punish you, even if the information is already out. See also some of the more famous whistleblowers that leaked US internal or secret information such as Maning and Assange.\n\nAs for any means of distributing the info yourself, I'm fairly certain you'd fail if the info was \"big\" enough. Maybe a Tor hidden service could get you some of the way, but it's also common knowledge that many (most?) Tor relay nodes are actually controlled by the government. (no, that's not tin foil hat drama ;-)",

Just using HTTPS would be enough.\n\nThe reason Tor exists is to \"prevent any single point on the internet (other than the user's device) from being able to view both where traffic originated from and where it is ultimately going to at the same time\" (as written on wikipedia).\n\nIf enough relay nodes are under control of the same organization, it is highly probable that they'd be able to deanonymize traffic given enough time. Note that I'm not saying \"decrypt\". The contents of your communications will still largely be secure, but the metadata (such as source and destination IP, date / time of communications, etc) wouldn't be. These different data points could be correlated with each other to further decrease your anonymity and confidentiality. For instance, if you'd post on a forum at a specific time / date a few times.\n\nAs far as I know though, there's never been a court case or other evidence that any organization can actually do this. Then again, such power would be kept a state secret I would imagine.",

If you control access to it to a trusted group of individuals there's still a chance that will happen if they spread such information around. You're proposing the impossible here. The best way to keep a secret is for the secret to never be uttered to anyone else which defeats what you're going for here.\n\nB: Not everything on the internet is forever. Link rot is a thing, not everything gets archived and even if it does, sometimes it's in some private collection in a goon cave that goes nowhere. If you wanted to get something out, post about it on various sites, maybe buy advertisements for it. Make videos about it, make a website about it. Archive everything you've made on public archives. Make a torrent of it too and keep that thing seeded and spread the magnet link around. If people agree it's important, they will keep it alive. You can also give the information to reputable journalists as well.\n\nC: The above also defeats your purpose as none of this will keep it hidden from world powers.

Opsec is about reducing the potential harms of whatever it is you're doing being compromised and that changes greatly depending on what it is you're doing.

To prevent data from being removed you either need to have it be so widely distributed that removing is fruitless, or you need it to be in a mechanism that is resistant to removal, such as a blockchain.\n\nFor instance, let's say you find an algorithm that can factor primes far faster than anything that exists today, to the point that AES is broken. If you were to present that in a public forum, such as a conference on encryption, along with a link to your GitHub repository with the code that proves it, it would be nearly impossible to put the Genie back in the bottle.\n\nThe irony here is you couldn't use the standard cert based auth to validate you produced this, since your very algorithm makes the standard methods forgeable, so you would need to use something like an elliptical curve crypto library to create the signature.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nA few days ago I shared the early concept for **NODE: Protocol**, and the feedback was good. One of the biggest questions was: *\"How do you actually make hacking co-op without it just being two people staring at different screens?\"*\n\nI’ve spent the last few weeks building out the **\"Invisible Crew\"** system and a high-stakes **Darknet Hub** to bridge the gap. Here’s the update:\n\n**1. The \"Invisible Crew\" (MeshLink)** I’m using the **Steam SDK** for Godot to create a host-authoritative P2P relay. You don't see \"avatars\"—you see your crew through the logs. If your partner spikes the CPU on a target, you see the lag. If they exfiltrate data, you see the packets moving. You share **Heat**, but you have **Individual Traces**. If one person gets sloppy, the Feds track *their* IP, putting the whole crew in the crosshairs.\n\nYou can send BTC to your crew members if they need to spend it on exploits or toolkits to make sure they succeed with the mission. \n\nI’m currently solo-devving this in Godot 4 and aiming for a Steam release later this year. I'd love to know—does the idea of a \"Shared Heat\" mechanic make you want to play with friends, or would you be too paranoid about a \"loud\" teammate ruining your run?\n\nJoin the discord server for more information: [https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt](https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lhr11mdhmlg1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab64de6097da600b520cface178ba884a7430651\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i6t61mdhmlg1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f928f62c08ddeec0968133819cf1e5a7fed52b\n\n",

Most \"tools\" you're finding are either outdated exploits packaged with adware, or they're just wrappers around adb commands that people are charging for. Real FRP research mostly moved behind paywalls and private channels because once a bypass drops publicly, manufacturers patch it within weeks—there's no incentive for actual researchers to post detailed methodologies anymore.\n\nIf you're interested in the legitimate side of device security testing, focus on the OWASP MASTG framework instead. Understanding how FRP *works* at the OS level (Secure Boot, verified boot, attestation APIs) is more valuable than chasing bypasses. Tools like Frida and jadx let you instrument and analyze the actual FRP implementations to understand their weaknesses, which is way more educational than running some random executable. The community knowledge exists, but it's fragmented across private forums, conferences, and GitHub repos rather than consolidated in one place like it used to be.",

      "text": "# Thrilled to share NODE: Protocol\n\nHacking games have come a long way since classics like *Uplink*, but few capture the raw isolation and teamwork of real-world cyber ops. Enter **NODE: Protocol**, an indie title in active development that's blending realistic terminal hacking with immersive co-op mechanics. With single-player mode almost wrapped up, the focus is shifting to multiplayer – and it's shaping up to be a game-changer.\n\n# The Core Fantasy: You're Not Just a Hacker, You're Part of a Crew\n\nImagine booting up a custom OS that feels like a real hacker's rig: command-line tools, encrypted chats, and a vast network to infiltrate. That's NODE OS at its heart. In single-player, you're a lone operator scanning gateways, exploiting vulns with tools like nmap, searchsploit, and metasploit, all while managing heat levels to avoid traces and fed raids.\n\nBut the real magic kicks in with co-op. Drawing inspiration from *Mr. Robot*'s fsociety and real APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups, NODE: Protocol turns 2-4 players into a tight-knit cell. No avatars or gamertags – just shared intel via **MeshLink**, an in-game encrypted relay that handles text, voice, and system notifications. Your crew shares the same procedurally generated network (250 gateways, \\~2000 LAN nodes), but each has their own IP and terminal. Breach a server? The door's open for everyone. Leave sloppy logs? The trace hits *your* IP, risking a full crew raid.\n\nThis \"shared world, individual accountability\" creates emergent drama: One reckless brute-force could spike crew heat, leading to heated MeshLink debates like \"Don't hydro that – heat's at 4.2!\" It's not just co-op; it's a social simulator where trust and paranoia mirror real hacker collectives.\n\n# How Co-op Works: From Breach to Raid\n\nLet's break down a typical \"full network breach\" op, the signature co-op mode:\n\n* **Setup**: Join via Steam lobbies (friends or skill-matched public via Crew Rating brackets). Pick a mission from the board, like hitting MegaCorp's infrastructure.\n* **Roles Emerge**: No classes – roles form naturally. Breacher scans and exploits the gateway. Netrunner pivots to LAN devices for data exfil. Ghost monitors traces with analyze, cleans logs via logcleaner, and deploys diversions like strobe.\n* **Tension Builders**: Shared heat means every action counts. Traces follow individual footprints, but a raid hits everyone – cue panic shredding and wallet locks.\n* **Rewards & Progression**: Equal splits for teamwork, with contrib bonuses for MVPs. Successful ops cascade into chains, unlocking intel on connected entities for epic campaigns.\n* **Tech Backbone**: Built in Godot with Steam SDK for host-authoritative P2P. Commands route seamlessly – reads local for speed, mutations synced. Host migration ensures no session dies mid-heist.\n\nPhased rollout keeps it grounded: MVP focuses on core sharing (exploits, heat), Phase 2 adds voice and full breaches, Phase 3 polishes with persistent crews and advanced mechanics like time-locked targets (impossible solo).\n\n# Why NODE: Protocol Stands Out\n\nUnlike abstracted hackers like *Midnight Protocol* (a great turn-based puzzler), NODE emphasizes diegetic realism – everything's in the OS fiction. No UI overlays; evidence of your crew is subtle: foreign IPs in logs, heat climbing mysteriously, auto-shared exploits. It's intimate, like a real C2 (command-and-control) setup.\n\nDev insights from forums highlight the Godot fit: Signal-based architecture makes multiplayer retrofits easy, with a thin NetManager handling sync. Challenges like time limits (tuned to 5-7min for tension without frustration) and worldmap focus (full map with target highlights for agency) show thoughtful iteration.\n\nJoin discord for more information: \n\n[https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt](https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt)",
