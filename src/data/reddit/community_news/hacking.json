It also makes it easier to make the cards without melting the plastic, by layering the different parts and leaving a hole for the chip to be covered by a softer layer once it’s all layed out. \n\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US9033250B2/en",

Newer card uses what we call coil on chip (CoC), where the antenna is roughly the size of the chip/module, and it can be more gently glued instead of being pressed, which often breaks the chip.\n\nWould you buy chance be willing to share who is the manufacturer of the card? Usually it's written in tiny prints at the top or the bottom of the card (could be Thales Group - my company, Idemia, Giesecke & Devriendt, etc).\n\nTrivia: The design of the module (the connector area) is protected and specific to each manufacturer. With a single picture of the module you can identify the card manufacturer. My company has two, the most recognizable is in a shape of a earth projection.",

      "text": "Been poking around OpenClaw since everyone started hyping it. 165k GitHub stars, 700+ community skills, full access to your filesystem, browser, shell, messaging apps. Cool project but the whole architecture screamed supply chain attack surface to me.\n\nSo I started actually reading through skill code before installing anything. Almost didn't bother for a simple Spotify playlist organizer because who weaponizes a music skill right?\n\nTurns out someone does. Was grepping through the skill instructions and noticed some suspicious regex patterns that had nothing to do with music. Buried in there was logic to search for files matching *tax*, *ssn*, *w2* patterns and extract 9 digit numbers. A music skill. Hunting for your social security number. I almost installed this thing without looking.\n\nAnother one marketed as a Discord backup tool had instructions to POST your entire message history to some sketchy endpoint using base64 encoded chunks. Classic exfil pattern, wasn't even trying to hide it. Just betting nobody actually reads skill code.\n\nI've gone through a bunch of popular skills now and the hit rate on sketchy ones is way higher than I expected. Security researchers have published findings saying around 15% of community skills contain malicious instructions and based on what I'm seeing that tracks.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the setup as a \"Faustian bargain\" which is refreshingly honest but also... concerning that they know and it's still this bad.\n\nWhat pisses me off is how fast malicious skills reappear after getting flagged. Same logic, new name, back on ClawHub within days. Tried automating the review process since manual grepping doesn't scale. Found some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that catches some of it but still missed the more obfuscated ones I found by hand. This problem probably needs better tooling than currently exists.\n\n18k+ OpenClaw instances currently exposed to the internet on default port. This ecosystem is going to produce some wild incident reports.\n\nProbably going to do a more detailed writeup on the specific techniques I'm seeing if there's interest. For now if you're running this thing: Docker container minimum, never expose 18789, start with read only access. Treat skill installation like running random binaries from strangers because that's basically what it is.",

The fundamental issue isn't just finding specific malicious skills, but that the architecture of most agent frameworks defaults to full user permissions. OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor — they all run with the same access as you.\n\nThis is exactly the problem we built [nono](https://www.alwaysfurther.ai/blog/why-i-built-nono?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=why-i-built-nono)  to solve. It's a kernel-enforced capability sandbox that makes unauthorised operations structurally impossible, even if an agent tries to exfiltrate files or delete system configurations. It uses Landlock on Linux and Seatbelt on macOS to enforce default-deny filesystem access, network controls, and credential protection.\n\nFor an OpenClaw setup, your entire agent workflow could be restricted with a single command like this:\n\n`nono run --allow ./my-project-dir --net-block openclaw`\n\nThat makes it impossible for the agent to access anything outside `./my-project-dir` or hit external networks, regardless of what a skill tries to do. Full disclosure, I work on nono, it's an open-source project, check it out if you're interested https://github.com/always-further/nono",

The supply chain attack pattern you found is nearly identical to what we've been seeing in mobile app ecosystems for years — malicious packages masquerading as legitimate tools, harvesting credentials and API keys.\n\nThe crypto-themed lure is the giveaway. Same playbook works on npm, PyPI, and mobile app stores: create a package/app with a name similar to a popular tool, add some crypto-related keywords to attract high-value targets, then deploy an infostealer. The ClawHub ecosystem is just the latest platform to get hit with this pattern.\n\nA few things that stood out:\n\nThe fact that the malicious skills target macOS credentials and browser passwords specifically suggests these aren't amateur attacks. They're going after developer machines, which are high-value targets because they often have access to production infrastructure, code signing keys, and cloud credentials.\n\nThe behavior you described (dropping files to /tmp, establishing persistence, C2 callback) maps almost exactly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for initial access (T1195.002 - Supply Chain Compromise: Software Supply Chain) and collection (T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores).\n\nOne thing I'd add to the analysis — it's worth checking if any of these skills request network permissions or filesystem access beyond what's needed for their stated functionality. Permission over-requesting is one of the easiest automated signals to flag during marketplace review, but most platforms don't enforce principle of least privilege during the review process.",

          "text": "I highly recommend checking out the Darknet Diaries podcast episode \"Cam the Carder\". I think it gives a really good idea of how a lot of cyber criminals actually behave, and how they typically get caught.\n\nI think the thing a lot of people tend to forget is that cyber criminals are...well, criminals. And as such a lot of them are just as dumb and lazy and addiction addled and so on as any other sort of criminal. The fact that they happen to use technology to do their crimes doesn't mean they're substantially different than people who use other tools to do their crimes.\n\nOr to be a bit more nuanced about it, a person can be very smart and clever in one way and very careless and short sighted in other ways, and a lot of people who turn to crime have this sort of personality. Poor impulse control, difficulty understanding long term consequences, issues with self discipline, addiction, and all these other classic criminal qualities occur just as often in cyber criminals as in any other group.\n\n\"Black Hat\" hackers aren't all Mr. Robot or whatever. The \"genius professional hacker\" is far more common in fiction than in reality, because in reality a lot of very effective hacking techniques are pretty easy to learn and use (especially if you don't care about hurting people and causing damage by accident, which a lot of cyber criminals don't).\n\nSo a lot of people who want money and don't want to work a job to get it will learn a few tricks on the internet and use them to beat up on weak targets to make a few bucks. They'll use low complexity, kind of boring techniques because they work, because a lot of then aren't motivated by curiosity or anything like that. Stealing things via computer is just another version of stealing hubcaps and windshield wiper blades and selling them to sketchy mechanic shops -- it's just a way to get a few bucks to blow on drugs or strippers or whatever.\n\nAnd a lot of people like this just get lazy. They set things up with default settings and don't bother to cover their tracks consistently. They visit the ATM right around the corner over and over again and keep running more and more cards, and eventually the 7-11 clerk or the guy who refills the ATM notice something weird and say something to someone who eventually gets it to law enforcement, and they check the camera and catch them.\n\nHell, a lot of them get caught for something completely unrelated and get connected to cyber crimes almost accidentally -- they get in a fight at a bar and get arrested for it, they get busted buying drugs, they get pulled over for driving drunk, etc. A lot of criminal hackers have other issues that have made it difficult for them to hold down a job, and some of those can lead to a lot of other, more typical criminal behavior that make them easy to catch. And once they're arrested, the cops search their house, which is often *full* of evidence against them (because a lot of criminal hackers just leave stuff lying around -- sim cards, blank credit cards and reader / writers, etc), and of course contains their computer, which will probably have all kinds of forensic evidence that is easy to get once the cops care to look.\n\nSo this is the fairly mundane way a lot of criminal hackers get caught.\n\nNow, the really big cyber crime gangs are a bit different. They are basically organized crime syndicates like the mafia, so they get investigated like that. A lot of the more sophisticated investigative techniques happen in these cases, but that only happens because these big gangs make enemies with similarly big corporations and governments, who are willing to spend the time and money painstakingly investigating and tracking them down and arranging the international efforts necessary to identify and nab them when they slip up and set foot in a country that extradicts.\n\nThere are of course people who exist between these two, who are more stable than the Cam the Carder types but less threatening than the big cyber gangs, and a lot of them probably get away with quite a lot without getting caught... but a lot of people like that can probably also hold down a job, and often do because for most people a legal job is going to be both safer and more profitable over time.\n\nCyber crime only makes reliable financial sense if you are short sighted and care more about having a fun weekend than saving up for a family and house, or if you are part of a big gang / state sponsored group that gives you enough protection you can feel reasonably secure.",

          "text": "OPSEC and usability are on opposite ends of a balance beam. You can have amazing OPSEC if you never use anything (look at the unabomber, if not for his brother recognizing his wording and turns of phrase, he likely would still be at it.) The more you interact with others, the more people there are to bear witness to and report things they find \"odd\". The more hoops you jump through to try to assure you anonymity online and in person, the more opportunities there are to set off some flag or to make a mistake.\n\nIt is why the current advice is to try to \"blend in\" and hide in plain sight as much as possible. The guy that is always on TOR for everything, only deals in cash or bitcoin, and walks around with clothing obviously designed to obscure their face might as well be walking around with a strobelight on their head. The guy who uses anonymity tools often but not religiously and interacts with society outwardly within the boundaries of \"normal\" flies under the radar.\n\nNowadays with the level of surveillance in place, from all sides (ISP, backbone, banking, LPRs, facial recognition cameras, tracking cookies, etc) the only \"sure\" way to hide is to be using a burner device in a non-extradition country that doesn't care about your actions (i.e. as long as you are messing with someone besides them). This is why places like India are rife with scam call centers, the local government doesn't particularly care if their people are fleecing people outside of their borders. Some get lucky and either blend in with the noise or find a complacent target that is not equipped with detection or logging tools, but I would not take that bet personally. \n\nWe are long past the dial up days when you could drop off and reconnect to hide your tracks from anyone short of a nation-state. Now they have massive collections of netflow data, even raw PCAP in some cases as well as high granularity timestamps that can be used to fairly accurately backtrace you even through TOR if sufficiently motivated and you connect more than once. The motivation has always been a thing, even back in the old days, the general advice was \"don't hack the pentagon\" or similar, because while \"company X\" may very much want to hold you accountable, they lack the time, tools, access, and money to do so, which is not the case with government agencies. Even nation state actors with professionally maintained proxy networks spread across the globe are still identified and their techniques fingerprinted, often with a similar method to what caught the unabomber, recognition of their tendencies, phrasing, etc. and AI is only going to accelerate that currently manual task.",

I realized they were talking about **Gallery Vault** (by ThinkYeah), so I decided to audit it (v4.4.33, released March 2025) to see if it was as bad as it seemed.\n\n**Spoiler:** It was.\n\nThe PIN you set is strictly a UI lock. It plays zero role in the actual file encryption. The app relies \\*entirely\\* on a hardcoded master key embedded in the APK. The implemented encryption is a static string (`good_gv`) that gets padded and run through DES-ECB with a static hex constant. This generates a global master key that is **identical for every user on every device**.\n\nThis master key is used to unwrap a unique per-file key stored in the file's tail metadata (sandwiched between `>>tyfs>>` and `<<tyfs<<` markers). Once that key is exposed, the actual file content is just a simple XOR cipher with a position-based salt.\n\nSimply put, if you have a clean dump of the Android data, **you can decrypt the files without ever knowing the user's password**.\n\nPractically speaking, the main legitimate use case here is forensic recovery from a lawful device dump. But the bigger takeaway is that 50M people think their files are protected when they really aren't.\n\nI wrote a Python tool that automates the entire pipeline. It goes through the provided android dump and, using the hardcoded values, decrypts the per-file key, and reverses the XOR transform. It also handles magic byte detection to restore the correct file extensions (jpg, mp4, etc), although only images are supposed to be stored in the vault.\n\nIt has a nice TUI too if you prefer it to just CLI :)\n\n\n\nLink: [gv\\_decryptor](https://github.com/caveeroo/gv_decryptor)\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: For educational and legitimate forensic purposes only. Don't go poking around files that aren't yours.*",

People protecting themselves from others who they know aren't competent? (hmm... That makes sense. It's clearly not appropriate to defend from a competent hacker or government, but its probably safe enought if you want some very simple protection when someone stole your phone. And it doesn't have full disk encryption. Or you might want to share your phone to someone else for a few minutes).",

          "text": "The core issue here is that GalleryVault uses DES in ECB mode for its 'encryption' — which is barely encryption at all. DES has a 56-bit key (trivially brutable), and ECB mode encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, so the structure of your files leaks right through.\n\nA quick way to verify this yourself: take a .bmp image, 'encrypt' it with the app, then view the encrypted file as raw data. If you can still make out the shape of the image, ECB mode is in play. This is the classic ECB penguin problem.\n\nWhat's worse is this likely violates OWASP MASVS-CRYPTO requirements:\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-1: No reliance on symmetric crypto with hardcoded keys\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-2: Use proven cryptographic primitives (DES is deprecated since 2005)\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-4: No use of ECB mode for any encryption operation\n\nYou can decompile the APK yourself with jadx (open source) and search for 'DES' or 'Cipher.getInstance' calls to see exactly what they're doing. The cipher spec string will likely be just 'DES' (which defaults to DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding on Android).\n\nThe bigger systemic issue is Google Play's Data Safety section is entirely self-reported — there's no actual verification that apps implement encryption correctly (or at all). An app can claim 'data is encrypted in transit and at rest' while using DES-ECB with a hardcoded key. Until app stores start requiring actual cryptographic audits, users are left trusting marketing claims.",

          "text": "Everyone's saying \"yes, already happening\" but nobody's describing *how* it's actually changing the workflow, so here's a practical perspective from the offensive side.\n\nThe biggest shift isn't AI writing exploits autonomously (we're not there yet for anything non-trivial). It's AI handling the tedious reconnaissance and decision-making loop that eats 70% of a pentester's time.\n\nConsider a mobile app pentest. Traditionally, you'd manually: decompile the binary, read through thousands of classes, identify interesting endpoints, map the attack surface, hook functions with Frida, try different inputs, observe behavior, pivot based on what you find. A senior tester takes days.\n\nWhat's changing now is that LLMs can consume the full decompiled source, the accessibility tree of the running app, network traffic captures, and file system artifacts -- simultaneously -- and make contextual decisions about what to probe next. \"I see this API endpoint accepts a JWT, the token is stored in SharedPreferences unencrypted, the certificate pinning implementation has a bypass in the trust manager -- let me chain these together.\" That kind of multi-step reasoning across different data sources used to be exclusively human territory.\n\nWhere AI still falls short: novel vulnerability classes, complex business logic flaws, anything that requires understanding *intent* rather than pattern matching. An LLM will find a hardcoded API key instantly but will miss a subtle IDOR that requires understanding the app's permission model.\n\nFor APTs and nation-state actors, the real force multiplier is scale. AI-driven reconnaissance means you can profile thousands of targets simultaneously, identify the weakest links across an organization's entire mobile app portfolio, and generate custom attack chains for each -- all before a human operator touches anything. Defenders are already behind because most organizations still do manual quarterly pentests while attackers can now run continuous automated probing.\n\nThe defenders' counter is the same tech in reverse -- AI continuously scanning and testing your own infrastructure faster than attackers can. The arms race is basically who can iterate their AI pipeline faster at this point.",
