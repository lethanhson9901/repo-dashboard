Not only is it standard practice to exclude external resources when scraping domains, but it's incredibly easy to fingerprint and remove unwanted data.\n\nI know y'all don't want to hear that because this seems like a message of hope, but we have to be smarter than this... This is an idiotic approach, like pouring gas on the hood of a car because cars need gas to run - we don't know what type of engine the car has, how much gas it needs, or where the gas goes - we don't know if the poisoned data will have an effect on the model because we don't know what sort of model is being used, what data actually matters, how the data is filtered and transformed, or how the data is being used. \n\nSure, it seems like a good idea to try anything and everything, but the number of known techniques to poison specific, publicly-available models, scraping techniques, and use-cases is so incredibly small against the infinite possibilities for-profit companies with private models and capabilities develop. You're throwing rocks and sticks at an M1 Abrams tank, trying things from an early 2000's grad student's thesis on how to stop this newfangled Google webcrawler from indexing your webpage, facing an army of the most talented, professional researchers, data scientists, and programmers, with infinite resources and grad students, that the world has to offer.\n\nI'm not saying I know what the technical solution is - I don't think there is a technical solution - but I think we need to solve this problem either through legal means or market demand, because as long as there's investor money backing AI model training research, we won't be able to stop paid intellectual innovation with our meager efforts.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice on a \"silent patch\" situation. About three weeks ago, I discovered a critical RCE in a product that has several high paid tiers ($500–$2,000/mo).\n\nI followed the proper disclosure process and reported it privately via GHSA (GitHub Security Advisory) and followed up with a few professional emails.\n\nThe maintainer never acknowledged the report in the GHSA thread and has completely ignored my emails. yesterday, I just checked their latest release and they silently patched the exact logic I reported. There is no mention of a security fix in the release notes, no CVE, and the GHSA draft is still sitting in triage while they refuse to credit me.\n\nIt feels like they’re trying to avoid the \"Critical\" label on their record to protect their commercial image while taking my research for free.\n\nSince the patch is now public code, am I clear to just publish my own technical write-up and publish their name to the world? Should I bypass them and request a CVE ID directly via MITRE or another CNA to ensure the vulnerability is actually documented? I’m not asking for a bounty, but I want the credit for my professional portfolio, and it feels shady for a company charging $2k/month to sweep a full RCE under the rug.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with maintainers who take the fix but refuse to acknowledge the researcher?\n\nAny advice on how to handle this without being \"the bad guy\" would be appreciated.\n\n  \nEdit: so I decided to contact MITRE directly and not risk getting sued by a company with a battery of lawyers. Hopefully that gets accepted and I can add it to the list of my found CVEs",

          "text": "There are some \"interesting\" takes in this thread, so I'm going to note a couple of things:\n\n1. You, as a security researcher and a bug reporter, are NOT entitled to a credit, a response to an email/bug, or even a bug fix ever being made. It's nice and professional when a company does this, but it is their right to choose what they do. You can of course ask for credit, but you have to accept \"no\" for an answer. There is no reason to shame the company for not giving credit (as others suggested) or to start a public discussion about it. I would however note it down in the published report in a matter of fact way (\"Company hasn't responded. Company fixed the bug. Unclear whether the fix was due to my report, another report, or internal findings as no credits accompanied the fix.\")\n2. Unless you have a contract with the company or with someone handling their bug bounty program (doesn't seem to be the case), you contacting them is strictly a courtesy on your side. The reason security researchers do this, is to make sure the users are protected, and contacting the vendor with a bug report is commonly the fastest way to do that without putting users at risk. I.e. security researchers work for the benefit of users, not the vendor — an important thing to remember (it also helps to answer some other questions).\n3. In general you can publish your research whenever (though be sure your country hasn't regulated this in law to some extent). Some folks do full-disclosure, some folks wait patiently until the fix is published (coordinated disclosure) — or even a bit longer, and some folks follow e.g. the 90-day policy (whichever version). Personally I like the 90-day policy, as I think it benefits the users the most (though it's not a simple or straight-forward topic). The extent of the research you want to publish is also your choice and you can spread the details over time if you want.\n4. Furthermore, as others mentioned, you can request CVEs yourself. I'll give you a few hints:\n   1. Publish your research first (at least some info, that will be most helpful to defenders), because the CVE form requires you to provide some links with more information. You can always write that the CVE number is pending.\n   2. The better you fill out the form, the faster it's going to be processed. Look how other CVEs are filled, try to mimic the structure and level of details. This makes MITRE's reviewer job waay easier and therefore the CVE is assigned much faster.\n   3. If MITRE doesn't reply in like 10 days, ping them.\n5. Note that a CVE number isn't a trophy — it's just a mechanism to help defenders discover that they need to fix systems in a more automated way. For your security researcher's career purposes a link to your published research is enough, even without the vendor crediting you.\n6. In general always remember to communicate with vendors / MITRE / etc in a friendly, professional way. This is a negotiation situation, and what benefits users the most, is everyone working together. At times that's not possible. At times it requires some more pinging the company.\n   1. This said, always take into account that the company can send you legal threats regardless of what you do. I've seen legal threats sent to researchers just because they dared to report a bug, or because they written something as trivial as \"vendor's patching process is subpar and requires improvements\". If that happens and it's your first time, remain calm and chat with some more senior security researchers or a lawyer who deals with cybersec — they can usually help you deescalate the situation.",

But the article makes blind assumptions about the bulk deployment of the Apollo Federation architecture without ever supplying evidence that this was observed in the field or that this is even a common misconfiguration:\n\n\"An exposed Apollo Federation subgraph can leak its full schema\n... The trail led to a single, easy-to-miss line in Apollo Federation’s documentation. A brief warning that effectively says, “do not expose this\"... While necessary for functionality, these fields pose security risks when exposed publicly... If a subgraph is directly accessible... The security issue arises from architectural misconfigurations in deployment... When internal protocols become externally reachable...\"\n\nChecking Apollo's Federation documentation, every attempt is made to express that subgraphs should never be exposed and only the router should interface with the subgraphs. It's not a \"brief warning\", it's literally in every architectural diagram and heavily mentioned. Even Google's AI knows this is bad, when you look it up: \"... While clients shouldn't query subgraphs directly in production...\"\n\nExposing subgraphs also goes against the entire purpose of using Apollo's federation, as the point is to create a single interface (i.e., the router) for accessing multiple API's. So I don't think this represents a genuine concern with how this architecture is being deployed, unless anyone has any practical examples to counter this. \n\nWhat irks me the most are the parts on how testers don't look for this and that the AI was able to reason its way into finding this misconfiguration during an alleged engagement. How would either go about finding exposed subgraphs? The AI doesn't magically divine where such an exposed subgraph might be - there would obviously need to be a discovery process, either through the initial scoping, where the customer sends detailed information about the deployment, or through interactive and exhaustive analysis (e.g., dirbusting, crawling, scraping references, and bruteforcing variable names). \n\nI've never seen an engagement where a tester hasn't done this, and there are already so many automated tools to accomplish this.\n\nAgain, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think this is a common misconfiguration in the slightest. I think this is probably a wild mischaracterization of a test/dev backend environment that this AI product was dropped into, where it had access to resources that would normally be locked behind the Apollo Federation router, behind the application, behind network infrastructure, before reaching the Internet. I understand that they need to build hype for their startup by paying aggregators to push their self-published content, but to say that this is an \"inflection point\" or that anything of value was demonstrated here (given a complete lack of sources showing otherwise) is incredibly disingenuous, to where the founders of Runsybil should genuinely question their intentions on whether they're here to help improve security or simply grift off of people that aren't smart enough to read between the lines. The latter arguably hurts everyone.",

      "text": "Please investigate P25 radio communications in your area. I am using a modified version of [SDRTrunk](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk) in my area to capture GBs of interesting and useful P25 metadata. P25 is the radio communications platform all local and federal officials use to communicate; think of it as government radio Discord. All you need are 2-5x SDRs (I have RTL-SDRs) running in parallel to capture multiple counties worth of radio call event metadata. This includes unencrypted (local EMS / Fire) and even unencrypted metadata from encrypted (Special / Federal (DOJ, ICE, CBP)) radio communications. This data is super useful in identifying trends and patterns which help you filter down to interesting results. Think helping you track down a needle in a radio haystack. I've identified multiple radios:\n\n* Operating outside of their jurisdiction\n* Operating from out of state\n* Unique (federal) radio configurations\n* Radios operating on undocumented talk groups\n* Highly mobile devices visiting multiple districts in a day\n* Radios with elevated permissions\n* Commander radios \n* etc\n\nThe benefit is once you can identify the pattern you are looking for you can take it locally. Now every time an *interesting* P25 radio opens coms within 2-5 mile radius around me I am automatically alerted and my directional antenna can even help pinpoint the direction they are. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBrfqLc0E2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBrfqLc0E2U)\n\n**Please DM me if you wish to learn more; stay vigilant!**\n\nPlease note my modified version of SDRTrunk only **decodes** unencrypted data; it does not decrypt encrypted data.\nDecoding unencrypted data is perfectly legal however the action you take on that data may not be legal. Do not interfere with enforcement operations based on this data or commit crimes using this data. Doing so will significantly increase your sentence. \n\n\n**Legal Notice & Disclaimer**\n\nMonitoring unencrypted P25 radio communications is legal under federal law. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act explicitly permits interception of \"any governmental, law enforcement, civil defense, private land mobile, or public safety communications system, including police and fire, readily accessible to the general public\" (18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(g)(ii)(II)). Unencrypted transmissions meet the statutory definition of \"readily accessible\" under 18 U.S.C. § 2510(16). The FCC has confirmed that publication of such communications is not prohibited by 47 U.S.C. § 605.\n\n**Responsible Use Guidelines**: This information is provided for academic research, radio hobbyist education, and interoperability study purposes only. Users must not: (1) attempt to decrypt encrypted communications; (2) use this information to facilitate, aid, or abet criminal activity; (3) interfere with law enforcement operations; or (4) exploit this data for commercial gain without authorization. Some states restrict mobile scanner use—verify local laws before portable monitoring. The presence of system identifiers, talkgroups, or frequencies in this document does not guarantee current operational status, as agencies frequently reconfigure their communications infrastructure.",

Long time lurker, first-time poster.\nI’m still relatively new to the scene, but over the past few months I’ve had a lot of success reverse-engineering and red-teaming Gemini (Google’s AI platform). I’ve found multiple working zero-days and full security bypasses, including architectural issues, and submitted three of them to Google’s official VRP program.\n\nHere’s where it gets frustrating:\nTwo of the exploits were silently patched with zero communication, no acknowledgment, and no bounty, despite being clear violations of Google’s own outlined VRP policy. One day the exploits worked; next day, post-Christmas, they were dead. No appropriate triage, no follow up, nothing. Just patched and ghosted.\n\nI found working bypasses to both patches within 30 minutes. The core issue is architectural, not a simple one liner fix, but it feels like they’re just slapping a band-aid on and pretending the vector doesn’t exist.\nI’ve since built even more advanced exploit chains, using full red team methodology, and I’m at a crossroads now.\n\nDo I give them another shot and submit one more (hoping they don’t take the piss again)? Or do I start looking elsewhere; private buyers, brokers, or even just responsible public disclosure?\nThese aren’t minor bugs. These are multi-stage attack chains that meet the top payout tier according to their own guidelines.\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve dealt with VRP, especially folks who’ve reported to Google recently.\n\nIs this a one-off? Or is this becoming the norm?\nSerious input only please. Appreciate any advice.\n\nEdit. Thank you everyone for your responses. I understand that there are no other ethical options really open to white hat hackers in a situation like this. That is a shame. Someone even in the comments went as far as telling me to stop ethical hacking and that I give you guys a bad reputation. How kind. I do apologise if I have given you guys a 'bad reputation' for asking a genuine question. Thank you for everyone else's input. ",

Use Tor Browser. Cuz anti detect browsers are designed to make each profile look like a unique normal user to websites, not to provide actual anonymity. They're fingerprint randomization tools.\n\nIf you mean multi accounting then yeah, anti xetect browsers make sense.\nAdsPower seems to be popular for managing lots of accounts, decent fingerprint separation.\nMultilogin probably the most established, expensive as hell, but profiles stay stable. Incogniton is newer, some people like it.\n\nI'm not gonna recommend one specifically because I don't use them for the obvious reason that multi accounting at scale is usually against ToS of whatever platform you're doing it on. But from what I've seen people say, Multilogin is probably the most reliable if you're willing to pay, and AdsPower is the middle ground.",

          "text": "Honestly, if you’re bored with the standard stuff and want to keep it local, I’d highly recommend trying to spin up a small environment rather than just hunting for single boxes.\n\nGOAD (Game of Active Directory) is hands down the best project for this right now. You grab it off GitHub and spin it up locally. It’s totally different from VulnHub machines because it’s not just about getting root on one server, it forces you to learn lateral movement, pivoting, and Kerberoasting. It feels way more like a \"real\" network.\n\nIf you strictly want single downloadable VMs, give Metasploitable 3 a shot. It is completely different from MS2; it actually makes you work for the enumeration and feels much more modern. The SickOs series on VulnHub is also a solid classic that doesn't feel like a total guessing game.\n\nBut yeah, if your rig can handle the RAM, definitely look into the AD labs. That’s where the real fun starts.",
