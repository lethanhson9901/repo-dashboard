Fortunately, some states are introducing legislation to require this (it is unfortunate that said legislation is necessary, since I would have hoped the courts would rule that way, but they haven't). \n\nIn any event, even though the Flock cameras in question have been patched, there are of course plenty of other cameras  (not Flock-related, just normal consumer market devices) you can find on Shodan that are unprotected.",

His home computer got hacked by russia around the 2000s leading to the shadow brokers who published all these elite tools for everyone in the world to see. Since then its been pretty fair game for all nation state actors. No ones offensive capabilities match their defensive so were again in a we have nukes u have nukes position with every one else on this front. Everyone is in eachothers systems.",

This event lead to much more sophisticated hacks and larger state sponsored groups by various nations. \n\n   \nSecond book is called operation sandworm by andy greenberg.  This covers an elite russian cyber unit that became prominent in 2010s when they began hacking ukraine prior to the modern russia Ukraine conflict. This was before they went to physical war. \n   \n   \nThe third is called this is how they tell me the world ends. Which covers how the world and various nations responded to the advancements in cyber ware fare. This outlines the race to hoard zero days and get spies into companies where they could plant exploits for later use. How cyber is currently all offense with little defense capability. This explains how we got to today. Over the years.\n   \n   \n@cyber news though covers alot of these events if u dont like books. But the books are such great reads i highly recommend. Itll keep u engaged",

If these are internet-accessible endpoints you're targeting, use something like Shodan (https://www.shodan.io/) or Censys (https://search.censys.io/) first. That data has already been pulled via scans, so at least you're not interacting with the target in realtime.\n\nWhen you ask about minimizing \"traces\" I would think about hiding your source IP as well. If you're going to interact directly with the targets, using something like a virtual private server or proxying through other endpoints (however you get access to them) would also be a good idea. That's how the biggest nation-state hacking groups get it done and it makes attribution a real pain, though with enough resources and effort like the FIVE EYES intel agencies they'll find out who you are.",

Rather than relying on generic scans, crafting specific, protocol-aware requests often leads to more accurate discovery of hosts and services. For example, SMB or CIFS probes can help identify Windows systems, while DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, or SNMP interactions can reveal hostnames, web services, applications, or network devices.\n\nWhen discretion is required, stealth-oriented approaches are preferred. These include passive discovery by observing existing traffic, slowing down request rates to blend in with normal activity, and using minimal, legitimate-looking protocol requests. Focusing only on likely services instead of performing broad scans further reduces noise and the chance of detection.\n\nOverall, combining targeted discovery with stealth techniques allows meaningful information gathering while keeping network visibility and detection risks low.",

So if you're doing a preliminary scan it's not plausible unless you got inside information.\n\nI'm assuming you're doing a preliminary scan for a pentest or bug bounty. In that case:\n\nI think the absolute lowest trace would be: stealth scan, lower speed, possibly fragmenting packets (to evade firewalls/ids flags against some targets), and don't ping (assuming you know host is up).\nThis would slow down your scan a lot, omit the ping logs, and fragment your scans so they're harder to detect. A scan like this would take forever, so probably start it before making coffee and breakfast, and get ready to watch some entertainment when you sit back down while you wait lol.",

It's inspired by classics such as \"Uplink\", but also books that I think everyone passionate about IT security should read (\"The Cuckoo's Egg\" by Cliff Stoll, \"Hackers: Heroes of the digital revolution\" by Steven Levy.. ).\n\nIt's also a very nostalgia-based game since you'll be connecting to BBS around the world and it's heavily CLI-focused. Finding the right spot between \"fun\" and \"realism\" is something I've always been deliberate about, and I hope you'll like it!\n\nThere is a demo already available here if you want to try it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508150/ or wishlist it!\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the game!",

          "text": "If your laptop doesn't have space for VMs locally, you can run everything in the cloud which is actually pretty common for pentest labs.\n\nThe easiest free option is probably using VirtualBox or VMware with external storage. Get a decent USB 3.0 external drive or even a fast USB stick if you're on a budget, install VirtualBox on your laptop, then configure it to store the VM files on the external drive instead of your internal disk. VirtualBox lets you change the default machine folder location in preferences. This way the VMs live on external storage but you can still run them normally, you just need to keep the drive plugged in. The performance hit isn't terrible if you use USB 3.0 or better yet an external SSD.\n\nIf you don't want to deal with external drives, cloud options exist but they're more limited for free. AWS has a free tier that gives you some EC2 instances for a year but the specs are pretty low and you'd need to be careful about not exceeding the limits or they'll charge you (maybe even... A lot). You could run a Kali instance and a Windows instance in AWS but managing networking between them and keeping it all in the free tier is kind of annoying, I'm too lazy to waste my energy on this. Google Cloud and Azure have similar free tiers with the same limitations.\n\nAnother option is using something like TryHackMe or HackTheBox which are specifically designed for hacking labs. They host everything in the cloud so you don't need local resources at all, you just access the VMs through your browser or VPN. TryHackMe has a bunch of free rooms and labs where they give you access to vulnerable machines you can practice on. HackTheBox has some free machines too but most of the good stuff requires a subscription. These are honestly better for learning than setting up your own lab from scratch because the machines are already configured to be vulnerable in interesting ways, whereas if you just spin up a random Windows VM you'd need to intentionally misconfigure it or install vulnerable software to have anything to actually hack.\n\nIf you specifically want to build your own lab for some reason, there's also the option of using a older laptop or desktop if you have one lying around. Turn it into a dedicated lab machine, install a hypervisor like Proxmox or ESXi on bare metal, run your VMs there, and access it remotely from your main laptop. This is actually how a lot of people do home labs because it keeps the resource-heavy stuff off your daily driver machine.\n\nYou could also look into using containers instead of full VMs. Docker containers use way less disk space and resources than VMs. There are Kali Docker images and you can run vulnerable Windows containers for testing, though Windows containers are less common and kind of janky. This won't give you the full VM experience but for a lot of pentesting practice it's enough.\n\nAnother free cloud option that people don't talk about much is Oracle Cloud's free tier which is actually pretty generous. They give you two AMD compute instances free forever, not just for a year like AWS. The specs aren't amazing but it's enough to run a Kali instance and a Windows instance if you're not doing anything too resource-intensive. You'd need to figure out the networking to get them talking to each other but it's doable.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind if you go the cloud route is that hacking activities even against your own VMs can sometimes trigger abuse alerts from cloud providers if they detect port scanning or exploit attempts. **Make sure you read their terms of service** and maybe keep your activities limited to stuff that doesn't generate a ton of network noise that might get flagged.\n\nHonestly though if you're just starting out, I'd go with TryHackMe or HackTheBox first before building your own lab. You'll learn faster with pre-configured vulnerable machines and you don't have to worry about the infrastructure side. Once you know what you're doing and want more control, then invest in external storage or a dedicated lab machine. Building the lab is kind of a distraction from actually learning pentesting unless the lab setup itself is what you're trying to learn.",

Any member can set it to 1 at any time meaning their transaction will always get approved. Vice versa any member can set it to the maximum amount potentially slowing the process. A variable like that shouldn't be able to be altered so easily and is definitely a vulnerability. It should only be getting recalculated when necessary. IE: When a certain amount of members log in, or leave. With no say from the members themselves.\n\nnoDuplicate, is very unoptimized and a potential vulnerability, it should be instead looking for something like a UUID, something to quickly compare against and see if it's the same member, rather than checking through the entire object which could infact lead to duplicate member objects if one variable is slightly different. Fortunately it isn't getting called anywhere here. The same applies to onlyMember here, but to a less serious but potentially problematic degree for users implying msg.sender is trusted by this point. The same solution as noDuplicate is required here. (Then again when I think about it if it was trusted by this point it shouldn't need to be verified again anyways. Thinking about it this whole thing might be a big vulnerability.)",
