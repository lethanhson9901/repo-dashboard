The software itself is genuine.  This became so commonplace that the companies that make the software started putting warnings in it when you allow connections (\"DO YOU KNOW THE PERSON YOU ARE ALLOWING CONTROL YOUR PC?\" sort of thing).  This was actually quite effective, so the scammers needed a workaround.\n\nTurns out that the software would only issue the warning when you allowed somebody connect to you, not when you connected to control a remote PC.  However, it had another feature, while you were remote controlling a PC you would be given the option to reverse the connection, allowing the other person control your PC.

By doing all the port scanning and Shodan searches you mentioned, you get access to their cameras, their computers, and personal details.

At that point their greed usually handles the rest and they will try to pull it down to their own machine to open it. A quiet remote access trojan (RAT) can give the person controlling it the same type of access they would have if sitting at the infected computer. From there it is just a matter of surveying the environment (browse local files, scan the network, connect to other machines on the network, wash-rinse-repeat, etc.). A well practiced and skilled pentester could pull most of this off in less than a day. The challenge is the social engineering to convince the scammer that they are dealing with a \"senile old lady with memory issues\" and not a pentester running an ancient windows 7 box as a honeypot.\n\nSome of the more recent videos have shown an increase in paranoia from some of the scammers. Some now check the device manager for telltale signs they are in a VM. So it is likely they will eventually adjust their calculations for profit vs expense and decide that basic anti-virus or even enterprise grade IDS/IPS and layer 7 firewalls are worth the investment. But for now, their model is still profitable enough that they don't seem to care if they are taken down since they can just grab a new batch of cheap PCs and a random apartment to be back online overnight. I would be surprised if they even bother to re-image their machines when they get infected, they probably just sell them to unsuspecting people for a quick buck and easy evidence disposal.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is a professionally managed scam center with a curated collection of global proxy servers that uses sandboxed VMs for the scammer side and has proper network and device security. It would be incredibly difficult to pull off the exploitations of the scammer networks we currently see with the \"fly by night cashgrab\" operations we currently deal with. Fortunately, outside of North Korea, that sort of thing is pretty much unheard of.",

They simply let the guys know before hand what will happen and then they pay them a flat rate based on how well the video does. \n\nLiterally all of these videos follow the same formula, anyone who has real life experience breaking into systems will know it's not that particularly difficult but most of the times these networks just don't have that many devices connected to the internet to really make a big difference. It's usually useless shit that doesn't amount to anything, ie printers, laptops with bullshit on em, network drives with nothing but excel sheets and pdfs, etc.\n\nI always find it interesting all these scammers seem to have IP cameras with insecure passwords. That also conveniently shows the scammers faces and work space in full view. For some reason the scammer themselves also never block out the cameras or even go and pull the plug on their network rack.\n\n They just feed into this Mr Robot fantasy because they're more actors than real scammers. Also the dollar exchange rate to their local currency works out pretty well.\n\nYes the methods and tools used are legit. RATs, reverse shells, etc can definitely work but it's more a Hail Mary luck of the draw thing when it comes to day to day hacking.",

Then it's a piece of cake. These people probably work behind the scenes for large corporations.

              "text": "This, but with some practical complications and limitations.\n\nFirst, the \"good-faith security research\" from the CFAA only applies when considering criminal liability, **but not civil liability.** This means that you, the security researcher, don't necessarily have carte blanche to go hack whatever you want to without incurring civil liability for your actions - if you cause damages to a private company or violate existing legal terms you agreed upon, they can hold you accountable.\n\nIn addition to the quantifiable damages we might be familiar with as hackers (e.g., creating DoS conditions, stealing intellectual property/data/money, other criminal and malicious activities), compensation for intangible damages can also be pursued - you publicly lied about finding a vulnerability (defamation), you publicize an article about a vulnerability without carefully verifying your claims (negligent misrepresentation).\n\nSpeaking practically and from experience, whether or not a company will pursue civil legal action against you comes down to: do they know, and do they care? And both of these depend on what you're actually doing. \n\nIf you're pulling apart binaries to hunt for vulnerabilities on your private computer, no one's going to know until you decide to do something with what you find, and how you go about that process determines what criminal and/or civil liability you open yourself up to. You avoid this by being smart and responsible, lawyering up, and only making calculated moves.\n\nIf you're actively touching remote systems you don't own (e.g., live testing a company's web application whom you do not work for, querying a database that's not yours, or connecting to a private network with a banner stating as much) **- I cannot emphasize this enough - it DOES NOT MATTER if they have a bug bounty program - THIS IS NOT IMMUNITY - YOU CAN INCUR CIVIL LIABILITY.** Bug bounty programs are not a legally binding contract with you. The company can still pursue legal action against you, even if you follow all of the rules and stay in scope, simply because they don't like you. It's happened to people. It can happen to you. There's literally nothing but reputation standing in the way. \n\nThe only way to minimize personal liability is to work under a company (like an LLC), lawyer up, and have said lawyer draft a contract in line with a clear statement of work from your customer. If you don't have a signed contract between both parties, you're acquiring legal liability as your profession.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, companies sue anyone and everyone all of the time, for any reason, even when they know they can't win. Be a professional - always wear (legal) protection.\n\nSource: I've been personally sued for contributing to a bug bounty program, my various employers have been sued on my behalf, I've been sued for responsibly and privately disclosing vulnerabilities, I've had friends in this industry argue with me that bug bounty programs are safe and protected who were then sued by the company after submitting their findings (lol), my lawyers have successfully defended me from liability against a very large and wealthy network infrastructure company that didn't like my 0-day (they're still mad), I've had clients with contracts try to sue me because they didn't like how right I was after they paid me to be right, and I did it all without developing a criminal record (so far).",

Technically, a prosecutor could bring chargers under the original law. Additionally, those guidelines could not be used as a defense. \n\nThat being said, there are requirements laid out and steps that must be taken prior to charging a defendant that would make it very difficult for a prosecutors to defy the guidelines. \n\nFrom [Arnold & Palmer](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/enforcement-edge/2022/05/cybersecurity-research-with-violating-cfaa):\n> As a procedural matter, all federal prosecutors who seek to charge cases under the CFAA are required to consult with DOJ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) before bringing charges. If the prosecutor intends to charge a case contrary to CCIPS’s written recommendation, she must inform the Deputy Attorney General’s office before charging and, in some cases, seek approval.\n\nThere is language included that touches on monetary gain and extortion. This is why you’ll see people strongly urge others not to “cold-call” organizations asking for a reward that don’t have a bounty program after finding a vulnerability \n\nDOJ memos & guidelines with respect to how much weight they carry is whole other can of worms. There’s been a handful of pretty significant policy changes over the past few administrations. It’s made it pretty difficult for Federal prosecutors.",

Since you've got settings access, you might want to grab the APKs directly from /data/app/ using adb over USB and decompile them with jadx to see what's actually running under the hood—Miko robots typically have some aggressive telemetry and the stock app usually has hardcoded endpoints you can block at the firewall level. If Google Play Store won't install, it's probably because the device is missing Play Services or has a restricted signature—try sideloading the microG variant instead, which is stripped down and won't fight as hard against the locked-down ROM. Also worth checking if ADB is enabled in developer options; if it is, you can skip the OTG keyboard entirely next time and just push APKs directly over USB. The blank privacy policy is a solid tell that they're intentionally limiting user agency on the device, which is worth documenting if you plan to write this up anywhere.",

The framework-specific reversing section is probably the most useful part -- most public resources only cover native Java/Kotlin, but in practice a huge percentage of apps now ship as Flutter, React Native, or .NET MAUI, and each one has completely different binary layouts and string storage. The MAUI section is especially relevant right now because those apps embed .NET DLLs directly in the APK (blob files on Android, bundle root on iOS), and all the business logic strings end up there instead of the DEX bytecode. If you only run strings on classes.dex you will miss everything.\n\nThe banking trojan section covering NFC relay attacks is timely too. We have been seeing more of those in the wild since Android 14 made HCE relay trivially easy to implement with a few lines of HostApduService code.\n\nOne thing I would love to see added is coverage of how apps detect instrumentation frameworks -- not just Frida but also the newer Dobby-based hooking that some protectors are starting to use. The cat-and-mouse between packers and hooking frameworks is getting interesting.",

      "text": "Hey redditors,\n\nI am finally at a point that I am comfortable enough to share the gaming project i am working on.  \nThe goal was to create a hacking simulator that is realistic but also entertaining with extra perks that we missed in older games like uplink, hacknet and grey hack.\n\nFor example in node - protocol it is possible to infect hosts with a botnet or crypto miner.  \nbesides that the game has a full integration with bitcoin payments, this will be used for mission payouts, certain hosts will have a wallet.dat to crack for extra payouts.\n\nThe openworld has NPC's and the total amount of devices is over 2400+ including mobile devices and wifi networks to crack to find them.\n\nOther fun things are the darkmarket where you can buy computer upgrades or software upgrades to have kernel exploits.\n\nI am aiming to make the game coop, but i am not yet 100% sure how this will work out, any ideas would be welcome :)\n\nIn upcoming weeks I will launch the demo on steam for an early peek so players can give feedback and test the game mechanics.\n\nScreenshots of the current alpha version: [https://imgur.com/a/node-protocol-alpha-XKob1da](https://imgur.com/a/node-protocol-alpha-XKob1da)  \nTo follow the progress join the discord server [https://discord.gg/A3jV8JYt](https://discord.gg/A3jV8JYt)",

      "text": "Im looking for advice on where to start on getting some data out of a piece of hardware. I have a piece of hardware which connects to my local network thru wifi. You then can load the software which connects to the hardware thru the network and that software then gives you the data. The company has since locked the hardware that was purchased behind a subscription model, yes I would now have to pay them to use the hardware I purchased outright. I guess I have two questions.    \n1. Would it be feasible to just grab the data directly and have a little program that just spit that out? I did install wireshark and was able to intercept packets. I do also have a LLM and installed private-gpt to try and send that data to the LLM to try to decode it, wasnt successful yet! I assume in this situation there would have to be some sort of handshake? Maybe the box just constantly sends data?  \n2. I did also try to use radare2 and r2ai/decai to try to make the software more friendly to me. Those tho seem to be really aimed at linux and this is a windows app. I am also not a great programmer, I know just enough to get myself in trouble. Is there somewhere I could browse to find people more accomplished at at task like that? Removing certain parts of software?    \nThis seems to skirt a couple of the sub rules, hopefully its ok :)",

UART/TTL headers offer interesting insights during boot and/or operation. Dumping any 25c or other flash storage and doing binwalk , extracting any filesystem's (or squashes) and see what can be dine that way. And then there's jtag. Knowing what the memory and CPU are doing in real time, for example. \n\n\nBut if you just expect to wireshare pcap a packet, pipe it to an LLM and be hacking.. Yeah, good luck with that.
