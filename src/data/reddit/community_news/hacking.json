When I finished my physics exam I went over it again just to be sure the answers I put were the answers I wanted to put (multiple choice), and spent the rest of the time playing the original Zelda. When my teacher walked past me and saw that I was playing a game, he was both impressed and suspicious that I'd stored answers on it. I saved the game, went through all the files in the calculator just to show him that the only thing stored on it was games and an old principal interest calculator spreadsheet that I made that I forgot I even had on there, and when he was satisfied with it not having any extra material, he let me keep playing it for the rest of the duration I was required to stay, and let me leave. I didn't score too well on that exam to be honest, but fuck it it was a good way to pass the remaining 30 minutes or w/e.",

Also, this attack was in concomitance with another attack directly at Ubisoft. They breached Ubisoft’s database and stole 900GB of data regarding both old and future projects. I dug a bit and found [these images](https://postimg.cc/gallery/fYNDYKZ) from their telegram group which makes me assume the Ubisoft breach was made with phishing attempts, as they’re(presumably) mocking the employees who fell for it.",

Now the “code” looks like normal text, hides inside PDFs, knowledge bases, emails, Jira tickets, etc… and the model happily obeys it because that’s literally what it was trained to do.\n\nWhat I’m seeing is a few categories of defenses actually helping:\n\n• **isolation instead of trust** – treat the model like an untrusted intern. It suggests, but doesn’t execute. Anything that touches real systems goes through policy checks or a separate service.\n\n• **capability allow-listing** – instead of asking “what should the AI do?”, define *the only things it is ever allowed to do*, and force everything else to fail closed.\n\n• **context provenance** – signing or labeling internal docs so the system can distinguish authoritative content from user-supplied prompts. A lot of attacks succeed simply because the model can’t tell “who said this.”\n\n• **runtime monitoring + honeytokens** – planting fake “sensitive” data to see if the model ever tries to leak it. If it does, something upstream is compromised.\n\nInput filtering alone definitely isn’t enough. We need something closer to how we handle untrusted code execution — least-privilege, audit logs, and review loops.\n\nCurious what others are actually deploying in production.\n\n  \nHas anyone found an approach that *catches prompt injection early* instead of just hoping downstream controls stop it?",

The record created for Let's Encrypt is unknown to Github.\n\nEven if you are the owner of the domain now, it can change tomorrow (standard transfers are slow, but some platforms can transfer account-to-account within hours). I am not sure how the record is decided by Let's Encrypt, but most likely it stays the same even after the transfer (cache). If DNS validation was the only method then it will not work longer than 30 days. Http validation on the other end would stay.\n\nAt the end of the day, Github did nothing wrong.

Its nothing super crazy, just a ps1 script that i can hide inside rubber duckies or game exes. It downloads keys and other ps1 scripts from an AWS EC2 instance I have running and installs and configures permissions and firewall rules for SSH. After this it sends a reverse ssh connection to an open port to the same AWS EC2 instance. It also creates a service that sends me a text on telegram every 5 mins telling me the username of my target when the pc turns on. It has persistence using task scheduling and services. This way I can know when the target is online, what their username is, the keys and permissions are fixed by my script so i just need to connect using their username. It bypasses most AVs easily, although seems to have some trouble on systems with a VPN.  \n  \nFor the next part of my project, I created an Ubuntu server VM with a Wazuh server on it on my laptop. I also created windows 10 VM on my desktop and installed an agent on it. I didn't create any rules or anything, just default Wazuh. I then hid my malware RAT inside a fake exe that imitates an exe of a legit game and launched it on the agent VM. It gave some stuff like the sshd user creation a med severity, the game file crashing because of weird graphics settings in a VM also got a med severity, but that was about it, nothing related to the actual malicious file and nothing got a severity level higher than medium. It also gave the telegram service a low severity. The rest of the logs didn't look that out of place to me, probably a bunch of false positives. I'm going to now create rules to catch my own malware and learn about that. \n\n  \n",

This sounds like the sort of thing that any SOC would pick up on in minutes, and also sounds like the scripts need running with elevated privileges. Whilst it may avoid AV, behavioral monitoring would likely pick this up automatically too.\n\nIf you're looking to learn, which it sounds like you are, yeah - this is good. You've clearly got good scripting knowledge, have learnt about basic reverse engineering and payload delivery, and now you're learning about how to set up detections and maybe writing some playbooks too. \n\nIf I was interviewing you for a junior or graduate position and you told me about this project as a lab then I'd be interested in hearing more",

Without that, Wazuh just sees `powershell.exe` running but not *what* it is doing inside.\n\nIf you want to level it up:\n\n1. Enable Script Block Logging via Group Policy on the Windows VM.\n2. Install **Sysmon** on the Windows VM and point Wazuh to read the Sysmon logs. You will instantly see the network connections and process spawning much clearly.\n\nKeep going, this is great portfolio work.",

In general problem solving and adaptability to new kinds of systems. You need exposure to these things to learn how to adapt to new ones more efficiently. You need a lot of exposure to security on both sides of the spectrum into different technologies so that you know what you're running into when you actually encounter them in the field. I have years of working with lots of different kinds of technologies on a support and management side so I know somewhat where to start when encountering them even if I'm not super familiar with them. I've spent the last 2 years of this company doing stuff with Azure and InTune and stuff and I just recently did a security assessment for a customer and they wanted Google workspace and all I had done with Google workspace is a basic permissions task and with Azure infrastructure all lab work. Well, with my most recent security assessment, I had to set up an MDM in Google workspace and then federate it over to Microsoft and create a Microsoft tenant for them to use Microsoft 365 services and then also set up a federated domain for Apple so that they can have MDM services on their iPhones. Even if you're not greatly experienced in each of these fields, you need to know what you're engaging with and how to create recommendations and how to accurately secure these things. It's not just going in and breaking stuff. It's knowing how to find things, what you're looking for, and what to recommend the customer to do about what you found, and in some cases also being able to implement that for the customer if there's a follow-up project involving that. Cyber security is not an entry-level position. It's a mid-career shift. I'm just now getting into it and the only reason I was able to do it so soon is because I had multiple years in it throughout college Plus a few years after, And then I got lucky that one of our customers wanted an IT assessment and our GM thought I was the right guy to do it, and then I did well enough that the company wants to expand on that service offering now. I wasn't just aired on to a new company for cyber security outright. If you look at a cyber security entry level position, it has lots of requirements because cyber security entry level is entry to cyber security not entry into the workforce. Unless you get lucky and get into a great program of a company that is working to bring in people directly from college to become Junior pentesters or cyber security analysts or do you had a really good cyber security internship that you can turn into a full-time position with the same company, you're almost certainly not going to have a cyber security job out the gate",

The \"hack\" is that if I cannot find the job I want, I will create it.\n\nThe other \"hack\" is realizing that I would be paid maybe $1,500 at the high end for a week's worth of intense work for an employer,  who will charge the customer I'm doing the work for, $10,000 (probably on the low end).  I can safely charge the customer directly half as much, and they WILL hire me. \n\nThe IT companies (really all companies regardless of service or products they sell) are hacking ALL of us.  They charge too much, and pay too little,  as is the game to secure a profit margin.  Leaving lots of room for growth for entrepreneurs who aren't afraid to take some risk. \n\n\nOther reasons:\n\nMy personal credit is bad, and its easier to build new credit (with a business by opening a credit line against it) than to fix bad credit.  \n\nWant to know how black hat hackers set up shell companies, commit fraud, and fly under the radar? You should understand how to form a corporation, and the type of things you need to operate one, like general liability insurance,  and other licenses.  \n\nWant to avoid a uncomfortable discussion into your sparse work history  to a future prospective employer? You own/owned a company. \"No, i wasn't unemployed 6 months, I was operating my own small business.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nI don't see how any hacker could call themselves complete (I'm definitely not) without understanding business and possessing some basic business related skills...\n\nI was beyond \"stuck\". \n\nHomeless,  no transportation,  and a warrant (misdemeanor) that kept me from getting a job. \n\nNow I own a company,  and hire a person with a truck to do construction work (does it matter what type of work it is?) One of my last projects, I charged a client a hourly rate of $60 per hour per person.  I paid my employee (who handled transportation and delivery of materials) $50 per hour, and pocketed $10 of what I was charging for him, bringing my hourly rate to $70 per hour...\n\nDoes it matter when I get to the job site when I own a business? Hell no, the customer is just relieved I showed up. Try living like that working for an employer! Can't be done. \n\nYou aren't stuck forever.  You have to plot and scheme and BE a HACKER.",
