If the store changes the price locally (for example reduced prices for items with short expiry date) then the new article data is stored on the local servers. To be able to change the price displayed on the price tags you’d need access at least to the local servers (usually in the back office of the store) but the tills would display the correct price anyway. The store has no legal obligation to sell the item at a lower price which is displayed only on the price tag as long the back office server shows the correct price.",

In India for example, we have a defined Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for each product that is set the moment a product is launched into the market, by the seller itself. This MRP is printed into the labels and packaging as well. \n\nNowhere, in any transaction, is the price of that unit allowed to exceed the MRP, even if you are reselling it at a further degree officially. Sure, stores can run discounts, but it is directly illegal to exceed the printed MRP on a unit no matter what. If a company wants to raise its prices, it can only do so for further manufactured batches by printing revised MRPs. Product once out and about cannot be retconned either. \n\nIt's not even complicated to sue in case of violations, there are unique small-claims consumer courts that enforce this easily. \n\nI assumed that if we had that in India of all places, surely it was a commonplace practice?",

Prices are set from the back end, so price change attacks are a poor choice. What is very vulnerable in these systems  is how prices are sent to the tags. \n\nThese e-ink tags are low energy devices requiring frequent updates to adjust pricing dynamically through the day. Individual price setting needs to be done with a high power emitter/transmitter to keep receiver power down. With just how many items and the low timeframe these devices have to receive price data (in order to save power), data transmission security/encryption is a joke. Many of the systems rely on IR blasting to set prices on these tags. I would not be surprised if just the item’s barcode numbering was an active part of the data transfer process. \n\nIt would be very unfortunate if the prices were logged discreetly using a small receiver placed somewhere in the store behind a shelf where it could receive the IR pulses/low energy transmissions to the tags. It would be even more unfortunate if someone purchased or requested sample dynamic price tags or information from the supplier to easily crack the transmission’s very basic price “encryption”. It would be even more unfortunate if these price changes were sent to a public website for everyone to view item price history after only a few months of covert logging. Not saying someone should do this, but in my mind, this would be the ideal approach. \n\nExposure of the practice or revealing the key tactics (as they are almost guaranteed to be anti-consumer) would be much more financially damaging to the large companies trialing these systems.",

If you are interested, pygame uses a similar approach (with draw loops and event handling) and is much more user friendly. \n\nGive it a try if you want to continue learning. \n\nYou should be able to look around and find methods of porting and compiling your own game to the TI 84 but I've never gone down that road.",

When my teacher walked past me and saw that I was playing a game, he was both impressed and suspicious that I'd stored answers on it. I saved the game, went through all the files in the calculator just to show him that the only thing stored on it was games and an old principal interest calculator spreadsheet that I made that I forgot I even had on there, and when he was satisfied with it not having any extra material, he let me keep playing it for the rest of the duration I was required to stay, and let me leave.

Also, this attack was in concomitance with another attack directly at Ubisoft. They breached Ubisoft’s database and stole 900GB of data regarding both old and future projects. I dug a bit and found [these images](https://postimg.cc/gallery/fYNDYKZ) from their telegram group which makes me assume the Ubisoft breach was made with phishing attempts, as they’re(presumably) mocking the employees who fell for it.",

          "text": "Anti-detect browsers are mitigation, not invisibility. Anyone claiming they make you untrackable is either lying or doesn't understand how modern tracking works. The question isn't \"can I be tracked\" (you  absolutely can), but it's how much effort does tracking me require and is it worth it for whoever's trying.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that browsers leak information by design. Canvas fingerprinting, WebGL, audio context, font enumeration, timing attacks, TLS fingerprinting, screen resolution, timezone, language settings, installed plugins, hardware specs visible through WebGL, all of this combines into a fingerprint that's often unique enough to track you across sessions even without cookies. Anti-detect browsers try to randomize or normalize these signals, but they're fighting an uphill battle because new fingerprinting vectors get discovered constantly.\n\nThe runtime limitation is a real thing, I mean Chromium and Firefox have certain behaviors baked into how they handle rendering, JavaScript execution, network requests. You can spoof some of this but not all of it without breaking sites or introducing inconsistencies that are themselves fingerprintable. For example, you can lie about your user agent but if your CSS features don't match what that browser version should support, congrats, you just made yourself more unique. Same with canvas randomization, if you're randomizing canvas output but your other signals stay consistent, you're creating a detectable pattern.\n\nMost sophisticated tracking today uses behavioral and environmental correlation more than pure browser fingerprinting. How you move your mouse, typing patterns, the timing between actions, IP address, DNS leaks, timezone consistency with your claimed location, browser window size matching common screen resolutions, whether your fonts match your OS claim. Even if your browser fingerprint is perfect, if you're the only person accessing a site from that IP with that exact behavior pattern at that time of day, you're trackable. Anti-detect browsers can't fix this because it's outside the browser.\n\nThe tools that work best focus on consistency over randomness. If you randomize everything every session, you create a unique pattern of randomness that's fingerprintable. Better approach is to create a stable fake identity per use case and stick to it. Same fake canvas, same fake fonts, same timezone, same everything for that persona. This is what commercial anti-detect browsers like Multilogin or GoLogin try to do, they let you maintain multiple consistent profiles rather than random things every time.\n\nProfile isolation matters more than fingerprint spoofing in most cases. Running separate browser instances with different IP addresses via residential proxies, different cookies, different storage, different everything, that's harder to correlate than one browser trying to look like many. VMsare overkill for most use cases but they give you actual isolation at the OS level which is tough to beat.\n\nWhere these browsers provide value is against automated tracking and lazy fingerprinting. If you're trying to avoid getting banned managing multiple accounts on platforms with basic anti-fraud, they work well enough. If you're trying to evade state-level adversaries or sophisticated fraud detection systems, you're probably going to get caught eventually because they're looking at way more than just your browser.\n\nThe breaking point is when the cost of maintaining consistency across all vectors exceeds the value of the activity you're trying to hide. You can isolate browser fingerprints but then you need matching IP reputation, matching timezone and language settings, matching behavioral patterns, matching payment methods if you're doing anything financial, matching social graphs if it's social media. The attack surface is huge and one mistake correlates everything.\n\nTraditional isolation methods like VMs or separate physical machines are more robust if you're paranoid, but less convenient. Anti-detect browsers are a usability trade-off, good enough for most threat models, not good enough for high-stakes scenarios. They're tools, not dark magic. Use them knowing their limitations and design your threat model accordingly. If what you're doing would be seriously problematic if correlated, don't trust a browser to save you. Change your approach entirely.",

I'm a software engineer who ended up down the rabbit hole because tracking and fingerprinting kept intersecting with stuff I was building. Started with trying to understand why certain implementations were getting flagged, then got curious about detection methods, then started poking at browser internals to see what actually leaks versus what people think leaks. It's more of a technical interest that grew out of necessity than a formal discipline I studied.\n\nMost of what I know comes from reading papers on fingerprinting techniques, reverse-engineering how platforms detect automation, and breaking my own implementations enough times to understand where the weak points actually are. The gap between theoretical privacy and practical correlation became obvious pretty quickly once you start testing assumptions against real systems. You realize how much signal exists outside the browser that people ignore because they're focused on the wrong layer.",

But i do not understand why people consider this a vulnerability. I don't understand why this even needs to be considered private information. The company could publish this info on the website publicly and I'm not sure what the issue would be.\n\nThe other \"vulnerability\" being that the bot replies could reflect HTML back to the user. Again, I'm struggling to understand the issue. The article talks about session theft via XSS but this would mean that the site has bad cookie hygiene which is a separate vulnerability which exists whether the chat bot is there or not (the chat bot is just an avenue for reaching the pre existing vulnerability). \n\nHow can it be persistent XSS unless users can see other people's chat history, which makes no sense.\n\nThey also talk about html being an avenue to maybe redirect to phishing pages etc, but that would imply that the site has weak security allowing cross site POST requests, which is another pre-existing vulnerability.\n\nIf the user has to ask the chat bot \"please send me a link to a phishing page\" for the bad thing to happen i feel like that is a false positive finding.",

Now the “code” looks like normal text, hides inside PDFs, knowledge bases, emails, Jira tickets, etc… and the model happily obeys it because that’s literally what it was trained to do.\n\nWhat I’m seeing is a few categories of defenses actually helping:\n\n• **isolation instead of trust** – treat the model like an untrusted intern. It suggests, but doesn’t execute. Anything that touches real systems goes through policy checks or a separate service.\n\n• **capability allow-listing** – instead of asking “what should the AI do?”, define *the only things it is ever allowed to do*, and force everything else to fail closed.\n\n• **context provenance** – signing or labeling internal docs so the system can distinguish authoritative content from user-supplied prompts. A lot of attacks succeed simply because the model can’t tell “who said this.”\n\n• **runtime monitoring + honeytokens** – planting fake “sensitive” data to see if the model ever tries to leak it. If it does, something upstream is compromised.\n\nInput filtering alone definitely isn’t enough. We need something closer to how we handle untrusted code execution — least-privilege, audit logs, and review loops.\n\nCurious what others are actually deploying in production.\n\n  \nHas anyone found an approach that *catches prompt injection early* instead of just hoping downstream controls stop it?",

And every time it was the same: we were “flown in” and there were promises about finally giving us the budget to manage their entire server park instead of half assing it themselves, but then not doing it once the panick was over. But this time they hired another company to help them and they told our mutual customer to put the blame on us and make it into a court case.\nI was ‘interrogated’ by the owners a couple of times, looking up mails and other proof that we suggested changes etc until 4 am for multiple nights. But we won the court case in the end.\n\nFunny detail: they remained as a customer. They had 3 years remaining on their contract and apart from this they were very content of our services.\n\nThey did not approve the budget to make the required changes.\n\nWe made them sign a contract where we were explicitly excluded from their own ‘internal’ environment which we didn’t manage.\n\nThey were hacked again a year later..",

          "text": "Yeah, I've been following some of the major incidents from this year and honestly, the pressure those IR teams faced must have been absolutely crushing.\n\nThe Change Healthcare situation in February stands out to me. The attack took down the biggest medical insurance claims clearinghouse in the US, which meant thousands of pharmacies couldn't process electronic payments. Patients couldn't get their prescriptions filled without paying out of pocket. The whole thing lasted *weeks*. Can you imagine being on that response team, knowing that every hour of downtime meant someone somewhere might not get critical medication because they couldn't afford it?   \nThe attack eventually cost over $1 billion, but the weight of knowing real people's health was on the line had to be way heavier than any dollar amount.\n\nThen there's the CrowdStrike incident in July - that faulty update that blue-screened 8.5 million Windows machines worldwide. Airlines grounded, hospitals disrupted, financial systems down. The response teams had to figure out how to fix millions of devices that couldn't even boot normally. Each one needed manual intervention in safe mode.   \nI read that the impact assessment alone must have been overwhelming because you're getting reports from every sector simultaneously.\n\nOne thing I've learned from reading post-mortems is that the worst part isn't always the technical challenge—it's the decision-making under pressure when you don't have complete information. Like the recent CISA advisory about a GeoServer exploit where the vulnerability had been disclosed 11 days before attackers used it, but the agency's incident response plan didn't even have procedures for bringing in third-party help quickly. Those kinds of gaps only become obvious when you're in the middle of it.\n\nThe lesson that sticks with me is that technical skills get you in the door, but it's your ability to stay calm, communicate clearly, and make judgment calls with incomplete data that actually matters when everything's on fire.",
