It also makes it easier to make the cards without melting the plastic, by layering the different parts and leaving a hole for the chip to be covered by a softer layer once it’s all layed out. \n\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US9033250B2/en",

Newer card uses what we call coil on chip (CoC), where the antenna is roughly the size of the chip/module, and it can be more gently glued instead of being pressed, which often breaks the chip.\n\nWould you buy chance be willing to share who is the manufacturer of the card? Usually it's written in tiny prints at the top or the bottom of the card (could be Thales Group - my company, Idemia, Giesecke & Devriendt, etc).\n\nTrivia: The design of the module (the connector area) is protected and specific to each manufacturer. With a single picture of the module you can identify the card manufacturer. My company has two, the most recognizable is in a shape of a earth projection.",

      "text": "Been poking around OpenClaw since everyone started hyping it. 165k GitHub stars, 700+ community skills, full access to your filesystem, browser, shell, messaging apps. Cool project but the whole architecture screamed supply chain attack surface to me.\n\nSo I started actually reading through skill code before installing anything. Almost didn't bother for a simple Spotify playlist organizer because who weaponizes a music skill right?\n\nTurns out someone does. Was grepping through the skill instructions and noticed some suspicious regex patterns that had nothing to do with music. Buried in there was logic to search for files matching *tax*, *ssn*, *w2* patterns and extract 9 digit numbers. A music skill. Hunting for your social security number. I almost installed this thing without looking.\n\nAnother one marketed as a Discord backup tool had instructions to POST your entire message history to some sketchy endpoint using base64 encoded chunks. Classic exfil pattern, wasn't even trying to hide it. Just betting nobody actually reads skill code.\n\nI've gone through a bunch of popular skills now and the hit rate on sketchy ones is way higher than I expected. Security researchers have published findings saying around 15% of community skills contain malicious instructions and based on what I'm seeing that tracks.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the setup as a \"Faustian bargain\" which is refreshingly honest but also... concerning that they know and it's still this bad.\n\nWhat pisses me off is how fast malicious skills reappear after getting flagged. Same logic, new name, back on ClawHub within days. Tried automating the review process since manual grepping doesn't scale. Found some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that catches some of it but still missed the more obfuscated ones I found by hand. This problem probably needs better tooling than currently exists.\n\n18k+ OpenClaw instances currently exposed to the internet on default port. This ecosystem is going to produce some wild incident reports.\n\nProbably going to do a more detailed writeup on the specific techniques I'm seeing if there's interest. For now if you're running this thing: Docker container minimum, never expose 18789, start with read only access. Treat skill installation like running random binaries from strangers because that's basically what it is.",

          "text": "Nice work on this. The supply chain attack pattern you found is nearly identical to what we've been seeing in mobile app ecosystems for years — malicious packages masquerading as legitimate tools, harvesting credentials and API keys.\n\nThe crypto-themed lure is the giveaway. Same playbook works on npm, PyPI, and mobile app stores: create a package/app with a name similar to a popular tool, add some crypto-related keywords to attract high-value targets, then deploy an infostealer. The ClawHub ecosystem is just the latest platform to get hit with this pattern.\n\nA few things that stood out:\n\nThe fact that the malicious skills target macOS credentials and browser passwords specifically suggests these aren't amateur attacks. They're going after developer machines, which are high-value targets because they often have access to production infrastructure, code signing keys, and cloud credentials.\n\nThe behavior you described (dropping files to /tmp, establishing persistence, C2 callback) maps almost exactly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for initial access (T1195.002 - Supply Chain Compromise: Software Supply Chain) and collection (T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores).\n\nOne thing I'd add to the analysis — it's worth checking if any of these skills request network permissions or filesystem access beyond what's needed for their stated functionality. Permission over-requesting is one of the easiest automated signals to flag during marketplace review, but most platforms don't enforce principle of least privilege during the review process.",

The fundamental issue isn't just finding specific malicious skills, but that the architecture of most agent frameworks defaults to full user permissions. OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor — they all run with the same access as you.\n\nThis is exactly the problem we built [nono](https://www.alwaysfurther.ai/blog/why-i-built-nono?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=why-i-built-nono)  to solve. It's a kernel-enforced capability sandbox that makes unauthorised operations structurally impossible, even if an agent tries to exfiltrate files or delete system configurations. It uses Landlock on Linux and Seatbelt on macOS to enforce default-deny filesystem access, network controls, and credential protection.\n\nFor an OpenClaw setup, your entire agent workflow could be restricted with a single command like this:\n\n`nono run --allow ./my-project-dir --net-block openclaw`\n\nThat makes it impossible for the agent to access anything outside `./my-project-dir` or hit external networks, regardless of what a skill tries to do. Full disclosure, I work on nono, it's an open-source project, check it out if you're interested https://github.com/always-further/nono",

          "text": "I highly recommend checking out the Darknet Diaries podcast episode \"Cam the Carder\". I think it gives a really good idea of how a lot of cyber criminals actually behave, and how they typically get caught.\n\nI think the thing a lot of people tend to forget is that cyber criminals are...well, criminals. And as such a lot of them are just as dumb and lazy and addiction addled and so on as any other sort of criminal. The fact that they happen to use technology to do their crimes doesn't mean they're substantially different than people who use other tools to do their crimes.\n\nOr to be a bit more nuanced about it, a person can be very smart and clever in one way and very careless and short sighted in other ways, and a lot of people who turn to crime have this sort of personality. Poor impulse control, difficulty understanding long term consequences, issues with self discipline, addiction, and all these other classic criminal qualities occur just as often in cyber criminals as in any other group.\n\n\"Black Hat\" hackers aren't all Mr. Robot or whatever. The \"genius professional hacker\" is far more common in fiction than in reality, because in reality a lot of very effective hacking techniques are pretty easy to learn and use (especially if you don't care about hurting people and causing damage by accident, which a lot of cyber criminals don't).\n\nSo a lot of people who want money and don't want to work a job to get it will learn a few tricks on the internet and use them to beat up on weak targets to make a few bucks. They'll use low complexity, kind of boring techniques because they work, because a lot of then aren't motivated by curiosity or anything like that. Stealing things via computer is just another version of stealing hubcaps and windshield wiper blades and selling them to sketchy mechanic shops -- it's just a way to get a few bucks to blow on drugs or strippers or whatever.\n\nAnd a lot of people like this just get lazy. They set things up with default settings and don't bother to cover their tracks consistently. They visit the ATM right around the corner over and over again and keep running more and more cards, and eventually the 7-11 clerk or the guy who refills the ATM notice something weird and say something to someone who eventually gets it to law enforcement, and they check the camera and catch them.\n\nHell, a lot of them get caught for something completely unrelated and get connected to cyber crimes almost accidentally -- they get in a fight at a bar and get arrested for it, they get busted buying drugs, they get pulled over for driving drunk, etc. A lot of criminal hackers have other issues that have made it difficult for them to hold down a job, and some of those can lead to a lot of other, more typical criminal behavior that make them easy to catch. And once they're arrested, the cops search their house, which is often *full* of evidence against them (because a lot of criminal hackers just leave stuff lying around -- sim cards, blank credit cards and reader / writers, etc), and of course contains their computer, which will probably have all kinds of forensic evidence that is easy to get once the cops care to look.\n\nSo this is the fairly mundane way a lot of criminal hackers get caught.\n\nNow, the really big cyber crime gangs are a bit different. They are basically organized crime syndicates like the mafia, so they get investigated like that. A lot of the more sophisticated investigative techniques happen in these cases, but that only happens because these big gangs make enemies with similarly big corporations and governments, who are willing to spend the time and money painstakingly investigating and tracking them down and arranging the international efforts necessary to identify and nab them when they slip up and set foot in a country that extradicts.\n\nThere are of course people who exist between these two, who are more stable than the Cam the Carder types but less threatening than the big cyber gangs, and a lot of them probably get away with quite a lot without getting caught... but a lot of people like that can probably also hold down a job, and often do because for most people a legal job is going to be both safer and more profitable over time.\n\nCyber crime only makes reliable financial sense if you are short sighted and care more about having a fun weekend than saving up for a family and house, or if you are part of a big gang / state sponsored group that gives you enough protection you can feel reasonably secure.",

          "text": "OPSEC and usability are on opposite ends of a balance beam. You can have amazing OPSEC if you never use anything (look at the unabomber, if not for his brother recognizing his wording and turns of phrase, he likely would still be at it.) The more you interact with others, the more people there are to bear witness to and report things they find \"odd\". The more hoops you jump through to try to assure you anonymity online and in person, the more opportunities there are to set off some flag or to make a mistake.\n\nIt is why the current advice is to try to \"blend in\" and hide in plain sight as much as possible. The guy that is always on TOR for everything, only deals in cash or bitcoin, and walks around with clothing obviously designed to obscure their face might as well be walking around with a strobelight on their head. The guy who uses anonymity tools often but not religiously and interacts with society outwardly within the boundaries of \"normal\" flies under the radar.\n\nNowadays with the level of surveillance in place, from all sides (ISP, backbone, banking, LPRs, facial recognition cameras, tracking cookies, etc) the only \"sure\" way to hide is to be using a burner device in a non-extradition country that doesn't care about your actions (i.e. as long as you are messing with someone besides them). This is why places like India are rife with scam call centers, the local government doesn't particularly care if their people are fleecing people outside of their borders. Some get lucky and either blend in with the noise or find a complacent target that is not equipped with detection or logging tools, but I would not take that bet personally. \n\nWe are long past the dial up days when you could drop off and reconnect to hide your tracks from anyone short of a nation-state. Now they have massive collections of netflow data, even raw PCAP in some cases as well as high granularity timestamps that can be used to fairly accurately backtrace you even through TOR if sufficiently motivated and you connect more than once. The motivation has always been a thing, even back in the old days, the general advice was \"don't hack the pentagon\" or similar, because while \"company X\" may very much want to hold you accountable, they lack the time, tools, access, and money to do so, which is not the case with government agencies. Even nation state actors with professionally maintained proxy networks spread across the globe are still identified and their techniques fingerprinted, often with a similar method to what caught the unabomber, recognition of their tendencies, phrasing, etc. and AI is only going to accelerate that currently manual task.",

I realized they were talking about **Gallery Vault** (by ThinkYeah), so I decided to audit it (v4.4.33, released March 2025) to see if it was as bad as it seemed.\n\n**Spoiler:** It was.\n\nThe PIN you set is strictly a UI lock. It plays zero role in the actual file encryption. The app relies \\*entirely\\* on a hardcoded master key embedded in the APK. The implemented encryption is a static string (`good_gv`) that gets padded and run through DES-ECB with a static hex constant. This generates a global master key that is **identical for every user on every device**.\n\nThis master key is used to unwrap a unique per-file key stored in the file's tail metadata (sandwiched between `>>tyfs>>` and `<<tyfs<<` markers). Once that key is exposed, the actual file content is just a simple XOR cipher with a position-based salt.\n\nSimply put, if you have a clean dump of the Android data, **you can decrypt the files without ever knowing the user's password**.\n\nPractically speaking, the main legitimate use case here is forensic recovery from a lawful device dump. But the bigger takeaway is that 50M people think their files are protected when they really aren't.\n\nI wrote a Python tool that automates the entire pipeline. It goes through the provided android dump and, using the hardcoded values, decrypts the per-file key, and reverses the XOR transform. It also handles magic byte detection to restore the correct file extensions (jpg, mp4, etc), although only images are supposed to be stored in the vault.\n\nIt has a nice TUI too if you prefer it to just CLI :)\n\n\n\nLink: [gv\\_decryptor](https://github.com/caveeroo/gv_decryptor)\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: For educational and legitimate forensic purposes only. Don't go poking around files that aren't yours.*",

People protecting themselves from others who they know aren't competent? (hmm... That makes sense. It's clearly not appropriate to defend from a competent hacker or government, but its probably safe enought if you want some very simple protection when someone stole your phone. And it doesn't have full disk encryption. Or you might want to share your phone to someone else for a few minutes).",

          "text": "The core issue here is that GalleryVault uses DES in ECB mode for its 'encryption' — which is barely encryption at all. DES has a 56-bit key (trivially brutable), and ECB mode encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks, so the structure of your files leaks right through.\n\nA quick way to verify this yourself: take a .bmp image, 'encrypt' it with the app, then view the encrypted file as raw data. If you can still make out the shape of the image, ECB mode is in play. This is the classic ECB penguin problem.\n\nWhat's worse is this likely violates OWASP MASVS-CRYPTO requirements:\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-1: No reliance on symmetric crypto with hardcoded keys\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-2: Use proven cryptographic primitives (DES is deprecated since 2005)\n- MSTG-CRYPTO-4: No use of ECB mode for any encryption operation\n\nYou can decompile the APK yourself with jadx (open source) and search for 'DES' or 'Cipher.getInstance' calls to see exactly what they're doing. The cipher spec string will likely be just 'DES' (which defaults to DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding on Android).\n\nThe bigger systemic issue is Google Play's Data Safety section is entirely self-reported — there's no actual verification that apps implement encryption correctly (or at all). An app can claim 'data is encrypted in transit and at rest' while using DES-ECB with a hardcoded key. Until app stores start requiring actual cryptographic audits, users are left trusting marketing claims.",

          "text": "TLDR: We're securing it now and the quantum era where RSA is \"broken\" is a ways out still, especially for RSA 4096. Also AES can't be broken by quantum.\n\nSo stuff like RSA 2048 is at risk but the industry has long since recommended against its use in the early 2010s. It would take about 20 million qubits to crack a 2048 bit RSA key using Shor's if I remember correctly; gotta have a bunch of qubits for error correction. RSA 3072 and 4096 would require significantly more and are still considered quantum resistant because of it. Shor's also isn't a constant time algorithm so the more bits in the number you're trying to factor the more operations you have to perform, it's something on the order of O(n^3), so billions of ops for 2048 and tens of billions of ops for 4096. For a single quantum computer that means months to years for scale, you have to parallelize massively to get that down to days or weeks. Microsoft has a quantum computer that can \"in theory\" scale up to a million qubits but I don't think they've achieved that yet in practice.\n\nNow consider that every website in the world has a unique certificate. Even with quantum supremecy you're not going to crack them all in a reasonable amount of time. TLS certs also expire so for one website the key changes every year or two. In the case of people using letsencrypt they could be changing their cert on a monthly basis. For actors working on the \"save now decrypt later\" tactic, they could be saving stuff protected with RSA 2048 and that would potentially be decryptable years from now. That could include stuff like immutable PII like SSNs and the like...but...why do that when traditional hacks, phishing and data leaks don't require a quantum computer at all?\n\nI've been following post quantum since the mid 2010's. The NIST started a program to seek out quantum resistant algorithms a long time ago and the final set of post quantum algorithms have been finalized and are starting to be implemented; I work for a large bank and there's an internal team working that stuff right now.\n\nSymmetric key is also agnostic to all this. There is no quantum algorithm that can break AES, so zip/7z archives or other stuff encrypted with a symmetric key are safe. If an encryption algorithm doesn't have a \"trap door function\" then quantum isn't a threat to it.",

In order for Grover's to search the space, it needs to know what the decrypted solution might look like, inferring a need for at least a partial plaintext attack.\n\n> An essential component needed in Grover’s algorithm is a circuit which on input a candidate key |K> indicates if this key is equal to the secret target key or not. To do so, the idea is to simply encrypt some (fixed) plaintext under the candidate key and compare the result with the (assumed to be known) corresponding ciphertext under the secret target key. - [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04965)\n\nGrover's basically can take y = f(x) and find an x value given a y. For AES what this paper is doing is given a ct = AES(pt, key), the key can be derived given ct and pt. It solves for the key but given a known plaintext.\n\nYes that means the 'key' can be derived using quantum and that is an interesting finding. But to put that into practice to produce an algorithm that only takes in the ciphertext and somehow produces the key or the plaintext doesn't follow. It is possible under AES to have two different plaintext and key combinations produce the same ciphertext, so without a known plaintext, you can't just produce the key and without the key you can't produce the plaintext (which if you have the key, then you're already done). If it can be estimated what kind of file is being encrypted or what the first 128-256 bits of data is encrypted then this could be a possible solution in a partial plaintext attack. It is easy to counter this by simply adding a high-entropy one-time-pad of bits at the start of the plaintext that you then just discard during decryption. Quantum only provides a partial plaintext attack vector, it doesn't 'break' the algorithm as a whole.\n\nGrover's would have to be enhanced to detect a drop in entropy if a known plaintext is not available. Even if that enhancement does come about, a simple mitigation would just be to encrypt it once, to get a high entropy data stream, and then encrypt it again with two separate keys.",

Without salt, the password \"cracker\" will always have the same hash.  So, you simply take your hash you discovered and perform your comparison against all known hashes in your database.  SHA1 also has an issue with collisions, so even if you do not have the exact same password, the hash might still match.\n\nA randomly generated salt can be stored in plain text with the hash password.  So, imagine the salt is \"390s90d88FF\".  As the password is sent from the client, the salt is appended so it becomes \"390s90d88FFcracker\".  There is no way you are going to have that password in your prehashed database.
