In your case, you can produce two \"ground truths\" for comparison since you know the type face.  At a minimum, it seems like it could reduce some amount of ambiguity.",

Then downloads an executable and copies a shortcut to your startup folder. At the end, it sends you an error message.\n\nIf you saw \"Developer Mode is currently closed...\", the second script activated and downloaded the final executable payload. You will want to see if %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\Nfservice\\\\ is a folder that exists, or if your startup folder has any weird new .lnk files that point to 7z.exe or neservice.exe. Use chatgpt to help you with this.\n\nKeep in mind that, while this obfuscation is very weak, there is no guarantee the final payload is not more sophisticated and engaging in evasion. Bitdefender probably did work here, but that doesn't mean nothing malicious executed.\n\nEDIT: I pulled the final payload and this is a pretty nasty one. It's a RAT called NetSupport, it ultimately will callback to the attacker and give them complete access to your machine. So keep that in mind as you're evaluating what you want to do next. Again, I think Bitdefender probably did its job but you can judge your own risk profile. neservice.exe is evading Bitdefender on VirusTotal, so if it got to that stage you may be infected. I would emphasize that if the PowerShell execution got blocked, you got very lucky because the final payload \\*would\\* likely have gotten you and you'd be completely pwned.",

There's basically a law here according to which you cannot use any phone on cellular networks unless you pay the one time tax calculated according to the msrp of the phone. (the tax is often 70% of the msrp of the phone) \n\nThe solution? (illegally) change the phone's imei to one of a cheap 4g enabled phone so that you can use the expensive phone on cellular networks. This is very commonly used solution even if you're buying an S24 ultra or a pixel 9 pro. (this doesn't work on iPhones, obviously)",

          "text": "TLDR: We're securing it now and the quantum era where RSA is \"broken\" is a ways out still, especially for RSA 4096. Also AES can't be broken by quantum.\n\nSo stuff like RSA 2048 is at risk but the industry has long since recommended against its use in the early 2010s. It would take about 20 million qubits to crack a 2048 bit RSA key using Shor's if I remember correctly; gotta have a bunch of qubits for error correction. RSA 3072 and 4096 would require significantly more and are still considered quantum resistant because of it. Shor's also isn't a constant time algorithm so the more bits in the number you're trying to factor the more operations you have to perform, it's something on the order of O(n^3), so billions of ops for 2048 and tens of billions of ops for 4096. For a single quantum computer that means months to years for scale, you have to parallelize massively to get that down to days or weeks. Microsoft has a quantum computer that can \"in theory\" scale up to a million qubits but I don't think they've achieved that yet in practice.\n\nNow consider that every website in the world has a unique certificate. Even with quantum supremecy you're not going to crack them all in a reasonable amount of time. TLS certs also expire so for one website the key changes every year or two. In the case of people using letsencrypt they could be changing their cert on a monthly basis. For actors working on the \"save now decrypt later\" tactic, they could be saving stuff protected with RSA 2048 and that would potentially be decryptable years from now. That could include stuff like immutable PII like SSNs and the like...but...why do that when traditional hacks, phishing and data leaks don't require a quantum computer at all?\n\nI've been following post quantum since the mid 2010's. The NIST started a program to seek out quantum resistant algorithms a long time ago and the final set of post quantum algorithms have been finalized and are starting to be implemented; I work for a large bank and there's an internal team working that stuff right now.\n\nSymmetric key is also agnostic to all this. There is no quantum algorithm that can break AES, so zip/7z archives or other stuff encrypted with a symmetric key are safe. If an encryption algorithm doesn't have a \"trap door function\" then quantum isn't a threat to it.",

A lot of modern sites either break or don’t behave the way they should.\n\nI’m starting to think an antidetect browser with native proxy support is just a cleaner setup overall, since it handles traffic at the browser level instead of routing through a web page. I’ve seen 1Browser come up a few times, but it’s hard to tell what’s actually solid versus hype.\n\nFor folks here who’ve used antidetect browsers or proxy-based workflows, what’s been working well for you lately?",

Purely a program I built to find things I don't think I would have normally found myself.\n\nWhat it is:\n\n* A browser extension\n* You log in (or not), browse the app normally\n* Click “record”, perform your usual workflow, testing, etc., click “stop”\n* It captures the exact API calls you made\n\nThen the tool tries to break logic assumptions that emerged from your own flow.\n\nExample:\n\n* You apply a coupon\n* Cart total changes\n* Checkout succeeds\n\nThe tool then asks things like:\n\n1. Can the coupon be reused?\n2. Can another user apply it?\n3. Can it be applied to a different product?\n4. Can checkout / refund be abused to get money back?\n\nIt does this by replaying and mutating the same requests you already made, and it only reports an issue if it can prove its theories to be correct.\n\nIts also basically zero-friction, since it runs in your own browser, works based on your flow, and won't flood you with false positives.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Would you use something like this?\n2. Would you pay for it?",
