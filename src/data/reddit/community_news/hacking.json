When I finished my physics exam I went over it again just to be sure the answers I put were the answers I wanted to put (multiple choice), and spent the rest of the time playing the original Zelda. When my teacher walked past me and saw that I was playing a game, he was both impressed and suspicious that I'd stored answers on it. I saved the game, went through all the files in the calculator just to show him that the only thing stored on it was games and an old principal interest calculator spreadsheet that I made that I forgot I even had on there, and when he was satisfied with it not having any extra material, he let me keep playing it for the rest of the duration I was required to stay, and let me leave. I didn't score too well on that exam to be honest, but fuck it it was a good way to pass the remaining 30 minutes or w/e.",

Pictured above is the Flipper Blackhat + Screen (480x480) + Edgar Case 2.0! \n\nSo what can it do?\n\n- 5Ghz WiFi\n- Evil portal \"passthrough\", when your victom enters their credentials, it puts them through to the internet.\n- Evil Twin.\n- Datajacker: insert a USB drive, hit a button, steals everything off the drive.\n- Dataloader: load malware to a USB drive.\n- It runs Kali Linux, so anything Kali can do from the command line, no problem.\n- 480x480 screen, to launch applications, view input, play doom, etc...\n- 2x USB-A, connect Wifi dongles, SDR radios, keyboard/mouse, whatever. \n\nAnd here's the update!\n\n- [I will be talking at FOSDEM 2026 in Brussels!](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/WDCDC3-the_blackpants_are_pants_for_your_blackhat/)\n- Shipping to the US likely to resume soon, it looks like Swisspost has nearly everything figured out.\n- The \"Blackpants\" are a carrier for the Flipper Blackhat. First prototypes made. Available in my shop soon.\n\t- [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1p9pxmb/i_made_a_fully_open_source_handheld_hacking/)\n\t- [IG Post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DR6he99jXoL/?img_index=1) \n- [Case #1 - Back in Stock](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/products/flipper-blackhat-1)\n- [Case #2 - Back in Stock](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/products/flipper-blackhat-tron-case), this is what's pictured.\n- [We're in stock!](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/)\n\nFirmware situation: I maintained two versions of the firmware: the \"Buildroot\" version and the \"Armbian/Kali\" version. The buildroot version was used for the Flipper Blackhat + Flipper Zero combo, while the Armbian version is used for the Flipper Blackhat + Blackpants combo.\n\n[V0.3 Armbian](https://github.com/o7-machinehum/flipper-blackhat-os/releases) This new release can be used for BOTH setups! So if you're a Flipper Blackhat user, check out the new OS - is has quite a few more features!\n\nWhat's next?\n\n- Blackpants in stock soon!\n- Hardening Armbian Firmware Release\n- C2/RAT infrastructure. This is for deploying malware on vulnerable devices on open networks.\n- ARP poisoning for more advanced MITM attacks.\n- MACjacking + captive portal bypass. Connect to public APs w/o manually accepting TOS.\n- Webserver for interacting with the Blackhat\n\nSocials to keep updated (It helps me a lot if you follow along)\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/EtZT7mjNuM)\n- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@rootkitlabs)\n- [IG](https://instagram.com/rootkitlabs)",

          "text": "No, the phone doesn't ping towers when properly powered off through the OS. The radio is actually off. If it was still pinging, the battery would drain noticeably over days/weeks which doesn't happen with a phone that's actually off.\n\nBut you're probably remembering that some phones (particularly iPhones with iOS 15+) have \"Find My\" functionality that works even when \"powered off\". The phone enters an ultra-low-power Bluetooth beacon mode that lets nearby Apple devices detect it, similar to AirTags. This doesn't ping cell towers but it does mean the phone isn't completely dead. Android has been implementing similar features.\n\nAirplane mode isn't enough, the phone can still be forced to connect by baseband exploits or can be compelled to exit airplane mode remotely in theory. If you're worried about location tracking, airplane mode doesn't guarantee safety.\n\nPowering off helps, but is not bulletproof, sophisticated adversaries (state-level) can potentially compromise the baseband processor or install firmware that makes \"off\" not actually off. This requires targeted attacks though, not mass surveillance, so if you are not a politician or a famous person who is bothering someone, then this is most likely not your case.\n\nThe real threat isn't passive pinging when off, it's actually metadata from when the phone WAS on. Cell tower records, GPS history, app location data, all that gets logged when your phone is on normally. If you bring your phone to a protest and then power it off when you arrive, they already know you're there from the records before you shut down.\n\nLeave the phone at home or somewhere else you'd plausibly be. Seriously, that's the only reliable method. If you must bring it, put it in a Faraday bag (you can test these, to do that put phone in bag, call it, if it rings the bag doesn't work). Removing the battery used to be the gold standard but most modern phones don't have removable batteries lol.\n\nBurner phones help for preventing identity linkage but you need to be careful, so basically buy with cash, never connect it to your home WiFi, don't use it anywhere you've used your regular phone, don't bring both phones to the same place. Most people fuck this up. And yes Intelligence agencies and organizations can link phones to each other and understand that you are the same user if you used them in the same place as a regular phone.,\n\nThe threat model matters though. Mass surveillance at protests typically works through everyone's regular phones being on and in their pockets creating a pattern of who was where, facial recognition if you're on camera, and social network analysis of who was there together based on who's phones were near each other. Powering off when you arrive doesn't defeat any of that because the important data was collected before you turned it off.\n\nIf you're worried about being tracked at demonstrations, the phone being \"off\" is not your main problem. The problem is bringing any phone at all.",

When em hits an object it reflects just like the light we can see. The neat trick is we can send a em beam to a device and even with it off detect its reflection. With enough data that reflection becomes unique. So a beam that can pass through walls hits your phone. The phone scatters that beam in a predictable way. An observer listening to the em spectrum of the beam picks up the reflection from your phone. That reflection is given to a database and who's phone becomes apparent.  You can imagine from there how that information can be used.",

Also, this attack was in concomitance with another attack directly at Ubisoft. They breached Ubisoft’s database and stole 900GB of data regarding both old and future projects. I dug a bit and found [these images](https://postimg.cc/gallery/fYNDYKZ) from their telegram group which makes me assume the Ubisoft breach was made with phishing attempts, as they’re(presumably) mocking the employees who fell for it.",

Download the v82 .tgz for flashing via qFlipper. Then flash the v82. After that, you have to put the files from the leak (folders 2-4) in the right places. Put the key.fz file directly on the card (no folder, directly on the SD), than put keeloq_mfcodes and setting_user in the SubGHZ folder. Then flash the firmware from folder 4 using qFlipper. That's it. You can test if everything has worked by checking if you can see 65 frequencies in the SubGHZ-app on your Flipper.",

Fortunately, some states are introducing legislation to require this (it is unfortunate that said legislation is necessary, since I would have hoped the courts would rule that way, but they haven't). \n\nIn any event, even though the Flock cameras in question have been patched, there are of course plenty of other cameras  (not Flock-related, just normal consumer market devices) you can find on Shodan that are unprotected.",

Worst case scenario:: someone could clone the WiFi system and see every interaction between every device using that wifi.\nI'd like to know a bit more about wifi myself: It carries data? or allows us to send and receive data? How? is it a frequency? Is it like electricity? Why is it that \"fibre\" is better than copper, but you can still beam it down from a satellite in vast quantities? What is being beamed down exactly? If it's a connection to the Internet how is it throttled and why do we have to pay so much for it? If it's like a road there must be a way to sneak onto it? Obviously I'm stupid cause everyone else says they know what it is... they just can't explain it. Betcha no one answers this.",

Now to go through your questions, wether you are connected for a second or two hours doesn't really matter, computers are fast. (Though the probability that you are doing something wrong increases over time of course.) \n\nTo look at your concrete questions: If you log into your bank, then the attacker should only see a bunch of encrypted traffic, which only tells the attacker that you are talking to your bank but not what you are doing.^1 With tor, tor does what a vpn does and should disguise which website you are talking to in addition to what the banking app does.^1 \n\nNotepad, depends, if your notepad is purely local, then it shouldn't matter what anybody does on the network connection. If your notepad saves unencrypted to the cloud, then the attacker just straight up sees your notes. If your notepad displays ads, then the attacker will see the communication between your phone and the ad network, which may be encrypted but more likely is just a lot of behavioral data an attack would need to sit down and work to understand the format.^1\n\nAnd of course, deep packet inspection is done at your ISP, several of the networks between you and the webserver and of course the webserver you connect to sees all the data you send there. That's why you should always check if you are using https when browsing the web and especially when you send any sensitive data. \n\n^1 As long as we are assuming the attacker is just on a fishing trip, if a competent attacker tries to attack you personally they could start working with the information.",

If someone figured out your WiFi password, it raises the question - what other passwords do you have that are accessible, easily crackable, or similar? Many people reuse password patterns, so cracking one often gives clues to the others.\nOnce someone’s on your home network, they can access shared drives and folders, scan for devices with web interfaces like routers, cameras, and NAS and try to access them, monitor local traffic between your devices, and mess with those cameras OP mentioned if they have weak credentials.\nBeyond that, if they connect to your network and use it for illegal acts (child pornography, fraud, torrenting, other illicit activity) you may be held liable if it’s determined that you didn’t do your due diligence to prevent the unauthorized access.\nThis isn’t VPN fearmongering.

          "text": "Two things worth unpacking here. I'll start with the easier one. \n\nPublic wifis are not that dangerous to use, unless you happen to frequent sites that are not using HTTPS and that you input sensitive data into. The traffic is encrypted and a lot of people are still living in 2010 and reciting outdated information when preaching about the dangers. I think the best attack you can still do is related to captive portals, which are the webpages that ask you to login before you can use wifi. So you could just phish creds through that by making someone connect to your network, but it requires user interaction. Of course if you're worried about 0-days being popped on you by a nationstate actor, I wouldn't connect your computer to unknown networks, but that threat model is not realistic for most.\n\nSecond, if an attacker gained access to your personal network, then what they can do depends on what devices are in the network and how they're secured and configured. If you have a bunch of webcams and they're using known default credentials, then I would expect an attacker to be able to control them easily. Some IoT devices will simply be trash and easily compromised, and on the other hand some can be secure. However, any attacker in this position would've just massively increased the potential attack surface available to them, making further compromise more likely. But nothing happens automatically, if only your computer was plugged into the wifi then the above about public wifis applies unless you've been deliberately opening up ports with vulnerable services running on them.",

          "text": "Wifi Pentester here. The short answer is, it depends on several factors including what type of network it is and what security settings are enabled. \n\nThe long answer: Also it depends, but with more words. Behold! A novel! In two parts bc character limits. \n\n**Encryption**\n\nFirst, though, an understanding of encryption should be established. The two main types of networks you'll see available for guests are Open and PSK WPA2 networks (not going to get into WPA3 networks as they are not widely utilized enough yet and its a whole can of worms).\n\n*Open Networks*\n\nAn open network has no encryption on the traffic. Anybody can connect to the network, and the traffic that is passed through is clear text even to attackers that are not connected to the network. More on what they might be able to see later. \n\nMany orgs use what is called a Captive Portal, which is usually a splash page that your browser redirects to once you're connected to the network that forces you have to enter in some sort of credentials to access the internet. Behind the scenes the network is automatically registering the device's MAC address, which is how it \"knows\" what devices have and haven't entered credentials into the captive portal (note: there are other ways to secure a captive portal but they are almost never used). \n\nIt is trivial for an attacker (even one not connected to the network) to sniff a connected device's MAC address and change their own MAC address to match it, which would then allow them to connect to the network and access the internet with no indication to the network that it is not the legitimately connected device (with some exceptions that are, again, almost never used). \n\nThe thing is, a captive portal only prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the internet. An attacker can still connect to the network, sniff traffic, and run whatever scans they want without even bothering with the captive portal at all. Most companies run what are called IDS or IPS sytems that can detect potentially malicious scanning, but not all of them will automatically kick devices that are scanning maliciously and even if they do most of the time an attacker can simply change their MAC address and reconnect. \n\n*PSK Networks*\n\nA PSK network uses a shared password to connect. Unfortunately it is pretty easy for an attacker with no access to the network to sniff the necessary components when a device connects to the network and crack the password. How long it takes to crack depends on how complex the password is. Hackers keep common word lists that are extremely extensive, and modern cracking tools can automatically try every variation of l33t speak and/or adding numbers and characters that might be used. Good hackers can also use tools that will scrape words and phrases from a company's website and add that into the word list. \n\nPSK networks are encrypted, which means that network traffic is not sent and received over plain text like with Open networks. However, PSK networks don't offer \"forward secrecy\", which means that an attacker who does have the password can decrypt any data passed through the network. \n\n(1/2)",

Not that this is bad information, it’s just dated and I don’t think it’s a great step towards learning hacking.  \n\nI think the building blocks for learning hacking do involve learning technology.  But, I recommend learning a technology that you’ll use on a regular basis.  If you don’t use something regularly it’s a challenge to maintain and grow your knowledge.  Learning Cisco technology is great, but unless you work with it in a good-sized network it’ll be challenging. \n\nIf you choose this route you should look for “entry level”and/or “associate” level books and certs.  https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/training-events/certifications/career-path.pdf\n\nI hope makes sense and is helpful.

Now the “code” looks like normal text, hides inside PDFs, knowledge bases, emails, Jira tickets, etc… and the model happily obeys it because that’s literally what it was trained to do.\n\nWhat I’m seeing is a few categories of defenses actually helping:\n\n• **isolation instead of trust** – treat the model like an untrusted intern. It suggests, but doesn’t execute. Anything that touches real systems goes through policy checks or a separate service.\n\n• **capability allow-listing** – instead of asking “what should the AI do?”, define *the only things it is ever allowed to do*, and force everything else to fail closed.\n\n• **context provenance** – signing or labeling internal docs so the system can distinguish authoritative content from user-supplied prompts. A lot of attacks succeed simply because the model can’t tell “who said this.”\n\n• **runtime monitoring + honeytokens** – planting fake “sensitive” data to see if the model ever tries to leak it. If it does, something upstream is compromised.\n\nInput filtering alone definitely isn’t enough. We need something closer to how we handle untrusted code execution — least-privilege, audit logs, and review loops.\n\nCurious what others are actually deploying in production.\n\n  \nHas anyone found an approach that *catches prompt injection early* instead of just hoping downstream controls stop it?",

The record created for Let's Encrypt is unknown to Github.\n\nEven if you are the owner of the domain now, it can change tomorrow (standard transfers are slow, but some platforms can transfer account-to-account within hours). I am not sure how the record is decided by Let's Encrypt, but most likely it stays the same even after the transfer (cache). If DNS validation was the only method then it will not work longer than 30 days. Http validation on the other end would stay.\n\nAt the end of the day, Github did nothing wrong.

Whether you're defending these systems or want to understand the real threats, this is the kind of technical breakdown that changes how you think about physical security.\n\n\n\nCheck it out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psit0UBhV28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psit0UBhV28)\n\n\n\nSubscribe to my channel when you at it,    [https://www.youtube.com/@iceman1001/](https://www.youtube.com/@iceman1001/)",

If these are internet-accessible endpoints you're targeting, use something like Shodan (https://www.shodan.io/) or Censys (https://search.censys.io/) first. That data has already been pulled via scans, so at least you're not interacting with the target in realtime.\n\nWhen you ask about minimizing \"traces\" I would think about hiding your source IP as well. If you're going to interact directly with the targets, using something like a virtual private server or proxying through other endpoints (however you get access to them) would also be a good idea. That's how the biggest nation-state hacking groups get it done and it makes attribution a real pain, though with enough resources and effort like the FIVE EYES intel agencies they'll find out who you are.",

Rather than relying on generic scans, crafting specific, protocol-aware requests often leads to more accurate discovery of hosts and services. For example, SMB or CIFS probes can help identify Windows systems, while DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, or SNMP interactions can reveal hostnames, web services, applications, or network devices.\n\nWhen discretion is required, stealth-oriented approaches are preferred. These include passive discovery by observing existing traffic, slowing down request rates to blend in with normal activity, and using minimal, legitimate-looking protocol requests. Focusing only on likely services instead of performing broad scans further reduces noise and the chance of detection.\n\nOverall, combining targeted discovery with stealth techniques allows meaningful information gathering while keeping network visibility and detection risks low.",

It seems like it really depends on your situation.\n\nI think the hypothetical way to draw the least attention would be a very slow Zombie scan. But for that, you'd need a Zombie. Which, in it of itself requires a lot of information. So if you're doing a preliminary scan it's not plausible unless you got inside information.\n\nI'm assuming you're doing a preliminary scan for a pentest or bug bounty. In that case:\n\nI think the absolute lowest trace would be: stealth scan, lower speed, possibly fragmenting packets (to evade firewalls/ids flags against some targets), and don't ping (assuming you know host is up).\nThis would slow down your scan a lot, omit the ping logs, and fragment your scans so they're harder to detect. A scan like this would take forever, so probably start it before making coffee and breakfast, and get ready to watch some entertainment when you sit back down while you wait lol.",

At least i think so, idk if it is like this in reality.  \n  \nThere is another issue that there probably is existing signal on wire, so without having it at hand so that we could inject precisely opposite phase to cancel it out, all you would do is to create mess. I don't think you can simply overpower threshold function.\n\nbut it's interesting idea, perhaps not exactly inject, but one could probably use pulse as noninvasive glitching function. i think i had bunch of capacitors from old spot welder somewhere.... :D",

Its nothing super crazy, just a ps1 script that i can hide inside rubber duckies or game exes. It downloads keys and other ps1 scripts from an AWS EC2 instance I have running and installs and configures permissions and firewall rules for SSH. After this it sends a reverse ssh connection to an open port to the same AWS EC2 instance. It also creates a service that sends me a text on telegram every 5 mins telling me the username of my target when the pc turns on. It has persistence using task scheduling and services. This way I can know when the target is online, what their username is, the keys and permissions are fixed by my script so i just need to connect using their username. It bypasses most AVs easily, although seems to have some trouble on systems with a VPN.  \n  \nFor the next part of my project, I created an Ubuntu server VM with a Wazuh server on it on my laptop. I also created windows 10 VM on my desktop and installed an agent on it. I didn't create any rules or anything, just default Wazuh. I then hid my malware RAT inside a fake exe that imitates an exe of a legit game and launched it on the agent VM. It gave some stuff like the sshd user creation a med severity, the game file crashing because of weird graphics settings in a VM also got a med severity, but that was about it, nothing related to the actual malicious file and nothing got a severity level higher than medium. It also gave the telegram service a low severity. The rest of the logs didn't look that out of place to me, probably a bunch of false positives. I'm going to now create rules to catch my own malware and learn about that. \n\n  \n",

This sounds like the sort of thing that any SOC would pick up on in minutes, and also sounds like the scripts need running with elevated privileges. Whilst it may avoid AV, behavioral monitoring would likely pick this up automatically too.\n\nIf you're looking to learn, which it sounds like you are, yeah - this is good. You've clearly got good scripting knowledge, have learnt about basic reverse engineering and payload delivery, and now you're learning about how to set up detections and maybe writing some playbooks too. \n\nIf I was interviewing you for a junior or graduate position and you told me about this project as a lab then I'd be interested in hearing more",

Building the malware yourself to test Wazuh is exactly what Purple Teaming is from my own point of view, and it teaches you way more than just running tools in a lab.\n\nRegarding Wazuh missing the RAT: Default Wazuh rules often miss raw PowerShell scripts unless you have PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) enabled on the Windows victim. Without that, Wazuh just sees `powershell.exe` running but not *what* it is doing inside.\n\nIf you want to level it up:\n\n1. Enable Script Block Logging via Group Policy on the Windows VM.\n2. Install **Sysmon** on the Windows VM and point Wazuh to read the Sysmon logs. You will instantly see the network connections and process spawning much clearly.\n\nKeep going, this is great portfolio work.",

In general problem solving and adaptability to new kinds of systems. You need exposure to these things to learn how to adapt to new ones more efficiently. You need a lot of exposure to security on both sides of the spectrum into different technologies so that you know what you're running into when you actually encounter them in the field. I have years of working with lots of different kinds of technologies on a support and management side so I know somewhat where to start when encountering them even if I'm not super familiar with them. I've spent the last 2 years of this company doing stuff with Azure and InTune and stuff and I just recently did a security assessment for a customer and they wanted Google workspace and all I had done with Google workspace is a basic permissions task and with Azure infrastructure all lab work. Well, with my most recent security assessment, I had to set up an MDM in Google workspace and then federate it over to Microsoft and create a Microsoft tenant for them to use Microsoft 365 services and then also set up a federated domain for Apple so that they can have MDM services on their iPhones. Even if you're not greatly experienced in each of these fields, you need to know what you're engaging with and how to create recommendations and how to accurately secure these things. It's not just going in and breaking stuff. It's knowing how to find things, what you're looking for, and what to recommend the customer to do about what you found, and in some cases also being able to implement that for the customer if there's a follow-up project involving that. Cyber security is not an entry-level position. It's a mid-career shift. I'm just now getting into it and the only reason I was able to do it so soon is because I had multiple years in it throughout college Plus a few years after, And then I got lucky that one of our customers wanted an IT assessment and our GM thought I was the right guy to do it, and then I did well enough that the company wants to expand on that service offering now. I wasn't just aired on to a new company for cyber security outright. If you look at a cyber security entry level position, it has lots of requirements because cyber security entry level is entry to cyber security not entry into the workforce. Unless you get lucky and get into a great program of a company that is working to bring in people directly from college to become Junior pentesters or cyber security analysts or do you had a really good cyber security internship that you can turn into a full-time position with the same company, you're almost certainly not going to have a cyber security job out the gate",

The \"hack\" is that if I cannot find the job I want, I will create it.\n\nThe other \"hack\" is realizing that I would be paid maybe $1,500 at the high end for a week's worth of intense work for an employer,  who will charge the customer I'm doing the work for, $10,000 (probably on the low end).  I can safely charge the customer directly half as much, and they WILL hire me. \n\nThe IT companies (really all companies regardless of service or products they sell) are hacking ALL of us.  They charge too much, and pay too little,  as is the game to secure a profit margin.  Leaving lots of room for growth for entrepreneurs who aren't afraid to take some risk. \n\n\nOther reasons:\n\nMy personal credit is bad, and its easier to build new credit (with a business by opening a credit line against it) than to fix bad credit.  \n\nWant to know how black hat hackers set up shell companies, commit fraud, and fly under the radar? You should understand how to form a corporation, and the type of things you need to operate one, like general liability insurance,  and other licenses.  \n\nWant to avoid a uncomfortable discussion into your sparse work history  to a future prospective employer? You own/owned a company. \"No, i wasn't unemployed 6 months, I was operating my own small business.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nI don't see how any hacker could call themselves complete (I'm definitely not) without understanding business and possessing some basic business related skills...\n\nI was beyond \"stuck\". \n\nHomeless,  no transportation,  and a warrant (misdemeanor) that kept me from getting a job. \n\nNow I own a company,  and hire a person with a truck to do construction work (does it matter what type of work it is?) One of my last projects, I charged a client a hourly rate of $60 per hour per person.  I paid my employee (who handled transportation and delivery of materials) $50 per hour, and pocketed $10 of what I was charging for him, bringing my hourly rate to $70 per hour...\n\nDoes it matter when I get to the job site when I own a business? Hell no, the customer is just relieved I showed up. Try living like that working for an employer! Can't be done. \n\nYou aren't stuck forever.  You have to plot and scheme and BE a HACKER.",

Any member can set it to 1 at any time meaning their transaction will always get approved. Vice versa any member can set it to the maximum amount potentially slowing the process. A variable like that shouldn't be able to be altered so easily and is definitely a vulnerability. It should only be getting recalculated when necessary. IE: When a certain amount of members log in, or leave. With no say from the members themselves.\n\nnoDuplicate, is very unoptimized and a potential vulnerability, it should be instead looking for something like a UUID, something to quickly compare against and see if it's the same member, rather than checking through the entire object which could infact lead to duplicate member objects if one variable is slightly different. Fortunately it isn't getting called anywhere here. The same applies to onlyMember here, but to a less serious but potentially problematic degree for users implying msg.sender is trusted by this point. The same solution as noDuplicate is required here. (Then again when I think about it if it was trusted by this point it shouldn't need to be verified again anyways. Thinking about it this whole thing might be a big vulnerability.)",

Immediate action: add a reentrancy guard + move execution to a separate external function and/or use checks-effects-interactions with strict state gating.\n\n\nWhy it’s vulnerable\nThe wallet performs a low-level call to t.recipient with value.\n\n\nThat call can invoke code in the recipient (fallback/receive), which can re-enter the wallet during the same transaction.\n\n\nBecause executeTx() is internal and state changes are minimal and localized, the key issue is the coupling of approval + execution in the same external call path plus the fact that the wallet exposes other state-changing functions callable by members during re-entry.\n\n\nIn typical multisig designs, execution is separated and guarded; here, the design makes it easier to create execution-time control flow surprises and drain patterns when a member is also a contract (or controls a contract) that becomes recipient.",

They say theirs have AT&T 5G connectivity to send you information about interaction with your advertising.\n\nThere's only 220 megs of available space showing when I plug it into USB C on my PC. I haven't opened it up to see if it has an SD card or if it's all soldered.\n\nIf the sample has the 5G radio, there's more fun hacking potential, especially if it has a SIM card and an SD card that can be upgraded.\n\nLink to information on the video it came with and two other videos I got to play on it. The MP4 it came with is 1280x720, the others are lower resolution which it stretched to fill the display, or did it shrink the large one some... Further testing is needed to figure out the audio and video formats supported.\n\n[https://pastebin.com/WrDNKKV6](https://pastebin.com/WrDNKKV6)\n\nThe website isn't specific on any technical information on the videos and images except for 1920x1080 resolution, MP4, JPG, and AAC. Nor do they give display specifications other than \"high definition\".\n\nI've not decided on if I want to rip it open or just glue on a nice wrap and make a different video for a gift or something.",
