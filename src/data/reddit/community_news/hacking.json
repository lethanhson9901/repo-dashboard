We did not receive any customer inquiries regarding the interruption.\" An AWS spokesperson added: \"It was a coincidence that AI tools were involved.\"\n\nSeems like the AI had it's own role, was in supervised mode (not autopilot, which is the other mode for Kiro). Supervised mode asks someone to verify actions, in piecemeal, or 'do everything'. Maybe the reason they are blaming the dev was because the Dev allowed 'do everything', not realizing that \"I'm gonna burn yo' shit down and rebuild it\" was on line 35 of the changes it would do?\n\nFrom: [https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/](https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/)\n\n\"Supervised mode\n\nIn supervised mode, Kiro works interactively with the user, requiring their approval and guidance at each step:\n\n* Kiro suggests actions such as file creation, modification and deletion, but waits for user confirmation before proceeding\n* Kiro asks clarifying questions when needed\n* You can review and approve each generated document or code change, thus maintaining full control over the development process\n\nWhen operating in either of these modes, you can view individual or all file changes made by the agent by selecting **View all changes** in the **Chat** module. Additionally, you can also select **Revert all changes** or revert to a [checkpoint](https://kiro.dev/docs/chat/checkpoints) to restore your files to their previous state in the filesystem locally.\"\n\nIf the human blindly trusts the AI and 'allow all', is it not on the human?

              "text": "This, but with some practical complications and limitations.\n\nFirst, the \"good-faith security research\" from the CFAA only applies when considering criminal liability, **but not civil liability.** This means that you, the security researcher, don't necessarily have carte blanche to go hack whatever you want to without incurring civil liability for your actions - if you cause damages to a private company or violate existing legal terms you agreed upon, they can hold you accountable.\n\nIn addition to the quantifiable damages we might be familiar with as hackers (e.g., creating DoS conditions, stealing intellectual property/data/money, other criminal and malicious activities), compensation for intangible damages can also be pursued - you publicly lied about finding a vulnerability (defamation), you publicize an article about a vulnerability without carefully verifying your claims (negligent misrepresentation).\n\nSpeaking practically and from experience, whether or not a company will pursue civil legal action against you comes down to: do they know, and do they care? And both of these depend on what you're actually doing. \n\nIf you're pulling apart binaries to hunt for vulnerabilities on your private computer, no one's going to know until you decide to do something with what you find, and how you go about that process determines what criminal and/or civil liability you open yourself up to. You avoid this by being smart and responsible, lawyering up, and only making calculated moves.\n\nIf you're actively touching remote systems you don't own (e.g., live testing a company's web application whom you do not work for, querying a database that's not yours, or connecting to a private network with a banner stating as much) **- I cannot emphasize this enough - it DOES NOT MATTER if they have a bug bounty program - THIS IS NOT IMMUNITY - YOU CAN INCUR CIVIL LIABILITY.** Bug bounty programs are not a legally binding contract with you. The company can still pursue legal action against you, even if you follow all of the rules and stay in scope, simply because they don't like you. It's happened to people. It can happen to you. There's literally nothing but reputation standing in the way. \n\nThe only way to minimize personal liability is to work under a company (like an LLC), lawyer up, and have said lawyer draft a contract in line with a clear statement of work from your customer. If you don't have a signed contract between both parties, you're acquiring legal liability as your profession.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, companies sue anyone and everyone all of the time, for any reason, even when they know they can't win. Be a professional - always wear (legal) protection.\n\nSource: I've been personally sued for contributing to a bug bounty program, my various employers have been sued on my behalf, I've been sued for responsibly and privately disclosing vulnerabilities, I've had friends in this industry argue with me that bug bounty programs are safe and protected who were then sued by the company after submitting their findings (lol), my lawyers have successfully defended me from liability against a very large and wealthy network infrastructure company that didn't like my 0-day (they're still mad), I've had clients with contracts try to sue me because they didn't like how right I was after they paid me to be right, and I did it all without developing a criminal record (so far).",

Additionally, those guidelines could not be used as a defense. \n\nThat being said, there are requirements laid out and steps that must be taken prior to charging a defendant that would make it very difficult for a prosecutors to defy the guidelines. \n\nFrom [Arnold & Palmer](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/enforcement-edge/2022/05/cybersecurity-research-with-violating-cfaa):\n> As a procedural matter, all federal prosecutors who seek to charge cases under the CFAA are required to consult with DOJ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) before bringing charges. If the prosecutor intends to charge a case contrary to CCIPS’s written recommendation, she must inform the Deputy Attorney General’s office before charging and, in some cases, seek approval.\n\nThere is language included that touches on monetary gain and extortion. This is why you’ll see people strongly urge others not to “cold-call” organizations asking for a reward that don’t have a bounty program after finding a vulnerability \n\nDOJ memos & guidelines with respect to how much weight they carry is whole other can of worms. There’s been a handful of pretty significant policy changes over the past few administrations. It’s made it pretty difficult for Federal prosecutors.",

Both have the public reach and means to fight off lawsuits from companies or governments. The key is to distribute it quickly and widely and being able to deal with the fallout.\n\nThere's little you can to protect yourself against companies or governments if they decide to become petty about the whole thing and just want to punish you, even if the information is already out. See also some of the more famous whistleblowers that leaked US internal or secret information such as Maning and Assange.\n\nAs for any means of distributing the info yourself, I'm fairly certain you'd fail if the info was \"big\" enough. Maybe a Tor hidden service could get you some of the way, but it's also common knowledge that many (most?) Tor relay nodes are actually controlled by the government.

Just using HTTPS would be enough.\n\nThe reason Tor exists is to \"prevent any single point on the internet (other than the user's device) from being able to view both where traffic originated from and where it is ultimately going to at the same time\" (as written on wikipedia).\n\nIf enough relay nodes are under control of the same organization, it is highly probable that they'd be able to deanonymize traffic given enough time. Note that I'm not saying \"decrypt\". The contents of your communications will still largely be secure, but the metadata (such as source and destination IP, date / time of communications, etc) wouldn't be. These different data points could be correlated with each other to further decrease your anonymity and confidentiality. For instance, if you'd post on a forum at a specific time / date a few times.\n\nAs far as I know though, there's never been a court case or other evidence that any organization can actually do this. Then again, such power would be kept a state secret I would imagine.",

People will know about it, eventually that information will make its way to world powers. If you control access to it to a trusted group of individuals there's still a chance that will happen if they spread such information around. You're proposing the impossible here. The best way to keep a secret is for the secret to never be uttered to anyone else which defeats what you're going for here.\n\nB: Not everything on the internet is forever. Link rot is a thing, not everything gets archived and even if it does, sometimes it's in some private collection in a goon cave that goes nowhere. If you wanted to get something out, post about it on various sites, maybe buy advertisements for it. Make videos about it, make a website about it. Archive everything you've made on public archives. Make a torrent of it too and keep that thing seeded and spread the magnet link around. If people agree it's important, they will keep it alive. You can also give the information to reputable journalists as well.\n\nC: The above also defeats your purpose as none of this will keep it hidden from world powers. What you should take away from this is that you're attempting a contradictory task. Opsec is about reducing the potential harms of whatever it is you're doing being compromised and that changes greatly depending on what it is you're doing. There is no perfect magic bullet solution, only good practices and a lot of fail safes. You can't stop everything.\n\nD: This is to your first sentence, people claim to have all sorts of information. Most of them want one of two things, or both things. That being attention and money. Believe it or not, people do lie on the internet.",

      "text": "# Thrilled to share NODE: Protocol\n\nHacking games have come a long way since classics like *Uplink*, but few capture the raw isolation and teamwork of real-world cyber ops. Enter **NODE: Protocol**, an indie title in active development that's blending realistic terminal hacking with immersive co-op mechanics. With single-player mode almost wrapped up, the focus is shifting to multiplayer – and it's shaping up to be a game-changer.\n\n# The Core Fantasy: You're Not Just a Hacker, You're Part of a Crew\n\nImagine booting up a custom OS that feels like a real hacker's rig: command-line tools, encrypted chats, and a vast network to infiltrate. That's NODE OS at its heart. In single-player, you're a lone operator scanning gateways, exploiting vulns with tools like nmap, searchsploit, and metasploit, all while managing heat levels to avoid traces and fed raids.\n\nBut the real magic kicks in with co-op. Drawing inspiration from *Mr. Robot*'s fsociety and real APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups, NODE: Protocol turns 2-4 players into a tight-knit cell. No avatars or gamertags – just shared intel via **MeshLink**, an in-game encrypted relay that handles text, voice, and system notifications. Your crew shares the same procedurally generated network (250 gateways, \\~2000 LAN nodes), but each has their own IP and terminal. Breach a server? The door's open for everyone. Leave sloppy logs? The trace hits *your* IP, risking a full crew raid.\n\nThis \"shared world, individual accountability\" creates emergent drama: One reckless brute-force could spike crew heat, leading to heated MeshLink debates like \"Don't hydro that – heat's at 4.2!\" It's not just co-op; it's a social simulator where trust and paranoia mirror real hacker collectives.\n\n# How Co-op Works: From Breach to Raid\n\nLet's break down a typical \"full network breach\" op, the signature co-op mode:\n\n* **Setup**: Join via Steam lobbies (friends or skill-matched public via Crew Rating brackets). Pick a mission from the board, like hitting MegaCorp's infrastructure.\n* **Roles Emerge**: No classes – roles form naturally. Breacher scans and exploits the gateway. Netrunner pivots to LAN devices for data exfil. Ghost monitors traces with analyze, cleans logs via logcleaner, and deploys diversions like strobe.\n* **Tension Builders**: Shared heat means every action counts. Traces follow individual footprints, but a raid hits everyone – cue panic shredding and wallet locks.\n* **Rewards & Progression**: Equal splits for teamwork, with contrib bonuses for MVPs. Successful ops cascade into chains, unlocking intel on connected entities for epic campaigns.\n* **Tech Backbone**: Built in Godot with Steam SDK for host-authoritative P2P. Commands route seamlessly – reads local for speed, mutations synced. Host migration ensures no session dies mid-heist.\n\nPhased rollout keeps it grounded: MVP focuses on core sharing (exploits, heat), Phase 2 adds voice and full breaches, Phase 3 polishes with persistent crews and advanced mechanics like time-locked targets (impossible solo).\n\n# Why NODE: Protocol Stands Out\n\nUnlike abstracted hackers like *Midnight Protocol* (a great turn-based puzzler), NODE emphasizes diegetic realism – everything's in the OS fiction. No UI overlays; evidence of your crew is subtle: foreign IPs in logs, heat climbing mysteriously, auto-shared exploits. It's intimate, like a real C2 (command-and-control) setup.\n\nDev insights from forums highlight the Godot fit: Signal-based architecture makes multiplayer retrofits easy, with a thin NetManager handling sync. Challenges like time limits (tuned to 5-7min for tension without frustration) and worldmap focus (full map with target highlights for agency) show thoughtful iteration.\n\nJoin discord for more information: \n\n[https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt](https://discord.com/invite/A3jV8JYt)",

If there is out of date stuff or vulnerable stuff a scanner is going to hit that quickly, so some random solo guy having fun or whatever isn’t going to be finding a lot of stuff like that first. \n\nMy question got lost a bit in the thoughts: are initial access brokers now just playing an obfuscation game with their servers and phishing campaigns, and searching for web vulnerabilities is not really a reasonable thing to find in the current time?
