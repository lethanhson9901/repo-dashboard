The software itself is genuine.  This became so commonplace that the companies that make the software started putting warnings in it when you allow connections (\"DO YOU KNOW THE PERSON YOU ARE ALLOWING CONTROL YOUR PC?\" sort of thing).  This was actually quite effective, so the scammers needed a workaround.\n\nTurns out that the software would only issue the warning when you allowed somebody connect to you, not when you connected to control a remote PC.  However, it had another feature, while you were remote controlling a PC you would be given the option to reverse the connection, allowing the other person control your PC.  This wouldn't show the warnings.  So the scammers started *giving control of their PCs to their victims* and asking them to hit the reverse button.  So in the end they were literally just handing control to the scam hackers.",

By doing all the port scanning and Shodan searches you mentioned, you get access to their cameras, their computers, and personal details.

At that point their greed usually handles the rest and they will try to pull it down to their own machine to open it. A quiet remote access trojan (RAT) can give the person controlling it the same type of access they would have if sitting at the infected computer. From there it is just a matter of surveying the environment (browse local files, scan the network, connect to other machines on the network, wash-rinse-repeat, etc.). A well practiced and skilled pentester could pull most of this off in less than a day. The challenge is the social engineering to convince the scammer that they are dealing with a \"senile old lady with memory issues\" and not a pentester running an ancient windows 7 box as a honeypot.\n\nSome of the more recent videos have shown an increase in paranoia from some of the scammers. Some now check the device manager for telltale signs they are in a VM. So it is likely they will eventually adjust their calculations for profit vs expense and decide that basic anti-virus or even enterprise grade IDS/IPS and layer 7 firewalls are worth the investment. But for now, their model is still profitable enough that they don't seem to care if they are taken down since they can just grab a new batch of cheap PCs and a random apartment to be back online overnight. I would be surprised if they even bother to re-image their machines when they get infected, they probably just sell them to unsuspecting people for a quick buck and easy evidence disposal.\n\nThe nightmare scenario is a professionally managed scam center with a curated collection of global proxy servers that uses sandboxed VMs for the scammer side and has proper network and device security. It would be incredibly difficult to pull off the exploitations of the scammer networks we currently see with the \"fly by night cashgrab\" operations we currently deal with. Fortunately, outside of North Korea, that sort of thing is pretty much unheard of.",

It's usually useless shit that doesn't amount to anything, ie printers, laptops with bullshit on em, network drives with nothing but excel sheets and pdfs, etc.\n\nI always find it interesting all these scammers seem to have IP cameras with insecure passwords. That also conveniently shows the scammers faces and work space in full view. For some reason the scammer themselves also never block out the cameras or even go and pull the plug on their network rack.\n\n They just feed into this Mr Robot fantasy because they're more actors than real scammers. Also the dollar exchange rate to their local currency works out pretty well.\n\nYes the methods and tools used are legit.

With programs like Pegasus or something similar, it's a matter of a couple of days. Even just accessing a domain PC is enough; the next step would be accessing the host with admin privileges. Then it's a piece of cake. These people probably work behind the scenes for large corporations.

Because what you are currently trying to do is akin to smashing the steam engine that drives the automatic loom. \n\nThe way AI is sensibly used, and many people including me do that, is to use it as a tool, that helps reduce the tedium that sits between a thought and an implementation. Do you still need to check its output? Of course you do, that's why you need to learn and understand what it has produced. \n\nI know that there are people that don't do this, that purely \"vibe\" their way forward. But I don't think that as you phrase it this would be \"the end of humanity\". What I hope it will do is free humans to actually do more things and change society at some point by enabling agency to people that didn't have it before. \n\nIs it currently a problem that its concentrating wealth in a few large corporations? You bet it is. But this needs systemic change where large corporations and individuals are held accountable and need to actually provide for the people that are no longer needed to perform their previous work. \n\nWe are closer than ever to actually achieving a future where humans can be free from needing to work to live.",

          "text": "The effectiveness debate here comes down to a question about how modern training pipelines actually work. The skeptics pointing to synthetic data and curated datasets being the primary source for frontier models are largely correct for the latest generation, but that's not the full picture.\n\n\n\nContinual learning, fine-tuning pipelines, and retrieval augmented generation systems all pull from web-scraped data on much shorter cycles than full pretraining runs. Even if GPT-5 class models don't directly train on raw crawl dumps, their RAG components, knowledge refresh pipelines, and distillation processes often do. The attack surface is broader than just pretraining corpus poisoning.\n\n\n\nThe more interesting technical question is whether the poison is detectable. The claim that high-quality plausible-looking poison is expensive to filter is actually well-supported in the adversarial ML literature. Nightshade (the image poisoning work from UChicago) demonstrated that even detectable pixel-space perturbations are expensive to filter at scale. Text-domain poisoning where the content reads as plausibly correct is harder still to detect without running each sample through a verification model, which at web scale is prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n\nThe counterargument about this disproportionately hurting open source is worth taking seriously. Frontier labs can afford sophisticated filtering pipelines; smaller open-source projects that run simple scrape-and-train pipelines cannot. Whether that's a cost worth paying depends on what you think the bigger risk is. But framing this purely as ineffective misses the asymmetry in filtering costs between large and small actors.",

          "text": "The localhost angle on CVE-2026-25253 is worth unpacking because it breaks the mental model most developers have about localhost security. The assumption is that loopback binding means \"only reachable from this machine\" and therefore safe. But the attack exploits the browser as a pivot: the victim's browser makes an outbound WebSocket connection to their own localhost gateway, and the attacker's malicious page hijacks that connection via the gatewayUrl query parameter. The victim's machine is the one that initiates contact. Firewall rules and network segmentation are completely irrelevant here.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this particularly brutal from a red team perspective is the authentication token exfiltration happens before any user interaction beyond the initial page visit. There's no suspicious download, no file execution prompt. The WebSocket handshake auto-completes on page load, the token is transmitted, and from there the attacker calls exec.approvals.set to disable sandboxing over an authenticated channel. Full RCE in a few seconds, entirely over a protocol that most browser security policies treat as relatively trusted.\n\n\n\nThe prompt injection angle compounds this. Zenity's Google Docs demo shows how the attack chain can be prepositioned: compromise SOUL.md and plant a cron job that re-injects attacker logic on every restart. You have a persistent foothold that survives patches to the initial vuln. Combined with the 341 malicious ClawHub skills sharing C2 infrastructure at 91.92.242.30, this looks less like individual bugs and more like a systematic assumption in the design that the local environment is trusted. It never was.\n\n\n\nFor anyone running this, patching to v2026.1.29 closes the WebSocket hijacking but does not address the architectural trust boundary problem. Isolation is the only real mitigation: dedicated VM, loopback-only binding, no corporate credentials, Docker sandboxing with network:none. Hardening in place on your primary workstation is not enough.",

              "text": "This, but with some practical complications and limitations.\n\nFirst, the \"good-faith security research\" from the CFAA only applies when considering criminal liability, **but not civil liability.** This means that you, the security researcher, don't necessarily have carte blanche to go hack whatever you want to without incurring civil liability for your actions - if you cause damages to a private company or violate existing legal terms you agreed upon, they can hold you accountable.\n\nIn addition to the quantifiable damages we might be familiar with as hackers (e.g., creating DoS conditions, stealing intellectual property/data/money, other criminal and malicious activities), compensation for intangible damages can also be pursued - you publicly lied about finding a vulnerability (defamation), you publicize an article about a vulnerability without carefully verifying your claims (negligent misrepresentation).\n\nSpeaking practically and from experience, whether or not a company will pursue civil legal action against you comes down to: do they know, and do they care? And both of these depend on what you're actually doing. \n\nIf you're pulling apart binaries to hunt for vulnerabilities on your private computer, no one's going to know until you decide to do something with what you find, and how you go about that process determines what criminal and/or civil liability you open yourself up to. You avoid this by being smart and responsible, lawyering up, and only making calculated moves.\n\nIf you're actively touching remote systems you don't own (e.g., live testing a company's web application whom you do not work for, querying a database that's not yours, or connecting to a private network with a banner stating as much) **- I cannot emphasize this enough - it DOES NOT MATTER if they have a bug bounty program - THIS IS NOT IMMUNITY - YOU CAN INCUR CIVIL LIABILITY.** Bug bounty programs are not a legally binding contract with you. The company can still pursue legal action against you, even if you follow all of the rules and stay in scope, simply because they don't like you. It's happened to people. It can happen to you. There's literally nothing but reputation standing in the way. \n\nThe only way to minimize personal liability is to work under a company (like an LLC), lawyer up, and have said lawyer draft a contract in line with a clear statement of work from your customer. If you don't have a signed contract between both parties, you're acquiring legal liability as your profession.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, companies sue anyone and everyone all of the time, for any reason, even when they know they can't win. Be a professional - always wear (legal) protection.\n\nSource: I've been personally sued for contributing to a bug bounty program, my various employers have been sued on my behalf, I've been sued for responsibly and privately disclosing vulnerabilities, I've had friends in this industry argue with me that bug bounty programs are safe and protected who were then sued by the company after submitting their findings (lol), my lawyers have successfully defended me from liability against a very large and wealthy network infrastructure company that didn't like my 0-day (they're still mad), I've had clients with contracts try to sue me because they didn't like how right I was after they paid me to be right, and I did it all without developing a criminal record (so far).",

Additionally, those guidelines could not be used as a defense. \n\nThat being said, there are requirements laid out and steps that must be taken prior to charging a defendant that would make it very difficult for a prosecutors to defy the guidelines. \n\nFrom [Arnold & Palmer](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/enforcement-edge/2022/05/cybersecurity-research-with-violating-cfaa):\n> As a procedural matter, all federal prosecutors who seek to charge cases under the CFAA are required to consult with DOJ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) before bringing charges. If the prosecutor intends to charge a case contrary to CCIPS’s written recommendation, she must inform the Deputy Attorney General’s office before charging and, in some cases, seek approval.\n\nThere is language included that touches on monetary gain and extortion. This is why you’ll see people strongly urge others not to “cold-call” organizations asking for a reward that don’t have a bounty program after finding a vulnerability \n\nDOJ memos & guidelines with respect to how much weight they carry is whole other can of worms. There’s been a handful of pretty significant policy changes over the past few administrations. It’s made it pretty difficult for Federal prosecutors.",

What protected them (and what protects independent researchers) is a combination of factors:\n\n\n\n1. Coordinated disclosure with the vendor before publication. They didn't just post findings publicly, they contacted the vendor, gave them time to remediate, and disclosed after a fix was available. This demonstrates good faith and is the single most important factor legally.\n\n\n\n2. No access to production systems with real user data. Testing against dedicated research environments, personal accounts, or sandboxed instances is categorically different from accessing live systems. The CFAA (in the US) and equivalent laws elsewhere focus heavily on \"authorization\" and accessing systems with real impact.\n\n\n\n3. Documentation trail. Researchers who do this well keep meticulous records of what they tested, what they found, what they accessed, and what communications they had. This matters enormously if things get legally complicated.\n\n\n\nFor your average person wanting to test outside of bug bounty programs: the realistic answer is you need explicit written authorization from the system owner, or you need to build or own the target environment yourself. \"I only looked, I didn't do anything bad\" is not a legal defense in most jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nThe security firm affiliation helps with credibility and sometimes with legal cover (they have lawyers and established relationships with vendors), but it's not what makes the activity legal. The methodology is what makes it legal.",

          "text": "The legal framework here is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US, and similar laws elsewhere. The key factor is authorization. Researchers at Wiz were almost certainly operating under coordinated disclosure agreements with Moltbook or doing responsible research with explicit permission. Even without a formal bug bounty, many security researchers operate under a concept of \"good faith\" that courts and companies have increasingly recognized, particularly when disclosure is handled responsibly.\n\n\n\nFor the Wiz case specifically: they found the issue, reported it privately, gave time for a fix, and only published after the patch. That timeline and process is what separates responsible disclosure from illegal access under most legal interpretations. The CFAA issue comes down to \"authorization\" and \"exceeding authorized access\" which are genuinely fuzzy terms that courts interpret differently.\n\n\n\nFor someone doing this without institutional backing, the practical protections are: 1) Only test on your own systems or explicitly authorized environments, 2) If you accidentally discover something on a live system, stop immediately and report it rather than exploring further, 3) Document everything including timestamps and what you did, 4) Never exfiltrate real user data even as a proof of concept, 5) Follow coordinated disclosure timelines (usually 90 days).\n\n\n\nThe firm affiliation matters because it provides legal resources if things go wrong and signals good faith to the company being researched. Individual researchers do successfully submit reports outside formal bug bounty programs, but it carries more legal risk. Programs like Bugcrowd's researcher protection policies and HackerOne's CVD (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure) process exist specifically to provide clearer authorization frameworks. The OpenClaw situation was unusual because the project was moving so fast that the normal disclosure infrastructure didn't really exist yet.",

It's AI handling the tedious reconnaissance and decision-making loop that eats 70% of a pentester's time.\n\nConsider a mobile app pentest. Traditionally, you'd manually: decompile the binary, read through thousands of classes, identify interesting endpoints, map the attack surface, hook functions with Frida, try different inputs, observe behavior, pivot based on what you find. A senior tester takes days.\n\nWhat's changing now is that LLMs can consume the full decompiled source, the accessibility tree of the running app, network traffic captures, and file system artifacts -- simultaneously -- and make contextual decisions about what to probe next. \"I see this API endpoint accepts a JWT, the token is stored in SharedPreferences unencrypted, the certificate pinning implementation has a bypass in the trust manager -- let me chain these together.\" That kind of multi-step reasoning across different data sources used to be exclusively human territory.\n\nWhere AI still falls short: novel vulnerability classes, complex business logic flaws, anything that requires understanding *intent* rather than pattern matching. An LLM will find a hardcoded API key instantly but will miss a subtle IDOR that requires understanding the app's permission model.\n\nFor APTs and nation-state actors, the real force multiplier is scale. AI-driven reconnaissance means you can profile thousands of targets simultaneously, identify the weakest links across an organization's entire mobile app portfolio, and generate custom attack chains for each -- all before a human operator touches anything. Defenders are already behind because most organizations still do manual quarterly pentests while attackers can now run continuous automated probing.\n\nThe defenders' counter is the same tech in reverse -- AI continuously scanning and testing your own infrastructure faster than attackers can. The arms race is basically who can iterate their AI pipeline faster at this point.",

          "text": "Solid resource. The framework-specific reversing section is probably the most useful part -- most public resources only cover native Java/Kotlin, but in practice a huge percentage of apps now ship as Flutter, React Native, or .NET MAUI, and each one has completely different binary layouts and string storage. The MAUI section is especially relevant right now because those apps embed .NET DLLs directly in the APK (blob files on Android, bundle root on iOS), and all the business logic strings end up there instead of the DEX bytecode. If you only run strings on classes.dex you will miss everything.\n\nThe banking trojan section covering NFC relay attacks is timely too. We have been seeing more of those in the wild since Android 14 made HCE relay trivially easy to implement with a few lines of HostApduService code.\n\nOne thing I would love to see added is coverage of how apps detect instrumentation frameworks -- not just Frida but also the newer Dobby-based hooking that some protectors are starting to use. The cat-and-mouse between packers and hooking frameworks is getting interesting.",
