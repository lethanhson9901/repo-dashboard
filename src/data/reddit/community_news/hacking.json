      "text": "I am 22 years old. I have a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in cybersecurity. I hold OSCP, OSWE and a few other certifications. I have been into hacking for about eight years, mostly out of personal interest. I have also reported several zero days. I will keep the following in basic language. My age and background may seem not matching since I started the journey quite earlier than most people.\n\nAt the beginning it was cool and fun. Learning how things break, bypassing systems, understanding what is really behind the interfaces. It felt like discovering a hidden layer of the world.\n\nFinding zero days is exciting. It is hard to explain that feeling to anyone outside the field. You spend weeks deep in a system, then suddenly something clicks. That part never really gets old.\n\nWhat changed is everything around it.\n\nI started to notice how careless people are with access, passwords, devices, and data. You realize that a lot of compromises do not need advanced exploits. They only need patience and basic mistakes.\n\nNow this mindset affects how I think outside of hacking. I assume mistakes exist by default. I notice weak behavior patterns in companies and in normal life. I analyze things even when I do not want to. It is not fear, just constant awareness.\n\nI still enjoy the field, but the mental cost is real.\n\nFor those who have been in offensive security for many years, how do you deal with this?\n\nHow do you separate your professional mindset from normal life?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Keep as little information on it as possible. Email addresses is also important. Don’t associate the same emails with things that are important, for example the email you use for Reddit, Disney, and video game mods should not be the same one that’s associated with your bank, Amazon, or your cell provider. You can use the same one for things that are less important or are more likely to appear in a data leak. Apple has an email forwarding capability, I suggest you look into it. Don’t ever use something in your password that has a family members name, initials, date of birth or anything simple that has a link to you unless you’re fine with someone gaining access to it. Always use a vpn and accept that if you use a public WiFi network, you’re at risk, avoid it if you can and if you see your phone connect to a network automatically in a public place, you’ve been compromised, disconnect immediately. Get a wallet with RFID blocker, otherwise it’s possible if someone is standing next to you, they can scan your credit card info, that being said, don’t pay for a product with tap to pay if someone is standing oddly close. Also if there’s an insert credit card payment you want to use at an atm, or business to buy goods, inspect the reader closely and make sure the plastic is secure and it doesn’t look like there’s something on it to grab your card. Generally be careful where you put your information, you’d be shocked what people can get with an email/number, your name and date of birth. There’s other things you can do but this is a long enough essay. If you got questions im happy to answer",

It's even more difficult to get a perspective on the real world without spending time inside multiple corporate environments, where you aren't spending your time hunting for vulnerabilities that net bounties. More difficult, still, is hunting for true 0-day coming off a cyber security degree, unless that degree program was actually a computer science program.\n\nAs someone with multiple decades of perspective (and humouring your alleged experience), I don't think corporate infosec, in general, is so far off in 2026 that we need to be personally concerned that everything is so readily vulnerable and exploitable.

The early concepts of a SOC were just beginning to take hold, and we had just invented the notion of a SIEM. Up until then, broad visibility was basically non-existent. We were also transitioning from seldom-updated, signature-based security products, to real-time, behavioral detection tools. The NVD was established in 2005, which was a dramatic improvement to ICAT. It was a period of immense growth, though it was all in response to a wildly uncontrollable threat, that moved with relative impunity. We used to walk in, where we now have to struggle - it's not impossible to get in and cause harm, but it is significantly more difficult.",

When you spend years learning how things break, it’s hard not to see cracks everywhere.\n\nThat said, I struggle a bit with the idea that this realization came as a surprise.\n\nWith your background, like myself, and the level of certifications you hold, one of the first lessons in offensive security is that most real-world compromises are not glamorous. They are not zero days. They are not exotic chains. They are weak passwords, reused credentials, exposed services, over-privileged accounts, and simple misconfigurations. Patience and basic mistakes, like you said.\n\nThat’s not a hidden truth you uncover eight years in. It’s almost foundational to the field.\n\nThe excitement of deep research and rare bugs is real, but the day-to-day reality has always been that systems fall because humans are inconsistent. That gap between technical capability and operational discipline is the norm, not the exception.\n\nAs for the mental shift, it helps to reframe what you’re noticing. Seeing weaknesses everywhere does not mean you have to carry responsibility for them everywhere. In professional settings, that awareness is an asset. Outside of work, it’s just information. Not every unlocked door is yours to secure.\n\nYou don’t separate the mindset completely. You learn to scope it. At work, you analyze. At home, you allow imperfection. Most people are not threat models. Most environments are not in your remit.\n\nIf anything, recognizing that simple exploits cause most damage should reduce the pressure. The world is not held together by flawless systems. It functions despite predictable flaws. That’s normal, not alarming.\n\nThe skill to cultivate over time is not deeper paranoia. It is controlled attention. Choose when to care deeply. Let the rest exist without you auditing it.\n\nI too, can write AI humble brag slop.",

They are paid to worry about and do something about this. They are paid to make sure that controls are applied and risks are managed. You are paid to do your small part as directed by them.\nLet them lose sleep...it's why they earn the money.\n\nAnd don't forget Cybersecurity is just one of many risks to Operational Resilience. Yes we see a lot of focus on cyber due to tge headlines...but was it a cyber attack that took out Heathrow's substation? Was it a cyber attack that took out Spain and Portugals power grids last year? Was it a cyber attack when Crowdstrike Thanos'd half the internet? No.\nSo my advice is to think outside of your cyber box, think of all of these risks to the business laid out in an enterprise Risk Heat Map. Where does cyber risk sit in that map?\nIs cyber risk high impact and high liklihood in that map. Is it higher than the many other risks to the business. Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nTLDR: Do your part. Let those who are paid to worry do their job. Step back from a blinkered cyber obsessed narrow viewpoint and put it in the wider context. Get some sleep. ☺️",

I am analytical by nature... honestly anything can be hacked. Including ourselves... oh I dont use the term paranoid.... im not paranoid. That would suggest I was under a misconception that my peers. My government, etc, were secretly against me and interfere with my personal pursuit of happiness... and im under no misconception whatsoever. Im well aware that I am a target and  my own government is the culprit... it sucks and I know ignorance is bliss....",

When I’m bored now. I just toy with url prompts to see if one sticks. That said, I’m painfully aware when I see an exploit that that isn’t the scary part. Most of those can be blocked by limiting the systems access to internal networks. Not ideal, but simple if it’s a zero day. The hard part is toying with zero days. I do the same as I did with that url. Modifying payloads, adjusting commands, leading to full compromise rather than info disclosure or making a system change that leads to full compromise. Nothing is secure. Not even from a zero day. But especially not from human error. We are ALWAYS the weak link. By laziness (guilty) obliviousness (guilty) or plumb ignorance (guilty). The paranoia is exhausting. I spend so much time stressed. But instead. I’ve just had to accept the risk. I’m a network admin (netsec admin unofficially) and I’ve had employees write their password and hand it to me for troubleshooting. Upon which I’ve handed it back and said “you’ll have to change this when I’m done. Sorry man.” In the age of tech. We can’t rely on people, we need to rely on the tech to protect the people, not the people to protect the tech.",

I find that although they are very different, they are similar in many ways too. This feeling that you have, you are not alone in having. \n\nFor me, what has been key is understanding when it is a me problem, and I know that sounds selfish, but sometimes you have to be just a little bit. Now in saying this I don't mean to say be reckless and negligent, nor am I saying to harden yourself against others and not be willing to help when/if you can, but you can begin to consider some minor things as of no consequence(low impact) it helps soften the edges a bit so to speak. \n\nBut this takes time, let yourself think the thoughts but allow yourself to be curious instead of judge, for judgment seeks action(i hope this makes sense) \n\nI also acknowledge that you cannot un-know things and humans being humans can stress the living hell out of you when you do know better, but that's ok, part of the dance and all if you will. \n\nOne thing that helped me quite a bit was being in familiar safe zones, areas where I knew enough about everything around me that while I was still aware, I did not feel the need to be hyper-aware constantly. \n\nI think the biggest thing is to acknowledge where you are at mental while dealing with it and then work on small things to help align yourself more with those environments to be more comfortable. \n\nNote* writing this before bed after a long day so I hope this makes sense",

Not only is it standard practice to exclude external resources when scraping domains, but it's incredibly easy to fingerprint and remove unwanted data.\n\nI know y'all don't want to hear that because this seems like a message of hope, but we have to be smarter than this... This is an idiotic approach, like pouring gas on the hood of a car because cars need gas to run - we don't know what type of engine the car has, how much gas it needs, or where the gas goes - we don't know if the poisoned data will have an effect on the model because we don't know what sort of model is being used, what data actually matters, how the data is filtered and transformed, or how the data is being used. \n\nSure, it seems like a good idea to try anything and everything, but the number of known techniques to poison specific, publicly-available models, scraping techniques, and use-cases is so incredibly small against the infinite possibilities for-profit companies with private models and capabilities develop. You're throwing rocks and sticks at an M1 Abrams tank, trying things from an early 2000's grad student's thesis on how to stop this newfangled Google webcrawler from indexing your webpage, facing an army of the most talented, professional researchers, data scientists, and programmers, with infinite resources and grad students, that the world has to offer.\n\nI'm not saying I know what the technical solution is - I don't think there is a technical solution - but I think we need to solve this problem either through legal means or market demand, because as long as there's investor money backing AI model training research, we won't be able to stop paid intellectual innovation with our meager efforts.",

Just try installing the free demo on Linux. Although if using a Steam Deck, this game will probably be difficult to navigate without a keyboard and mouse.\n\n\\- If you are asking if the operating system your character uses in-game is Linux-based ... yes. It's a Linux-like distro called BearOS. Just check out some of the promotional videos and screenshots on the Steam store page.",

The blue text at one point was way hard to read.\n\n  \nQuestions: Did you try other visuals besides cycling colors and the parallel lines for bitstrings?

      "text": "USA captured the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuelan security officers who survived that military operation described the incoming attack starting with all their radar systems suddenly turning off without any explanation, and that they had never experienced anything of the like before. The media says that their radar systems were jammed, but that is not how the survivors described the event. They specifically said that their systems basically just shut down by themselves. That indicates a cyber attack, instead of radar jamming technology. Most probably hardware backdoors were used to machinate that part of the attack.\n\nHardware backdoors have been pushed into mass market CPUs and motherboards for a long time now. To make things worse, Windows 11 made it mandatory to have TPM 2.0 for the user to \"upgrade\" their OS to the latest version. So if hardware backdoors are being forced on the consumers and governments, that's an easy delivery system to gain technological power over countries and their infrastructures.\n\nSo if USA and its closest allies have been concentrating on building such a cyberwarfare infrastructure for decades, that's a major national security threat for all the other countries. If one country can basically just \"push a button\" to turn off all the modern technology dependent systems of their targeted countries and their militaries and infrastructures, that can instantly create major chaos and destruction in the targeted country. \"Don't want to co-operate with our demands? Well we just turn off all your infrastructures.\" How do you fix that? Buy a new CPU, motherboard or a computer? How? You can't order it online without a working computer. Maybe by going to the computer store near you? They can't sell it to you as their computers are down too. They can't order new ones for the same reason. They also can't accept payments because their credit card system is also down. What about cash? Well the bank infrastructures are also dependent on the same systems and are also down, so no luck there either. And also cash has been on its way out for a long time now and banks don't have much cash these days, so it's becoming unobtanium. Hospitals? Patient records are not accessible without a computer. Medical factories and industrial factories? Down also for the same reason. Water delivery infrastructure? Problems there too. Food production and delivery? Mostly down too. That's a large scale life threatening situation for the targeted countries who should experience that type of an attack. And no one can do anything to fix the situation as long as their infrastructures are dependent on such backdoored hardware and/or software.\n\nThe safest way out such a problem would probably be for every country to have their own CPU manufacturing. But that is such a high technology undertaking and very expensive to get started, that it would be a massive long term investment from each country. Developing and manufacturing much lower tech CPUs would be possible for individual countries. For example RISC-V based computers could probably be manufactured at scale for the use of government infrastructures and systems. But then there's also the high demand for all sorts of entertainment and convenience products and systems people have made themselves dependent on, such as Youtube, video games, etc. Those drive the sales of such high tech backdoored hardware. But as long as those entertainment systems are kept completely separate from the important government systems, the countries could stay mostly operational in the event of such potential cyber attacks.\n\nJust my 2 cents...",

A condition of his bail was that he remain under the supervision of his mother at all times, Mr. Cottle said.\n\nIn 2021, hackers who claimed to be affiliated with Anonymous gained access to the Texas GOP website by first infiltrating web-hosting company Epik. They defaced the party’s website, replacing its banner with cartoon characters, a pornographic image and a music video, and then downloaded personal identifying information from the party’s web server and shared it online, according to U.S. court documents.",

      "text": "Hey all. Long time lurker, first-time poster.\nI’m still relatively new to the scene, but over the past few months I’ve had a lot of success reverse-engineering and red-teaming Gemini (Google’s AI platform). I’ve found multiple working zero-days and full security bypasses, including architectural issues, and submitted three of them to Google’s official VRP program.\n\nHere’s where it gets frustrating:\nTwo of the exploits were silently patched with zero communication, no acknowledgment, and no bounty, despite being clear violations of Google’s own outlined VRP policy. One day the exploits worked; next day, post-Christmas, they were dead. No appropriate triage, no follow up, nothing. Just patched and ghosted.\n\nI found working bypasses to both patches within 30 minutes. The core issue is architectural, not a simple one liner fix, but it feels like they’re just slapping a band-aid on and pretending the vector doesn’t exist.\nI’ve since built even more advanced exploit chains, using full red team methodology, and I’m at a crossroads now.\n\nDo I give them another shot and submit one more (hoping they don’t take the piss again)? Or do I start looking elsewhere; private buyers, brokers, or even just responsible public disclosure?\nThese aren’t minor bugs. These are multi-stage attack chains that meet the top payout tier according to their own guidelines.\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve dealt with VRP, especially folks who’ve reported to Google recently.\n\nIs this a one-off? Or is this becoming the norm?\nSerious input only please. Appreciate any advice.\n\nEdit. Thank you everyone for your responses. I understand that there are no other ethical options really open to white hat hackers in a situation like this. That is a shame. Someone even in the comments went as far as telling me to stop ethical hacking and that I give you guys a bad reputation. How kind. I do apologise if I have given you guys a 'bad reputation' for asking a genuine question. Thank you for everyone else's input. ",

I personally have no problem with anything I find being used offensively. Certain agencies have people dedicated to sourcing zero days and there’s ways to get in contact with them if you want to sell your zero day to your own respective government. \n\nNations are going to hack each other regardless. Crowdfense will pay you in crypto currency. Just exercise some basic security practices when you submit. I do think there’s a rule against selling them something that’s been accepted by someone else. So your pre patch exploit can’t be sold but your post patch one could.\n\nNobody gets a bad reputation from selling to a broker and I’m personally sick and tired of vendors taking advantage of researchers deciding to be ethical, they just treat it as free security labor. Fuck those bastards, they’ve gotten too complacent. “But everyone is submitting critical bugs found with AI” okay and cyber criminals are super charging their campaigns with AI. Provide resources with financial incentives or nobody is going to help you secure your product. Not everyone is obsessed with recognition in the community, some of us just want our paper.\n\n“You’re not entitled to pay from a vendor” and the vendor isn’t entitled to ethical reporting. It’s a two way street. Go to a broker, use an alias, get paid in crypto (crowdfense will do crypto) and be happy with your money. Either that or you can slave away your zero days for free to appease yo strangers on Reddit. \n\nTalent like yours shouldn’t go to waste. The gray market is where i personally think you belong. I’m never submitting to a vendors program again because I’m tired of not getting paid after they patch the thing that they claim isn’t an issue. People don’t hack for the love of the game anymore, everyone wants to be a cyber celebrity. I don’t care if this gets downvoted. \n\nHope you get it figured out but ignore the people saying brokers are illegal and unethical. As long as you sell to a proper broker and not some shadow broker on TOR then you will be fine. I guess it comes down to your motivation my friend. Do you hunt for money or for community recognition? I have no problem being responsible for a zero day in a single point of failure and receiving zero recognition from the community so long as I get my money. You’re basically making what a company who hires researchers to sell an exploit to the government would make.\n\nMy motto is “if a guy can start a defense company and sell to the government, then I can do the same as an independent researcher”.

And DiskCryptor looks more like the interface I used.  I'm pretty sure it had a GUI.)   \n  \nFunny situation that you've probably heard dozens of times before:  \n  \nI have a drive I put a password on a while ago.  I -know- the password (lol).  And yet, it doesn't work.  \n\nI'm not a coder of any kind, I don't know any programming languages.  It's a windows 11 pc and the drive is external.  The password was put on several years/versions ago.\n\nWhat I'm mainly wondering is if a program could be made to 'brute force' within a specific set of parameters.    \n  \nSpecifically: Like I said, I know what the password should be.  It's a long passphrase.  So let's say for example that the password has a set of words, a set of numbers and a couple special characters.  In a specific, set order.\n \nI know what the order is supposed to be.  The parameters I'm thinking of are-  Varying upper and lower case for the words.  Adding a character that maybe is part of the word, like (W for Virginia/WVirginia).  Stuff like that.  Varying the special character.  The password is, let's say, 35 characters long.  \n  \nI'm thinking if something like a brute force script that goes from, whatever, 33-35 characters, uses these known words and numbers, but varies some of the places where upper/lower case might matter, the special characters, etc.  Maybe playing with the word order which *should* be set, but at this point who knows.  \n  \nEither way I think I'm looking at what, maybe a hundred or so different variations?  When the actual variation shouldn't be more than a dozen or so, but I've tried those dozen, so I'm expanding out.\n  \nHow possible/impossible is this?  How might one go about doing that?  \n  \nFollow up question - is there any reason that a newer version of DCrypt would work with a drive encrypted with an older version?  And the pc used would be different than the one trying to get in, if that makes a difference.",

          "text": "DriveCrypt specifically has anti-brute-force mechanisms built in that dramatically slow down password attempts. This is intentional, the software is designed to make dictionary and brute force attacks extremely time-consuming. Even with a limited search space like you're describing (100-ish variations), if the software rate-limits to something like one attempt per few seconds, you're looking at potentially hours or days just for those variations.\n\nAlso, if you're talking about DriveCrypt (the commercial one from SecurStar), there's no official API or scripting interface for automated password attempts. You'd have to interact with the GUI or reverse engineer how it communicates with the driver, which is way beyond not knowing any programming languages territory.\n\nThe brute force script, in theory, yeah, you could make a script that tries variations. Python would be the easiest for this if the software had a command-line interface. But there is a problem  that most disk encryption software doesn't expose a simple command-line mount option that accepts password input programmatically, specifically to prevent exactly what you're trying to do.\n\nYou'd need to either find or write something that can interact with DriveCrypt's interface programmatically, which requires programming knowledge and possibly violates the CFAA depending on jurisdiction since you're essentially trying to circumvent security measures (even on your own drive).\n\nNewer versions of DriveCrypt are supposed to be backwards compatible with containers created by older versions (4.6 and above according to their docs). But there are some format differences like older versions used something called \"Summer\" format which newer versions can read but requires enabling a compatibility mode. If your drive was encrypted with a really old version and you're trying to mount it with current software, there might be compatibility issues. The PC being different shouldn't matter, the encryption is tied to the password/keyfile, not the specific hardware.\n\nBefore going down the brute force rabbit hole, have you tried enabling legacy format support if the software has that option? DriveCrypt has a \"Summer\" compatibility mode for older containers. Check if there's a setting for that in the current version.\n\nDid you use any kind of keyfile in addition to the password? Some encryption software lets you use a file as part of the authentication. If you set that up years ago and forgot, the password alone won't work.\n\nIf the data is critical, you might want to consult a professional before trying anything that could potentially corrupt the container. Some disk encryption formats have header backups, but if you screw something up trying to brute force it, you might make recovery impossible even if you eventually remember the correct password.",

                  "text": "DiskCryptor changes things significantly actually. It's open source and way more accessible than what I thought you were dealing with.\n\nSo yeah, DiskCryptor has a command-line tool called dccon.exe that can mount volumes programmatically. You can absolutely script password attempts with it. The syntax is something like dccon -mount with the device and password flags. So in theory you could write a script that loops through your password variations and tries mounting with each one until something works.\n\nDiskCryptor uses a pretty low iteration count for its key derivation function, only about 1,000 PBKDF2 iterations. For context, modern secure encryption like VeraCrypt uses 200,000 to 500,000+ iterations. The low iteration count means each password attempt is computationally cheaper to test, which is good for you trying limited variations. Could be seconds to minutes depending on your system.\n\nBackwards compatibility should be fine. DiskCryptor has been pretty stable with format compatibility over versions. If you encrypted it years ago with DiskCryptor and you're using current DiskCryptor, that shouldn't be the issue I believe.\n\nThe practical approach would be a script that takes your known password components, generates the variations you think are likely, loops through trying to mount with each one, and stops when it succeeds. Python would probably be easiest for this if you or someone you know can code. The logic is straightforward, like generate password variations based on your rules, try each one, check if mount succeeded, move to next if it failed.\n\nSince you said you don't know programming. You're gonna need to either learn enough Python to write this yourself, which honestly isn't that hard for something this simple, or find someone who can help you. There are communities like r/learnpython where you could describe what you need without revealing your actual password and someone might point you in the right direction. Or if the data is valuable enough, pay someone to write it, though be very careful about who you trust with that kind of access.\n\nBig warning here though, **work on a copy** of the drive first, not the original. Even though DiskCryptor doesn't have explicit lockout features, you don't want to risk corrupting the only copy of your data through repeated failed mount attempts or script errors. Make an image of the encrypted drive and test on that. If something goes wrong with the copy, you still have the original.\n\nAlso be strategic about which variations you try. If you start doing all possible case combinations for a long passphrase, the permutations explode exponentially. Like if you have 10 letters that could be upper or lower case, that's over 1000 combinations just for case variations alone. Focus on the specific variations that seem most likely based on how you think you might have entered it, like if you always capitalize proper nouns, or if you tend to use exclamation marks instead of other special characters, that kind of thing.\n\nIf you're wrong about the password structure entirely, like if there's a word you're not remembering or the order is completely different than you think, this approach won't help. DiskCryptor's weak key derivation means it's theoretically more brute-forceable than modern encryption, but that requires specialized hardware and a lot of time if the search space is large. Your best bet is that you're very close to the right password and just need to find the exact variation.\n\nSo yeah, it's scriptable and potentially doable. Just make absolutely sure you're working on a copy, not the original encrypted drive, and be realistic about whether your 100 variations actually cover the likely possibilities or if you're still guessing.",
