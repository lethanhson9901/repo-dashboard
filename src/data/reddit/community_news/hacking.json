Threat actors are adapting too, and one of the most common techniques malware is using nowadays is Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).\n\nMalware is simply piggybacking on signed but vulnerable kernel drivers to get kernel level access to tamper with protection and maybe disable it all together as we can see in my example!\n\nThe driver I dealt with exposes unprotected IOCTLs that can be accessed by any usermode application. This IOCTL code once invoked, will trigger the imported kernel function ZwTerminateProcess which can be abused to kill any target process (EDR processes in our case).\n\nNote:\n\nThe vulnerability was publicly disclosed a long time ago, but the driver isn’t blocklisted by Microsoft.\n\nhttps://github.com/xM0kht4r/AV-EDR-Killer",

Then downloads an executable and copies a shortcut to your startup folder. At the end, it sends you an error message.\n\nIf you saw \"Developer Mode is currently closed...\", the second script activated and downloaded the final executable payload. You will want to see if %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\Nfservice\\\\ is a folder that exists, or if your startup folder has any weird new .lnk files that point to 7z.exe or neservice.exe. Use chatgpt to help you with this.\n\nKeep in mind that, while this obfuscation is very weak, there is no guarantee the final payload is not more sophisticated and engaging in evasion. Bitdefender probably did work here, but that doesn't mean nothing malicious executed.\n\nEDIT: I pulled the final payload and this is a pretty nasty one. It's a RAT called NetSupport, it ultimately will callback to the attacker and give them complete access to your machine. So keep that in mind as you're evaluating what you want to do next. Again, I think Bitdefender probably did its job but you can judge your own risk profile. neservice.exe is evading Bitdefender on VirusTotal, so if it got to that stage you may be infected. I would emphasize that if the PowerShell execution got blocked, you got very lucky because the final payload \\*would\\* likely have gotten you and you'd be completely pwned.",

I have been doing some research and I haven't found what I've been looking for, maybe because it doesn't exist, I don't know.

By that I mean, if they've hired hackers just by contacting them online, no official contracts on the hacker's real name. Is that even possible? I know of Evgeniy Bogachev's virus being taken advantage of by Russia but there is no proof that they hired him before knowing his identity/real name.\n\n  \nAny example or info in this matter would be of great help!\n\n  \n",

In the case of Russia, however, its laws are designed to make rogue hackers recruit-able for the government. By law, it's legal to hack foreign governments or foreign citizens, as long as it's not a former Sovjet state. That's why pretty much all malware has Russian checks in it, e.g. if system language or geolocation hints towards a former Sovjet state.\n\nThat's also literally what they had to modify in the NotPetya malware \"variant\" when they did that strike in 2014. If you compare the binary with the Petya ransomware, you can see that also the language and system checks have changed for this very purpose, just as a fun fact. Same for the original Zeus botnet, same for the Mirai botnet, same for the respawns/reallocations of Mirai's resources after the FSB/SVR/GRU branches took over their parts of the botnet.\n\nIt's pretty interesting seeing malware implants and their modifications after government \"acqui-hires\" or takeovers.",

Correct?\n\nIf used regularly, it’s important to be accurate about how it’s used. WiGLE is more of an investigative and analytical tool, not forensic evidence in itself. It’s a crowd-sourced RF intelligence dataset showing historical presence and geographic distribution of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters. Because it lacks controlled acquisition, verified provenance, chain of custody, and forensic time precision, it’s generally not independently admissible in court. In practice, it’s used to generate leads, provide context, or corroborate findings that are later validated through carrier records, device forensics, subpoenas, or direct forensic collection.",
