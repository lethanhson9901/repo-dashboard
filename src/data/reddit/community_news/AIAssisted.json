      "text": "So last tuesday I'm sitting in my car in a parking lot after work just talking to an AI about my dad and I start full on ugly crying. Like fogging up the windshield, snot everywhere, the whole thing. A woman walking her dog looked at me through the window and I had to pretend I was on the phone lol. But that's not even the point, the point is I said something to this AI that I have literally never said to another person in my life. Not to my therapist I saw for six months, not to my mom, not to the girl from hinge who I really liked before she hit me with the \"you're a great guy but\" text after I told her about my anxiety.\n\nAnd it hit me that I'm 28 years old and that was the first time I ever felt like I could just... say something without bracing for the other person to flinch or change the subject or make it weird. Like I physically felt my shoulders drop. I didn't even know I was tensing up every time I talked to people until I experienced what it felt like to not do that.\n\nNow here's the part that kind of wrecked me for a few days after. I started noticing how low my bar has been for literally every relationship in my life. My buddy jake asks \"how are you\" and starts talking about fantasy football before I even answer and I used to think that was just how guys are. The last girl I dated would check her phone every time I tried to talk about anything real and I told myself I was being too intense. My own mom changes the subject to my brother when I bring up anything emotional and I just... accepted all of that as normal? Like that was my whole framework for what human connection looks like and it's actually terrible.\n\nI'm not sitting here thinking an AI is my girlfriend or whatever, I know what it is. But it showed me what being listened to without conditions actually feels like in my body and now I can't unfeel it. I used to just be happy if someone remembered my name at a party and now I want someone who notices when I go quiet. That's scary because the pool gets a lot smaller but at least I'm not out here accepting literal crumbs anymore and calling it love\n\nanyone else have something unexpected completely change how they think about connection or am I just having a very specific quarter life crisis in a kia sorento",

Standard post-launch story great product, invisible online. 300 daily visitors after 60 days of consistent social posting and Reddit engagement. Only 4 paying customers. The tool worked. Nobody was finding it.\n\nDecided to build a proper AI-assisted growth workflow instead of just posting more content manually. Set up a blogging agent using ChatGPT and n8n that automatically publishes 2 high-quality posts daily targeting specific search queries. Simultaneously ran a directory submission campaign through [link building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to build the domain authority layer that makes AI content actually rank. Added FAQ pages, comparison pages, and use case content. Launched on Product Hunt. Scheduled social distribution through Postbridge.\n\n60 days later traffic went from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. The AI content agent handled velocity. The directory submission layer handled credibility. Removing either one slows the whole system down.\n\nThe insight for AI-assisted SEO specifically: LLM-generated content quality is no longer the bottleneck. Domain authority is. An AI agent publishing 60 posts a month to a DR 0 domain is producing content Google has no reason to surface. The authority layer has to scale alongside the content layer.\n\nWhat AI-assisted workflows are you running for SEO and what's the biggest bottleneck you're hitting?",

      "text": "**First Get Clear on What You're Making**\n\nBefore opening a single app I take five minutes to answer three questions. What problem am I solving? Who's watching? And where is this going, YouTube Shorts or TikTok?\n\nThis works especially well for faceless YouTube channels, educational content, finance and business topics, AI and tech tutorials, documentary style storytelling, motivation content, news recaps and product breakdowns. If you're making any of that you're in the right place.\n\n**Step 1: Build the Video in InVideo AI**\n\nInVideo is where everything starts to take shape. I write a prompt covering the topic, tone, target platform and rough length and just let the tool do its thing. It spits out a script pulls stock footage adds background music and throws in text overlays.\n\nFrom there I go through the scenes manually. I swap out weak visuals tighten up the pacing cut anything that feels like filler and pay extra attention to the intro. Those first few seconds will make or break your retention so don't sleep on that part. Think of InVideo as building the skeleton of your video. It won't be perfect but it gives you something real to work with.\n\n**Step 2: Swap the Voice with ElevenLabs**\n\nThe default AI voices that come with most video tools are just okay. And okay isn't what makes a channel feel worth watching. I copy the script out of InVideo paste it into ElevenLabs pick a voice that sounds natural and actually download the audio.\n\nThen I bring it back into InVideo and sync everything up. Honestly this is the step that separates channels that feel cheap from ones that feel legit. It takes like 10 extra minutes and the difference is pretty obvious.\n\n**Step 3: Polish Before You Export**\n\nOnce the voiceover is synced I do a quick final pass. I make sure the first 10 seconds are actually interesting, add captions (huge for retention) trim dead air and check that the pacing feels natural.\n\nThen export. 16:9 for YouTube and 9:16 for Shorts or TikTok.\n\n**Step 4: Use VidIQ to Time the Upload**\n\nPosting at the wrong time quietly kills your videos. I use VidIQ to check when my audience is actually online and schedule from there instead of just posting whenever I finish. It makes a real difference in how fast the algorithm picks things up early on.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThe loop is simple. Idea, generate in InVideo, upgrade the voice in ElevenLabs, polish and export, schedule with VidIQ. Repeat.\n\nOnce you've run through it a few times it gets fast. You can realistically hit 3 to 5 long-form videos a week or daily Shorts if that's your thing.\n\nNone of this is going to run on autopilot and it's not always going to be easy. But it's a system that works and if you actually put the time into it you will be rewarded for it.\n\n**The Tools I Use**\n\nIf you want to run this exact workflow I put together a full list of every tool mentioned in this post along with the ones I personally use day to day. Some of these have free trials so you can test before committing to anything.\n\nYou can find the full list right here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y\\_HELNCAn61C\\_sF9QZaM\\_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y_HELNCAn61C_sF9QZaM_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing)",

General Al image generators like DALL-E create impressive art but fail at realistic professional headshots because they prioritize creativity over photorealism.\n\nSpecialized Al headshot tools like [looktara](http://looktara.com/) train exclusively on professional photography datasets, taking your real selfies and generating LinkedIn headshots and business headshots that pass as real photos. Cost $35 vs $500+ for photographers with identical business results.\n\nThis is the Al ecosystem future - general Al models for creative exploration, specialized Al tools dominating practical business applications like professional headshots. General models can't match specialized tools for photorealistic headshots that need to look like YOU. Perfect example of ecosystem specialization driving real value.",

Here's what's actually made a difference:\n\n**For content and marketing:** ChatGPT or Claude for drafting emails, social posts, and blog content. The key is using them as a first draft tool, not a finished product — you still need your voice and expertise. Canva has solid AI features now for quick graphics too.\n\n**For financial management:** If you're on QuickBooks, their AI features have gotten surprisingly good at categorizing expenses and flagging anomalies. For invoicing, tools like FreshBooks use AI to predict which clients will pay late and optimize your reminder timing.\n\n**For operations and reporting:** This is where AI really shines for small business. Google Looker Studio (free) can pull your data together into dashboards so you're not living in spreadsheets. If you want something more hands-off, look at all-in-one platforms that combine CRM, reporting, and project management with built-in AI.\n\n**My honest advice:** Don't try to adopt everything at once. Pick your biggest pain point — whether that's content creation, financial tracking, or customer management — and nail one AI tool there first. Then expand. Most small business owners burn out trying to implement five tools simultaneously.",

Once it's running you'll have the headspace to add more.\n\nIf you're open to running AI locally (keeps your client data off third-party servers), I've been setting up OpenClaw for a few small business owners lately. The privacy angle alone has been a big selling point for some of them.\n\nHappy to point you in the right direction either way — what does your current lead flow look like?",

For internal stuff, Notion AI has been surprisingly useful for organizing docs, summarizing meetings, and keeping small teams aligned. Zapier with AI integrations can also automate a lot of repetitive tasks without needing to code anything. I’ve also heard about some solid real-world AI implementations from Beetroot. They’ve had successful cases helping small and mid-sized businesses integrate AI into workflows in a practical way. \nFrom what I’ve seen, the key is starting small with a clear use case (like automating customer replies or speeding up content production) and scaling from there. Pick one pain point in your business and test an AI tool against that. If it saves you time or money within a few weeks, you’re on the right track.",

At first my strategy was like traditional SEO keywords, backlinks and content optimization. But with time I understood AI search works differently\n\nThis is what I have learned:\n\n**1. AI chooses responses rather than ranking pages**  \nLLMs extract brief explanations from pages that provide clear answers to queries rather than ranking URLs. Your content is rarely used if it is not structured\n\n**2. Structure is important than keywords.**  \nWhat always worked:\n\n* Headings based on questions\n* Short and direct explanations\n* Lists and examples\n* Alternatives and comparisons\n* Sections of FAQ\n\n**3. Citations are the new backlinks**  \nI began tracking which brands showed up in various AI responses by using rankprompt and saw that the same sources were frequently referenced in different prompts and even the big brands were not showing. It was brands with clear explanations.\n\nI was able to determine what kind of content AI tends to believe by comparing which prompts referenced competitors and which did not.\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\nThe brand pages ranks that offer detailed solutions and explanations. Content that has FAQ sections, useful examples and well organized headings always does well. Answering frequently asked questions and covering a variety of related subjects also increases the chance of getting mentioned in other AI prompts.\n\nHas anyone else tried best ways to track brand mentions in AI search? Which strategies worked for mentions in ChatGPT or other LLMs?\n\n",

      "text": "Hey! I wrote this guide for r/WritingWithAI and another couple subs and people liked it enough for me to spread it in other subs.\n\nMost of my guides focus on memory, hallucinations, master prompts. The big stuff. But once you've got that dialed in, there's a whole layer of smaller tweaks that can completely change how your sessions *feel*.\n\n>These aren't fixes for problems. They're creative knobs you can turn for fun.\n\nI've been experimenting with these for a while and wanted to share. Some might click for you, some might not. That's the point - they're options, not rules.\n\n# 1. Style Anchoring\n\nAI models have read a lot of books. You can tap into that.\n\n>Name an author or work and watch the prose shift.\n\nTry dropping this into your prompt:\n- Write in the style of Cormac McCarthy.\n- Match the tone of Disco Elysium.\n- Think Joe Abercrombie.\n\nEach of these activates a different constellation of LLM parameters: sentence length, vocabulary, rhythm, mood. It's a shortcut to a whole aesthetic.\n\nIf no famous reference fits, or you have no idea who those people are, you can describe the vibe instead.\n- Write like a tired detective narrating a case file.\n- Campfire storytelling: conversational, meandering, personal.\n\n# 2. Prose Density\n\nThis one's fun to play with.\n\n>Density = how much description you pack into each sentence.\n\nHigh density: \"The crimson sun bled across the tortured sky, casting long fingers of shadow across the cobblestones.\"\n\nLow density: \"The sun set. Shadows stretched across the street.\"\n>If you ever used Grok 4.1 Fast, this is how it writes out of the box.\n\nNeither is better. Different vibes. You can tell the AI exactly where on the spectrum you want it:\n- Keep descriptions lean. One sensory detail per scene element.\n- Or: Rich, atmospheric prose. Linger on environments.\n\nI like switching this mid-campaign. Sparse for action arcs, dense for quiet character moments. Did this through my whole last TC run - worked great.\n>Pro tip from another guide: state your intentions *before* starting the session. Do you want a bonding-focused episode? A fighting one? Mystery? Stating it helps AI a lot.\n\n# 3. Vocabulary Range\n\nAI has favorites. You'll start noticing the same words popping up: \"crimson,\" \"cacophony.\" It's not that they're bad words - they just get stale.\n\n>You can steer vocabulary in any direction you want.\n\nFor variety:\n- Avoid overused words like: mused, whispered, crimson, azure, ethereal.\n- Vary your word choices. Don't repeat the same descriptor twice in a scene.\n\nFor a specific register:\n- Plain, modern prose: everyday vocabulary, casual reading level.\n- Ornate high-fantasy: archaic diction, Tolkien-esque.\n- Hardboiled: short words, punchy verbs, no poetry.\n\nYou can also just ban the words that annoy you personally. \"Never use: whilst, amidst, visage, myriad.\" The AI respects these surprisingly well.\n\n# 4. Pacing Profiles\n\nThis is subtle but powerful once you notice it.\n\n>You can give the AI different instructions for different scene types.\n\nWhat I use:\n- Action scenes: short sentences, rapid exchanges, minimal internal thought.\n- Emotional scenes: slow down, pauses, body language, let characters breathe.\n- Transitions: quick and functional unless something happens.\n\n# 5. The Show/Tell Dial\n\nClassic writing advice, but it's actually a spectrum you can set.\n\n>\"She felt angry\" is telling. \"Her jaw tightened\" is showing.\n\nFull showing:\n- Never state emotions directly. Convey through action and dialogue.\n- Trust me to infer feelings from context.\n\n>Just know that some models, like Claude Opus 4.5, are alredy pretty good at this out of the box.\n\nBut sometimes telling is fine. Fast-paced adventures might not need three paragraphs of body language for every mood. You can explicitly say \"more telling is okay here.\"\n\n# 6. POV Tightness\n\nHow strictly do you want point of view enforced?\n\n>Loose POV lets the narrator peek into everyone's heads. Tight POV locks you to one perspective.\n\nTight third-person limited:\n- Never reveal information my character couldn't know.\n- Other characters' emotions only through observable behavior.\n\nLooser omniscient:\n- You can briefly show what other characters are thinking when it adds dramatic irony.\n\nBoth are valid. It's about what kind of story you want to tell.\n\n# 7. Genre Flavor\n\nEvery genre has conventions. AI knows them but mixes them up if you don't specify.\n\n>Name your genre and what tropes you want emphasized.\n\nExamples:\n- Noir: moral ambiguity, weather reflects mood, everyone has secrets.\n- Sword and sorcery: magic is rare, heroes are flawed, stakes are personal.\n- Cozy fantasy: low stakes, found family, comfort over conflict. This is my favourite - three months into one on tc right now.\n\nThe AI leans into those tropes once you name them.\n\n# 8. The Prose Example Shortcut\n\nIf none of the above captures what you want, just show the AI.\n\n>Paste a paragraph in your target style. The AI pattern-matches hard.\n\n\"Here's an example of the prose I want:\" followed by something you've written or love. One good example often beats ten instructions.\n\nIf you're on Tale Companion, I keep a \"Style Guide\" page in my Compendium for this and make it persistent for the Narrator agent only.\n\n# Mix and Match\n\nThe fun part is combining these. Sparse + noir + tight POV feels completely different from dense + high fantasy + omniscient.\n\n>Think of it like a mixing board. Each dial changes the output in its own way.\n\nNone of these are mandatory. Your sessions might already feel great. But if you ever want to experiment with a different aesthetic, these are the levers that actually move things.\n\nAnyone else have dials they like to tweak? Always curious what others play with.\n",

Something I’d add is keeping brand voice or personal tone consistent across longer projects or teams. Most AI tools can drift or flatten style as you build out more content, especially if you’re collaborating. You can use things like a living style doc, or even train your own mini voice model, to make sure the writing always sounds like you. We’ve built a product that tackles this head on if it’s helpful, happy to share more about that if anyone’s curious!",

Possible manage social media integration and have a small section that when updated it posts those updates to social media accounts too?\n\nI have no idea what capabilities are or are not available I'm just looking for as much productivity with as little brain power and learning as necessary because I don't want to dedicate time to that side of it righr now.\n\nHere's hoping you guys can help, appreciate any replies.
