SillyTavern with extensions has all the features that proprietary AI companion services have and the best character writers publish theirs for free too. u can use good open weight models like GLM or pay higher for the big proprietary models. And unless u use it a big log u won't even pay more than the proprietary services, because u pay as u use, while proprietary services charge profitable subscriptions where 99% of users pay way more than they use.",

      "text": "Went all-in on AI content generation for a new project last month. Used ChatGPT to write 20 optimized blog posts in one week. Added proper headers, optimized for keywords, made sure everything read naturally. Published them all and waited for traffic. Nothing happened. Week two, still nothing. Week three, maybe 15 visitors total across all 20 posts.\n\nThe problem wasn't the AI content quality. ChatGPT actually did a solid job writing helpful, readable posts. The problem was my domain had zero authority so Google didn't care how good the content was. No trust signals meant no rankings regardless of quality. Fixed this by building domain authority before generating more AI content. Used [manual directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the site to 200+ directories to establish baseline trust with Google. This part took an hour to set up, then ran automatically while I kept using AI for content.\n\nFirst three weeks after submission looked the same. Directory listings went live but those 20 blog posts still weren't ranking. Search Console showed increasing crawl frequency though, which meant Google was starting to pay attention. Week four through six is when everything changed. Domain authority moved from zero to 20. All 20 of those AI-generated posts suddenly started appearing in search results. New posts I published with ChatGPT showed up within days instead of sitting invisible for weeks.\n\nNow getting 500 organic visitors per month and it's climbing. The AI workflow is finally producing actual results because the foundation is in place. I can research a topic, generate an outline, write the post, and publish in under an hour instead of a full day. The interesting lesson is how AI and SEO work together. AI helps you create content 10x faster and maintain consistency, but it can't build the external signals that make Google trust your domain. You need both working together.\n\nStarted tracking time saved with the AI workflow. Before AI and authority building, one post took 4 hours to write and didn't rank. Now one post takes 45 minutes to write with AI assistance and ranks within a week because the domain foundation is solid. The AI-assisted SEO lesson is that tools and content generation are only half the equation. You can have perfectly written AI content, but without domain authority backing it up, you're just creating invisible pages faster.​",

I use Genstore to spin up small ecommerce sites, which has basically replaced the old manual WordPress setups I used to do. It’s just a lot more convenient. Midjourney is mainly for generating product images, which saves a lot of cost, and for visual work it still feels very worth the subscription.\n\nThere are plenty of other AI tools I’ve tried, but after looking at my actual workflow, I realized I’m fine sticking to their free or basic tiers. So I’m curious what everyone else is doing this year. Which AI products are you still paying for, and which features do you actually use often enough to feel like the subscription makes sense?",

Auditors spent maybe 20 minutes on policies and training. spent 3 hours on technical architecture.\n\nThe questions were specific and brutal, show us cryptographic proof that client data stays isolated during processing, demonstrate that your vendors can't access privileged information, prove that data doesn't persist after processing completes.\n\nOur policies said we only use vendors with strong security, auditors wanted to see technical verification. Two of our five AI platforms failed this test. We could show contracts saying the vendor wouldn't access our data, but couldn't prove they technically couldn't, auditors gave us 90 days.\n\nEthics committees are getting technical, they understand the difference between policy based security and technically-enforced security, having the right contracts isn't enough anymore. Now we are testing with phala and aws nitro, both use confidential computing and show technical proof let’s see what they have to say now.\n\nIf you're using AI tools for legal work, make sure you can technically prove data protection, not just document that you have good policies.",

Their life cost is so low they can stay over a year not working living from their savings.\n\nWhat I see startup founders do is the same, but found a company instead of resting, probably because their past job wasn't tiring to begin with. Then they have many months to work without income.\n\nThen in USA they have tons of high risk investors. When they get any to fund their company, they just transparently reserve part of the funding to themselves and they can roll longer. Their next deadline become the deadline when the investor's vest goes down and he can take off his share. Before that they need to find a new investor to play previous one's share and some more.\n\nIn the eventuality if the company does bankrupting, the founder just must make sure he leaves with enough savings from investments to live for another year. Then he founds another company or has that time to find a new job.\n\nAnd he's not a failure.  His company didn't last, but he learned a lot of skill on many different areas. He'll be a much better employee than he was before his startup.",

      "text": "Is anyone else noticing this? The backlash against generative AI is getting louder it seems. I keep seeing more and more where people are just done with automation for everything & tired of content that all looks the same\n\nSomeone said recently, “Why should I bother reading this if no one could be bothered to write it?” And then there’s a Substack essay I saw just now “we are not learning anymore”where they're arguing that generative AI isn’t just a crutch, it’s actually making us worse at thinking.\n\nIt does make sense to me. Most AI tools just give you what you ask for and they're fast, easy, forgettable, sometimes even make things up. There’s no friction, no challenge, nothing that actually helps you think or work for yourself. It’s like eating empty calories.\n\nSo I’m curious. How are you all feeling about this? Are you as fed up as everyone seems to be? Or do you see it differently?\n\nAnd here’s where I’ll admit something. I’ve actually been wrestling with this for a while, and it pushed me to try something different. I built Senelo which is a kind of AI thinking partner that doesn’t just spit out answers, but basically pushes back, and challenges you, and helps you actually think for yourself - stopping short of rushing to answers or anything like that. \n\nI’m not here to pitch I am just genuinely curious if anyone else is hungry for something different, or if you think the anti-AI backlash is just a phase.\n\nWould love to hear how you’re seeing it.\n\n  \n",

I dont mean any of this personally, I am just engaging with what I see in front of me, and we all like to believe that our tastes are refined, based on reason. But I dont think most of us, myself included, are fully honest about two things:\n\n1. We base our preferences to some degree on aesthetic preferences\n2. Those aesthetic preferences are subjective, inconsistent, and if left unchecked actively discourage us from trying new things.\n\nWith this framing, I have to back up and say this didn't start with AI. Take any fandom, or hobby, or \"special interest\" and you will find poeple who absolutely love it, and poeple who will shit on that. That's the crux of it for me, is that when we say \"poeple don't hate generated content\" which is empirically falsifiable but I recognize you mean the general poeple not the literal \"no one,\" but still I think that presumes a common standard that frankly doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not sure if I could survive listening to a full lifehouse song, its like being stretched and waterboarded at the same time, with a 27 second emotional note about how that feels with no resolution. But that's just me, something like at least 15 million poeple liked them. Conversely, traditional Korean music is something I have been enjoying lately, at the beginning is to me off key, but that is just how my ear has been trained. These are subjective experiences, and I do think it relates to this topic. This to me suggests that objective ear/eye/taste is a myth. Pushing past that comfort zone is something that needs to be consented to, but I think that is how we tune in to someone else and try to share their experience.\n\nI do think a lot of poeple could benefit from slowing down, and refining what they are working on a bit more to make sure its ready before asking someone else to take the time to consume it. That's common courtesy though, and if someone tells me they have done the best they can, I want to hear/see/watch/read it.\n\nSorry, I've been stuck in monologues today. I'm fed up with mean spirited dialogues I have been listening to my whole life.\n\nThere is the natural splendor all around us, and there is the human intent. Everything else is just noise.",

No matter how many instructions you add, you can’t rewrite its voice and tone, or the way it reasons, challenges, and adapts. The 8,000-character system prompt limit with OPENAI forces you to compress your customisation - leaving nuance, important (sometimes detailed) directives, and your actual goal cut short and likely lost to these limitations. \nYou get a tool that follows instructions, but can’t fundamentally change its core mandate or personality. The “custom” experience is skin only skin deep…\n\nIt’s only been out a week !! I’m getting a good amount of sign ups and I’ve had positive unsolicited feedback so far - that said I built the tool because my custom GPT wasn’t enough, I’m curious what other peoples experience is with tools that re available.",

People begin to yearn for indications of genuine thought once again when everything sounds the same.  \n  \nAI is still useful, in my opinion, but only when it is utilized as a collaborator rather than a substitute. You lose creativity, taste, and judgment the instant it completely eliminates friction. The techniques that slow you down a little, make better inquiries, or compel more explicit intent appear to work the best.  \n  \nTherefore, I believe that this is more of a correction than a phase.

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month or so testing both TicNote and Plaud side by side for real-world use — lectures, meetings, and random conversations I thought I’d remember but never do. I see these two compared a lot, so I figured I’d share what actually stood out for me after using both consistently.\n\nWhat I was looking for\n\nMy needs were pretty straightforward: reliable recording, solid transcription, and summaries that actually help me do something afterward. I record a mix of classes and work meetings, sometimes several hours a day, so free usage limits and long-term cost also mattered more than flashy features.\n\nPlaud: first impressions\n\nPlaud looks nice out of the box. The hardware feels polished, and setup was simple enough. Recording itself works fine, and once a session ends, it generates a summary pretty quickly.\n\nWhere Plaud started to fall short for me was what happens after the recording. The summaries tend to be very broad — almost everything that’s mentioned gets included. That sounds good in theory, but in practice it means a lot of filler, repeated points, and side comments mixed in with the actually important stuff. It felt more like a compressed transcript than a real analysis. Also, transcription only happens after the recording ends, so during meetings I had no idea whether key points were being captured correctly.\n\nThe free usage is fairly limited too, and if you record often, you hit that ceiling faster than expected.\n\nMoving over to TicNote\n\nTicNote felt more workhorse than polished demo product. What immediately stood out was real-time transcription. Being able to glance down during a meeting and see that important points were actually being captured gave me way more confidence to stay present instead of taking manual notes.\n\nThe biggest difference, though, is how TicNote processes information. Its summaries are noticeably more selective. It does a better job filtering out verbal noise — offhand remarks, repeated phrasing, small talk — and highlighting decisions, deadlines, and actual takeaways. It feels like it’s actively asking, “What here matters?” instead of just summarizing everything equally.\n\nI also ended up using features I didn’t expect to care about, like the AI podcast-style recap. On days with long recordings, I’ll listen to a condensed audio summary while commuting, which is surprisingly effective.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the free 600 minutes made a big difference. On lighter weeks, I don’t even touch a paid plan. With Plaud’s 300 minutes, I was constantly aware of the limit.\n\nThe trade-offs\n\nPlaud is simpler and more minimal, which some people might prefer. If you mainly want a clean summary of everything that was said and don’t mind sorting through it yourself, it can work.\n\nTicNote feels more opinionated. It tries to interpret what’s important and what’s not, which won’t be perfect every time, but for me it reduced the mental effort after recording by a lot.\n\nMy takeaway\n\nIf you want basic recording and broad summaries with minimal setup, Plaud is fine.\n\nBut if your goal is to turn messy, real-world conversations into something you can actually review, act on, or study from — especially if you record often — TicNote ended up being the more useful tool for me. It saved me time after meetings, not just during them, and that’s what mattered most.",
