Most tools I've tested produce wildly different results each time - facial features change, body proportions shift, lighting varies dramatically - which makes them useless for anyone trying to create a cohesive set of content or build character consistency. I need something that can learn a specific look and then maintain it across dozens of generations without constant regenerating and cherry-picking.​\n\nI saw someone mention [HotPhotoAI](http://hotphotoai.com) in another thread as being better for consistency because of how it handles custom model training, but I haven't tested it yet. Has anyone actually found an NSFW AI assistant that solves the consistency problem, or are we all just stuck regenerating until we get lucky? What features or capabilities should I be looking for that separate tools with real consistency from ones that just produce random variations every time?​",

      "text": "Built an AI-assisted workflow for link building that generated 123 backlinks in 4 months with 18% success rate. No manual guest posting or paid placements, just AI handling prospecting, qualification, and draft personalization around \"best of\" lists.​ The context was marketing blog stuck at DA 19 with traditional link building failing. Guest post outreach had 2-3% success rates taking 4-6 hours per placement. Broken link building got almost zero responses. The insight was \"best of\" lists get updated regularly so owners actively seek quality additions - you're providing value not begging.​\n\nHere's the AI workflow. Agent 1 handled prospecting. Fed it search queries like \"marketing blogs to follow 2026\", \"best marketing resources + current year\" and it returned 180 URLs classified by niche and relevance using semantic analysis. That filtered raw opportunities to relevant ones before manual review.​ Agent 2 handled qualification at scale. Instead of manually checking 180 pages, AI summarized each list extracting last updated date, evaluated whether descriptions showed curation versus link farm patterns, analyzed average quality of listed sites to determine if mine would fit, and scored each opportunity 1-10. This cut 180 prospects to 68 high-quality targets.​\n\nFoundation work happened before agents could be effective. A [directory submission campaign ](http://getmorebacklinks.org/)moved site from DA 8 to 19, so when list owners checked domain it showed established presence not brand-new blog. That credibility made AI-assisted outreach convert instead of getting ignored.​ Agent 3 handled personalization. For each target, AI drafted outreach including custom intro referencing specific resources on their list, value proposition tied to their curation criteria, strongest articles summarized, and reciprocal value offer. Each draft got 10-20% human editing so final email sounded natural.​\n\nResults showed 22 initial emails with 19% response rate and 4 placements. Scaled to 100+ pitches maintaining 17-18% reply rates. Total reached 123 backlinks mostly contextual editorial links from DA 30-70+ domains with average DA of 47.​ Efficiency was 35 minutes per complete outreach versus 4-6 hours per manual guest post. Success rate of 18% versus 2-3% for manual. The takeaway is AI didn't replace human judgment, it amplified it 10x.",

For the past few months, I keep reading that AI video is \"here\" and \"mature.\" I see people playing with Suno for music or making trippy clips with Runway or Pika. But when I actually try to apply any of this to my day job, I hit a wall.\n\nI work at a consulting firm and we are under pressure to constantly churn out content for our clients. The bottleneck is that my boss is the face of the brand, but he is booked back-to-back with meetings all day. He has zero time to sit in front of a camera and record.\n\nI’m looking for a solution where I can essentially \"clone\" him using an AI avatar to deliver these updates. I don't need cinematic 4K movie quality; I just need something that looks professional enough to pass for a LinkedIn update or a client briefing.\n\nHas anyone actually successfully integrated an AI avatar tool into a boring B2B workflow? Is the learning curve steep? And honestly, is the output actually good enough to send to clients, or does it just look creepy?\n\nAppreciate any honest takes on what is actually worth paying for.  \n  \nEdit: Thanks for the recs. General consensus seems to be Synthesia or HeyGen for high-end avatars, or Leadde AI if I want the same features but cheaper. For more creative or ad-style clips, people suggested Fiddlart and Kling.

You are on the right track thinking about avatars. The play here is to clone your boss once, then just feed his scripts or existing PDFs/PPTs into the tool to generate the content.\n\nFor that specific workflow, you should look at tools that specialize in \"Corporate Learning/Comms\" rather than \"Creative Video.\"\n\nI’d recommend looking at tools like Synthesia or Leadde AI. Synthesia is the gold standard for quality, but if you are watching your budget, Leadde is a solid alternative that does the exact same job for a lot less money.\n\nBoth are built exactly for what you described: onboarding, compliance stuff, boring-but-important product demos, and sales enablement.

Auditors spent maybe 20 minutes on policies and training. spent 3 hours on technical architecture.\n\nThe questions were specific and brutal, show us cryptographic proof that client data stays isolated during processing, demonstrate that your vendors can't access privileged information, prove that data doesn't persist after processing completes.\n\nOur policies said we only use vendors with strong security, auditors wanted to see technical verification. Two of our five AI platforms failed this test. We could show contracts saying the vendor wouldn't access our data, but couldn't prove they technically couldn't, auditors gave us 90 days.\n\nEthics committees are getting technical, they understand the difference between policy based security and technically-enforced security, having the right contracts isn't enough anymore. Now we are testing with phala and aws nitro, both use confidential computing and show technical proof let’s see what they have to say now.\n\nIf you're using AI tools for legal work, make sure you can technically prove data protection, not just document that you have good policies.",

Ive been experimenting with AI assistance while doing my hobbies and the specific hobby I had issue with was my notes on philosophy, history, and theology. (Basically everytime I read a work I enjoy I add notes about it to my document with footnotes about other stories it reminded me of)\n\nWhen I tried giving it to Claude it rewrote all my notes (this was my fault, I should’ve been more careful with the prompts but I had backups so it’s okay) when I told Claude it just destroyed my notes it remembered it and would automatically index anytime I mentioned my notes from that moment onward.\n\nI guess at one point I referenced a trade terminal at my university’s business college because it kept insisting I was a day trader every time I brought up my history notes. It got so bad I just had to delete Claude’s persistent memories and copy-paste the ones from ChatGPT into Claude so it would stop. \n\nChatGPT doesn’t have an automated persistent memory index feature, it relies on manual user input which I prefer when it comes to note taking.\n\n\n\n2.) *Token Limits*\n\nBecause I’m weird I coded a private extension for chromium that copy-pastes reply chains from comment section arguments across social media into PDF documents so I can listen to analyses of argument structures like a podcast, but even on Sonnet Claude’s token limit feels restrictive.",

I was making around 15k per month. I thought, okay, this is it, I am officially a founder now.\n\nThat client left after one month.\n\nThat’s it. One month.\n\nSuddenly no revenue, no backup, no runway, and I had to go back to the same field again with my confidence shaken and savings hit.\n\nReality check. One client is not a business. Early revenue is not stability. Excitement is not security.\n\nIf you are working a job right now and dreaming about your startup, please set a real target. A target where you can pay rent, eat properly, handle emergencies, and sleep without panic.\n\nQuit only when your startup can carry your basic life, not your ego.\n\nStartup life is already hard.

Then they have many months to work without income.\n\nThen in USA they have tons of high risk investors. When they get any to fund their company, they just transparently reserve part of the funding to themselves and they can roll longer. Their next deadline become the deadline when the investor's vest goes down and he can take off his share. Before that they need to find a new investor to play previous one's share and some more.\n\nIn the eventuality if the company does bankrupting, the founder just must make sure he leaves with enough savings from investments to live for another year. Then he founds another company or has that time to find a new job.\n\nAnd he's not a failure.  His company didn't last, but he learned a lot of skill on many different areas.

I keep seeing more and more where people are just done with automation for everything & tired of content that all looks the same\n\nSomeone said recently, “Why should I bother reading this if no one could be bothered to write it?” And then there’s a Substack essay I saw just now “we are not learning anymore”where they're arguing that generative AI isn’t just a crutch, it’s actually making us worse at thinking.\n\nIt does make sense to me. Most AI tools just give you what you ask for and they're fast, easy, forgettable, sometimes even make things up. There’s no friction, no challenge, nothing that actually helps you think or work for yourself. It’s like eating empty calories.\n\nSo I’m curious. How are you all feeling about this? Are you as fed up as everyone seems to be? Or do you see it differently?\n\nAnd here’s where I’ll admit something. I’ve actually been wrestling with this for a while, and it pushed me to try something different. I built Senelo which is a kind of AI thinking partner that doesn’t just spit out answers, but basically pushes back, and challenges you, and helps you actually think for yourself - stopping short of rushing to answers or anything like that. \n\nI’m not here to pitch I am just genuinely curious if anyone else is hungry for something different, or if you think the anti-AI backlash is just a phase.\n\nWould love to hear how you’re seeing it.\n\n  \n",

I dont mean any of this personally, I am just engaging with what I see in front of me, and we all like to believe that our tastes are refined, based on reason. But I dont think most of us, myself included, are fully honest about two things:\n\n1. We base our preferences to some degree on aesthetic preferences\n2. Those aesthetic preferences are subjective, inconsistent, and if left unchecked actively discourage us from trying new things.\n\nWith this framing, I have to back up and say this didn't start with AI. Take any fandom, or hobby, or \"special interest\" and you will find poeple who absolutely love it, and poeple who will shit on that. That's the crux of it for me, is that when we say \"poeple don't hate generated content\" which is empirically falsifiable but I recognize you mean the general poeple not the literal \"no one,\" but still I think that presumes a common standard that frankly doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not sure if I could survive listening to a full lifehouse song, its like being stretched and waterboarded at the same time, with a 27 second emotional note about how that feels with no resolution. But that's just me, something like at least 15 million poeple liked them. Conversely, traditional Korean music is something I have been enjoying lately, at the beginning is to me off key, but that is just how my ear has been trained. These are subjective experiences, and I do think it relates to this topic. This to me suggests that objective ear/eye/taste is a myth. Pushing past that comfort zone is something that needs to be consented to, but I think that is how we tune in to someone else and try to share their experience.\n\nI do think a lot of poeple could benefit from slowing down, and refining what they are working on a bit more to make sure its ready before asking someone else to take the time to consume it. That's common courtesy though, and if someone tells me they have done the best they can, I want to hear/see/watch/read it.\n\nSorry, I've been stuck in monologues today. I'm fed up with mean spirited dialogues I have been listening to my whole life.\n\nThere is the natural splendor all around us, and there is the human intent. Everything else is just noise.",

No matter how many instructions you add, you can’t rewrite its voice and tone, or the way it reasons, challenges, and adapts. The 8,000-character system prompt limit with OPENAI forces you to compress your customisation - leaving nuance, important (sometimes detailed) directives, and your actual goal cut short and likely lost to these limitations. \nYou get a tool that follows instructions, but can’t fundamentally change its core mandate or personality.

People begin to yearn for indications of genuine thought once again when everything sounds the same.  \n  \nAI is still useful, in my opinion, but only when it is utilized as a collaborator rather than a substitute. You lose creativity, taste, and judgment the instant it completely eliminates friction. The techniques that slow you down a little, make better inquiries, or compel more explicit intent appear to work the best.  \n  \nTherefore, I believe that this is more of a correction than a phase.

There are so many AI tools out there these days, and honestly some of them are starting to feel bloated or just kind of boring after the hype wears off.\n\nRight now, the ones I use the most are still ChatGPT and Gemini. I decided not to renew Claude this year since I wasn’t really reaching for it anymore. Besides those, because I do ecommerce-related work, I end up using Genstore pretty often, along with Midjourney. I use Genstore to spin up small ecommerce sites, which has basically replaced the old manual WordPress setups I used to do. It’s just a lot more convenient. Midjourney is mainly for generating product images, which saves a lot of cost, and for visual work it still feels very worth the subscription.\n\nThere are plenty of other AI tools I’ve tried, but after looking at my actual workflow, I realized I’m fine sticking to their free or basic tiers. So I’m curious what everyone else is doing this year. Which AI products are you still paying for, and which features do you actually use often enough to feel like the subscription makes sense?",

Cold traffic. No fake urgency.  \n  \nSame prompt used everywhere.\n\n  \n\\#1 Lovable\n\nClean and polished UI.  \nNice spacing, typography, and visual balance.  \n  \nFeels production ready out of the box.  \n  \nMore focused on layout and aesthetics than lead flow logic.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/58u9zlbuopeg1.gif\n\n\\#2 Landerlab\n\nThis one stood out.  \n  \nNo form on the first screen.  \n  \nStarts with a short eligibility check instead.  \n  \nContact details are only requested after qualification.  \nFeels built for paid traffic and real lead gen workflows.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/swed63r1ppeg1.gif\n\n\\#3 Bolt\n\nSolid structure and clear copy.  \nMore content and sections than Lovable.  \n  \nPushes a full lead form immediately.  \nOptimized for volume over lead quality.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c06781l5ppeg1.gif\n\n\\#4 Figma Make\n\n Strong visual hierarchy and layout.  \nIntroduces hard qualifiers like ownership and spend.  \n  \nStill surfaces contact fields early.  \nFeels closer to a design tool than a funnel builder.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mmp48idappeg1.gif\n\nwhich one is your favorite?\n\n",
