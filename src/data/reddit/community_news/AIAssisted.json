I've seen examples from tools like [Looktara](http://looktara.com/) where the quality is indistinguishable from traditional photography.\n\nSo why hasn't this industry been disrupted yet? Is it just lack of awareness that these tools exist, or are there quality/authenticity concerns that keep people paying 10x more for traditional photographers ?\n\nFrom a generative AI perspective, what's preventing complete market displacement here? Technical limitations, social acceptance, or something else entirely?",

I can already draft marketing proposals with a full creative treatment much faster now than I could without AI. It still needs a lot of hand holding and if I wasn’t already aware of the specifics of the job I would not get results. I foresee a world where professionals use their skillset to efficiently  prompt  an ai to build a skeleton that they can build on and iterate quickly. Also you will 100% see new photographer with knowledge of angles, lighting, colour etc add inexpensive AI assisted photography to their menu. They will be professionally touched up finished and printed etc and will look amazing. My agency is already using digital images and video generation to replace hours of test shoots and it’s making us extremely competitive. Normally you need hours of camera time to get even a few early prototypes instead we take one or two good pictures of someone with their permission and generate rotational data and video then pull the frames we want so when we get our proposal accepted we know exactly what actual shot we need saving almost tens of thousands in camera time per project.(depending on the project).",

Spent hours on prompts but the facial likeness was terrible - looked polished but didn't resemble me at all.\n\nAlmost gave up and booked a $500 photographer session when I found [Looktara](http://looktara.com), a specialized AI headshot tool. Cost $40, took 10 minutes, and the facial accuracy was dramatically better than ChatGPT because it's trained specifically for headshot generation rather than general image creation.\n\nThis made me realize the AI ecosystem is fragmenting into specialized vertical tools that outperform general models for specific use cases. Saved me $460 and got better results than trying to force ChatGPT to do something it's not optimized for.\n\nSeeing this pattern across multiple domains now - general LLMs for reasoning and coordination, specialized AI for tasks requiring domain expertise. Anyone else noticing this shift in how we're actually using AI tools?",

      "text": "Went all-in on AI content generation for a new project last month. Used ChatGPT to write 20 optimized blog posts in one week. Added proper headers, optimized for keywords, made sure everything read naturally. Published them all and waited for traffic. Nothing happened. Week two, still nothing. Week three, maybe 15 visitors total across all 20 posts.\n\nThe problem wasn't the AI content quality. ChatGPT actually did a solid job writing helpful, readable posts. The problem was my domain had zero authority so Google didn't care how good the content was. No trust signals meant no rankings regardless of quality. Fixed this by building domain authority before generating more AI content. Used [manual directory submission tool to submit the site to 200+ directories to establish baseline trust with Google](http://getmorebacklinks.org). This part took an hour to set up, then ran automatically while I kept using AI for content.\n\nFirst three weeks after submission looked the same. Directory listings went live but those 20 blog posts still weren't ranking. Search Console showed increasing crawl frequency though, which meant Google was starting to pay attention. Week four through six is when everything changed. Domain authority moved from zero to 20. All 20 of those AI-generated posts suddenly started appearing in search results. New posts I published with ChatGPT showed up within days instead of sitting invisible for weeks.\n\nNow getting 500 organic visitors per month and it's climbing. The AI workflow is finally producing actual results because the foundation is in place. I can research a topic, generate an outline, write the post, and publish in under an hour instead of a full day. The interesting lesson is how AI and SEO work together. AI helps you create content 10x faster and maintain consistency, but it can't build the external signals that make Google trust your domain. You need both working together.\n\nStarted tracking time saved with the AI workflow. Before AI and authority building, one post took 4 hours to write and didn't rank. Now one post takes 45 minutes to write with AI assistance and ranks within a week because the domain foundation is solid. The AI-assisted SEO lesson is that tools and content generation are only half the equation. You can have perfectly written AI content, but without domain authority backing it up, you're just creating invisible pages faster.​",

I had 2,000 “marketing guides” saved (Twitter threads, GitHub repos, Articles), but when I needed a “Marketing Guide,” I didn’t find the one I had saved 6 months before. It was digital clutter.\n\nI used the Long Context Window to extract and scan my entire “Digital Memory” and index it by Utility, rather than Title.\n\nThe \"Synapse\" Protocol:\n\nI copy or save my Chrome Bookmarks or Twitter Bookmarks to an HTML/CSV file and put it there.\n\nThe Prompt:\n\nInput: [Uploaded bookmarks.html with 2,000 rows]. \n\nRole: You are my Second Brain Architect. \n\nTask: Create a \"Use-Case Index.\"\n\nThe Logic:\n\nIgnore Categories: Don't group by “Folder”. Group by \"Problem Solved.\" \n\nThe Tagging: Look for the keywords in the Title/URL. If the link is referring to “Cold Emailing,” tag it under “Sales Growth.” \n\nThe Query System: Create a lookup table that I can ask “I need to fix my sleep schedule” -> and you give me the Best 3 Links I have already saved.\n\nOutput: A JSON or Markdown table: Problem | Best Link from my Stash | Why it works.\n\nWhy this wins:\n\nIt produces “Instant Recall.”\n\nThe AI said: “You stress about ‘Productivity’? You saved this ‘Monk Mode Protocol’ thread in 2023. \"Read it now.\"\n\nFinally, I used the resources I had. It transforms “Hoarding” into “Actionable Wisdom.”",

Most of these tools are trained to make text sound “correct” or generic, so all the little quirks that make your writing sound like you get ironed out. A couple things that can help: try feeding the AI larger samples of your own writing to reference, or do a light first draft with AI and then go back and intentionally add back your personal touches. Some folks use AI just for structure, then rewrite sections in their own voice.\n\nYou can use Atom Writer for this since it lets you actually train the AI on your own style and builds in human review before content goes live. That way, you don’t lose those weird sentences and pacing that make your voice unique. But regardless of tool, keeping a part of the process manual usually helps preserve that personal feel.",

          "text": "Totally agree, most AI-generated ads sound super bland and it’s a real problem for agencies who want each brand to actually stand out. Part of it is that a lot of the AI writing tools are trained on the same giant datasets, so you end up with that copy-paste corporate tone unless you spend a lot of time editing. One thing that helps is building a detailed brand voice guide, with actual examples of what “on-brand” copy looks like, and then using that as a reference for every draft, AI or not. Also, using a platform like Atom Writer can help since it lets you train the AI on your own brand voice and then keeps everything consistent across your team, plus you still get to review and tweak before anything goes live. Sometimes it’s worth setting up a team review process just to catch anything that slipped through and sounds robotic. Basically, AI is a tool, but it really needs human oversight and customization to avoid that generic feel.",

Ik this is quite specific but i make long form history videos on youtube and manual searching takes hours. I've tried a variety of things asking chat gpt and Gemini but they frequently hallucinate links, especially gemeni. Lately ive been using google collab to have the gemeni in there create a 4 step Process.\n\n1. Give keywords to gemeni to reinterpret for best results. Example: **Ottoman battle 15th century**=battle of kosovo, 1444 battle of varna, 15th century ottoman army, etc\n\n2. Have a python script download image's from wikimedia that match my specific criteria. Minimum resolution, aspect ration, painting or photo( this step is to cast a wide but not too wide net of images for the next step)\n\n3. Have gemeni parse through these results using its ability to see images to make sure they are keyword appropriate. (I've come to realize that asking AI to do step 2 leads to it not being able to do many images or just hallucinating. However is ai capable of looking through a fixed number of images say 200 or is that to much)\n\n4. lastly i have gemeni in google collab create a GUI that presents the chosen images by keyword, allowing me to multiselect download them\n\nThe issue i've been having is that something goes wrong in step 2 where the images selected are not what i'm looking form despite there being images on wikimedia that match my criteria.\n\nSo what advice or guidance could you guys give me for this sort of project/whatever this is. **I'm open to just about anything to help me do this.**",

Expensive. Super heavy heavy expert coding what? What even are these models it's as confusing as gpt mini o and random numbers. \n\nAnd when I use it it always feels inconsistent for example for story writing sometimes it's perfectly fine with most nsfw stuff suddenly mid writing \"sorry can't do that or continue\" what? \n\nThe quality is mixed. Sometimes it gives good answers sometimes it feels like Google search answer the little ai popup. \nWhen I use thinking it's slow when expert or such nodes it basically only searches 200 tweets and websites \n\nIts not that good free. Its not that consistent it feels like a confused gpt. Like somewhere between but slightly worse than gemini and Claude. \n\nDoes anyone here use grok consistently personally or professionally?

I tried a bunch of “AI-powered” betting tools early on and kept running into the same problem: they’d spit out picks, but when things went sideways I had no idea *why*. Wins felt lucky, losses felt random, and nothing actually improved.\n\nThat’s why I started building [https://btrbet.app](https://btrbet.app) . I didn’t want another black box telling me what to bet. I wanted something that showed me where *I* was screwing up. Once I started tracking every bet and breaking results down by league, market, odds range, and bet type, the blind spots became obvious fast. Stuff like “I’m fine in NBA totals but terrible in sides,” or “these matchup-heavy spots kill me every time.”\n\nYour NBA example is a perfect case. No model is going to catch every matchup nuance, but if you keep seeing the same type of loss show up in your data, you can either study that angle harder or just stop betting it altogether. That decision alone is worth more than any AI pick feed.\n\nBtrBet also handles the boring but important stuff — line shopping, breakeven percentages, tracking — which doesn’t feel flashy, but over time it’s the difference between surviving variance and slowly bleeding out.\n\nIf you’re already doing real research and still feel like “something’s not working,” you’re probably not missing better predictions. You’re missing feedback. That’s what I built BtrBet for, and it’s what finally made betting feel less like guessing and more like a process I could actually improve.",

Even more frustrating, the model is constantly forgetting in the same chat the style and format, reverting to scaffolding, outlines, and trying to force me into it's style instead of my own. I'm tired of it, and in a conversation today it recommended I find a new AI to work with as it can't stop revering to summarizing and flagging even something like burn scars from a fire and treatment as against it's TOS.\n\n  \nI used to 1099 test prompts for CoPilot and from my professional relationship with them, I will not use their services.

Also available in LM Studio.\n\n\nYou'll get very uncensored AI by running it offline. I can get these models running at reasonable speeds on a 4th gen i7, to give you an idea. I got a small but coherent model of DeepSeek (offline) running on a Phenom II X4 960T (AM3)...runs at 2-3 words per second. Tried the same model on a 1st gen i7 and no dice.\n\n\nAs long as your machine doesn't fall into dinosaur age, there's a great chance you can run offline AI!",

          "text": "Yeah, ChatGPT has really tightened up on the content front lately. If you want more control over style and less generic output, you can use something like Atom Writer. It lets you actually train the AI on your writing voice, so it keeps your style and doesn’t just default to bland summaries or outlines. Plus, it’s got human-in-the-loop features so you can keep things sounding natural. Might be worth a look if you’re tired of fighting the model.",
