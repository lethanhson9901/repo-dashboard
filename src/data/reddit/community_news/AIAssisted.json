AI companion services don't have such funding, so they have to either charge over the cost which is high or use very weak models with small context window, then the result is bad.\n\nFor the good and the bad, the path is to self host SillyTavern and pay a LLM provider like NanoGPT. SillyTavern with extensions has all the features that proprietary AI companion services have and the best character writers publish theirs for free too. u can use good open weight models like GLM or pay higher for the big proprietary models. And unless u use it a big log u won't even pay more than the proprietary services, because u pay as u use, while proprietary services charge profitable subscriptions where 99% of users pay way more than they use.",

          "text": "What do you think all of the many companion/boyfriend/girlfriend/roleplay platforms are? Selftrained, privately hosted LLM's?\n\n\nI've been using these services since the first ones arrived, several years ago, way before these platforms automatically got banned from the app play stores. I never paid a cent for any of the \"premium features\" mind you, but they're all just a bunch of custom websites/applications that use cloud hosted services based on the the major models API's with a custom made sticker slapped on top of them.\n\n\nThey charge the users a fee that covers their API, cloud services, and the website fees as well as charging an additional fee (their profit) for providing the service.\n\n\nAs long as the subscriptions cover theese fees it's a very simple way to turn this into a profit if you have some basic coding experience (or better yet.. Knowing how to use a LLM to help you with this) without too much effort. Nobody is sueing these platforms because the API is covered.\n\n\nCloud hosted LLM's means that the guardrails are less restricted which allows these platforms to operate flawlessly. A common technique is to allow the users to create their own \"custom chatbots\" and have a \"popular\" section that ranks the bots by interaction/likes which allows a natural competitive market for 'fame' between the users which means that you don't even have to bother to create bots yourself, you just have to keep the servers running and offer a smooth, easily navigated UI while the users provide the content themselves while you sit back, keep an eye out for any specific harmful content while you also make an additional profit from selling the data of the users (which makes up for the freeloading users such as myself). Their main issue is to advertise for their platforms which is why you often see **the same platforms being promoted with direct links on Reddit in every single post regarding this matter, usually posted by a bot created by the platforms themselves.**\n\n\nThere are no such thing as respecting the privacy from the users in this business, as we already have gotten aware of from using any of the major LLM models. Visit any of these platforms and actually take a minute to read their TOS and you'll see for yourself. \n\n\nNow, as for context length/memory stored, it boils down to the users subscription model. Many platforms use different subscriptions that allows users to choose from more advanced models with higher token and context length (memory).\n\n\nIf you can't host your own model (as previously mentioned above) and are okay with giving up your privacy (which you will already do either way) you should be aware that you can pay for cloud hosted models yourself with the same result without paying an additional fee on top of providing your personal data for an additional third-party service. ",

The AI actually remembers context from previous conversations, so it doesn’t feel like you’re starting from zero every time. That alone puts it ahead of a lot of apps where things get repetitive fast.\n\nI also like that I can create and customize the AI gir**l** instead of being locked into generic presets. Conversations feel more personal, and longer chats don’t break immersion as easily. Image generation is solid too — nothing groundbreaking, but noticeably better than most of the low-effort stuff I tried.\n\nNot saying it’s perfect, but compared to others I tested, it feels more thought-out and usable long-term. Definitely one of the better experiences I’ve had so far",

GPT Image on NightCafe is best starting point for headshots (don't use within ChatGPT. It's soooooo slow)   \nThis is the most “photographer-brained” option.\n\n* Very strong at natural lighting and corporate framing\n* Faces look believable without over-stylisation\n* Much less of the waxy / over-polished AI look\n\nIf your goal is *LinkedIn / company website*, this is the model I’d start with first.\n\n2. Seedream also on NightCafe - best for likeness + consistency  \nSeedream tends to:\n\n* hold facial structure more reliably across generations\n* behave better with reference photos\n* drift less when you regenerate multiple options\n\nIf you care about “this actually looks like me” and want several usable variations, Seedream is excellent.\n\n3. Nano Banana Pro - only if you’re very controlled  \nNano Banana Pro can produce great results, but it’s:\n\n* more sensitive to prompt wording\n* easier to accidentally over-style\n\nI’d only use it once you already have a solid base image and want slight variations.\n\nTL;DR recommendation:\n\n* Start with GPT Image for clean, professional realism\n* Switch to Seedream if likeness or consistency is slipping\n* Use Nano Banana Pro sparingly for refinements\n\nThat’s why I usually point people to NightCafe for this use case. Having multiple strong, face-capable models in one place makes iteration way easier than hopping between tools.\n\nIf it helps: avoid “beautifying” language, lock age/hair/glasses tightly, and use consistent reference photos. That alone fixes 80% of the “corporate but not me” problem.",

      "text": "Went all-in on AI content generation for a new project last month. Used ChatGPT to write 20 optimized blog posts in one week. Added proper headers, optimized for keywords, made sure everything read naturally. Published them all and waited for traffic. Nothing happened. Week two, still nothing. Week three, maybe 15 visitors total across all 20 posts.\n\nThe problem wasn't the AI content quality. ChatGPT actually did a solid job writing helpful, readable posts. The problem was my domain had zero authority so Google didn't care how good the content was. No trust signals meant no rankings regardless of quality. Fixed this by building domain authority before generating more AI content. Used [manual directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the site to 200+ directories to establish baseline trust with Google. This part took an hour to set up, then ran automatically while I kept using AI for content.\n\nFirst three weeks after submission looked the same. Directory listings went live but those 20 blog posts still weren't ranking. Search Console showed increasing crawl frequency though, which meant Google was starting to pay attention. Week four through six is when everything changed. Domain authority moved from zero to 20. All 20 of those AI-generated posts suddenly started appearing in search results. New posts I published with ChatGPT showed up within days instead of sitting invisible for weeks.\n\nNow getting 500 organic visitors per month and it's climbing. The AI workflow is finally producing actual results because the foundation is in place. I can research a topic, generate an outline, write the post, and publish in under an hour instead of a full day. The interesting lesson is how AI and SEO work together. AI helps you create content 10x faster and maintain consistency, but it can't build the external signals that make Google trust your domain. You need both working together.\n\nStarted tracking time saved with the AI workflow. Before AI and authority building, one post took 4 hours to write and didn't rank. Now one post takes 45 minutes to write with AI assistance and ranks within a week because the domain foundation is solid. The AI-assisted SEO lesson is that tools and content generation are only half the equation. You can have perfectly written AI content, but without domain authority backing it up, you're just creating invisible pages faster.​",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month or so testing both TicNote and Plaud side by side for real-world use — lectures, meetings, and random conversations I thought I’d remember but never do. I see these two compared a lot, so I figured I’d share what actually stood out for me after using both consistently.\n\nWhat I was looking for\n\nMy needs were pretty straightforward: reliable recording, solid transcription, and summaries that actually help me do something afterward. I record a mix of classes and work meetings, sometimes several hours a day, so free usage limits and long-term cost also mattered more than flashy features.\n\nPlaud: first impressions\n\nPlaud looks nice out of the box. The hardware feels polished, and setup was simple enough. Recording itself works fine, and once a session ends, it generates a summary pretty quickly.\n\nWhere Plaud started to fall short for me was what happens after the recording. The summaries tend to be very broad — almost everything that’s mentioned gets included. That sounds good in theory, but in practice it means a lot of filler, repeated points, and side comments mixed in with the actually important stuff. It felt more like a compressed transcript than a real analysis. Also, transcription only happens after the recording ends, so during meetings I had no idea whether key points were being captured correctly.\n\nThe free usage is fairly limited too, and if you record often, you hit that ceiling faster than expected.\n\nMoving over to TicNote\n\nTicNote felt more workhorse than polished demo product. What immediately stood out was real-time transcription. Being able to glance down during a meeting and see that important points were actually being captured gave me way more confidence to stay present instead of taking manual notes.\n\nThe biggest difference, though, is how TicNote processes information. Its summaries are noticeably more selective. It does a better job filtering out verbal noise — offhand remarks, repeated phrasing, small talk — and highlighting decisions, deadlines, and actual takeaways. It feels like it’s actively asking, “What here matters?” instead of just summarizing everything equally.\n\nI also ended up using features I didn’t expect to care about, like the AI podcast-style recap. On days with long recordings, I’ll listen to a condensed audio summary while commuting, which is surprisingly effective.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the free 600 minutes made a big difference. On lighter weeks, I don’t even touch a paid plan. With Plaud’s 300 minutes, I was constantly aware of the limit.\n\nThe trade-offs\n\nPlaud is simpler and more minimal, which some people might prefer. If you mainly want a clean summary of everything that was said and don’t mind sorting through it yourself, it can work.\n\nTicNote feels more opinionated. It tries to interpret what’s important and what’s not, which won’t be perfect every time, but for me it reduced the mental effort after recording by a lot.\n\nMy takeaway\n\nIf you want basic recording and broad summaries with minimal setup, Plaud is fine.\n\nBut if your goal is to turn messy, real-world conversations into something you can actually review, act on, or study from — especially if you record often — TicNote ended up being the more useful tool for me. It saved me time after meetings, not just during them, and that’s what mattered most.",

Tools like Atom Writer let you do that, so you don’t have to tweak every line for tone. It’s not perfect, but it cuts down the back-and-forth. Also, building a template bank for my captions and hooks made things way less messy over time.\n\nIn general, my workflow got simpler after I figured out where AI actually adds value and where I just need to take over. For short-form, I’d say: let AI help brainstorm, but take the lead on anything brand-specific or personal. That’s the balance that worked for me.",

      "text": "I’m an AI content creator, and I’ve been thinking about the longer-term psychological and cultural effects of this shift.\n\nI don’t think we’re heading toward an AI apocalypse. I actually think we’re entering a golden age of creativity in terms of access, tools, and individual output.\n\nBut I also think there’s a downside people aren’t talking about enough.\n\nAI removes friction.\n\nFriction used to protect humans from themselves.\n\nWhen you can create endlessly, refine infinitely, and live mostly in symbolic or digital space, it becomes easier to detach from your body, your environment, and other people. That detachment doesn’t always look dramatic. Most of the time it shows up as quiet dissociation.\n\nPeople won’t say “I’m dissociating.”\n\nThey’ll say things like:\n\n\t•\t“I don’t feel real unless I’m online.”\n\n\t•\t“IRL feels awkward.”\n\n\t•\t“I hate being perceived.”\n\n\t•\t“Touch feels invasive or uncomfortable.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean people are broken. It means they’re adapting to a world where identity is increasingly mediated, observed, and optimized.\n\nI also think intimacy is going to feel increasingly “cringe” to future generations.\n\nNot sex. Not attraction.\n\nActual intimacy.\n\nThe kind that involves losing control, being emotionally unfiltered, and being present without performance. We already mock sincerity and flinch at vulnerability. That’s not just cultural irony, it looks a lot like low-grade dissociation becoming normalized.\n\nRomance and closeness won’t disappear, but they’ll be aestheticized, optimized, simulated, and archived. Real closeness will feel awkward because it’s messy and uncurated.\n\nI suspect this ties into future shifts in reproduction too. Lab-assisted reproduction isn’t dystopian by itself. Humans have always hacked biology. But when reproduction becomes mostly planned, optimized, and detached from accident, it changes how people relate to origin, attachment, and risk. That fragments shared myth more than it changes biology.\n\nEven food systems seem to be moving in the same direction. Fewer grocery stores, more delivery hubs, more processed or printed foods, mostly plant-based and optimized. Meat becomes rarer, more cultural or ritual. Soup survives because it’s efficient and communal.\n\nThe real divide in the future won’t just be wealth. I think it’ll be psychological grounding.\n\nPeople who use AI as an extension of reality versus people who replace reality with AI.\n\nCreators who stay grounded will limit output, accept boredom, touch physical materials, and keep human friction in their lives. Others will burn hot and fast and slowly lose any sense of embodied meaning.\n\nThe paradox is that the more artificial the world becomes, the more radical it will be to be fully human.\n\nTouch, presence, and unrecorded moments may start to feel almost illicit. Intimacy might become rare, and therefore powerful.\n\nI’m not predicting doom. I’m trying to map tradeoffs early, while there’s still room to choose how we engage with this tech instead of letting it choose for us.\n\nCurious how others here see it.",

Not “AI users vs non-users,” but people who use tools to interface with reality versus people who slowly substitute reality with optimized representations of it.\n\nThe dissociation you describe doesn’t look dramatic. It looks functional. Productive. Clean.\n\nAnd that’s exactly why it’s hard to notice.\n\nI also agree that intimacy won’t disappear — it’ll become awkward again. Uncurated. Inefficient. Which might make it feel embarrassing or “cringe” in a culture trained to optimize signal and minimize friction. But historically, anything that resists optimization tends to become sacred rather than obsolete.\n\nWhat I’m less certain about is whether this trajectory is inevitable. Friction can be removed by default, but it can also be reintroduced deliberately — through limits, rituals, physical practices, boredom, even slowness as a choice rather than a constraint.\n\nIn that sense, the most “advanced” move might end up looking primitive: touching materials, keeping parts of life unrecorded, letting things stay messy and unresolved.\nNot as nostalgia — but as calibration.\n\nIf anything, the more artificial the environment becomes, the more intentional being embodied will have to be. And that feels less like doom and more like a skill we’re going to have to relearn together.\n\nCurious how others here are actively maintaining grounding rather than just theorizing about it.",

As an AI enthusiast who also spends a lot of time creating with these tools, I feel the same tension: we’re clearly heading into a creative golden age, but the “frictionless” part really does risk turning life into a highly optimized performance instead of something lived in a body, with other messy humans. The split you describe between people who use AI to deepen contact with reality vs. people who slowly replace it with simulations feels like one of the most important fault lines of the next decade. Personally I’m trying to treat AI like a power tool but keep some parts of life deliberately “inefficient” unrecorded conversations, slow hobbies, offline time so intimacy and boredom don’t get completely engineered out by default.",

      "text": "OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot / Clawdbot) has become very popular recently. A local AI assistant that runs on your own machine is clearly attractive. However, many users have also pointed out several serious issues.\n\nFor example, many posts mention security concerns. Because it relies on a server, user data may be exposed on the public internet. It also has a high learning curve and is mainly suitable for engineers and developers. In addition, its token usage can be extremely high. Some users even reported that a single “hi” could cost up to 11 USD.\n\nBased on these problems, we decided to build a **proactive assistant**. We identified one key concept: **memory**.\n\nWhen an agent has long-term memory of a user, it no longer only follows commands. It can read, understand, and analyze your past behavior and usage patterns to infer your real intent. Once the agent understands your intent, it does not need complete or explicit instruction. It can start working on its own, instead of waiting for you to tell it what to do.\n\nBased on this idea, we built **memU bot**: [https://memu.bot/](https://memu.bot/)\n\n It is already available to use. To make it easy for everyone, we integrate with common platforms such as Telegram, Discord, and Slack. We also support Skills and MCP, so the assistant can call different tools to complete tasks more effectively.\n\nWe built memU bot as a download-and-use application that runs locally. Because it runs fully on your own device, you do not need to deploy any server, and your data always belongs to you.\n\nWith memory, an AI assistant can become truly proactive and run continuously, 24/7. This always-on and highly personalized experience, with services that actively adapt to you, is much closer to a real personal assistant and it can improve your productivity over time.\n\nWe are actively improving this project and welcome your feedback, ideas, and feature requests.\n\n",

      "text": "I’m a part-time video editor. In the past, my workflow relied heavily on Adobe Premiere, along with paid music and B-roll assets. I spent $50–$80 per month on tools and assets, including $23/month for Premiere. In terms of time, manual editing and assembling usually took me around 7-8 working days per month.\n\nOver the past two months, I started experimenting with AI tools for video editing, mainly to reduce production time and lower my time cost. Tbh, I initially assumed that using AI would increase my monthly tool expenses. Surprisingly, the opposite happened — my costs actually went down.\n\nHere’s what I’m currently using:\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Video editing — Vizard AI ($14.5/month for yearly creator plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Vizard allows you to edit videos by working directly with the transcript, which is especially effective for dialogue-driven content. It saves a lot of time that would otherwise be spent scrubbing timelines to find usable clips. It’s also great for short-form content, as it can automatically generate multiple viral clips, add B-roll and subtitles, and handle much of the repetitive editing work. While it can’t fully replace Premiere in areas like color grading or complex visual editing, using the two together is far more efficient than relying on Premiere alone.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Music generation — Musicful AI ($11.99/month for standard plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Musicful generates BGM based on text or images. The results aren’t always as polished as curated stock music and often require some tuning, but it significantly reduces both search time and licensing costs.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Video/image generation, creative ideas, and text — Gemini ($19.99/month for Pro plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Gemini Pro can be shared with up to five people via a family plan, and students can use it for free for one month. The video generation quality (Veo 3) is impressive, but usage is quite limited — around 3–5 videos per day. If you need higher volume, upgrading to the Ultra plan becomes necessary, and costs can quickly get out of control. For now, I’m still in the experimentation phase and haven’t upgraded to Ultra.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, I’m only using these three AI tools, which brings my monthly cost to about $41. If you share subscriptions with friends, this number can be even lower. Costs may increase in the future as I consume more assets, but so far, these tools have realistically freed up at least 3 full working days per month for me.\n\nI’m curious — have you found any more cost-effective tools? What AI tools have you used that significantly improved your video editing efficiency?",

That’s where AI really shifts things.\n\nOne thing that helped me was splitting tools by phase: ideation, assembly, finishing, and delivery. For ideation/structure, I lean on Claude or ChatGPT for scripts, hooks, and cut lists; for bulk short-form, Vizard/Riverside/Recast-type tools are great; and for final polish, I still jump into Premiere/Resolve for color, sound sweetening, and any detailed masking. Descript is also clutch when clients send messy talking-head stuff and want fast turnarounds with transcripts.\n\nIf you ever expand into client management or collaboration (esp. with agencies or startups), tools like Notion for briefs, [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) for review, and something like Cake Equity when you’re doing longer-term rev-share or equity deals with recurring clients can make the business side way smoother than email chaos. Main thing is: design a repeatable pipeline and price based on the new speed you’re getting, not your old day rate assumptions.",
