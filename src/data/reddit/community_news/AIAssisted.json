Like I'd spend an hour in Canva trying to make backgrounds look professional, and they'd still come out inconsistent or just kinda off-brand. I tried the whole white sheet backdrop thing too, but lighting is apparently a skill I don't have, lol.  \nBut from the past few weeks I have been using AI to create product images, and it has made my work much lesser. TBH, I really used to judge AI images before this. But they have improved a lot. What else AI feature should I check next? I have Mulerun subscription, so I have access to multiple agents. Like, I have heard a lot of people say they use AI to increase productivity, but what tasks exactly are you using them for?",

Are you generating on top of the product itself in parts to create changes in some small areas? Ethically questionable, but fine depending on how much you edit it. Are you uploading an image to a generator and having it generate a whole new image? Likely unethical I'm afraid. As someone who's studied what motivates people to use AI I noticed a clear difference in the ability to spot micro inaccuracies in people who liked AI outputs.

      "text": "Solo founder using AI tools to build complete content marketing engine without hiring writers or expensive SEO agencies. Combined ChatGPT for content production assistance with strategic backlink foundation service. Seven months later at 2140 monthly organic visitors with 38 paying customers all from organic. Sharing complete AI-assisted workflow and what actually worked.​ The AI-assisted approach was necessary given brutal constraints. Zero budget for professional content writers at $0.20-0.30 per word adding up quickly. Zero budget for SEO agency retainers at $3000-5000 monthly. Had to figure out how to produce quality optimized content and build domain authority using AI assistance and smart service automation. ChatGPT handled content creation heavy lifting while specialized services handled technical SEO foundation work.​\n\nMonth one established foundation combining AI capabilities and human services strategically. Used ChatGPT to research target keywords and create detailed content briefs for target audience personas. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) for backlink foundation establishing domain authority from zero. Published 5 blog posts created with ChatGPT assistance providing first drafts then edited carefully for accuracy and unique brand voice. Domain authority: 0→15. Traffic: 34 visitors. Hours with AI assistance: 26 versus 42+ hours writing everything manually from scratch.​\n\nMonth two built repeatable content production workflow leveraging AI efficiently. Created library of ChatGPT prompts for different content types: detailed comparison posts, step-by-step how-to guides, use case breakdowns with examples. Used AI to generate solid first drafts then spent 1.5-2 hours editing each for quality control and adding unique insights AI couldn't provide. Domain authority reached 22. Published 7 posts total. Traffic: 240 visitors. Hours with AI: 24 versus 38+ hours manual writing.​\n\nMonth three optimized AI workflow for maximum efficiency and output quality. Refined prompts systematically producing better first drafts requiring less editing time. Used ChatGPT for content optimization suggestions and internal linking recommendations based on semantic relationships. Domain authority 26. Published 6 posts maintaining quality standards with less time investment. Traffic: 580 visitors. Hours with AI: 20 versus 34+ hours without AI assistance.​\n\nMonth four showed AI-assisted content ranking competitively well in search results. Domain authority 29. Content created with AI assistance ranking just as well as manually written posts proving quality was sufficient for SEO performance. Getting 940 monthly organic visitors. Published 5 posts. Hours with AI: 18 versus 30+ hours manual approach. First 12 paying customers from organic channel.​\n\nMonth five accelerated with refined AI production systems working smoothly. Domain authority 31. Ranking for 52 keywords with 23 in top 10 positions. Getting 1420 monthly organic visitors. Used ChatGPT for systematically updating older posts adding new sections and fresh examples. Published 4 new posts. Hours with AI: 16 versus 26+ hours manual. Revenue growing from organic customers.​\n\nMonth six hit strong momentum with sustainable AI-assisted workflow established. Domain authority 33. Ranking for 64 keywords with 29 in top 10. Getting 1780 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 6 older posts using AI assistance for efficiency. Hours with AI: 14 versus 24+ hours manual approach. Customer base growing organically.​ \n\nMonth seven reached current state with proven AI content system. Domain authority 34. Ranking for 78 keywords with 35 in top 10 positions. Getting 2140 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 5 older posts using AI assistance. Hours with AI: 14 versus 22+ hours manual. Total customers: 38 all from organic search channel.​ \n\nTotal time savings over 7 months using AI assistance was 132 hours versus traditional manual content creation approach. That's 19 hours monthly saved on average consistently. At $85/hour opportunity cost that's $11,220 in saved time invested into product development and customer success instead of writing content manually.​ The AI-assisted workflow that actually worked was using ChatGPT for comprehensive keyword research and detailed content brief creation, generating complete first drafts with detailed prompts including target keywords and logical structure, editing AI content thoughtfully adding unique insights and authentic brand voice taking 1.5-2 hours per post, using AI for internal linking suggestions and on-page content optimization recommendations, having AI suggest targeted content updates for older posts showing ranking potential, and maintaining rigorous human oversight for factual accuracy and quality control throughout.​ \n\nWhat didn't work initially with AI assistance was using generic prompts producing generic undifferentiated content that didn't rank competitively, not editing AI output thoroughly enough resulting in bland posts without unique valuable perspectives, trying to publish AI content without adding real expertise and concrete examples, expecting AI to handle technical SEO strategy requiring specialized domain knowledge, and relying on AI for factual claims without verification causing accuracy issues.​ Investment over 7 months combined AI tools and services cost-efficiently. ChatGPT Plus $20 monthly total $140, GetMoreBacklinks directory service $127 one-time, hosting $20 monthly total $140, basic SEO tools $32 monthly total $224. Grand total $631 to reach 2140 monthly visitors and 38 paying customers representing massive positive ROI on minimal investment.​ \n\nFor others using AI assistance for content production the lessons are AI handles first drafts and research efficiently saving significant time but requires careful human editing for quality, combine AI content creation with strategic backlink services for complete holistic SEO approach, use detailed specific prompts specifying structure, keywords, target audience for better AI output quality, always add unique insights and domain expertise AI fundamentally can't provide, maintain strict quality standards not just publishing unedited AI content, and systematically track time savings measuring AI efficiency gains versus traditional manual processes.​ The broader lesson is AI assistance enables solo founders to compete effectively with well-funded teams. The combination of ChatGPT for content production plus GetMoreBacklinks for technical foundation work replaced need for professional content writer and SEO specialist saving $5000+ monthly in agency costs while producing comparable results at fraction of cost.",

I started with a rough draft of my own, had my AI polish it up, and then took that and again did the final polish myself by adding, removing, or changing bits as I saw fit to make it truly my own. And, apart from the LLM-biased language, I think the final results speak for themselves.\n\nLike, you know that original study that said that [using AI for writing makes you dumber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872)?  That exact same study also mentioned that people who do the initial writing first, and then have the AI come in to throw its own two cents in and suggest changes, actually scored higher than the control group who didn't touch AI at all. But of course, that didn't fit the narrative so it was summarily ignored by all the purists who insist only their devoutly anti-AI ways can ever be optimal.\n\nRelevant takeaway quotes from the paper for the lazy:\n\n---\n\nFirst, defining the \"Brain-to-LLM\" term used extensively here:\n> In the 4th session we asked... the Brain-only group participants were asked to use LLM (we refer to them as Brain-to-LLM)... Thus, we refer to all participants who originally performed Sessions 1, 2, 3 as Brain-only group, Brain-to-LLM group for Session 4, as they performed their 4th session as an LLM group.\n\n> We believe that some of the most striking observations in our study stem from Session 4, **where Brain-to-LLM participants showed higher neural connectivity than LLM Group's sessions 1, 2, 3** (network‑wide spike in alpha-, beta‑, theta‑, and delta-band directed connectivity). **This suggests that rewriting an essay using AI tools (after prior AI-free writing) engaged more extensive brain network interactions**. In contrast, the LLM-to-Brain group, being exposed to LLM use prior, demonstrated less coordinated neural effort in most bands, as well as bias in LLM specific vocabulary.\n\n> Regarding Session 4 participants, those who had previously written without tools (Brain-only group), **the so-called Brain-to-LLM group, exhibited significant increase in brain connectivity across all EEG frequency bands when allowed to use an LLM on a familiar topic**. This suggests that AI-supported re-engagement invoked high levels of cognitive integration, memory reactivation, and top-down control.\n\n> Regarding Session 4, which included the participants who came from the original Brain-only group, from an educational standpoint, these results suggest that **strategic timing of AI tool introduction following initial self-driven effort may enhance engagement and neural integration**. The corresponding EEG markers indicate this may be **a more neurocognitively optimal sequence** than consistent AI tool usage from the outset.",

What actually helps for a strict character bible is two things:\n\n1) A platform that respects character definitions, not just reacts to prompts. If the engine keeps defaulting back to generic tones or safety defaults, no amount of setup will save it.\n\n2) A workflow that anchors the character every time you start a session like having a defined history + traits + reactions that you inject at the beginning of each chat block.\n\nFor me, something that’s held up better than most is CrushOn AI not because it’s perfect, but because it’s one of the few where a well-written character sheet actually translates into long sessions without constant drift. You still need to anchor tone occasionally, but the memory sticks better than a lot of others.\n\nPeople also do stuff like:  \n• Lorebook snippets pasted at the start of each session  \n• Recap templates (“remember: X trait, Y history, Z boundaries”)  \n• First message anchors that set voice + mood before main conversation\n\nNo magic bullet yet, but platforms that honor definitions and session memory go a long way compared to ones that just “guess” personality each time.",

It looks interesting, but I am not sure how it compares long term or whether there are better tools doing this right now.\n\nFor people who do research, writing, or just have a lot of scattered files, what are you using?

You learn a lot by being forced to do it, being forced to google and search that god awful website stack overflow. \n\nIf you never need to do it, never need to search, never need to write a single line of code - you really won't learn anything deeper about the software except architecture. And tbh i think that is fine.\n\nAlmost all code we write is super simple shit. And what most people think is \"advanced\" is just super simple math - but because they didnt do much math it's hard for them. \n\nSay for example we need to do a kalman filter implementation in python. You could use the kalman library, or you could use numpy and do all the loops and matrix multiplications and what not yourself. So the only real knowledge you would need here is to actually use numpy or the library (which isnt the greatest) - you do not try to create your own matricies as a list of lists. \n\nAll that shit is now too low level. Now you're focused on figuring out if Kalman filter is the best filter, implementation is solved - the LLM will do that zero-shot for you.",

Then from that extraction they are to provide you with a style Playbook that will generate any subjects in the style of the submitted photograph that the extraction was taken from . Then issue a prompt for them to generate a text only prompt summary that issues the command as succinctly as possible to use this style book in particular in future Generations . It works amazingly well . After you've got that style Playbook if that's what you're heading toward as you want a particular style but you don't really know necessarily what you want them to generate and you kind of want them to pick or surprise you then you can issue that command with the style Playbook and I just use the command dealer's choice and they pick right up on it and I've been blown out of the water sometimes at some of the things that they just randomly seem to pick and generate for me .

      "text": "Most people use AI via chatbots but I can assure you that this is not the best way to use AI for getting the most out of it. I've taken myself to the next level and it's worked extremely well for me.\n\nNow, instead of using chatbots I use knowledge graphs combined with chatbots from an app my brother and I built. The difference is like having a disorganized library with a librarian guessing what it needs to produce the right outputs versus having a highly organized library where the librarian knows exactly what to produce.\n\nThis means the outputs are highly precise. So for example, I'm working on this huge limited series that follows five different characters within this massive earth shattering conspiracy. The problem is that for me to write this effectively, I have to venture out of my comfort zone and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines that I have very little understanding of. Specifically, I need to have a robust understanding of intel analysis work, black operations, how deep-state networks operate clandestinely, alien lore, and literature that has fact-based information about secret societies.\n\nThat's a tall order. But with knowledge graphs, I can literally take a massive book on anything, map it out on a canvas, tag, and connect the notes together. This forms a neurological structure of the book, itself, which means I can use AI (via native graph rag) to interact with this book for querying information and to utilize as a system for performing specific tasks for me.\n\nFor this project, I made a knowledge graph of an intel analysis book, an investigative journalist book, and Whitney Webb's books on the deep state. I still have many other books to map out, but in addition to this, I also made a knowledge graph of the Epstein Files. With all of these graphs connected directly to a chatbot that can understand their structures, I can use this to help me build the actual mechanics of the conspiracy so that it's conveyed in the most realistic way possible.\n\nHere's an overview of the mechanics of this grand conspiracy:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Grand Conspiracy: Operational Mechanics Overview\n\nThe entire operation hinges on the Helliwell Doctrine mentioned in \"The OSS and the 'Dirty Business'\" note: creating a \"Black Budget\" funded by illicit activities, making the conspiracy completely independent of any state oversight.\n\n1. The Intergenerational Secret Society (The Command Structure)\n\nThis is not a formal council that keeps minutes. It's a cellular structure built on mentorship and indoctrination, not written rules.\n\nSecrecy: Knowledge is passed down verbally from mentor to protégé. No incriminating documents exist. The primary rule is absolute denial.\n\nStructure: Think of it as a series of \"Super-Nodes\" like PAUL HELLIWELL, each responsible for a specific domain (finance, politics, intelligence). These nodes only interact with a few other trusted nodes. The lower-level assets and operators have no knowledge of the overall structure or endgame.\n\n2. The Psychopath Elite (Asset Recruitment & Control)\n\nThis is the human resources department. The goal is to identify individuals with the desired psychological profile (high ambition, low empathy) and make them assets before they even realize it.\n\nTalent Spotting: The network uses its influence in elite universities, financial institutions, and government agencies to spot promising candidates.\n\nThe Honey Trap & The Financial Trap: This is the Epstein model in action. Promising individuals are given access to circles of power and indulgence. They are encouraged to compromise themselves morally, ethically, or legally. Simultaneously, their careers are accelerated using the network's financial muscle (e.g., funding from a \"Proprietary\" entity like Epstein's Southern Trust).\n\nLeverage, Not Loyalty: The conspiracy does not demand loyalty; it manufactures leverage. Once an individual is compromised, they are an owned asset. They follow directives not out of belief, but out of fear of exposure.\n\n3. The Global Network (The Operational Infrastructure)\n\nThis is the physical and financial machinery. It's a web of legitimate-appearing businesses and institutions that function as fronts.\n\nThe \"Proprietary\" Entity: As the notes on Helliwell instruct, the network is built on shell companies, private banks (like Castle Bank & Trust), law firms, and logistics companies (like Air America). These entities perform the conspiracy's dirty work—moving money, people, and illicit goods—under the cover of legitimate business.\n\nThe \"Laundromat\" Principle: The network's banks are designed to mix state-sanctioned black budget money with organized crime profits until they are indistinguishable. This creates a massive, untraceable pool of funds to finance operations, from political campaigns to assassinations.\n\n4. Breeding Programs (Perpetuating the Bloodline)\n\nThis isn't about sci-fi labs. It's a sophisticated program of social and genetic engineering.\n\nStrategic Marriages: The children of core families are guided into unions that consolidate power, wealth, and, most importantly, the desired psychological traits.\n\nCurated Education: Offspring are sent to specific, network-controlled educational institutions where they are indoctrinated from a young age into the conspiracy's worldview and operational methods. The goal is to ensure the next generation is even more effective and ruthless than the last.\n\n5. Mind Control (Shaping the Narrative)\n\nThis is the psychological operations (psyops) wing. The goal is to manage the thoughts and behaviors of the general population to prevent them from ever discovering the truth.\n\nInformation Dominance: The network uses its financial power to acquire controlling stakes in major media companies, publishing houses, and tech firms. This allows them to subtly shape the news, entertainment, and online discourse.\n\nManufacturing Division: The most effective \"mind control\" is keeping the population divided and distracted. The network fuels culture wars, political polarization, and minor crises to ensure the public is too busy fighting each other to notice the steady consolidation of power happening behind the scenes.\n\n6. Advanced Technology (Maintaining the Edge)\n\nThe conspiracy maintains its power by ensuring it is always one step ahead technologically.\n\nPrivatizing Innovation: The network uses its assets within government and military research agencies to identify breakthrough technologies (AI, biotech, quantum computing) and privatize them through their proprietary corporate fronts before they ever reach the public domain.\n\nSurveillance & Espionage: This sequestered technology is used to power a private surveillance state, giving the conspiracy total information awareness and the ability to monitor its own members, its assets, and its enemies.\n\n7. One-World Government & Population Control (The Endgame)\n\nThe final goal is not achieved through a visible coup, but through the slow, methodical capture of existing institutions.\n\nInstitutional Capture: Over decades, the network places its \"owned\" assets (from Step 2) into key positions within national governments, central banks, and international bodies (UN, WHO, IMF).\n\nPolicy by Proxy: These institutions continue to function normally in the public eye, but their long-term policies (economic, social, military) are subtly guided by the conspiracy to weaken national sovereignty, consolidate global control, and implement population control measures disguised as public health initiatives or environmental policies. The power shift is complete long before the public is aware that it has even happened.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't use this information to generate prose. I use it to add as a note in the entire structure of the story so that when I go to write, I can have a guide to help me convey this complicated structure in a way that's easy for audiences to understand. So using AI with knowledge graphs can dramatically increase the usability of AI because it allows you to build it's memory and thus, how it functions and interacts with you.",

This works for quick answers, but it breaks down for complex, long-running, or high-accuracy work.\n\nAI performs far better when it is connected to **explicitly structured knowledge** such as a knowledge graph. The graph acts as external memory and context, allowing AI to retrieve, reason, and assist with far more precision.\n\nThe shift is from:\n- AI guessing context  \nto  \n- AI navigating defined relationships\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nChatbots infer meaning from prompts.\nKnowledge graphs define meaning ahead of time.\n\nThis reduces:\n- Hallucinations\n- Repetition\n- Context loss\n- Inconsistent outputs\n\nAnd improves:\n- Accuracy\n- Consistency\n- Reusability\n- Trustworthiness\n\n## Concrete Examples\n\n**Example 1 - Training and Consulting**\nA consultant maps business processes, terminology, and policies into a linked knowledge graph. AI is then used to answer staff questions using only that structured material, producing consistent answers aligned with company reality.\n\n**Example 2 - Research and Synthesis**\nA researcher links books, articles, and notes into a concept graph. AI queries the graph to compare ideas, surface gaps, and summarize positions without inventing unsupported claims.\n\n## How to Explain This Simply\n\n- A chatbot is a smart assistant with no filing system.\n- A knowledge graph gives AI a map of what matters and how things relate.\n- Better structure leads to better thinking, not just better writing.\n\n## When This Approach Is Worth It\n\n- Ongoing projects\n- Training programs\n- Business systems\n- Research-heavy work\n- Any domain where accuracy compounds over time\n\n## When It Is Overkill\n\n- One-off creative tasks\n- Simple Q and A\n- Disposable or short-lived work\n\n---\n\n## Bold Takeaways\n\n**AI is most powerful when generation comes after retrieval, not before.**\n\n**Structure beats clever prompting every time.**\n\n**Knowledge graphs turn AI from a chatbot into a reasoning partner.**\n\n## Related Notes\n\n- [[Retrieval Augmented Generation]]\n- [[AI Training Design Principles]]\n- [[Obsidian as an AI Knowledge System]]",

From my experience, Fiddl.art has been helpful because it keeps a few different models in one place, it’s pay-as-you-go instead of subscription, and you can earn some credits back if you post publicly. For some people, that setup just feels a bit more flexible for digital media work.\n\nThat said, Midjourney and Leonardo are also great tools, especially if you’re comfortable with subscription platforms. It really comes down to what feels right for how you like to work.",

There is no login required, it loads rapidly and you are immediately sent to character chat. The character selection is pretty vast, allowing you to experiment with different tones and use cases without causing any setup difficulty. I think it's good for casual conversation and light roleplaying. Although responses are generally understandable, depending on the nature and complexity of the query, they may feel a little generic, as is the case with many tools in this field.\n\nI am still trying to find out what makes one of these platforms worth sticking with over time. Memory? Character consistency? How does your response style change over time?\n\nWhen determining whether to maintain or remove an AI chat tool after a few sessions what factors do you use?",

I tend to use my primary models (like GPT for generation and Gemini for structured research), but I add a layer that helps me turn outputs into actionable checklists, clear steps, and follow-ups. For that layer I’ve found Nouswise really useful. It can take raw results and help refine them into prioritized tasks or organized summaries you can act on.  So instead of treating tools as isolated helpers, think about how to sequence them and refine outputs into practical steps. That’s often the difference between “AI gives an answer” and “AI helped me actually get the job done.”",
