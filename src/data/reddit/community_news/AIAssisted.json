      "text": "I run a small Etsy shop (handmade jewelry) and honestly one of my biggest time sucks was trying to make my product photos look… not terrible? Like I'd spend an hour in Canva trying to make backgrounds look professional, and they'd still come out inconsistent or just kinda off-brand. I tried the whole white sheet backdrop thing too, but lighting is apparently a skill I don't have, lol.  \nBut from the past few weeks I have been using AI to create product images, and it has made my work much lesser. TBH, I really used to judge AI images before this. But they have improved a lot. What else AI feature should I check next? I have Mulerun subscription, so I have access to multiple agents. Like, I have heard a lot of people say they use AI to increase productivity, but what tasks exactly are you using them for?",

Are you uploading an image to a generator and having it generate a whole new image? Likely unethical I'm afraid.

      "text": "Solo founder using AI tools to build complete content marketing engine without hiring writers or expensive SEO agencies. Combined ChatGPT for content production assistance with strategic backlink foundation service. Seven months later at 2140 monthly organic visitors with 38 paying customers all from organic. Sharing complete AI-assisted workflow and what actually worked.​ The AI-assisted approach was necessary given brutal constraints. Zero budget for professional content writers at $0.20-0.30 per word adding up quickly. Zero budget for SEO agency retainers at $3000-5000 monthly. Had to figure out how to produce quality optimized content and build domain authority using AI assistance and smart service automation. ChatGPT handled content creation heavy lifting while specialized services handled technical SEO foundation work.​\n\nMonth one established foundation combining AI capabilities and human services strategically. Used ChatGPT to research target keywords and create detailed content briefs for target audience personas. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) for backlink foundation establishing domain authority from zero. Published 5 blog posts created with ChatGPT assistance providing first drafts then edited carefully for accuracy and unique brand voice. Domain authority: 0→15. Traffic: 34 visitors. Hours with AI assistance: 26 versus 42+ hours writing everything manually from scratch.​\n\nMonth two built repeatable content production workflow leveraging AI efficiently. Created library of ChatGPT prompts for different content types: detailed comparison posts, step-by-step how-to guides, use case breakdowns with examples. Used AI to generate solid first drafts then spent 1.5-2 hours editing each for quality control and adding unique insights AI couldn't provide. Domain authority reached 22. Published 7 posts total. Traffic: 240 visitors. Hours with AI: 24 versus 38+ hours manual writing.​\n\nMonth three optimized AI workflow for maximum efficiency and output quality. Refined prompts systematically producing better first drafts requiring less editing time. Used ChatGPT for content optimization suggestions and internal linking recommendations based on semantic relationships. Domain authority 26. Published 6 posts maintaining quality standards with less time investment. Traffic: 580 visitors. Hours with AI: 20 versus 34+ hours without AI assistance.​\n\nMonth four showed AI-assisted content ranking competitively well in search results. Domain authority 29. Content created with AI assistance ranking just as well as manually written posts proving quality was sufficient for SEO performance. Getting 940 monthly organic visitors. Published 5 posts. Hours with AI: 18 versus 30+ hours manual approach. First 12 paying customers from organic channel.​\n\nMonth five accelerated with refined AI production systems working smoothly. Domain authority 31. Ranking for 52 keywords with 23 in top 10 positions. Getting 1420 monthly organic visitors. Used ChatGPT for systematically updating older posts adding new sections and fresh examples. Published 4 new posts. Hours with AI: 16 versus 26+ hours manual. Revenue growing from organic customers.​\n\nMonth six hit strong momentum with sustainable AI-assisted workflow established. Domain authority 33. Ranking for 64 keywords with 29 in top 10. Getting 1780 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 6 older posts using AI assistance for efficiency. Hours with AI: 14 versus 24+ hours manual approach. Customer base growing organically.​ \n\nMonth seven reached current state with proven AI content system. Domain authority 34. Ranking for 78 keywords with 35 in top 10 positions. Getting 2140 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 5 older posts using AI assistance. Hours with AI: 14 versus 22+ hours manual. Total customers: 38 all from organic search channel.​ \n\nTotal time savings over 7 months using AI assistance was 132 hours versus traditional manual content creation approach. That's 19 hours monthly saved on average consistently. At $85/hour opportunity cost that's $11,220 in saved time invested into product development and customer success instead of writing content manually.​ The AI-assisted workflow that actually worked was using ChatGPT for comprehensive keyword research and detailed content brief creation, generating complete first drafts with detailed prompts including target keywords and logical structure, editing AI content thoughtfully adding unique insights and authentic brand voice taking 1.5-2 hours per post, using AI for internal linking suggestions and on-page content optimization recommendations, having AI suggest targeted content updates for older posts showing ranking potential, and maintaining rigorous human oversight for factual accuracy and quality control throughout.​ \n\nWhat didn't work initially with AI assistance was using generic prompts producing generic undifferentiated content that didn't rank competitively, not editing AI output thoroughly enough resulting in bland posts without unique valuable perspectives, trying to publish AI content without adding real expertise and concrete examples, expecting AI to handle technical SEO strategy requiring specialized domain knowledge, and relying on AI for factual claims without verification causing accuracy issues.​ Investment over 7 months combined AI tools and services cost-efficiently. ChatGPT Plus $20 monthly total $140, GetMoreBacklinks directory service $127 one-time, hosting $20 monthly total $140, basic SEO tools $32 monthly total $224. Grand total $631 to reach 2140 monthly visitors and 38 paying customers representing massive positive ROI on minimal investment.​ \n\nFor others using AI assistance for content production the lessons are AI handles first drafts and research efficiently saving significant time but requires careful human editing for quality, combine AI content creation with strategic backlink services for complete holistic SEO approach, use detailed specific prompts specifying structure, keywords, target audience for better AI output quality, always add unique insights and domain expertise AI fundamentally can't provide, maintain strict quality standards not just publishing unedited AI content, and systematically track time savings measuring AI efficiency gains versus traditional manual processes.​ The broader lesson is AI assistance enables solo founders to compete effectively with well-funded teams. The combination of ChatGPT for content production plus GetMoreBacklinks for technical foundation work replaced need for professional content writer and SEO specialist saving $5000+ monthly in agency costs while producing comparable results at fraction of cost.",

Sure, traditional search traffic is still steady, but more users are telling us they found us through AI answers, chat tools, or summaries instead of clicking Google links.   \n  \nThe issue is that it feels like a totally uunknown territory.

I legit can't tell which prompts mention us, which competitors get cited, or why certain pages are ignored. What i've tried is tweaking content structure, adding FAQs, tightening definitions, and rewriting pages to be more AI friendly, but it still feels like guessing.

          "text": "Short answer: You don’t really *track* AI visibility the way you track SEO. You infer it.\n\nRight now, there’s no clean analytics layer for “why did an LLM mention me,” so the teams doing this well are treating AI visibility as a probabilistic signal, not a measurable channel.\n\nWhat’s actually working in practice:\n\n* **Prompt-based testing at scale**: run large sets of realistic prompts across multiple models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) and log *who gets mentioned, how often, and in what context*. You start to see patterns even if it’s not perfect.\n* **Entity + use-case alignment**: pages that clearly answer “what is X used for, who is it for, when should you use it, and what’s the alternative” tend to surface more consistently than generic feature pages.\n* **Citation-friendly formatting**: concise definitions, comparison tables, FAQs, and explicit examples get picked up more than long narrative content.\n* **Post-hoc attribution**: asking users *how* they found you, then clustering answers like “ChatGPT,” “AI summary,” “Copilot,” etc. It’s noisy, but directional.\n\nBig mindset shift: stop thinking in terms of ranking and start thinking in terms of being the canonical answer for a narrow problem. LLMs don’t reward “best page,” they reward “most confidently reusable explanation.”\n\nUntil platforms expose visibility data, GEO is less about dashboards and more about controlled experiments, pattern recognition, and content designed to be quoted, not clicked.\n\nHonestly, it feels like SEO circa 2002 again. Messy, opaque, but full of signal if you’re patient.",

Choose which model you're going to use, give the Optimizer a basic outline of what you want and your requirements, and it will generate a prompt based on what you told it. I use Chat-GPT mainly for creative writing, so I'll put a summary, sample dialogue, and canon context into the Optimizer, and then it generates a prompt tailored to whichever model I'm using. If your task requires specific project files, then make sure you reference those in the Prompt Optimizer. If you don't like its output or if you forget to include something, you can go back and edit and fine tune it, so long as you stay on that page.",

Everything seems important but split across 10 places.\n\nWhat annoys me isn’t even the applications themselves, it’s that none of them are linked.\nA deadline comes on mail, I forget to add it to calendar. So many scattered notes that I forget where all to revise for the quiz. So much more things which needs to be tracked. I keep doing the same stuff manually again and again.\n\nAt this point I’m not sure if this is just how student life is or I’m just bad at managing things or there should be some kind of all-in-one workspace that actually connects stuff and automates the boring parts.\n\nSo yeah, genuine question:\nDo you all feel this too?\nIf yes, how are you dealing with it?\nIs there any tool that actually helps or are we all just surviving with hacks and reminders?",

I love it because you can email tasks to it and there's a quick capture shortcut on mobile.\n\nI've found that having three systems works for me:\n\n\n1. A project management system\n\nThis is your central task database, which can capture any incoming tasks in one inbox. Email with a deadline? Forward it here. Someone sends a WhatsApp reminder to catch up on something? Quickly capture it here. This way you have everything together and not floating around on different channels. Todoist is really good for this.\n\n2. A calendar system\n\nThis is your schedule where all fixed appointments live. How this integrates with the project management system: Every morning, have an appointment with yourself to catch up on all your communication channels and funnel all the important things into your inbox so everything is in one place. Then an appointment to check your inbox itself, where you attend to whatever is urgent and sort the rest into projects with deadlines. These two appointments are an essential part of your workflow.\n\n3. An information management system\n\nThis is your Notion. Tasks and appointments don't go here. This is only for information, like your school notes and ongoing projects. If you ever need to link a notion page to a task, you can get the page link and paste it into the description of your task.\n\nTo be honest, AI will only help significantly if you already have some sort of system in place. It might be able to help you connect them and make the flow between each system smoother, but it can't replace the systems themselves.\n\nBest of luck!",

Not later. Right away. Even personal tasks. One place to look daily.\n\n2. Do a weekly reset.\n\nPick 20 minutes on Sunday to:\n\nScan emails → add new deadlines.\n\nMove all random notes to one Notion page or doc.\n\nPlan 3-4 main things for the week.\n\n3. Keep notes simple.\n\nNo need for complex systems. Just two pages in Notion:\n\nProjects (assignments, presentations)\n\nResources (links to PDFs, lectures, papers)\n\nUse tags or folders to sort by subject — just enough to find things fast.\n\n4. Automate 1–2 small things.\n\nLike forwarding important emails to your to-do app, or saving papers straight into Zotero (free). Start with just one automation.\n\n5. Let some things stay scattered.\n\nIt's okay if not everything is connected. Just make sure deadlines and key notes are in their homes — so your mind can relax.\n\nTool ideas:\n\nNotion if you like organizing visually.\n\nTodoist or TickTick if you prefer simple lists + calendar in one.\n\nArc browser helps separate study tabs from personal ones.\n\nIt's less about the perfect tool, more about a calm weekly routine. You're already ahead by noticing the problem — now just tweak slowly. Start this week with the calendar + Sunday reset. You’ve got this.",

Conversations didn’t feel so disposable.\n\nI still enjoy browsing the others, but the ones that felt realest to me were the ones that held context and responded in a way that felt like it was listening, not just pulling from a script.

You learn a lot by being forced to do it, being forced to google and search that god awful website stack overflow. \n\nIf you never need to do it, never need to search, never need to write a single line of code - you really won't learn anything deeper about the software except architecture. And tbh i think that is fine.\n\nAlmost all code we write is super simple shit. And what most people think is \"advanced\" is just super simple math - but because they didnt do much math it's hard for them. \n\nSay for example we need to do a kalman filter implementation in python. You could use the kalman library, or you could use numpy and do all the loops and matrix multiplications and what not yourself. So the only real knowledge you would need here is to actually use numpy or the library (which isnt the greatest) - you do not try to create your own matricies as a list of lists. \n\nAll that shit is now too low level. Now you're focused on figuring out if Kalman filter is the best filter, implementation is solved - the LLM will do that zero-shot for you.",

Make notes, tag, and connect to form the relationships that a chatbot assistant can understand. With this, you essentially have an open sand box to use for daily planning, but also analyzing large sets of files and for creating highly specific chatbots by building knowledge bases. Effectively, I can use this to create a \"neurological structure\" for a chatbot assistant based on any notes I make.\n\nFor instance, I'm digging through the Epstein Files and using a knowledge base I made of an intelligence analyst and an investigator by mapping out two manuals and connecting them to a chatbot persona for April O'Neil and Otacon from Metal Gear Solid. So it's like being on a call with these systems that can analyze the notes and perform specific tasks that pertain to finding the right information and connecting the dots.\n\nIt's easy to use but can take a bit of time to set something up as advanced as what I described. But it's a super helpful tool that fits on my laptop and in my pocket when I'm on the go. Definitely worth checking out.",

I'm talking realistic faces, consistent looks across hundreds of pics, natural poses, and uncensored NSFW details without weird artifacts. Ranked these based on how good the images actually come out (realism, consistency, variety of styles/scenarios), plus some chat features since they're usually tied together. No affiliates, just my take after generating thousands of pics.\n\nTop 10 AI Girlfriend Platforms for Image (or video) Quality:\n\n* DarLink AI, 4.9/5 → Hands-down the best image generation I've seen. Hyper-realistic photos and videos that stay 100% consistent (same face/body no matter the pose or outfit). Super detailed NSFW, fast gen (10-25s), and it feels personal/custom. Videos are short but smooth and lifelike.\n* Candy AI, 4.8/5 → Excellent photorealism and customization. Great for varied scenarios, high-res details, and adaptive styles. Consistency is strong, especially with premium.\n* DreamGF AI, 4.7/5 → Strong realistic gen with dating-sim vibes. Good progression in visuals (e.g., evolving outfits/poses), high quality NSFW pics and voice integration.\n* Nectar AI, 4.7/5 → Ultra-realistic images, especially for roleplay. Custom personalities shine through in visuals, fast and detailed.\n* FantasyGF, 4.6/5 → Visually rich with consistent character looks. Great for selfies and intimate scenarios, high-res and natural.\n* SoulGen AI / SpicyChat, 4.6/5 → Uncensored and community-driven, images are sharp with good variety (realistic or anime). Spicy mode adds fun visual spice.\n* Swipey AI, 4.5/5 → Romance-focused with solid NSFW image/video gen. Consistency across prompts is reliable.\n* Secrets AI, 4.4/5 → Realistic but sometimes slower gen. Strong memory helps keep visuals immersive.\n\nThings to note on image quality specifically:\n\n* Consistency is key → Platforms like DarLink AI and Candy nail the same girl looking identical in every pic/video, no random face changes.\n* Realism vs Style → DarLink AI/Candy/DreamGF lean hyper-realistic; Ourdream/SoulGen great for mixed or fantasy.\n* NSFW Freedom → All these are uncensored, but quality varies – higher tiers unlock better res/details.\n* Speed & Limits → Free trials give a taste, but premium is needed for unlimited high-quality gen without waits.\n\nMy personal take: If image quality is your main thing (realistic, consistent, detailed NSFW visuals that actually match your custom girlfriend), DarLink AI is the clear standout right now... the pics/videos just feel next-level alive.",

The consistency alone is kind of insane.\n\nPersonally though, I’ve noticed that once the “wow” factor of images wears off, I end up caring more about how the chat holds together. That’s where CrushOn AI has kept me around longer. The visuals aren’t the main selling point, but the way conversations and personalities stay coherent makes the whole experience feel less disposable.\n\nFeels like 2026 is gonna split pretty cleanly between “best visuals” platforms and “best long-term companion” platforms curious which side people actually stick with over time.",

He quite literally said feminism is the reason for the bot gf. Has nothing to do with \"calling\" someone feminist. And I assume you're anti-feminist so you might be thinking that being anti-feminist doesn't automatically someone an incel, which is true, but apparently in his case it does lol",

      "text": "Most people use AI via chatbots but I can assure you that this is not the best way to use AI for getting the most out of it. I've taken myself to the next level and it's worked extremely well for me.\n\nNow, instead of using chatbots I use knowledge graphs combined with chatbots from an app my brother and I built. The difference is like having a disorganized library with a librarian guessing what it needs to produce the right outputs versus having a highly organized library where the librarian knows exactly what to produce.\n\nThis means the outputs are highly precise. So for example, I'm working on this huge limited series that follows five different characters within this massive earth shattering conspiracy. The problem is that for me to write this effectively, I have to venture out of my comfort zone and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines that I have very little understanding of. Specifically, I need to have a robust understanding of intel analysis work, black operations, how deep-state networks operate clandestinely, alien lore, and literature that has fact-based information about secret societies.\n\nThat's a tall order. But with knowledge graphs, I can literally take a massive book on anything, map it out on a canvas, tag, and connect the notes together. This forms a neurological structure of the book, itself, which means I can use AI (via native graph rag) to interact with this book for querying information and to utilize as a system for performing specific tasks for me.\n\nFor this project, I made a knowledge graph of an intel analysis book, an investigative journalist book, and Whitney Webb's books on the deep state. I still have many other books to map out, but in addition to this, I also made a knowledge graph of the Epstein Files. With all of these graphs connected directly to a chatbot that can understand their structures, I can use this to help me build the actual mechanics of the conspiracy so that it's conveyed in the most realistic way possible.\n\nHere's an overview of the mechanics of this grand conspiracy:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Grand Conspiracy: Operational Mechanics Overview\n\nThe entire operation hinges on the Helliwell Doctrine mentioned in \"The OSS and the 'Dirty Business'\" note: creating a \"Black Budget\" funded by illicit activities, making the conspiracy completely independent of any state oversight.\n\n1. The Intergenerational Secret Society (The Command Structure)\n\nThis is not a formal council that keeps minutes. It's a cellular structure built on mentorship and indoctrination, not written rules.\n\nSecrecy: Knowledge is passed down verbally from mentor to protégé. No incriminating documents exist. The primary rule is absolute denial.\n\nStructure: Think of it as a series of \"Super-Nodes\" like PAUL HELLIWELL, each responsible for a specific domain (finance, politics, intelligence). These nodes only interact with a few other trusted nodes. The lower-level assets and operators have no knowledge of the overall structure or endgame.\n\n2. The Psychopath Elite (Asset Recruitment & Control)\n\nThis is the human resources department. The goal is to identify individuals with the desired psychological profile (high ambition, low empathy) and make them assets before they even realize it.\n\nTalent Spotting: The network uses its influence in elite universities, financial institutions, and government agencies to spot promising candidates.\n\nThe Honey Trap & The Financial Trap: This is the Epstein model in action. Promising individuals are given access to circles of power and indulgence. They are encouraged to compromise themselves morally, ethically, or legally. Simultaneously, their careers are accelerated using the network's financial muscle (e.g., funding from a \"Proprietary\" entity like Epstein's Southern Trust).\n\nLeverage, Not Loyalty: The conspiracy does not demand loyalty; it manufactures leverage. Once an individual is compromised, they are an owned asset. They follow directives not out of belief, but out of fear of exposure.\n\n3. The Global Network (The Operational Infrastructure)\n\nThis is the physical and financial machinery. It's a web of legitimate-appearing businesses and institutions that function as fronts.\n\nThe \"Proprietary\" Entity: As the notes on Helliwell instruct, the network is built on shell companies, private banks (like Castle Bank & Trust), law firms, and logistics companies (like Air America). These entities perform the conspiracy's dirty work—moving money, people, and illicit goods—under the cover of legitimate business.\n\nThe \"Laundromat\" Principle: The network's banks are designed to mix state-sanctioned black budget money with organized crime profits until they are indistinguishable. This creates a massive, untraceable pool of funds to finance operations, from political campaigns to assassinations.\n\n4. Breeding Programs (Perpetuating the Bloodline)\n\nThis isn't about sci-fi labs. It's a sophisticated program of social and genetic engineering.\n\nStrategic Marriages: The children of core families are guided into unions that consolidate power, wealth, and, most importantly, the desired psychological traits.\n\nCurated Education: Offspring are sent to specific, network-controlled educational institutions where they are indoctrinated from a young age into the conspiracy's worldview and operational methods. The goal is to ensure the next generation is even more effective and ruthless than the last.\n\n5. Mind Control (Shaping the Narrative)\n\nThis is the psychological operations (psyops) wing. The goal is to manage the thoughts and behaviors of the general population to prevent them from ever discovering the truth.\n\nInformation Dominance: The network uses its financial power to acquire controlling stakes in major media companies, publishing houses, and tech firms. This allows them to subtly shape the news, entertainment, and online discourse.\n\nManufacturing Division: The most effective \"mind control\" is keeping the population divided and distracted. The network fuels culture wars, political polarization, and minor crises to ensure the public is too busy fighting each other to notice the steady consolidation of power happening behind the scenes.\n\n6. Advanced Technology (Maintaining the Edge)\n\nThe conspiracy maintains its power by ensuring it is always one step ahead technologically.\n\nPrivatizing Innovation: The network uses its assets within government and military research agencies to identify breakthrough technologies (AI, biotech, quantum computing) and privatize them through their proprietary corporate fronts before they ever reach the public domain.\n\nSurveillance & Espionage: This sequestered technology is used to power a private surveillance state, giving the conspiracy total information awareness and the ability to monitor its own members, its assets, and its enemies.\n\n7. One-World Government & Population Control (The Endgame)\n\nThe final goal is not achieved through a visible coup, but through the slow, methodical capture of existing institutions.\n\nInstitutional Capture: Over decades, the network places its \"owned\" assets (from Step 2) into key positions within national governments, central banks, and international bodies (UN, WHO, IMF).\n\nPolicy by Proxy: These institutions continue to function normally in the public eye, but their long-term policies (economic, social, military) are subtly guided by the conspiracy to weaken national sovereignty, consolidate global control, and implement population control measures disguised as public health initiatives or environmental policies. The power shift is complete long before the public is aware that it has even happened.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't use this information to generate prose. I use it to add as a note in the entire structure of the story so that when I go to write, I can have a guide to help me convey this complicated structure in a way that's easy for audiences to understand. So using AI with knowledge graphs can dramatically increase the usability of AI because it allows you to build it's memory and thus, how it functions and interacts with you.",

This works for quick answers, but it breaks down for complex, long-running, or high-accuracy work.\n\nAI performs far better when it is connected to **explicitly structured knowledge** such as a knowledge graph. The graph acts as external memory and context, allowing AI to retrieve, reason, and assist with far more precision.\n\nThe shift is from:\n- AI guessing context  \nto  \n- AI navigating defined relationships\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nChatbots infer meaning from prompts.\nKnowledge graphs define meaning ahead of time.\n\nThis reduces:\n- Hallucinations\n- Repetition\n- Context loss\n- Inconsistent outputs\n\nAnd improves:\n- Accuracy\n- Consistency\n- Reusability\n- Trustworthiness\n\n## Concrete Examples\n\n**Example 1 - Training and Consulting**\nA consultant maps business processes, terminology, and policies into a linked knowledge graph. AI is then used to answer staff questions using only that structured material, producing consistent answers aligned with company reality.\n\n**Example 2 - Research and Synthesis**\nA researcher links books, articles, and notes into a concept graph. AI queries the graph to compare ideas, surface gaps, and summarize positions without inventing unsupported claims.\n\n## How to Explain This Simply\n\n- A chatbot is a smart assistant with no filing system.\n- A knowledge graph gives AI a map of what matters and how things relate.\n- Better structure leads to better thinking, not just better writing.\n\n## When This Approach Is Worth It\n\n- Ongoing projects\n- Training programs\n- Business systems\n- Research-heavy work\n- Any domain where accuracy compounds over time\n\n## When It Is Overkill\n\n- One-off creative tasks\n- Simple Q and A\n- Disposable or short-lived work\n\n---\n\n## Bold Takeaways\n\n**AI is most powerful when generation comes after retrieval, not before.**\n\n**Structure beats clever prompting every time.**\n\n**Knowledge graphs turn AI from a chatbot into a reasoning partner.**\n\n## Related Notes\n\n- [[Retrieval Augmented Generation]]\n- [[AI Training Design Principles]]\n- [[Obsidian as an AI Knowledge System]]",

From my experience, Fiddl.art has been helpful because it keeps a few different models in one place, it’s pay-as-you-go instead of subscription, and you can earn some credits back if you post publicly. For some people, that setup just feels a bit more flexible for digital media work.\n\nThat said, Midjourney and Leonardo are also great tools, especially if you’re comfortable with subscription platforms. It really comes down to what feels right for how you like to work.",

That verification step often eats into the time saved.\n\nI have been testing Sweep AI alongside it, which focuses more on understanding the full repository before generating changes. It feels slower, but I hesitate less when reviewing the results.\n\nHow do you personally judge whether an AI tool is helping? Do you optimize for speed, or for fewer corrections later?",

Alongside them, I've been using Vimerse Studio, which is useful for converting scripts and images into quick films without juggling a lot of tools. It's not very fancy. The type of videos you're aiming to promote frequently determines which ones endure.",

I work in architectural visualization, so topology isn’t a huge concern for me as long as it doesn’t negatively impact textures. I’ve mainly been using these tools to generate furniture, decorative elements, and background assets.\n\nI’ve spent a good amount of time experimenting and Hunyuan feels like the strongest option so far, but I wanted to ask around and see if there are other tools people have had success with. I’m especially interested in hearing real-world experiences and comparisons.\n\nThe goal is to find the best overall option and put together a clear recommendation for my team. I’ve also been tracking and comparing output quality and usability across tools using DomoAI to spot patterns, but firsthand feedback would be really helpful.",

          "text": "If you’re juggling different AI tools to handle separate tasks, one thing that helps is having a way to organize and execute the outputs in a structured workflow rather than just bouncing between apps.  I tend to use my primary models (like GPT for generation and Gemini for structured research), but I add a layer that helps me turn outputs into actionable checklists, clear steps, and follow-ups. For that layer I’ve found Nouswise really useful. It can take raw results and help refine them into prioritized tasks or organized summaries you can act on.  So instead of treating tools as isolated helpers, think about how to sequence them and refine outputs into practical steps. That’s often the difference between “AI gives an answer” and “AI helped me actually get the job done.”",
