      "text": "Most AI-assisted SEO workflows solve half the problem. Here's what solving both halves looked like.\n\nBuilt an AI interior design tool earlier this year. Standard post-launch story great product, invisible online. 300 daily visitors after 60 days of consistent social posting and Reddit engagement. Only 4 paying customers. The tool worked. Nobody was finding it.\n\nDecided to build a proper AI-assisted growth workflow instead of just posting more content manually. Set up a blogging agent using ChatGPT and n8n that automatically publishes 2 high-quality posts daily targeting specific search queries. Simultaneously ran a directory submission campaign through [link building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to build the domain authority layer that makes AI content actually rank. Added FAQ pages, comparison pages, and use case content. Launched on Product Hunt. Scheduled social distribution through Postbridge.\n\n60 days later traffic went from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. The AI content agent handled velocity. The directory submission layer handled credibility. Removing either one slows the whole system down.\n\nThe insight for AI-assisted SEO specifically: LLM-generated content quality is no longer the bottleneck. Domain authority is. An AI agent publishing 60 posts a month to a DR 0 domain is producing content Google has no reason to surface. The authority layer has to scale alongside the content layer.\n\nWhat AI-assisted workflows are you running for SEO and what's the biggest bottleneck you're hitting?",

Add captions, use templates, make quick edits. If you want to post videos but don't know where to start, start here.\n\n**2. HeyGen / ClipTalk:** Both make AI avatar videos so you don't need to be on camera. ClipTalk is great for TikTok and Shorts. Just type your script and it makes a video. HeyGen is better for corporate stuff like training and onboarding videos. More polished, more professional.\n\n**3. Perplexity:** We use this instead of Google. It finds info fast and shows where it came from. Great for checking competitors, finding trends, and getting ideas.\n\n**4. Claude:** Our go-to AI for writing. Blog posts, strategy docs, brainstorming, brand voice. The output sounds like a real person wrote it.\n\n  \n**5. ExoClaw:** This one is new and we are still finding out its full power. But so far it does a lot. You create AI agents that work for you 24/7. They watch competitors, do research, run automations, and more. The setup takes just a few minutes. We keep finding new ways to use it every week.\n\n\n\nThe market has been shifting pretty quickly so I’m always testing new options.",

In simple terms, local deployment just means running your software on your own computer or an office system instead of putting it online. You usually only need one dedicated machine, the basic software your app depends on, and a way to back up your data. Local deployment is fine if it’s only for internal use, but if you plan to scale or allow remote access later, cloud might be easier. I’d suggest starting small with a basic local setup and learning how to start, stop, and back up the app. You don’t need deep technical knowledge — just clear steps. Hope this helps 🙂",
