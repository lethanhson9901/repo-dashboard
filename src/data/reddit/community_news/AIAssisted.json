      "text": "Genuine question - professional headshot photographers still charge $300-600 per session even though generative AI can create professional-looking headshots for under $50 in minutes.\n\nThe technology has clearly advanced to where most people can't reliably distinguish AI-generated headshots from real photos anymore. I've seen examples from tools like [Looktara](http://looktara.com/) where the quality is indistinguishable from traditional photography.\n\nSo why hasn't this industry been disrupted yet? Is it just lack of awareness that these tools exist, or are there quality/authenticity concerns that keep people paying 10x more for traditional photographers ?\n\nFrom a generative AI perspective, what's preventing complete market displacement here? Technical limitations, social acceptance, or something else entirely?",

I can already draft marketing proposals with a full creative treatment much faster now than I could without AI. It still needs a lot of hand holding and if I wasn’t already aware of the specifics of the job I would not get results. I foresee a world where professionals use their skillset to efficiently  prompt  an ai to build a skeleton that they can build on and iterate quickly. Also you will 100% see new photographer with knowledge of angles, lighting, colour etc add inexpensive AI assisted photography to their menu. They will be professionally touched up finished and printed etc and will look amazing. My agency is already using digital images and video generation to replace hours of test shoots and it’s making us extremely competitive. Normally you need hours of camera time to get even a few early prototypes instead we take one or two good pictures of someone with their permission and generate rotational data and video then pull the frames we want so when we get our proposal accepted we know exactly what actual shot we need saving almost tens of thousands in camera time per project.(depending on the project).",

Spent hours on prompts but the facial likeness was terrible - looked polished but didn't resemble me at all.\n\nAlmost gave up and booked a $500 photographer session when I found [Looktara](http://looktara.com), a specialized AI headshot tool. Cost $40, took 10 minutes, and the facial accuracy was dramatically better than ChatGPT because it's trained specifically for headshot generation rather than general image creation.\n\nThis made me realize the AI ecosystem is fragmenting into specialized vertical tools that outperform general models for specific use cases. Saved me $460 and got better results than trying to force ChatGPT to do something it's not optimized for.\n\nSeeing this pattern across multiple domains now - general LLMs for reasoning and coordination, specialized AI for tasks requiring domain expertise.

      "text": "Went all-in on AI content generation for a new project last month. Used ChatGPT to write 20 optimized blog posts in one week. Added proper headers, optimized for keywords, made sure everything read naturally. Published them all and waited for traffic. Nothing happened. Week two, still nothing. Week three, maybe 15 visitors total across all 20 posts.\n\nThe problem wasn't the AI content quality. ChatGPT actually did a solid job writing helpful, readable posts. The problem was my domain had zero authority so Google didn't care how good the content was. No trust signals meant no rankings regardless of quality. Fixed this by building domain authority before generating more AI content. Used [manual directory submission tool to submit the site to 200+ directories to establish baseline trust with Google](http://getmorebacklinks.org). This part took an hour to set up, then ran automatically while I kept using AI for content.\n\nFirst three weeks after submission looked the same. Directory listings went live but those 20 blog posts still weren't ranking. Search Console showed increasing crawl frequency though, which meant Google was starting to pay attention. Week four through six is when everything changed. Domain authority moved from zero to 20. All 20 of those AI-generated posts suddenly started appearing in search results. New posts I published with ChatGPT showed up within days instead of sitting invisible for weeks.\n\nNow getting 500 organic visitors per month and it's climbing. The AI workflow is finally producing actual results because the foundation is in place. I can research a topic, generate an outline, write the post, and publish in under an hour instead of a full day. The interesting lesson is how AI and SEO work together. AI helps you create content 10x faster and maintain consistency, but it can't build the external signals that make Google trust your domain. You need both working together.\n\nStarted tracking time saved with the AI workflow. Before AI and authority building, one post took 4 hours to write and didn't rank. Now one post takes 45 minutes to write with AI assistance and ranks within a week because the domain foundation is solid. The AI-assisted SEO lesson is that tools and content generation are only half the equation. You can have perfectly written AI content, but without domain authority backing it up, you're just creating invisible pages faster.​",

Most of these tools are trained to make text sound “correct” or generic, so all the little quirks that make your writing sound like you get ironed out. A couple things that can help: try feeding the AI larger samples of your own writing to reference, or do a light first draft with AI and then go back and intentionally add back your personal touches. Some folks use AI just for structure, then rewrite sections in their own voice.\n\nYou can use Atom Writer for this since it lets you actually train the AI on your own style and builds in human review before content goes live. That way, you don’t lose those weird sentences and pacing that make your voice unique. But regardless of tool, keeping a part of the process manual usually helps preserve that personal feel.",

I found a few that are pretty good.\n\nOne is ACE Studio, a professional AI tool suitable for music majors. It’s not just as simple as one-click song generation; it’s a whole AI creative lineup that helps me with production, arranging, lyric writing, etc. The downside is the annual subscription, which is a bit expensive for students.\n\nFreebeat has a music video agent feature that’s quite interesting. It doesn't just generate random visuals; it can build a complete video based on the structure and rhythm of the song. This makes going from a song to something watchable very simple, without needing too much manual adjustment.\n\nWith MuseScore, I can take a photo of a part of a music score and immediately hear the playback to know what it sounds like.\n\nRhymeZone and Thesaurus can be used to help with writing lyrics. You can also look into rhyme schemes so that your lyrics aren't just an ABAB structure.\n\nJust sharing in case others here are also looking into ai music tools. So what you guys think and what other generators you’ve found worth using.",

Finding anything specific usually meant opening random folders and scrubbing through timelines manually. It felt backwards that I could ask an LLM to write code, but I couldn't ask my Mac what was inside my own files.\n\nSo I built a local multimodal AI agent to fix this.\n\nInstead of relying on filenames, it runs local models on your Mac (M-series for now, working on others!) to \"watch\" and \"listen\" to your files in the background. It builds a semantic index completely offline.\n\n**The Workflow Shift:**\n\n* Old way: Remember vague filename -> Open folder -> Scrub timeline -> Give up.\n* AI Assisted way: Type \"Whiteboard discussion about pricing\" -> AI jumps to the exact timestamp.\n\n**The Technical Specs:**\n\n* 100% Offline: I'm a privacy nut, so no data leaves your device.\n* Multimodal: It uses embeddings to understand visual context (objects, scenes) + audio transcription.\n* Non-destructive: It doesn't rename or move your files; it just creates a smart layer on top of them.\n\nSo I'm trying to figure out where this fits in the broader \"AI Stack.\" Do you prefer AI tools that live in the cloud (like Gemini/Claude) for analysis, or are you looking for more Local AI tools to manage privacy?\n\nI'm looking for early testers. To be honest, we built it initially for video editors or creators who have huge media files , but I'm curious if this fits anyone else's workflow?\n\nIf you have a messy drive full of videos and want to test if this local AI can actually make sense of it, drop a comment and I'll DM you the link.\n\n(Also, open to roasting.

          "text": "Totally agree, most AI-generated ads sound super bland and it’s a real problem for agencies who want each brand to actually stand out. Part of it is that a lot of the AI writing tools are trained on the same giant datasets, so you end up with that copy-paste corporate tone unless you spend a lot of time editing. One thing that helps is building a detailed brand voice guide, with actual examples of what “on-brand” copy looks like, and then using that as a reference for every draft, AI or not. Also, using a platform like Atom Writer can help since it lets you train the AI on your own brand voice and then keeps everything consistent across your team, plus you still get to review and tweak before anything goes live. Sometimes it’s worth setting up a team review process just to catch anything that slipped through and sounds robotic. Basically, AI is a tool, but it really needs human oversight and customization to avoid that generic feel.",

I use it to help understanding subjects and clarifying possible questions that arise when going through material. In everyday life, I've also used it for short questions I just wanted a quick answer to or for example if I want to mash two pictures together or generate visual ideas to a tattoo artist.  \nFor all of this, I was willing to pay for the ChatGPT plus. As of late, I have heard a few things about it possibly falling behind in terms of quality, compared to some of the other AI-models that are available.\n\nHow true is this?  \nAnd which AI-model would you recommend me to use?  \nStay with ChatGPT?  \nSwitch to Claude? Gemini? Wolfram Alpha? Another entirely?\n\nAny help is great and appreciated!",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I do a lot of international client calls and cross-border meetings for work, so keeping track of details has always been a bit of a headache. I recently tested three AI voice recorders, TicNote, Plaud, and Soundcore, to see if they could help me manage notes, translations, and follow-ups more efficiently.\n\nSoundcore is very small and easy to carry around. It works fine for recording, and the transcription is basic, which is okay for simple conversations. However, when multiple people are talking, or if someone has a strong accent, the text isn’t always accurate. It’s lightweight and convenient for quick recordings, but for international calls, I found myself double-checking a lot.\n\nPlaud feels more like a polished, premium device. The summaries are neat, and you can mark key points during recording, which is nice. It’s solid for structured meetings or lectures, and it has a lot of templates for organizing notes afterward. That said, the AI transcription isn’t as flexible for multiple languages, and it’s mostly post-recording, so you don’t get real-time guidance.\n\nTicNote, on the other hand, has been a game-changer for my work. The recording quality is consistently clear, even in busy conference calls. Its AI transcription is fast and accurate, and the real standout feature for me is real-time transcription combined with translation. I can have conversations in different languages, see the text instantly, and get a live translation, basically turning it into a mini translation assistant. The AI summaries also focus on key points, so I spend less time reviewing and more time following up on what matters.\n\nIn the end, all three devices can record and transcribe, but for my international work:\n\nSoundcore is okay for light, quick recordings but not reliable for detailed meetings.\n\nPlaud is nice if you want structured notes and post-recording summaries, but it’s less versatile for live translation or multilingual calls.\n\nTicNote handles real-world, multilingual meetings the best, with strong transcription, live translation, and AI summaries, exactly what I need for work.",

Claude and gemini on the other hand have been consistent when there's a new update you know what your getting. Long context they work. They are simple. \n\n\nGrok on the other hand. Weird pricing. Expensive. Super heavy heavy expert coding what? What even are these models it's as confusing as gpt mini o and random numbers. \n\nAnd when I use it it always feels inconsistent for example for story writing sometimes it's perfectly fine with most nsfw stuff suddenly mid writing \"sorry can't do that or continue\" what? \n\nThe quality is mixed. Sometimes it gives good answers sometimes it feels like Google search answer the little ai popup. \nWhen I use thinking it's slow when expert or such nodes it basically only searches 200 tweets and websites \n\nIts not that good free. Its not that consistent it feels like a confused gpt. Like somewhere between but slightly worse than gemini and Claude. \n\nDoes anyone here use grok consistently personally or professionally? Or is it just me. Again my primary issue is lack of consistency and the weird way it behaves. ",

      "text": "I need help having AI find images on the web (specifically images on wikimedia) based on specific criteria like keyword, minimum image resolution, time period, type of image, etc. Also the amount of images i need range from 60-80. Ik this is quite specific but i make long form history videos on youtube and manual searching takes hours. I've tried a variety of things asking chat gpt and Gemini but they frequently hallucinate links, especially gemeni. Lately ive been using google collab to have the gemeni in there create a 4 step Process.\n\n1. Give keywords to gemeni to reinterpret for best results. Example: **Ottoman battle 15th century**=battle of kosovo, 1444 battle of varna, 15th century ottoman army, etc\n\n2. Have a python script download image's from wikimedia that match my specific criteria. Minimum resolution, aspect ration, painting or photo( this step is to cast a wide but not too wide net of images for the next step)\n\n3. Have gemeni parse through these results using its ability to see images to make sure they are keyword appropriate. (I've come to realize that asking AI to do step 2 leads to it not being able to do many images or just hallucinating. However is ai capable of looking through a fixed number of images say 200 or is that to much)\n\n4. lastly i have gemeni in google collab create a GUI that presents the chosen images by keyword, allowing me to multiselect download them\n\nThe issue i've been having is that something goes wrong in step 2 where the images selected are not what i'm looking form despite there being images on wikimedia that match my criteria.\n\nSo what advice or guidance could you guys give me for this sort of project/whatever this is. **I'm open to just about anything to help me do this.**",

The model cannot perform semantic searching because it lacks the ability to filter content through semantic methods at large volumes. Step 2 requires you to use Wikimedia's API combined with structured metadata which includes categories and captions and creator details and the date for aggressive filtering before any vision model processes the images. The vision model should only validate a small group of 20 to 50 items. Models can review images, but 200 is pushing it and accuracy drops fast. You should use AI as a verification tool instead of making it your main selection method.",
