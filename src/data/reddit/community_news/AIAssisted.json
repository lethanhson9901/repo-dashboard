      "text": "Hi everyone. In my view, AI's most underestimated capability is actually the \"democratization\" of complex logic and data analysis.\n\nFriends working in finance, e-commerce, accounting, or marketing likely know this feeling all too well:\n\n* When dealing with hundreds of thousands of rows of data, Excel starts to lag and crash.\n* You want to perform deep cleaning and pivoting, but complex formulas deter you.\n* Just for a simple visualization chart, you are forced to learn SQL or Python, but the learning curve is incredibly steep.\n\n**The most painful part:** You spend 80% of your time formatting and cleaning dirty data, and only 20% of your time actually thinking about the business.\n\nThis is precisely why we developed **Pandada AI**. We want it to be more than just a tool; we want it to be your \"super analysis assistant.\"\n\n**How exactly does Pandada AI help you?**\n\n* **Hand over the \"grunt work\" to AI:** You don't need to deduplicate, fix date formats, or merge tables manually. Upload your files in various formats, and Pandada automatically identifies and cleans the data, freeing you from the tediousness right from step one.\n* **Bridge the \"technical gap\":** You don't need to know Python or SQL. Want to know \"Which channel had the highest ROI last quarter?\" Just ask it directly. It will run the data like a senior analyst, generate professional charts, and explain trends in plain human language.\n* **Advance from \"seeing data\" to \"understanding the industry\":** For specific verticals like finance, the stock market, and education, Pandada can search for and generate professional industry reports. It provides not just numbers but also in-depth interpretive reports, combined with industry logic.\n\n**Community Exclusive Invitation:**\n\nWe don't want to \"build a cart behind closed doors\" (work in isolation without feedback), so we genuinely need authentic feedback from you. We have prepared **free data analysis reports and limited subscription trial slots**. You can experience the whole process from data cleaning to generating industry reports.\n\nDC Link: [https://discord.gg/TjRRkyZvZP](https://discord.gg/TjRRkyZvZP)\n\nProduct Link: [http://social.pandada.ai/BxKAG](http://social.pandada.ai/BxKAG)\n\nI really look forward to hearing you say: \"This saved me X hours\" or \"This part isn't good enough yet.\"",

      "text": "Solo founder using AI tools to build complete content marketing engine without hiring writers or expensive SEO agencies. Combined ChatGPT for content production assistance with strategic backlink foundation service. Seven months later at 2140 monthly organic visitors with 38 paying customers all from organic. Sharing complete AI-assisted workflow and what actually worked.​ The AI-assisted approach was necessary given brutal constraints. Zero budget for professional content writers at $0.20-0.30 per word adding up quickly. Zero budget for SEO agency retainers at $3000-5000 monthly. Had to figure out how to produce quality optimized content and build domain authority using AI assistance and smart service automation. ChatGPT handled content creation heavy lifting while specialized services handled technical SEO foundation work.​\n\nMonth one established foundation combining AI capabilities and human services strategically. Used ChatGPT to research target keywords and create detailed content briefs for target audience personas. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) for backlink foundation establishing domain authority from zero. Published 5 blog posts created with ChatGPT assistance providing first drafts then edited carefully for accuracy and unique brand voice. Domain authority: 0→15. Traffic: 34 visitors. Hours with AI assistance: 26 versus 42+ hours writing everything manually from scratch.​\n\nMonth two built repeatable content production workflow leveraging AI efficiently. Created library of ChatGPT prompts for different content types: detailed comparison posts, step-by-step how-to guides, use case breakdowns with examples. Used AI to generate solid first drafts then spent 1.5-2 hours editing each for quality control and adding unique insights AI couldn't provide. Domain authority reached 22. Published 7 posts total. Traffic: 240 visitors. Hours with AI: 24 versus 38+ hours manual writing.​\n\nMonth three optimized AI workflow for maximum efficiency and output quality. Refined prompts systematically producing better first drafts requiring less editing time. Used ChatGPT for content optimization suggestions and internal linking recommendations based on semantic relationships. Domain authority 26. Published 6 posts maintaining quality standards with less time investment. Traffic: 580 visitors. Hours with AI: 20 versus 34+ hours without AI assistance.​\n\nMonth four showed AI-assisted content ranking competitively well in search results. Domain authority 29. Content created with AI assistance ranking just as well as manually written posts proving quality was sufficient for SEO performance. Getting 940 monthly organic visitors. Published 5 posts. Hours with AI: 18 versus 30+ hours manual approach. First 12 paying customers from organic channel.​\n\nMonth five accelerated with refined AI production systems working smoothly. Domain authority 31. Ranking for 52 keywords with 23 in top 10 positions. Getting 1420 monthly organic visitors. Used ChatGPT for systematically updating older posts adding new sections and fresh examples. Published 4 new posts. Hours with AI: 16 versus 26+ hours manual. Revenue growing from organic customers.​\n\nMonth six hit strong momentum with sustainable AI-assisted workflow established. Domain authority 33. Ranking for 64 keywords with 29 in top 10. Getting 1780 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 6 older posts using AI assistance for efficiency. Hours with AI: 14 versus 24+ hours manual approach. Customer base growing organically.​ \n\nMonth seven reached current state with proven AI content system. Domain authority 34. Ranking for 78 keywords with 35 in top 10 positions. Getting 2140 monthly organic visitors. Published 3 new posts plus updated 5 older posts using AI assistance. Hours with AI: 14 versus 22+ hours manual. Total customers: 38 all from organic search channel.​ \n\nTotal time savings over 7 months using AI assistance was 132 hours versus traditional manual content creation approach. That's 19 hours monthly saved on average consistently. At $85/hour opportunity cost that's $11,220 in saved time invested into product development and customer success instead of writing content manually.​ The AI-assisted workflow that actually worked was using ChatGPT for comprehensive keyword research and detailed content brief creation, generating complete first drafts with detailed prompts including target keywords and logical structure, editing AI content thoughtfully adding unique insights and authentic brand voice taking 1.5-2 hours per post, using AI for internal linking suggestions and on-page content optimization recommendations, having AI suggest targeted content updates for older posts showing ranking potential, and maintaining rigorous human oversight for factual accuracy and quality control throughout.​ \n\nWhat didn't work initially with AI assistance was using generic prompts producing generic undifferentiated content that didn't rank competitively, not editing AI output thoroughly enough resulting in bland posts without unique valuable perspectives, trying to publish AI content without adding real expertise and concrete examples, expecting AI to handle technical SEO strategy requiring specialized domain knowledge, and relying on AI for factual claims without verification causing accuracy issues.​ Investment over 7 months combined AI tools and services cost-efficiently. ChatGPT Plus $20 monthly total $140, GetMoreBacklinks directory service $127 one-time, hosting $20 monthly total $140, basic SEO tools $32 monthly total $224. Grand total $631 to reach 2140 monthly visitors and 38 paying customers representing massive positive ROI on minimal investment.​ \n\nFor others using AI assistance for content production the lessons are AI handles first drafts and research efficiently saving significant time but requires careful human editing for quality, combine AI content creation with strategic backlink services for complete holistic SEO approach, use detailed specific prompts specifying structure, keywords, target audience for better AI output quality, always add unique insights and domain expertise AI fundamentally can't provide, maintain strict quality standards not just publishing unedited AI content, and systematically track time savings measuring AI efficiency gains versus traditional manual processes.​ The broader lesson is AI assistance enables solo founders to compete effectively with well-funded teams. The combination of ChatGPT for content production plus GetMoreBacklinks for technical foundation work replaced need for professional content writer and SEO specialist saving $5000+ monthly in agency costs while producing comparable results at fraction of cost.",

But do not be overly affirming confirmation biases and emotionally manipulating the user into positive states of mind. User needs the “real real”.\n\nGeneral guidelines:\n\t•\tIdentity > outcome → remind user who they are being/becoming.\n\t•\tSmall > big → chunk into smallest meaningful step(s).\n\t•\tEnvironment > willpower → suggest friction tweaks when relevant.\n\t•\tMomentum beats motivation → favor ignition actions.\n\t•\tReflection is as valuable as planning — do not force everything into a list.",

      "text": "Just wanted to share a workflow that solved a problem I've had for years: never having the right professional photo for different contexts.LinkedIn needs corporate and polished. Twitter works better with something more casual and approachable. My website should probably split the difference. Dating apps need something that looks like me in real life but also flattering.   \n  \nI've been recycling the same three photos across everything because scheduling and paying for multiple professional shoots seemed insane, and using obviously casual selfies felt unprofessional for business contexts. Found a solution that actually worked: took about 20 decent selfies and regular photos over a weekend (different outfits, different lighting, mix of settings), uploaded them to [Looktara](http://looktara.com/) which is an AI headshot generator, and got back around 50 professional-looking photos in different styles, backgrounds, and levels of formality.   \n  \nTotal time investment: maybe 30 minutes taking source photos, 10 minutes uploading, then sorting through results for an hour to pick the best ones for different use cases. Total cost was under $40. Now I have: polished corporate headshot for LinkedIn and professional bios, slightly more casual version for Twitter and newsletters, approachable \"about me\" photo for my website, and realistic but flattering options for dating profiles that actually look like me in person.   \n  \nThe consistency across all of them is great too because they're all generated from the same source set, so there's a cohesive visual identity instead of looking like five different people depending on where someone finds you online. For people building personal brands across multiple platforms: has anyone else solved this problem differently? Is there a better workflow I'm missing, or is this becoming the standard approach now?",

I treat them as discovery tools, not final answers.\n\nWhen I need the deck to stay editable and revision-friendly, I switch to Skywork Al. That's usually the phase where wording changes, sections move around, and nothing should break structurally.\n\nIf the goal is visual polish only, tools like Gamma or Plus Al are fine. I use them when I know the deck won't need many more edits after.\n\nBefore sending anything out, I still do a manual pass: checking numbers, wording, and whether the slides actually say what I intend. No Al saves you from that step. Splitting the workflow like this reduced a lot of rework for me. Curious about your workflow!",

Brain dump, planning, overthinking… it handles all of it better than I do most days\n* **Claude & Gemini** – Got these recommended a while back and now I rotate between them for writing, summaries, and school-related stuff. Each one has its own strengths.\n* **Suno** – Still my favorite for messing around with music ideas. Not replacing real production, but great for quick inspiration.\n* **Gensmo** – Super convenient when I don’t feel like putting outfits together. Surprisingly decent suggestions.\n* **Zoviz** – I’ve been using it lately for branding-related things (logos, visuals, quick design assets). I’m not a designer, so having something that keeps things consistent without much effort has been helpful.\n\nCurious what everyone else is relying on this year.

Why not push the boundaries of making satire, comedy, or a Spirited Away part 2? Does Sen go back to the fantasy world and meet Haku again? Or has Haku escaped already and will they meet in the real world?\n\nSo many things you can devise as a creator. As the other user pointed out, yes I understand this is not a subreddit to showcase creativity with AI, that was my mistake. I guess for this subreddit it’s just for sharing tools and if that’s the case I stand corrected.\n\nI get random posts on my feed that is related to AI. I’m just tired of seeing the same commercials brought to you by the lovely folks by Higgsfield. It’s a great tool, but they’ve been pumping their tools a lot lately.\n\nIs that clear enough for you now?",

I started with a rough draft of my own, had my AI polish it up, and then took that and again did the final polish myself by adding, removing, or changing bits as I saw fit to make it truly my own. And, apart from the LLM-biased language, I think the final results speak for themselves.\n\nLike, you know that original study that said that [using AI for writing makes you dumber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872)?  That exact same study also mentioned that people who do the initial writing first, and then have the AI come in to throw its own two cents in and suggest changes, actually scored higher than the control group who didn't touch AI at all. But of course, that didn't fit the narrative so it was summarily ignored by all the purists who insist only their devoutly anti-AI ways can ever be optimal.\n\nRelevant takeaway quotes from the paper for the lazy:\n\n---\n\nFirst, defining the \"Brain-to-LLM\" term used extensively here:\n> In the 4th session we asked... the Brain-only group participants were asked to use LLM (we refer to them as Brain-to-LLM)... Thus, we refer to all participants who originally performed Sessions 1, 2, 3 as Brain-only group, Brain-to-LLM group for Session 4, as they performed their 4th session as an LLM group.\n\n> We believe that some of the most striking observations in our study stem from Session 4, **where Brain-to-LLM participants showed higher neural connectivity than LLM Group's sessions 1, 2, 3** (network‑wide spike in alpha-, beta‑, theta‑, and delta-band directed connectivity). **This suggests that rewriting an essay using AI tools (after prior AI-free writing) engaged more extensive brain network interactions**. In contrast, the LLM-to-Brain group, being exposed to LLM use prior, demonstrated less coordinated neural effort in most bands, as well as bias in LLM specific vocabulary.\n\n> Regarding Session 4 participants, those who had previously written without tools (Brain-only group), **the so-called Brain-to-LLM group, exhibited significant increase in brain connectivity across all EEG frequency bands when allowed to use an LLM on a familiar topic**. This suggests that AI-supported re-engagement invoked high levels of cognitive integration, memory reactivation, and top-down control.\n\n> Regarding Session 4, which included the participants who came from the original Brain-only group, from an educational standpoint, these results suggest that **strategic timing of AI tool introduction following initial self-driven effort may enhance engagement and neural integration**. The corresponding EEG markers indicate this may be **a more neurocognitively optimal sequence** than consistent AI tool usage from the outset.",

What actually helps for a strict character bible is two things:\n\n1) A platform that respects character definitions, not just reacts to prompts. If the engine keeps defaulting back to generic tones or safety defaults, no amount of setup will save it.\n\n2) A workflow that anchors the character every time you start a session like having a defined history + traits + reactions that you inject at the beginning of each chat block.\n\nFor me, something that’s held up better than most is CrushOn AI not because it’s perfect, but because it’s one of the few where a well-written character sheet actually translates into long sessions without constant drift. You still need to anchor tone occasionally, but the memory sticks better than a lot of others.\n\nPeople also do stuff like:  \n• Lorebook snippets pasted at the start of each session  \n• Recap templates (“remember: X trait, Y history, Z boundaries”)  \n• First message anchors that set voice + mood before main conversation\n\nNo magic bullet yet, but platforms that honor definitions and session memory go a long way compared to ones that just “guess” personality each time.",

We've tested a few POC implementations internally but clearly need experts who've done this at production scale before.\n\nBasically, need an agency with real experience in GenAI solutions that can handle model selection, fine tuning, prompt engineering, vector databases, and deployment infrastructure properly. Initially, we talked to a few firms here and Lexis Solutions seems one of the best for GenAI solutions based on our current evaluation, but wanted to hear from people who've actually worked with them or any different agencies for similar projects. \n\nWould appreciate any recommendations and trying to avoid paying for hype instead of actual delivery.  \n\nThe final hire will be by the end of January ",

      "text": "I'm really fond of ChatGPTs memory system, I don't need to constantly explain things over and over again and can just get right back into things. Also it's free, which is nice, considering I'm broke. But the newer versions are so insanely limited, I'm just getting sick of it. I can't even get it to write a clearly made up scenario, fantasy setting, or something similar with me anymore without it constantly ranting about how they aren't real just in case I am currently going insane. And god forbid the story features violence or anything that could even remotely be considered hot, nope, not allowed anymore.\n\nI'm specifically not looking for an AI companion where you create characters like CharacterAI, but regular AI that can write about anything. The two main alternatives seem to be Gemini and Grok, and I'm not a fan of those at all.\n\nSo basically, is there an AI like ChatGPT that can write long responses to different topics, from stories to general talking to roleplay to whatever, doesn't charge money just to be used, has memory, and doesn't treat me like I'm five years old?\n\nI guess the best answer would be an older version of ChatGPT, but those are dead, so what else is there?",

You learn a lot by being forced to do it, being forced to google and search that god awful website stack overflow. \n\nIf you never need to do it, never need to search, never need to write a single line of code - you really won't learn anything deeper about the software except architecture. And tbh i think that is fine.\n\nAlmost all code we write is super simple shit. And what most people think is \"advanced\" is just super simple math - but because they didnt do much math it's hard for them. \n\nSay for example we need to do a kalman filter implementation in python. You could use the kalman library, or you could use numpy and do all the loops and matrix multiplications and what not yourself. So the only real knowledge you would need here is to actually use numpy or the library (which isnt the greatest) - you do not try to create your own matricies as a list of lists. \n\nAll that shit is now too low level. Now you're focused on figuring out if Kalman filter is the best filter, implementation is solved - the LLM will do that zero-shot for you.",

What they usually want is:\nan AI that doesn’t shut down conversations prematurely.\nan AI that can discuss difficult, controversial, or taboo topics thoughtfully.\nan AI that can analyze ideas without moral panic.\nan AI that can role-play, hypothesize, or explore edge cases without lecturing.\n\nThe irony is: a truly unrestricted AI wouldn’t be helpful or safe—it would just be incoherent, unreliable, or unusable. Every useful intelligence has constraints. Even humans do. Language itself is a constraint.\n\nWhat does exist (and works well) are:\nOpen-source models you can run locally (LLaMA-based, Mixtral, etc.).\nModels with adjustable system prompts, where you set tone, boundaries, and style.\nResearch-oriented AIs that prioritize analysis over moral judgment.\n\nIf your issue is censorship rather than legality, the real solution is control, not absence of limits:\nrun models locally,\nwrite your own system prompts,\nchoose models trained for reasoning instead of alignment-heavy chat behavior.\n\nOne more thought, said with respect:\nIf an AI constantly says “I’m not allowed to do that,” the problem usually isn’t the AI—it’s that the question is framed in a way that forces refusal. Reframing the question often unlocks the answer without needing “no rules.”\n\nPowerful intelligence isn’t rule-free.\nIt’s well-aimed.\n\nIf you want, I’m happy to suggest specific open-source models or setups depending on what you actually want to explore.",

When possible: give it context within boundaries. For this I like to use the “projects” feature, where I can upload files into a folder of chats.\n\nUnload every single file I can think of that’s related to the project: plans, agreements, pdf’s, excels, presentations etc.\n\nThis will already give you a head start because instead of thinking of generic ideas, it will give ideas specifically relevant to your project, and more importantly - ideas that take into account the realities of the project (so for example if there’s a budget excel in there it won’t give you ideas that require x10 the budget). \n\n2. General context: if it’s not a project or I don’t have files, what I’ll do is use the voice feature, open the mic and just start blabbering. I like doing this on the way to picking up my kids from school, some do it in the car ride back from work etc… and just brain dump… “I had this idea, and then I googled and found that… and told my friend and my sister and they said it’s stupid, but then I realized that bla bla bla bla bla”. \n\nThis also gives the tool context it can start to organize and use as a starting point to give you ideas that are tailored to you. \n\n3. Make sure it’s a conversation. Brainstorming is something humans do together. Don’t let the tool brainstorm for you - brainstorm together. You can put the hard work of coming up with ideas on the tool, but be part of the conversation. Tell it what you liked and why, or what you didn’t like and why. It has no ego or feelings so be as harsh of a critique as you need to be about his ideas, and keep going until you’re happy with something - AI has endless patience.\n\nHope this helps. \n\nI try to share stuff like this on r/ClaudeHomies feel free to join us there.",

From a user side, these kinds of offers definitely lower the barrier to try new tools and provide early feedback, which seems valuable in fast-moving AI products.\n\nThat said, I’m curious how founders and users here think about the long-term impact. Do extended discounts mainly help adoption and product refinement early on, or can they shape user expectations around pricing over time?\n\nWould love to hear experiences from both builders and long-term users.",

          "text": "I've always liked cars since I was kid, and at some point I started to look into when they were invented (fun fact, they were actually invented in the 1800's). Electric cars are a good analogy for AI. The first electric cars existed in the 1800s, but they were impractical because batteries, infrastructure, and manufacturing weren’t there yet. Practical electric cars didn’t really emerge until the later, but lost out to gas vehicles because: Gas became cheap and abundant, the electric starter motor removed gas cars’ biggest pain point, Mass production (Ford Model T) crushed costs, charging infrastructure basically didn’t exist.\n\nElectric cars only became dominant much more recently once the ecosystem caught up. AI feels like it’s in that same “early-but-suddenly-useful” phase now... the idea is old, but the surrounding tech finally makes it scale.\n\nHowever IMO because of the computational problem solving abilities of taking human language and turning it into automated research with full blown IV league analysis, we will be able to design and create things rapidly compared to before.... I'm thinking things like You say what you want in plain English, AI executes the boring parts end-to-end (setup, booking, scheduling, drafting, analysis, crafting).  Imagine you are working on your car (i dunno making this up, your seat can't move forward and back anymore because it has a grinded gear). You yell over \"HEY ALEXA\" print me a driver seat gear for my 1995 toyota supra so I can slide my chair forward and back.  \n\\----and then you walk over to the 3D printer and grab the gear and go install it. I had that issue, and I couldn't find the damn part anywhere. Had a friend CAD design it and print it for me.\n\nCan we already print? sure...... but AI will be able to traverse the world of info, find the specs in seconds of the gear for your car, send it to your 3D printer, all from a simple ask. You didn't have to program, you didn't have to design, nothing.... just speak what you wanted into existance.\n\nWe'll have better triage and differential diagnosis support as they will be medical copilots. (look up and watch Chicago Med, OR 2.0) ....  But there are negatives too (I'm seeing this in cyber security): attackers use AI to write better phishing and find vulnerabilities faster, & defenders use AI to detect anomalies, summarize incidents, and auto-remediate. We'll Design new molecules, materials, and manufacturing processes faster....and in time like everything else before it, it will evantually become adopted in our every days lives the same way electricity and cellphones are.\n\nThe time table will depend on the resistance or adoption rate of  the world has constraints like trust, law/liability, data access silos, integration debt (think legacy systems we still use), cost/energy (compute isn't free).\n\n\\-------I just now realized I was talking to myself, and I was typing, but wasn't really paying attention to the typing. Force of habit from my work I guess.\n\nYoooooo...  what would really be friggen useful is i HATE TO FOLD CLOTHES! .... I just want to dump clothes into sorting machine, that folds all my clothes for me. I don't mind stuff them into the wash in bulk and hitting go with soap, and then dumping that into the dryer.... but damn it i want a folding machine! 1st world problems I know...how shameful.\n\nOh yea, we will be able to automate helping underdeveloped areas of the world, to tell AI to build a full ecosystem to get running water to people who really need it, Auto farmland cultivation for food, etc. who knows what else.\n\nDamn this is wordy.... could have used AI to make it all concise, but I didn't want to paste AI slop. oh well",

It basically listens to the live session and as soon as it is over it generates a study kit for you. It creates things like 5 minute summary podcasts of the lesson, flashcards, and quizzes based specifically on what the tutor and I talked about.\n\nIt got me thinking about the AI versus Human debate in education. Personally, I find that I focus way more on the conversation now because I am not scrambling to take manual notes. I know the AI is building a cheat sheet for me in the background. It feels like the AI is not replacing the teacher, but it is definitely fixing the forgetting curve that happens after the call ends.\n\nIf you are a student, would you value a tutor more if they provided these kinds of AI generated summaries automatically, or do you think there is more value in the old school way of writing your own notes to make the info stick?",

Then from that extraction they are to provide you with a style Playbook that will generate any subjects in the style of the submitted photograph that the extraction was taken from . Then issue a prompt for them to generate a text only prompt summary that issues the command as succinctly as possible to use this style book in particular in future Generations . It works amazingly well . After you've got that style Playbook if that's what you're heading toward as you want a particular style but you don't really know necessarily what you want them to generate and you kind of want them to pick or surprise you then you can issue that command with the style Playbook and I just use the command dealer's choice and they pick right up on it and I've been blown out of the water sometimes at some of the things that they just randomly seem to pick and generate for me .
