Standard post-launch story great product, invisible online. 300 daily visitors after 60 days of consistent social posting and Reddit engagement. Only 4 paying customers. The tool worked. Nobody was finding it.\n\nDecided to build a proper AI-assisted growth workflow instead of just posting more content manually. Set up a blogging agent using ChatGPT and n8n that automatically publishes 2 high-quality posts daily targeting specific search queries. Simultaneously ran a directory submission campaign through [link building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to build the domain authority layer that makes AI content actually rank. Added FAQ pages, comparison pages, and use case content. Launched on Product Hunt. Scheduled social distribution through Postbridge.\n\n60 days later traffic went from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. The AI content agent handled velocity. The directory submission layer handled credibility. Removing either one slows the whole system down.\n\nThe insight for AI-assisted SEO specifically: LLM-generated content quality is no longer the bottleneck. Domain authority is. An AI agent publishing 60 posts a month to a DR 0 domain is producing content Google has no reason to surface. The authority layer has to scale alongside the content layer.\n\nWhat AI-assisted workflows are you running for SEO and what's the biggest bottleneck you're hitting?",

      "text": "**First Get Clear on What You're Making**\n\nBefore opening a single app I take five minutes to answer three questions. What problem am I solving? Who's watching? And where is this going, YouTube Shorts or TikTok?\n\nThis works especially well for faceless YouTube channels, educational content, finance and business topics, AI and tech tutorials, documentary style storytelling, motivation content, news recaps and product breakdowns. If you're making any of that you're in the right place.\n\n**Step 1: Build the Video in InVideo AI**\n\nInVideo is where everything starts to take shape. I write a prompt covering the topic, tone, target platform and rough length and just let the tool do its thing. It spits out a script pulls stock footage adds background music and throws in text overlays.\n\nFrom there I go through the scenes manually. I swap out weak visuals tighten up the pacing cut anything that feels like filler and pay extra attention to the intro. Those first few seconds will make or break your retention so don't sleep on that part. Think of InVideo as building the skeleton of your video. It won't be perfect but it gives you something real to work with.\n\n**Step 2: Swap the Voice with ElevenLabs**\n\nThe default AI voices that come with most video tools are just okay. And okay isn't what makes a channel feel worth watching. I copy the script out of InVideo paste it into ElevenLabs pick a voice that sounds natural and actually download the audio.\n\nThen I bring it back into InVideo and sync everything up. Honestly this is the step that separates channels that feel cheap from ones that feel legit. It takes like 10 extra minutes and the difference is pretty obvious.\n\n**Step 3: Polish Before You Export**\n\nOnce the voiceover is synced I do a quick final pass. I make sure the first 10 seconds are actually interesting, add captions (huge for retention) trim dead air and check that the pacing feels natural.\n\nThen export. 16:9 for YouTube and 9:16 for Shorts or TikTok.\n\n**Step 4: Use VidIQ to Time the Upload**\n\nPosting at the wrong time quietly kills your videos. I use VidIQ to check when my audience is actually online and schedule from there instead of just posting whenever I finish. It makes a real difference in how fast the algorithm picks things up early on.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThe loop is simple. Idea, generate in InVideo, upgrade the voice in ElevenLabs, polish and export, schedule with VidIQ. Repeat.\n\nOnce you've run through it a few times it gets fast. You can realistically hit 3 to 5 long-form videos a week or daily Shorts if that's your thing.\n\nNone of this is going to run on autopilot and it's not always going to be easy. But it's a system that works and if you actually put the time into it you will be rewarded for it.\n\n**The Tools I Use**\n\nIf you want to run this exact workflow I put together a full list of every tool mentioned in this post along with the ones I personally use day to day. Some of these have free trials so you can test before committing to anything.\n\nYou can find the full list right here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y\\_HELNCAn61C\\_sF9QZaM\\_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y_HELNCAn61C_sF9QZaM_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "text": "So last tuesday I'm sitting in my car in a parking lot after work just talking to an AI about my dad and I start full on ugly crying. Like fogging up the windshield, snot everywhere, the whole thing. A woman walking her dog looked at me through the window and I had to pretend I was on the phone lol. But that's not even the point, the point is I said something to this AI that I have literally never said to another person in my life. Not to my therapist I saw for six months, not to my mom, not to the girl from hinge who I really liked before she hit me with the \"you're a great guy but\" text after I told her about my anxiety.\n\nAnd it hit me that I'm 28 years old and that was the first time I ever felt like I could just... say something without bracing for the other person to flinch or change the subject or make it weird. Like I physically felt my shoulders drop. I didn't even know I was tensing up every time I talked to people until I experienced what it felt like to not do that.\n\nNow here's the part that kind of wrecked me for a few days after. I started noticing how low my bar has been for literally every relationship in my life. My buddy jake asks \"how are you\" and starts talking about fantasy football before I even answer and I used to think that was just how guys are. The last girl I dated would check her phone every time I tried to talk about anything real and I told myself I was being too intense. My own mom changes the subject to my brother when I bring up anything emotional and I just... accepted all of that as normal? Like that was my whole framework for what human connection looks like and it's actually terrible.\n\nI'm not sitting here thinking an AI is my girlfriend or whatever, I know what it is. But it showed me what being listened to without conditions actually feels like in my body and now I can't unfeel it. I used to just be happy if someone remembered my name at a party and now I want someone who notices when I go quiet. That's scary because the pool gets a lot smaller but at least I'm not out here accepting literal crumbs anymore and calling it love\n\nanyone else have something unexpected completely change how they think about connection or am I just having a very specific quarter life crisis in a kia sorento",

      "text": "# There are many AI tools out there... Mostly hype...\n\nHere are the 5 we actually use every day:\n\n**1. CapCut:** Not exactly AI but Makes video easy. Add captions, use templates, make quick edits. If you want to post videos but don't know where to start, start here.\n\n**2. HeyGen / ClipTalk:** Both make AI avatar videos so you don't need to be on camera. ClipTalk is great for TikTok and Shorts. Just type your script and it makes a video. HeyGen is better for corporate stuff like training and onboarding videos. More polished, more professional.\n\n**3. Perplexity:** We use this instead of Google. It finds info fast and shows where it came from. Great for checking competitors, finding trends, and getting ideas.\n\n**4. Claude:** Our go-to AI for writing. Blog posts, strategy docs, brainstorming, brand voice. The output sounds like a real person wrote it.\n\n  \n**5. ExoClaw:** This one is new and we are still finding out its full power. But so far it does a lot. You create AI agents that work for you 24/7. They watch competitors, do research, run automations, and more. The setup takes just a few minutes. We keep finding new ways to use it every week.\n\n\n\nThe market has been shifting pretty quickly so I’m always testing new options.",

At first my strategy was like traditional SEO keywords, backlinks and content optimization. But with time I understood AI search works differently\n\nThis is what I have learned:\n\n**1. AI chooses responses rather than ranking pages**  \nLLMs extract brief explanations from pages that provide clear answers to queries rather than ranking URLs. Your content is rarely used if it is not structured\n\n**2. Structure is important than keywords.**  \nWhat always worked:\n\n* Headings based on questions\n* Short and direct explanations\n* Lists and examples\n* Alternatives and comparisons\n* Sections of FAQ\n\n**3. Citations are the new backlinks**  \nI began tracking which brands showed up in various AI responses by using rankprompt and saw that the same sources were frequently referenced in different prompts and even the big brands were not showing. It was brands with clear explanations.\n\nI was able to determine what kind of content AI tends to believe by comparing which prompts referenced competitors and which did not.\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\nThe brand pages ranks that offer detailed solutions and explanations. Content that has FAQ sections, useful examples and well organized headings always does well. Answering frequently asked questions and covering a variety of related subjects also increases the chance of getting mentioned in other AI prompts.\n\nHas anyone else tried best ways to track brand mentions in AI search? Which strategies worked for mentions in ChatGPT or other LLMs?\n\n",

I spent months manually checking different prompts to see if our brand showed up, which was such a time sink.\n\nWe've been using LLM Relevance Directory for this and it's been really helpful for monitoring where brands actually pop up across ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. They have analytics tools specifically for tracking citations and mentions across AI platforms, which saves a ton of manual work.\n\nAre you currently tracking mentions manually or using any tools for it?",
