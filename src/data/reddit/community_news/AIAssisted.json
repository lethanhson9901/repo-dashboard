Most tools I've tested produce wildly different results each time - facial features change, body proportions shift, lighting varies dramatically - which makes them useless for anyone trying to create a cohesive set of content or build character consistency. I need something that can learn a specific look and then maintain it across dozens of generations without constant regenerating and cherry-picking.​\n\nI saw someone mention [HotPhotoAI](http://hotphotoai.com) in another thread as being better for consistency because of how it handles custom model training, but I haven't tested it yet. Has anyone actually found an NSFW AI assistant that solves the consistency problem, or are we all just stuck regenerating until we get lucky? What features or capabilities should I be looking for that separate tools with real consistency from ones that just produce random variations every time?​",

I've seen reviews where people say modern AI headshot tools have gotten way better than the early versions from 2023-2024 that looked like wax figures, but I'm skeptical about whether they're actually indistinguishable from real photography.\n\nSomeone in a productivity thread mentioned they used [Looktara](http://looktara.com) for their startup team headshots and nobody questioned whether they were real or AI-generated. That's encouraging, but I'm wondering if people just didn't say anything even though they noticed. For people who've used AI headshots in professional contexts: have clients, colleagues, or employers ever commented that your photos looked AI-generated? Or has it been completely unremarkable and nobody notices or cares ?\n\nAlso curious about which specific use cases feel acceptable versus risky. Like, LinkedIn profile seems fine, but what about investor pitch decks, professional licenses, or conference materials where credibility really matters? What's been your actual experience using these in business settings ?",

We've had people use their headshots for investor meetings, LinkedIn profiles, corporate websites, even conference speaker pages - zero questions asked. The \"something feels off\" factor basically disappeared once the tech improved past mid-2024.

      "text": "Built an AI-assisted system around \"best of\" lists that generated 123 backlinks in 4 months with 18% success rate without guest posts or buying links.​ The context was a marketing blog stuck at DA 19 with slow link acquisition. Guest posts took weeks per placement with 2-3% success rates. The insight was \"best of\" lists get updated regularly and owners actively look for quality additions, so you're helping them not begging.​ Here's where AI came in. First step was AI-assisted prospecting. Searched for \"marketing blogs to follow 2025\", \"best marketing blogs 2026\", then dropped URLs into an AI workflow to classify by niche and relevance. That filtered 180 opportunities down to relevant ones.​\n\nSecond step was smart qualification at scale. AI summarized each list and flagged last updated date, whether descriptions looked curated versus spam, and whether listed sites were similar tier. That cut the list from 180 to 68 high-quality targets.​ Foundation mattered before outreach could convert. A [directory submission campaign](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) had already moved the site from DA 8 to 19, so when list owners checked the blog it didn't look like zero-authority domain. That credibility boost made outreach actually convert.​\n\nThird step was AI-personalized outreach not templates. For each list, AI drafts included custom intro referencing specific resources on their list, argument for why my blog fit, 2-3 strongest articles summarized, and offer to share their list with my audience. Each draft was lightly edited by hand so it sounded human.​ Initial results showed 22 emails with 19% response rate and 4 placements. Scaled to 100+ pitches maintaining 17-18% reply rates. Total came to 123 backlinks in 4 months, mostly contextual editorial links from DA 30-70+ domains. Quality breakdown showed 67 links from DA 30-50, 41 from DA 50-70, and 15 from DA 70+ sites.​ Time efficiency was 35 minutes per outreach versus 4-6 hours per guest post. Success rate of 18% versus 2-3% for manual. Got 123 links in 4 months versus maybe 20-25 guest posts with same effort.​\n\nThe takeaway is AI didn't do link building alone. It found opportunities faster, pre-qualified targets, and drafted 80-90% of outreach leaving humans for final polish. Leverage came from combining AI speed with human judgment and genuine value.",

          "text": "I've always liked cars since I was kid, and at some point I started to look into when they were invented (fun fact, they were actually invented in the 1800's). Electric cars are a good analogy for AI. The first electric cars existed in the 1800s, but they were impractical because batteries, infrastructure, and manufacturing weren’t there yet. Practical electric cars didn’t really emerge until the later, but lost out to gas vehicles because: Gas became cheap and abundant, the electric starter motor removed gas cars’ biggest pain point, Mass production (Ford Model T) crushed costs, charging infrastructure basically didn’t exist.\n\nElectric cars only became dominant much more recently once the ecosystem caught up. AI feels like it’s in that same “early-but-suddenly-useful” phase now... the idea is old, but the surrounding tech finally makes it scale.\n\nHowever IMO because of the computational problem solving abilities of taking human language and turning it into automated research with full blown IV league analysis, we will be able to design and create things rapidly compared to before.... I'm thinking things like You say what you want in plain English, AI executes the boring parts end-to-end (setup, booking, scheduling, drafting, analysis, crafting).  Imagine you are working on your car (i dunno making this up, your seat can't move forward and back anymore because it has a grinded gear). You yell over \"HEY ALEXA\" print me a driver seat gear for my 1995 toyota supra so I can slide my chair forward and back.  \n\\----and then you walk over to the 3D printer and grab the gear and go install it. I had that issue, and I couldn't find the damn part anywhere. Had a friend CAD design it and print it for me.\n\nCan we already print? sure...... but AI will be able to traverse the world of info, find the specs in seconds of the gear for your car, send it to your 3D printer, all from a simple ask. You didn't have to program, you didn't have to design, nothing.... just speak what you wanted into existance.\n\nWe'll have better triage and differential diagnosis support as they will be medical copilots. (look up and watch Chicago Med, OR 2.0) ....  But there are negatives too (I'm seeing this in cyber security): attackers use AI to write better phishing and find vulnerabilities faster, & defenders use AI to detect anomalies, summarize incidents, and auto-remediate. We'll Design new molecules, materials, and manufacturing processes faster....and in time like everything else before it, it will evantually become adopted in our every days lives the same way electricity and cellphones are.\n\nThe time table will depend on the resistance or adoption rate of  the world has constraints like trust, law/liability, data access silos, integration debt (think legacy systems we still use), cost/energy (compute isn't free).\n\n\\-------I just now realized I was talking to myself, and I was typing, but wasn't really paying attention to the typing. Force of habit from my work I guess.\n\nYoooooo...  what would really be friggen useful is i HATE TO FOLD CLOTHES! .... I just want to dump clothes into sorting machine, that folds all my clothes for me. I don't mind stuff them into the wash in bulk and hitting go with soap, and then dumping that into the dryer.... but damn it i want a folding machine! 1st world problems I know...how shameful.\n\nOh yea, we will be able to automate helping underdeveloped areas of the world, to tell AI to build a full ecosystem to get running water to people who really need it, Auto farmland cultivation for food, etc. who knows what else.\n\nDamn this is wordy.... could have used AI to make it all concise, but I didn't want to paste AI slop. oh well",

      "text": "I have been taking some tutoring lessons on Wiingy recently and they have a feature called Co-Tutor AI that I have been testing out. It basically listens to the live session and as soon as it is over it generates a study kit for you. It creates things like 5 minute summary podcasts of the lesson, flashcards, and quizzes based specifically on what the tutor and I talked about.\n\nIt got me thinking about the AI versus Human debate in education. Personally, I find that I focus way more on the conversation now because I am not scrambling to take manual notes. I know the AI is building a cheat sheet for me in the background. It feels like the AI is not replacing the teacher, but it is definitely fixing the forgetting curve that happens after the call ends.\n\nIf you are a student, would you value a tutor more if they provided these kinds of AI generated summaries automatically, or do you think there is more value in the old school way of writing your own notes to make the info stick?",

Ive been experimenting with AI assistance while doing my hobbies and the specific hobby I had issue with was my notes on philosophy, history, and theology. (Basically everytime I read a work I enjoy I add notes about it to my document with footnotes about other stories it reminded me of)\n\nWhen I tried giving it to Claude it rewrote all my notes (this was my fault, I should’ve been more careful with the prompts but I had backups so it’s okay) when I told Claude it just destroyed my notes it remembered it and would automatically index anytime I mentioned my notes from that moment onward.\n\nI guess at one point I referenced a trade terminal at my university’s business college because it kept insisting I was a day trader every time I brought up my history notes. It got so bad I just had to delete Claude’s persistent memories and copy-paste the ones from ChatGPT into Claude so it would stop. \n\nChatGPT doesn’t have an automated persistent memory index feature, it relies on manual user input which I prefer when it comes to note taking.\n\n\n\n2.) *Token Limits*\n\nBecause I’m weird I coded a private extension for chromium that copy-pastes reply chains from comment section arguments across social media into PDF documents so I can listen to analyses of argument structures like a podcast, but even on Sonnet Claude’s token limit feels restrictive.",

For the past few months, I keep reading that AI video is \"here\" and \"mature.\" I see people playing with Suno for music or making trippy clips with Runway or Pika. But when I actually try to apply any of this to my day job, I hit a wall.\n\nI work at a consulting firm and we are under pressure to constantly churn out content for our clients. The bottleneck is that my boss is the face of the brand, but he is booked back-to-back with meetings all day. He has zero time to sit in front of a camera and record.\n\nI’m looking for a solution where I can essentially \"clone\" him using an AI avatar to deliver these updates. I don't need cinematic 4K movie quality; I just need something that looks professional enough to pass for a LinkedIn update or a client briefing.\n\nHas anyone actually successfully integrated an AI avatar tool into a boring B2B workflow? Is the learning curve steep? And honestly, is the output actually good enough to send to clients, or does it just look creepy?\n\nAppreciate any honest takes on what is actually worth paying for.",

A lot of the stuff you see on Twitter is just \"demo candy\" looks cool for 5 seconds but has zero practical use for a real business.\n\nSince you are in consulting, your clients care about the _expertise_, not whether the video looks like a Marvel movie. You are on the right track thinking about avatars. The play here is to clone your boss once, then just feed his scripts or existing PDFs/PPTs into the tool to generate the content.\n\nFor that specific workflow, you should look at tools that specialize in \"Corporate Learning/Comms\" rather than \"Creative Video.\"\n\nI’d recommend looking at tools like Synthesia or Leadde AI. Synthesia is the gold standard for quality, but if you are watching your budget, Leadde is a solid alternative that does the exact same job for a lot less money.\n\nBoth are built exactly for what you described: onboarding, compliance stuff, boring-but-important product demos, and sales enablement. They aren't trying to make movies; they are designed to get information across efficiently. Hope that helps clear up the noise a bit.",

Auditors spent maybe 20 minutes on policies and training. spent 3 hours on technical architecture.\n\nThe questions were specific and brutal, show us cryptographic proof that client data stays isolated during processing, demonstrate that your vendors can't access privileged information, prove that data doesn't persist after processing completes.\n\nOur policies said we only use vendors with strong security, auditors wanted to see technical verification. Two of our five AI platforms failed this test. We could show contracts saying the vendor wouldn't access our data, but couldn't prove they technically couldn't, auditors gave us 90 days.\n\nEthics committees are getting technical, they understand the difference between policy based security and technically-enforced security, having the right contracts isn't enough anymore. Now we are testing with phala and aws nitro, both use confidential computing and show technical proof let’s see what they have to say now.\n\nIf you're using AI tools for legal work, make sure you can technically prove data protection, not just document that you have good policies.",

I was making around 15k per month. I thought, okay, this is it, I am officially a founder now.\n\nThat client left after one month.\n\nThat’s it. One month.\n\nSuddenly no revenue, no backup, no runway, and I had to go back to the same field again with my confidence shaken and savings hit.\n\nReality check. One client is not a business. Early revenue is not stability. Excitement is not security.\n\nIf you are working a job right now and dreaming about your startup, please set a real target. A target where you can pay rent, eat properly, handle emergencies, and sleep without panic.\n\nQuit only when your startup can carry your basic life, not your ego.\n\nStartup life is already hard.

Then they have many months to work without income.\n\nThen in USA they have tons of high risk investors. When they get any to fund their company, they just transparently reserve part of the funding to themselves and they can roll longer. Their next deadline become the deadline when the investor's vest goes down and he can take off his share. Before that they need to find a new investor to play previous one's share and some more.\n\nIn the eventuality if the company does bankrupting, the founder just must make sure he leaves with enough savings from investments to live for another year. Then he founds another company or has that time to find a new job.\n\nAnd he's not a failure.  His company didn't last, but he learned a lot of skill on many different areas.
