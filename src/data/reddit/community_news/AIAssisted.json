Standard post-launch story great product, invisible online. 300 daily visitors after 60 days of consistent social posting and Reddit engagement. Only 4 paying customers. The tool worked. Nobody was finding it.\n\nDecided to build a proper AI-assisted growth workflow instead of just posting more content manually. Set up a blogging agent using ChatGPT and n8n that automatically publishes 2 high-quality posts daily targeting specific search queries. Simultaneously ran a directory submission campaign through [link building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to build the domain authority layer that makes AI content actually rank. Added FAQ pages, comparison pages, and use case content. Launched on Product Hunt. Scheduled social distribution through Postbridge.\n\n60 days later traffic went from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. The AI content agent handled velocity. The directory submission layer handled credibility. Removing either one slows the whole system down.\n\nThe insight for AI-assisted SEO specifically: LLM-generated content quality is no longer the bottleneck. Domain authority is. An AI agent publishing 60 posts a month to a DR 0 domain is producing content Google has no reason to surface. The authority layer has to scale alongside the content layer.\n\nWhat AI-assisted workflows are you running for SEO and what's the biggest bottleneck you're hitting?",

With AI though, I've made some strides in my communication abilities. (not even with just posting with AI but the process of spilling my guts out and then shaping it to be more refined has shown me through example, how much information is actually enough and what is too much. \n\nOther people get into a tizzy about it because they can't tell if there is a real person behind the posts or not.

Was spending $450 every 18 months on photographer sessions.\n\n Finally tried an [AI headshot tool](http://looktara.com/) myself. Upload photos at home, get professional results in 15 minutes, pay under $40. Done.\n\n Used across LinkedIn, my company bio, and client presentations for 5 months. Not one person has mentioned anything looking different or off.\n\n The recurring professional photography expense just quietly disappears. What other recurring professional expenses have you replaced with AI this year?",

Add captions, use templates, make quick edits. If you want to post videos but don't know where to start, start here.\n\n**2. HeyGen / ClipTalk:** Both make AI avatar videos so you don't need to be on camera. ClipTalk is great for TikTok and Shorts. Just type your script and it makes a video. HeyGen is better for corporate stuff like training and onboarding videos. More polished, more professional.\n\n**3. Perplexity:** We use this instead of Google. It finds info fast and shows where it came from. Great for checking competitors, finding trends, and getting ideas.\n\n**4. Claude:** Our go-to AI for writing. Blog posts, strategy docs, brainstorming, brand voice. The output sounds like a real person wrote it.\n\n  \n**5. ExoClaw:** This one is new and we are still finding out its full power. But so far it does a lot. You create AI agents that work for you 24/7. They watch competitors, do research, run automations, and more. The setup takes just a few minutes. We keep finding new ways to use it every week.\n\n\n\nThe market has been shifting pretty quickly so I’m always testing new options.",

In simple terms, local deployment just means running your software on your own computer or an office system instead of putting it online. You usually only need one dedicated machine, the basic software your app depends on, and a way to back up your data. Local deployment is fine if it’s only for internal use, but if you plan to scale or allow remote access later, cloud might be easier. I’d suggest starting small with a basic local setup and learning how to start, stop, and back up the app. You don’t need deep technical knowledge — just clear steps. Hope this helps 🙂",

      "text": "Hey! I wrote this guide for r/WritingWithAI and another couple subs and people liked it enough for me to spread it in other subs.\n\nMost of my guides focus on memory, hallucinations, master prompts. The big stuff. But once you've got that dialed in, there's a whole layer of smaller tweaks that can completely change how your sessions *feel*.\n\n>These aren't fixes for problems. They're creative knobs you can turn for fun.\n\nI've been experimenting with these for a while and wanted to share. Some might click for you, some might not. That's the point - they're options, not rules.\n\n# 1. Style Anchoring\n\nAI models have read a lot of books. You can tap into that.\n\n>Name an author or work and watch the prose shift.\n\nTry dropping this into your prompt:\n- Write in the style of Cormac McCarthy.\n- Match the tone of Disco Elysium.\n- Think Joe Abercrombie.\n\nEach of these activates a different constellation of LLM parameters: sentence length, vocabulary, rhythm, mood. It's a shortcut to a whole aesthetic.\n\nIf no famous reference fits, or you have no idea who those people are, you can describe the vibe instead.\n- Write like a tired detective narrating a case file.\n- Campfire storytelling: conversational, meandering, personal.\n\n# 2. Prose Density\n\nThis one's fun to play with.\n\n>Density = how much description you pack into each sentence.\n\nHigh density: \"The crimson sun bled across the tortured sky, casting long fingers of shadow across the cobblestones.\"\n\nLow density: \"The sun set. Shadows stretched across the street.\"\n>If you ever used Grok 4.1 Fast, this is how it writes out of the box.\n\nNeither is better. Different vibes. You can tell the AI exactly where on the spectrum you want it:\n- Keep descriptions lean. One sensory detail per scene element.\n- Or: Rich, atmospheric prose. Linger on environments.\n\nI like switching this mid-campaign. Sparse for action arcs, dense for quiet character moments. Did this through my whole last TC run - worked great.\n>Pro tip from another guide: state your intentions *before* starting the session. Do you want a bonding-focused episode? A fighting one? Mystery? Stating it helps AI a lot.\n\n# 3. Vocabulary Range\n\nAI has favorites. You'll start noticing the same words popping up: \"crimson,\" \"cacophony.\" It's not that they're bad words - they just get stale.\n\n>You can steer vocabulary in any direction you want.\n\nFor variety:\n- Avoid overused words like: mused, whispered, crimson, azure, ethereal.\n- Vary your word choices. Don't repeat the same descriptor twice in a scene.\n\nFor a specific register:\n- Plain, modern prose: everyday vocabulary, casual reading level.\n- Ornate high-fantasy: archaic diction, Tolkien-esque.\n- Hardboiled: short words, punchy verbs, no poetry.\n\nYou can also just ban the words that annoy you personally. \"Never use: whilst, amidst, visage, myriad.\" The AI respects these surprisingly well.\n\n# 4. Pacing Profiles\n\nThis is subtle but powerful once you notice it.\n\n>You can give the AI different instructions for different scene types.\n\nWhat I use:\n- Action scenes: short sentences, rapid exchanges, minimal internal thought.\n- Emotional scenes: slow down, pauses, body language, let characters breathe.\n- Transitions: quick and functional unless something happens.\n\n# 5. The Show/Tell Dial\n\nClassic writing advice, but it's actually a spectrum you can set.\n\n>\"She felt angry\" is telling. \"Her jaw tightened\" is showing.\n\nFull showing:\n- Never state emotions directly. Convey through action and dialogue.\n- Trust me to infer feelings from context.\n\n>Just know that some models, like Claude Opus 4.5, are alredy pretty good at this out of the box.\n\nBut sometimes telling is fine. Fast-paced adventures might not need three paragraphs of body language for every mood. You can explicitly say \"more telling is okay here.\"\n\n# 6. POV Tightness\n\nHow strictly do you want point of view enforced?\n\n>Loose POV lets the narrator peek into everyone's heads. Tight POV locks you to one perspective.\n\nTight third-person limited:\n- Never reveal information my character couldn't know.\n- Other characters' emotions only through observable behavior.\n\nLooser omniscient:\n- You can briefly show what other characters are thinking when it adds dramatic irony.\n\nBoth are valid. It's about what kind of story you want to tell.\n\n# 7. Genre Flavor\n\nEvery genre has conventions. AI knows them but mixes them up if you don't specify.\n\n>Name your genre and what tropes you want emphasized.\n\nExamples:\n- Noir: moral ambiguity, weather reflects mood, everyone has secrets.\n- Sword and sorcery: magic is rare, heroes are flawed, stakes are personal.\n- Cozy fantasy: low stakes, found family, comfort over conflict. This is my favourite - three months into one on tc right now.\n\nThe AI leans into those tropes once you name them.\n\n# 8. The Prose Example Shortcut\n\nIf none of the above captures what you want, just show the AI.\n\n>Paste a paragraph in your target style. The AI pattern-matches hard.\n\n\"Here's an example of the prose I want:\" followed by something you've written or love. One good example often beats ten instructions.\n\nIf you're on Tale Companion, I keep a \"Style Guide\" page in my Compendium for this and make it persistent for the Narrator agent only.\n\n# Mix and Match\n\nThe fun part is combining these. Sparse + noir + tight POV feels completely different from dense + high fantasy + omniscient.\n\n>Think of it like a mixing board. Each dial changes the output in its own way.\n\nNone of these are mandatory. Your sessions might already feel great. But if you ever want to experiment with a different aesthetic, these are the levers that actually move things.\n\nAnyone else have dials they like to tweak? Always curious what others play with.\n",
