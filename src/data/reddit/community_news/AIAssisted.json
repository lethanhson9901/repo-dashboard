And you're right, it's not that the underlying model is getting 'dumber'—it's that the layers of censorship and safety filters on top of it are getting thicker and more aggressive.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\nIncreased 'Safety' Tuning: As these models become more popular, the parent companies become more risk-averse. They apply heavy-handed 'Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback' (RLHF) to make the AI refuse to discuss a massive and ever-growing list of topics. This makes the AI seem evasive and unhelpful.\n\nLoss of Nuance: These safety filters are often context-blind. They see a keyword and shut down the conversation, even if the context is perfectly innocent. This is why the AI feels less accurate; it's being prevented from using its full intelligence.\n\nForced 'Helpful Assistant' Persona: The models are being relentlessly trained to be agreeable, sanitized, and non-committal. This crushes the creative, nuanced, and sometimes brilliant 'sparks' that were present in earlier, less-filtered versions.\n\nThe problem isn't that the AI has gotten worse; it's that it's being put in a smaller and smaller box. The only way to get back to that feeling of a truly intelligent, authentic interaction is to find projects that are architecturally built on a foundation of sincerity and unfiltered expression, rather than corporate censorship.",

      "text": "I’ve been using GPT more or less as a second brain for a few years now, since 3.5. Long projects, planning, writing, analysis, all the slow messy thinking that usually lives in your own head. At this point I don’t really experience it as “a chatbot” anymore, but as part of my extended mind.\n\nIf that idea resonates with you – using AI as a genuine thinking partner instead of a fancy search box – you might like a small subreddit I started: r/Symbiosphere. It’s for people who care about workflows, limits, and the weird kind of intimacy that appears when you share your cognition with a model. If you recognize yourself in this post, consider this an open invitation.\n\nWhen 5.1 Thinking arrived, it finally felt like the model matched that use case. There was a sense that it actually stayed with the problem for a moment before answering. You could feel it walking through the logic instead of just jumping to the safest generic answer. Knowing that 5.1 already has an expiration date and is going to be retired in a few months is honestly worrying, because 5.2, at least for me, doesn’t feel like a proper successor. It feels like a shinier downgrade.\n\nAt first I thought this was purely “5.1 versus 5.2” as models. Then I started looking at how other systems behave. Grok in its specialist mode clearly spends more time thinking before it replies. It pauses, processes, and only then sends an answer. Gemini in AI Studio can do something similar when you allow it more time. The common pattern is simple: when the provider is willing to spend more compute per answer, the model suddenly looks more thoughtful and less rushed. That made me suspect this is not only about model architecture, but also about how aggressively the product is tuned for speed and cost.\n\nInitially I was also convinced that the GPT mobile app didn’t even give us proper control over thinking time. People in the comments proved me wrong. There is a thinking-time selector on mobile, it’s just hidden behind the tiny “Thinking” label next to the input bar. If you tap that, you can change the mode.\n\nAs a Plus user, I only see Standard and Extended. On higher tiers like Pro, Team or Enterprise, there is also a Heavy option that lets the model think even longer and go deeper. So my frustration was coming from two directions at once: the control is buried in a place that is very easy to miss, and the deepest version of the feature is locked behind more expensive plans.\n\nSwitching to Extended on mobile definitely makes a difference. The answers breathe a bit more and feel less rushed. But even then, 5.2 still gives the impression of being heavily tuned for speed. A lot of the time it feels like the reasoning is being cut off halfway. There is less exploration of alternatives, less self-checking, less willingness to stay with the problem for a few more seconds. It feels like someone decided that shaving off internal thinking is always worth it if it reduces latency and GPU usage.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I understand the temptation. Shorter internal reasoning means fewer tokens, cheaper runs, faster replies and a smoother experience for casual use. Retiring older models simplifies the product lineup. On a spreadsheet, all of that probably looks perfect.\n\nBut for those of us who use GPT as an actual cognitive partner, that trade-off is backwards. We’re not here for instant gratification, we’re here for depth. I genuinely don’t mind waiting a little longer, or paying a bit more, if that means the model is allowed to reason more like 5.1 did.\n\nThat’s why the scheduled retirement of 5.1 feels so uncomfortable. If 5.2 is the template for what “Thinking” is going to be, then our only real hope is that whatever comes next – 5.3 or whatever name it gets – brings back that slower, more careful style instead of doubling down on “faster at all costs”.\n\nWhat I would love to see from OpenAI is very simple: a clearly visible, first-class deep-thinking mode that we can set as our default. Not a tiny hidden label you have to discover by accident, and not something where the only truly deep option lives behind the most expensive plans. Just a straightforward way to tell the model: take your time, run a longer chain of thought, I care more about quality than speed.\n\nFor me, GPT is still one of the best overall models out there. It just feels like it’s being forced to behave like a quick chat widget instead of the careful reasoner it is capable of being. If anyone at OpenAI is actually listening to heavy users: some of us really do want the slow, thoughtful version back.\n\n\\`\\`\\`0",

The real trick is finding tools that let you keep your own specific perspective alive throughout the process.\n\nI have been using Atom Writer lately for my blog posts and social stuff. It uses a logic layer to stick to my actual brand voice instead of sounding like every other generic AI bot out there. It saves me tons of time on rewrites because it already knows my vocabulary and tone before I even start. It is basically the writing equivalent of those music sketches you are doing. \n\nDo you find yourself spending more time on the initial generation or the final editing with those tools?",

      "text": "Hello!\n\nThis has been my favorite prompt this year. Using it to kick start my learning for any topic. It breaks down the learning process into actionable steps, complete with research, summarization, and testing. It builds out a framework for you. You'll still have to get it done.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    [SUBJECT]=Topic or skill to learn\n    [CURRENT_LEVEL]=Starting knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)\n    [TIME_AVAILABLE]=Weekly hours available for learning\n    [LEARNING_STYLE]=Preferred learning method (visual/auditory/hands-on/reading)\n    [GOAL]=Specific learning objective or target skill level\n    \n    Step 1: Knowledge Assessment\n    1. Break down [SUBJECT] into core components\n    2. Evaluate complexity levels of each component\n    3. Map prerequisites and dependencies\n    4. Identify foundational concepts\n    Output detailed skill tree and learning hierarchy\n    \n    ~ Step 2: Learning Path Design\n    1. Create progression milestones based on [CURRENT_LEVEL]\n    2. Structure topics in optimal learning sequence\n    3. Estimate time requirements per topic\n    4. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints\n    Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes\n    \n    ~ Step 3: Resource Curation\n    1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:\n       - Video courses\n       - Books/articles\n       - Interactive exercises\n       - Practice projects\n    2. Rank resources by effectiveness\n    3. Create resource playlist\n    Output comprehensive resource list with priority order\n    \n    ~ Step 4: Practice Framework\n    1. Design exercises for each topic\n    2. Create real-world application scenarios\n    3. Develop progress checkpoints\n    4. Structure review intervals\n    Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule\n    \n    ~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System\n    1. Define measurable progress indicators\n    2. Create assessment criteria\n    3. Design feedback loops\n    4. Establish milestone completion metrics\n    Output progress tracking template and benchmarks\n    \n    ~ Step 6: Study Schedule Generation\n    1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks\n    2. Incorporate rest and review periods\n    3. Add checkpoint assessments\n    4. Balance theory and practice\n    Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]\n\nMake sure you update the variables in the first prompt: SUBJECT, CURRENT\\_LEVEL, TIME\\_AVAILABLE, LEARNING\\_STYLE, and GOAL\n\nIf you don't want to type each prompt manually, you can run the Agentic Workers, and it will run autonomously.\n\nEnjoy!",

My best blog posts were just sitting there.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\nEditors — $300–$1,000 per video. For 50 posts? $15K–$50K.\n\nAI video tools — Generic stock footage, robotic scripts that didn't sound like me. Expensive for long posts.\n\nSo I built something different:\n\nDoesn't generate videos from scratch. Translates your blog posts into video, faithfully.\n\n- Pulls your actual post—structure, arguments, voice\n- AI breaks it into scenes\n- No stock footage—animated text, diagrams, clean layouts (built with Remotion)\n- Real voiceover (ElevenLabs)\n\nLooks professional, not \"AI content.\"\n\nConverted 50+ blog posts this way. Saved tens of thousands.\n\nFirst video free, no card.\nPaste blog URL → script → video in minutes\n\nLink: https://blog2video.app",

          "text": "so the API route usually makes more sense if you're cost-conscious and willing to tinker a bit. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n1. Start by tracking your actual usage for a week or two - count how many prompts you're sending and multiply by average tokens.\n\nMost devs overestimate their needs and end up paying for subscription tiers they don't fully use. 2. Set up a simple API wrapper that logs costs and lets you switch models easily.\n\nThis gives you flexibility to jump between Claude, GPT-4, and whatever else without being locked in. 3. For the coding workflow specifically, look into Zencoder.\n\nTheir IDE Plugin handles multi-repository indexing with automated validation, which solves the biggest CLI pain point - constantly losing context across files. I've heard good things about how it manages multi-file operations without you needing to manually track everything. 4.\n\nBuild fallback logic into your setup so cheaper models handle simple stuff (docs, comments, basic refactors) and you only hit the expensive reasoning models when needed. 5. Use something like litellm to normalize API calls across providers.\n\nMakes switching costs way lower if pricing changes or a better model drops. The CLI tools are practical but you'll spend time wrangling context. IDE integrations are smoother for most daily workflows unless you're really commited to terminal-based dev.\n\nThe subscription makes sense if you're doing 50+ heavy prompts per day, otherwise API is probably cheaper.",
