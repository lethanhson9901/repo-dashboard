AI companion services don't have such funding, so they have to either charge over the cost which is high or use very weak models with small context window, then the result is bad.\n\nFor the good and the bad, the path is to self host SillyTavern and pay a LLM provider like NanoGPT. SillyTavern with extensions has all the features that proprietary AI companion services have and the best character writers publish theirs for free too. u can use good open weight models like GLM or pay higher for the big proprietary models. And unless u use it a big log u won't even pay more than the proprietary services, because u pay as u use, while proprietary services charge profitable subscriptions where 99% of users pay way more than they use.",

          "text": "What do you think all of the many companion/boyfriend/girlfriend/roleplay platforms are? Selftrained, privately hosted LLM's?\n\n\nI've been using these services since the first ones arrived, several years ago, way before these platforms automatically got banned from the app play stores. I never paid a cent for any of the \"premium features\" mind you, but they're all just a bunch of custom websites/applications that use cloud hosted services based on the the major models API's with a custom made sticker slapped on top of them.\n\n\nThey charge the users a fee that covers their API, cloud services, and the website fees as well as charging an additional fee (their profit) for providing the service.\n\n\nAs long as the subscriptions cover theese fees it's a very simple way to turn this into a profit if you have some basic coding experience (or better yet.. Knowing how to use a LLM to help you with this) without too much effort. Nobody is sueing these platforms because the API is covered.\n\n\nCloud hosted LLM's means that the guardrails are less restricted which allows these platforms to operate flawlessly. A common technique is to allow the users to create their own \"custom chatbots\" and have a \"popular\" section that ranks the bots by interaction/likes which allows a natural competitive market for 'fame' between the users which means that you don't even have to bother to create bots yourself, you just have to keep the servers running and offer a smooth, easily navigated UI while the users provide the content themselves while you sit back, keep an eye out for any specific harmful content while you also make an additional profit from selling the data of the users (which makes up for the freeloading users such as myself). Their main issue is to advertise for their platforms which is why you often see **the same platforms being promoted with direct links on Reddit in every single post regarding this matter, usually posted by a bot created by the platforms themselves.**\n\n\nThere are no such thing as respecting the privacy from the users in this business, as we already have gotten aware of from using any of the major LLM models. Visit any of these platforms and actually take a minute to read their TOS and you'll see for yourself. \n\n\nNow, as for context length/memory stored, it boils down to the users subscription model. Many platforms use different subscriptions that allows users to choose from more advanced models with higher token and context length (memory).\n\n\nIf you can't host your own model (as previously mentioned above) and are okay with giving up your privacy (which you will already do either way) you should be aware that you can pay for cloud hosted models yourself with the same result without paying an additional fee on top of providing your personal data for an additional third-party service. ",

Nastia has that quieter, more grounded feel where the chat flows instead of jumping tones every few messages. It is not dramatic, but that is kind of the point.\n\nWhen something still feels comfortable after the novelty wears off, that is when it actually starts to matter.",

GPT Image on NightCafe is best starting point for headshots (don't use within ChatGPT. It's soooooo slow)   \nThis is the most “photographer-brained” option.\n\n* Very strong at natural lighting and corporate framing\n* Faces look believable without over-stylisation\n* Much less of the waxy / over-polished AI look\n\nIf your goal is *LinkedIn / company website*, this is the model I’d start with first.\n\n2. Seedream also on NightCafe - best for likeness + consistency  \nSeedream tends to:\n\n* hold facial structure more reliably across generations\n* behave better with reference photos\n* drift less when you regenerate multiple options\n\nIf you care about “this actually looks like me” and want several usable variations, Seedream is excellent.\n\n3. Nano Banana Pro - only if you’re very controlled  \nNano Banana Pro can produce great results, but it’s:\n\n* more sensitive to prompt wording\n* easier to accidentally over-style\n\nI’d only use it once you already have a solid base image and want slight variations.\n\nTL;DR recommendation:\n\n* Start with GPT Image for clean, professional realism\n* Switch to Seedream if likeness or consistency is slipping\n* Use Nano Banana Pro sparingly for refinements\n\nThat’s why I usually point people to NightCafe for this use case. Having multiple strong, face-capable models in one place makes iteration way easier than hopping between tools.\n\nIf it helps: avoid “beautifying” language, lock age/hair/glasses tightly, and use consistent reference photos. That alone fixes 80% of the “corporate but not me” problem.",

      "text": "Went all-in on AI content generation for a new project last month. Used ChatGPT to write 20 optimized blog posts in one week. Added proper headers, optimized for keywords, made sure everything read naturally. Published them all and waited for traffic. Nothing happened. Week two, still nothing. Week three, maybe 15 visitors total across all 20 posts.\n\nThe problem wasn't the AI content quality. ChatGPT actually did a solid job writing helpful, readable posts. The problem was my domain had zero authority so Google didn't care how good the content was. No trust signals meant no rankings regardless of quality. Fixed this by building domain authority before generating more AI content. Used [manual directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit the site to 200+ directories to establish baseline trust with Google. This part took an hour to set up, then ran automatically while I kept using AI for content.\n\nFirst three weeks after submission looked the same. Directory listings went live but those 20 blog posts still weren't ranking. Search Console showed increasing crawl frequency though, which meant Google was starting to pay attention. Week four through six is when everything changed. Domain authority moved from zero to 20. All 20 of those AI-generated posts suddenly started appearing in search results. New posts I published with ChatGPT showed up within days instead of sitting invisible for weeks.\n\nNow getting 500 organic visitors per month and it's climbing. The AI workflow is finally producing actual results because the foundation is in place. I can research a topic, generate an outline, write the post, and publish in under an hour instead of a full day. The interesting lesson is how AI and SEO work together. AI helps you create content 10x faster and maintain consistency, but it can't build the external signals that make Google trust your domain. You need both working together.\n\nStarted tracking time saved with the AI workflow. Before AI and authority building, one post took 4 hours to write and didn't rank. Now one post takes 45 minutes to write with AI assistance and ranks within a week because the domain foundation is solid. The AI-assisted SEO lesson is that tools and content generation are only half the equation. You can have perfectly written AI content, but without domain authority backing it up, you're just creating invisible pages faster.​",

There are so many AI tools out there these days, and honestly some of them are starting to feel bloated or just kind of boring after the hype wears off.\n\nRight now, the ones I use the most are still ChatGPT and Gemini. I decided not to renew Claude this year since I wasn’t really reaching for it anymore. Besides those, because I do ecommerce-related work, I end up using Genstore pretty often, along with Midjourney. I use Genstore to spin up small ecommerce sites, which has basically replaced the old manual WordPress setups I used to do. It’s just a lot more convenient. Midjourney is mainly for generating product images, which saves a lot of cost, and for visual work it still feels very worth the subscription.\n\nThere are plenty of other AI tools I’ve tried, but after looking at my actual workflow, I realized I’m fine sticking to their free or basic tiers. So I’m curious what everyone else is doing this year. Which AI products are you still paying for, and which features do you actually use often enough to feel like the subscription makes sense?",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month or so testing both TicNote and Plaud side by side for real-world use — lectures, meetings, and random conversations I thought I’d remember but never do. I see these two compared a lot, so I figured I’d share what actually stood out for me after using both consistently.\n\nWhat I was looking for\n\nMy needs were pretty straightforward: reliable recording, solid transcription, and summaries that actually help me do something afterward. I record a mix of classes and work meetings, sometimes several hours a day, so free usage limits and long-term cost also mattered more than flashy features.\n\nPlaud: first impressions\n\nPlaud looks nice out of the box. The hardware feels polished, and setup was simple enough. Recording itself works fine, and once a session ends, it generates a summary pretty quickly.\n\nWhere Plaud started to fall short for me was what happens after the recording. The summaries tend to be very broad — almost everything that’s mentioned gets included. That sounds good in theory, but in practice it means a lot of filler, repeated points, and side comments mixed in with the actually important stuff. It felt more like a compressed transcript than a real analysis. Also, transcription only happens after the recording ends, so during meetings I had no idea whether key points were being captured correctly.\n\nThe free usage is fairly limited too, and if you record often, you hit that ceiling faster than expected.\n\nMoving over to TicNote\n\nTicNote felt more workhorse than polished demo product. What immediately stood out was real-time transcription. Being able to glance down during a meeting and see that important points were actually being captured gave me way more confidence to stay present instead of taking manual notes.\n\nThe biggest difference, though, is how TicNote processes information. Its summaries are noticeably more selective. It does a better job filtering out verbal noise — offhand remarks, repeated phrasing, small talk — and highlighting decisions, deadlines, and actual takeaways. It feels like it’s actively asking, “What here matters?” instead of just summarizing everything equally.\n\nI also ended up using features I didn’t expect to care about, like the AI podcast-style recap. On days with long recordings, I’ll listen to a condensed audio summary while commuting, which is surprisingly effective.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the free 600 minutes made a big difference. On lighter weeks, I don’t even touch a paid plan. With Plaud’s 300 minutes, I was constantly aware of the limit.\n\nThe trade-offs\n\nPlaud is simpler and more minimal, which some people might prefer. If you mainly want a clean summary of everything that was said and don’t mind sorting through it yourself, it can work.\n\nTicNote feels more opinionated. It tries to interpret what’s important and what’s not, which won’t be perfect every time, but for me it reduced the mental effort after recording by a lot.\n\nMy takeaway\n\nIf you want basic recording and broad summaries with minimal setup, Plaud is fine.\n\nBut if your goal is to turn messy, real-world conversations into something you can actually review, act on, or study from — especially if you record often — TicNote ended up being the more useful tool for me. It saved me time after meetings, not just during them, and that’s what mattered most.",

Cold traffic. No fake urgency.  \n  \nSame prompt used everywhere.\n\n  \n\\#1 Lovable\n\nClean and polished UI.  \nNice spacing, typography, and visual balance.  \n  \nFeels production ready out of the box.  \n  \nMore focused on layout and aesthetics than lead flow logic.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/58u9zlbuopeg1.gif\n\n\\#2 Landerlab\n\nThis one stood out.  \n  \nNo form on the first screen.  \n  \nStarts with a short eligibility check instead.  \n  \nContact details are only requested after qualification.  \nFeels built for paid traffic and real lead gen workflows.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/swed63r1ppeg1.gif\n\n\\#3 Bolt\n\nSolid structure and clear copy.  \nMore content and sections than Lovable.  \n  \nPushes a full lead form immediately.  \nOptimized for volume over lead quality.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c06781l5ppeg1.gif\n\n\\#4 Figma Make\n\n Strong visual hierarchy and layout.  \nIntroduces hard qualifiers like ownership and spend.  \n  \nStill surfaces contact fields early.  \nFeels closer to a design tool than a funnel builder.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mmp48idappeg1.gif\n\nwhich one is your favorite?\n\n",

I keep seeing more and more where people are just done with automation for everything & tired of content that all looks the same\n\nSomeone said recently, “Why should I bother reading this if no one could be bothered to write it?” And then there’s a Substack essay I saw just now “we are not learning anymore”where they're arguing that generative AI isn’t just a crutch, it’s actually making us worse at thinking.\n\nIt does make sense to me. Most AI tools just give you what you ask for and they're fast, easy, forgettable, sometimes even make things up. There’s no friction, no challenge, nothing that actually helps you think or work for yourself. It’s like eating empty calories.\n\nSo I’m curious. How are you all feeling about this? Are you as fed up as everyone seems to be? Or do you see it differently?\n\nAnd here’s where I’ll admit something. I’ve actually been wrestling with this for a while, and it pushed me to try something different. I built Senelo which is a kind of AI thinking partner that doesn’t just spit out answers, but basically pushes back, and challenges you, and helps you actually think for yourself - stopping short of rushing to answers or anything like that. \n\nI’m not here to pitch I am just genuinely curious if anyone else is hungry for something different, or if you think the anti-AI backlash is just a phase.\n\nWould love to hear how you’re seeing it.\n\n  \n",

I dont mean any of this personally, I am just engaging with what I see in front of me, and we all like to believe that our tastes are refined, based on reason. But I dont think most of us, myself included, are fully honest about two things:\n\n1. We base our preferences to some degree on aesthetic preferences\n2. Those aesthetic preferences are subjective, inconsistent, and if left unchecked actively discourage us from trying new things.\n\nWith this framing, I have to back up and say this didn't start with AI. Take any fandom, or hobby, or \"special interest\" and you will find poeple who absolutely love it, and poeple who will shit on that. That's the crux of it for me, is that when we say \"poeple don't hate generated content\" which is empirically falsifiable but I recognize you mean the general poeple not the literal \"no one,\" but still I think that presumes a common standard that frankly doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not sure if I could survive listening to a full lifehouse song, its like being stretched and waterboarded at the same time, with a 27 second emotional note about how that feels with no resolution. But that's just me, something like at least 15 million poeple liked them. Conversely, traditional Korean music is something I have been enjoying lately, at the beginning is to me off key, but that is just how my ear has been trained. These are subjective experiences, and I do think it relates to this topic. This to me suggests that objective ear/eye/taste is a myth. Pushing past that comfort zone is something that needs to be consented to, but I think that is how we tune in to someone else and try to share their experience.\n\nI do think a lot of poeple could benefit from slowing down, and refining what they are working on a bit more to make sure its ready before asking someone else to take the time to consume it. That's common courtesy though, and if someone tells me they have done the best they can, I want to hear/see/watch/read it.\n\nSorry, I've been stuck in monologues today. I'm fed up with mean spirited dialogues I have been listening to my whole life.\n\nThere is the natural splendor all around us, and there is the human intent. Everything else is just noise.",

No matter how many instructions you add, you can’t rewrite its voice and tone, or the way it reasons, challenges, and adapts. The 8,000-character system prompt limit with OPENAI forces you to compress your customisation - leaving nuance, important (sometimes detailed) directives, and your actual goal cut short and likely lost to these limitations. \nYou get a tool that follows instructions, but can’t fundamentally change its core mandate or personality. The “custom” experience is skin only skin deep…\n\nIt’s only been out a week !! I’m getting a good amount of sign ups and I’ve had positive unsolicited feedback so far - that said I built the tool because my custom GPT wasn’t enough, I’m curious what other peoples experience is with tools that re available.",

You lose creativity, taste, and judgment the instant it completely eliminates friction. The techniques that slow you down a little, make better inquiries, or compel more explicit intent appear to work the best.  \n  \nTherefore, I believe that this is more of a correction than a phase.

      "text": "I’m a part-time video editor. In the past, my workflow relied heavily on Adobe Premiere, along with paid music and B-roll assets. I spent $50–$80 per month on tools and assets, including $23/month for Premiere. In terms of time, manual editing and assembling usually took me around 7-8 working days per month.\n\nOver the past two months, I started experimenting with AI tools for video editing, mainly to reduce production time and lower my time cost. Tbh, I initially assumed that using AI would increase my monthly tool expenses. Surprisingly, the opposite happened — my costs actually went down.\n\nHere’s what I’m currently using:\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Video editing — Vizard AI ($14.5/month for yearly creator plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Vizard allows you to edit videos by working directly with the transcript, which is especially effective for dialogue-driven content. It saves a lot of time that would otherwise be spent scrubbing timelines to find usable clips. It’s also great for short-form content, as it can automatically generate multiple viral clips, add B-roll and subtitles, and handle much of the repetitive editing work. While it can’t fully replace Premiere in areas like color grading or complex visual editing, using the two together is far more efficient than relying on Premiere alone.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Music generation — Musicful AI ($11.99/month for standard plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Musicful generates BGM based on text or images. The results aren’t always as polished as curated stock music and often require some tuning, but it significantly reduces both search time and licensing costs.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Video/image generation, creative ideas, and text — Gemini ($19.99/month for Pro plan)\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\*   Gemini Pro can be shared with up to five people via a family plan, and students can use it for free for one month. The video generation quality (Veo 3) is impressive, but usage is quite limited — around 3–5 videos per day. If you need higher volume, upgrading to the Ultra plan becomes necessary, and costs can quickly get out of control. For now, I’m still in the experimentation phase and haven’t upgraded to Ultra.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, I’m only using these three AI tools, which brings my monthly cost to about $41. If you share subscriptions with friends, this number can be even lower. Costs may increase in the future as I consume more assets, but so far, these tools have realistically freed up at least 3 full working days per month for me.\n\nI’m curious — have you found any more cost-effective tools? What AI tools have you used that significantly improved your video editing efficiency?",

That’s where AI really shifts things.\n\nOne thing that helped me was splitting tools by phase: ideation, assembly, finishing, and delivery. For ideation/structure, I lean on Claude or ChatGPT for scripts, hooks, and cut lists; for bulk short-form, Vizard/Riverside/Recast-type tools are great; and for final polish, I still jump into Premiere/Resolve for color, sound sweetening, and any detailed masking. Descript is also clutch when clients send messy talking-head stuff and want fast turnarounds with transcripts.\n\nIf you ever expand into client management or collaboration (esp. with agencies or startups), tools like Notion for briefs, [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) for review, and something like Cake Equity when you’re doing longer-term rev-share or equity deals with recurring clients can make the business side way smoother than email chaos. Main thing is: design a repeatable pipeline and price based on the new speed you’re getting, not your old day rate assumptions.",

Make sure you know what the actual story is, why it needs to exist, what you are trying to say, etc. Go over your character matrix and outline again and again. You really want an exhaustive outline. Then, when you're about to start the first draft, go into it with lowered expectations. The best AI can do for a novel/novella is to write a crappy first draft. OFC, break up the tasks by chapters, but really, break each chapter into three parts: the beginning, middle, and end.\n\nMake your own notes throughout the process of stuff that you want to layer in or change. And have another list of all the repetitive language that the AI uses: the words and phrases that keep getting peppered into every chapter. Write/edit the second draft yourself, using your notes for bigger stuff, then actually finding every single instance of repetitive language use and individually changing them yourself. If you do these things, your second draft will be more you than it.",
