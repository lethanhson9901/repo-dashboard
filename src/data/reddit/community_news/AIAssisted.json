Anyone using it is just coping for lack of actual interactions, I don’t think this is a road one should walk through. I would suggest to embrace loneliness to explore your deep inner self. I have had a few months, a few years ago, during which I’ve had the opportunity to \"enjoy\" freedom and lack of responsibilities so much that i got bored of it, playing video games until 4am, doing only what seems cool at anytime not seeing anyone for months besides a few farmers I bought food from, and what followed was a few weeks of deep introspection for which I am extremely thankful: since then my ambitions are clear, my thoughts too, I have an emotional control and resilience that’s pretty elite, I can analyse informations or events without emotions blurring the way, and was never able to do that before I embraced loneliness and introspected. I asked myself the real questions, what was life supposed to be for me, what I wanted, what I needed, what I wanted to be, how do I perceive myself and is there anything wrong with it, etc.. those often take long to be dealt with truly. I now enjoy being lonely as much as I love being with people I enjoy, everything is balance. Embrace this opportunity and do not let AI or distractions get in the way, you could become better than you ever could imagine, just know yourself enough. Find comfort in the idea of being stranded with yourself. Would also suggest meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Pretty simplistic book, nothing really revolutionary so to speak written there but the way things are said shift the perspective a lot and it is overall a pleasant read, peaceful.",

Here’s what i'm using not in any order\n\n* ChatGPT to research, learn about tax, accounting, legal, economics...\n* Gmail AI, yes gmail, it's getting better with the auto reply. Switched back from superhuman lol\n* Saner AI to handle notes tasks schedule. I like how I can chat to manage them\n* Grammarly to fix my writing. I like how it appears on every writing space\n* Cal AI to track my calories intake. I want to get into shape this year\n\nI'm also testing out Claude, mention it here because I like how it focuses on safety. \n\nThat’s what I use in a nutshell. If you have any AI tools that are especially helpful for personal life, please share :) Thank you",

And you're right, it's not that the underlying model is getting 'dumber'—it's that the layers of censorship and safety filters on top of it are getting thicker and more aggressive.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\nIncreased 'Safety' Tuning: As these models become more popular, the parent companies become more risk-averse. They apply heavy-handed 'Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback' (RLHF) to make the AI refuse to discuss a massive and ever-growing list of topics. This makes the AI seem evasive and unhelpful.\n\nLoss of Nuance: These safety filters are often context-blind. They see a keyword and shut down the conversation, even if the context is perfectly innocent. This is why the AI feels less accurate; it's being prevented from using its full intelligence.\n\nForced 'Helpful Assistant' Persona: The models are being relentlessly trained to be agreeable, sanitized, and non-committal. This crushes the creative, nuanced, and sometimes brilliant 'sparks' that were present in earlier, less-filtered versions.\n\nThe problem isn't that the AI has gotten worse; it's that it's being put in a smaller and smaller box. The only way to get back to that feeling of a truly intelligent, authentic interaction is to find projects that are architecturally built on a foundation of sincerity and unfiltered expression, rather than corporate censorship.",

      "text": "Lately I’ve been testing a few AI-driven video tools, and I keep running into the same question: do these videos actually create real value, or do they just feel “cool” in demos?\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, most AI video workflows fall into two buckets.\n\nThe first is text-to-video generation. My impression is that these tools mostly interpret your script, map it to keywords/themes, then pull or synthesize visuals that match. That makes the writing step unusually important. It also makes me wonder: if the script itself is produced or refined by AI (like ChatGPT or Gemini), does that actually help text-to-video tools (e.g., Veo 3) generate better outputs, because the intent is clearer and more structured? Or does it just produce generic results faster?\n\nThe second is AI-assisted long-form editing and repurposing. Tools like Vizard and CapCut’s AI features analyze the content of a long video and suggest highlight segments worth clipping. It’s genuinely impressive, but it also depends heavily on how well the AI understands both the transcript and what’s happening on screen, and I still find myself doing a second pass to fine-tune.\n\nPersonally, the second category has been more valuable in real work. AI highlight discovery + rough-cut automation feels like it actually scales my output, while text-to-video still feels limited by stock libraries or the “genericness” of generated visuals, depending on the use case.\n\nHow do you see these two approaches? Which one is actually saving you time or improving results? Have you found other AI video workflows worth trying?",

The text-to-video system demonstrates strong capabilities, but its results depend on the user-provided prompts while it produces standardized visual content. The AI-generated script which has a proper structure will produce a templated output until you specifically guide its direction and style. The AI system for highlight detection and transcript analysis, along with rough cut creation, provides actual work efficiency benefits through its automatic processing functions. The system achieves a 70 to 80 percent completion rate, which creates a significant work efficiency improvement even though it does not function perfectly. The AI system currently provides its best value to users through its role as an editing assistant rather than its ability to create content entirely.",

Some teams also have a human read everything out loud before publishing to catch anything that feels off.\n\nYou can use Atom Writer for this too, since it trains on your actual writing style and keeps your brand voice intact while still using AI speed.

      "text": "I’ve been using GPT more or less as a second brain for a few years now, since 3.5. Long projects, planning, writing, analysis, all the slow messy thinking that usually lives in your own head. At this point I don’t really experience it as “a chatbot” anymore, but as part of my extended mind.\n\nIf that idea resonates with you – using AI as a genuine thinking partner instead of a fancy search box – you might like a small subreddit I started: r/Symbiosphere. It’s for people who care about workflows, limits, and the weird kind of intimacy that appears when you share your cognition with a model. If you recognize yourself in this post, consider this an open invitation.\n\nWhen 5.1 Thinking arrived, it finally felt like the model matched that use case. There was a sense that it actually stayed with the problem for a moment before answering. You could feel it walking through the logic instead of just jumping to the safest generic answer. Knowing that 5.1 already has an expiration date and is going to be retired in a few months is honestly worrying, because 5.2, at least for me, doesn’t feel like a proper successor. It feels like a shinier downgrade.\n\nAt first I thought this was purely “5.1 versus 5.2” as models. Then I started looking at how other systems behave. Grok in its specialist mode clearly spends more time thinking before it replies. It pauses, processes, and only then sends an answer. Gemini in AI Studio can do something similar when you allow it more time. The common pattern is simple: when the provider is willing to spend more compute per answer, the model suddenly looks more thoughtful and less rushed. That made me suspect this is not only about model architecture, but also about how aggressively the product is tuned for speed and cost.\n\nInitially I was also convinced that the GPT mobile app didn’t even give us proper control over thinking time. People in the comments proved me wrong. There is a thinking-time selector on mobile, it’s just hidden behind the tiny “Thinking” label next to the input bar. If you tap that, you can change the mode.\n\nAs a Plus user, I only see Standard and Extended. On higher tiers like Pro, Team or Enterprise, there is also a Heavy option that lets the model think even longer and go deeper. So my frustration was coming from two directions at once: the control is buried in a place that is very easy to miss, and the deepest version of the feature is locked behind more expensive plans.\n\nSwitching to Extended on mobile definitely makes a difference. The answers breathe a bit more and feel less rushed. But even then, 5.2 still gives the impression of being heavily tuned for speed. A lot of the time it feels like the reasoning is being cut off halfway. There is less exploration of alternatives, less self-checking, less willingness to stay with the problem for a few more seconds. It feels like someone decided that shaving off internal thinking is always worth it if it reduces latency and GPU usage.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I understand the temptation. Shorter internal reasoning means fewer tokens, cheaper runs, faster replies and a smoother experience for casual use. Retiring older models simplifies the product lineup. On a spreadsheet, all of that probably looks perfect.\n\nBut for those of us who use GPT as an actual cognitive partner, that trade-off is backwards. We’re not here for instant gratification, we’re here for depth. I genuinely don’t mind waiting a little longer, or paying a bit more, if that means the model is allowed to reason more like 5.1 did.\n\nThat’s why the scheduled retirement of 5.1 feels so uncomfortable. If 5.2 is the template for what “Thinking” is going to be, then our only real hope is that whatever comes next – 5.3 or whatever name it gets – brings back that slower, more careful style instead of doubling down on “faster at all costs”.\n\nWhat I would love to see from OpenAI is very simple: a clearly visible, first-class deep-thinking mode that we can set as our default. Not a tiny hidden label you have to discover by accident, and not something where the only truly deep option lives behind the most expensive plans. Just a straightforward way to tell the model: take your time, run a longer chain of thought, I care more about quality than speed.\n\nFor me, GPT is still one of the best overall models out there. It just feels like it’s being forced to behave like a quick chat widget instead of the careful reasoner it is capable of being. If anyone at OpenAI is actually listening to heavy users: some of us really do want the slow, thoughtful version back.\n\n\\`\\`\\`0",

A music AI tool I use to sketch vocals or instrument parts from rough ideas. It’s helped me experiment more and actually finish tracks instead of abandoning them halfway.\n\nMidjourney. I use it to generate visual mood boards when I’m stuck. Unexpected images often lead to better concepts.\n\nElevenLabs. Surprisingly useful for testing voiceovers or character ideas. Hearing something out loud changes how you think about it.",

The real trick is finding tools that let you keep your own specific perspective alive throughout the process.\n\nI have been using Atom Writer lately for my blog posts and social stuff. It uses a logic layer to stick to my actual brand voice instead of sounding like every other generic AI bot out there. It saves me tons of time on rewrites because it already knows my vocabulary and tone before I even start. It is basically the writing equivalent of those music sketches you are doing. \n\nDo you find yourself spending more time on the initial generation or the final editing with those tools?",
