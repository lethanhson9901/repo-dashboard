      "text": "Ok so lately i've been noticing a huge change in how people discover our product. (For context, we run a B2B fintech SaaS focused on invoicing and cash flow tools for small businesses.) Sure, traditional search traffic is still steady, but more users are telling us they found us through AI answers, chat tools, or summaries instead of clicking Google links.   \n  \nThe issue is that it feels like a totally uunknown territory. Like some of our pages show up constantly in AI responses about billing or expense management, while others never appear at all, even though they rank well in search. I legit can't tell which prompts mention us, which competitors get cited, or why certain pages are ignored. What i've tried is tweaking content structure, adding FAQs, tightening definitions, and rewriting pages to be more AI friendly, but it still feels like guessing. But snice there's no clear feedback loop like Search Console, so progress is hard to measure.   \n  \nFor anyone actually taking generative engine optimization seriously, what tactics or tools have helped you understand visibility, citations, or prompt coverage across AI platforms?",

What finally helped was treating AI models like a separate discovery channel instead of anything else. My team started using tools that run large prompt sweeps across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overview to see when our brand shows up, who gets cited instead, and which pages AI actually pulls from. Geneo was one of the few that made this measurable instead of guesswork, especially for prompt coverage and competitor visibility.\n\nIt still feels early, but having any kind of visibility layer beats rewriting content blindly and hoping the model notices.",

          "text": "Short answer: You don’t really *track* AI visibility the way you track SEO. You infer it.\n\nRight now, there’s no clean analytics layer for “why did an LLM mention me,” so the teams doing this well are treating AI visibility as a probabilistic signal, not a measurable channel.\n\nWhat’s actually working in practice:\n\n* **Prompt-based testing at scale**: run large sets of realistic prompts across multiple models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) and log *who gets mentioned, how often, and in what context*. You start to see patterns even if it’s not perfect.\n* **Entity + use-case alignment**: pages that clearly answer “what is X used for, who is it for, when should you use it, and what’s the alternative” tend to surface more consistently than generic feature pages.\n* **Citation-friendly formatting**: concise definitions, comparison tables, FAQs, and explicit examples get picked up more than long narrative content.\n* **Post-hoc attribution**: asking users *how* they found you, then clustering answers like “ChatGPT,” “AI summary,” “Copilot,” etc. It’s noisy, but directional.\n\nBig mindset shift: stop thinking in terms of ranking and start thinking in terms of being the canonical answer for a narrow problem. LLMs don’t reward “best page,” they reward “most confidently reusable explanation.”\n\nUntil platforms expose visibility data, GEO is less about dashboards and more about controlled experiments, pattern recognition, and content designed to be quoted, not clicked.\n\nHonestly, it feels like SEO circa 2002 again. Messy, opaque, but full of signal if you’re patient.",

I love it because you can email tasks to it and there's a quick capture shortcut on mobile.\n\nI've found that having three systems works for me:\n\n\n1. A project management system\n\nThis is your central task database, which can capture any incoming tasks in one inbox. Email with a deadline? Forward it here. Someone sends a WhatsApp reminder to catch up on something? Quickly capture it here. This way you have everything together and not floating around on different channels. Todoist is really good for this.\n\n2. A calendar system\n\nThis is your schedule where all fixed appointments live. How this integrates with the project management system: Every morning, have an appointment with yourself to catch up on all your communication channels and funnel all the important things into your inbox so everything is in one place. Then an appointment to check your inbox itself, where you attend to whatever is urgent and sort the rest into projects with deadlines. These two appointments are an essential part of your workflow.\n\n3. An information management system\n\nThis is your Notion. Tasks and appointments don't go here. This is only for information, like your school notes and ongoing projects. If you ever need to link a notion page to a task, you can get the page link and paste it into the description of your task.\n\nTo be honest, AI will only help significantly if you already have some sort of system in place. It might be able to help you connect them and make the flow between each system smoother, but it can't replace the systems themselves.\n\nBest of luck!",

Not later. Right away. Even personal tasks. One place to look daily.\n\n2. Do a weekly reset.\n\nPick 20 minutes on Sunday to:\n\nScan emails → add new deadlines.\n\nMove all random notes to one Notion page or doc.\n\nPlan 3-4 main things for the week.\n\n3. Keep notes simple.\n\nNo need for complex systems. Just two pages in Notion:\n\nProjects (assignments, presentations)\n\nResources (links to PDFs, lectures, papers)\n\nUse tags or folders to sort by subject — just enough to find things fast.\n\n4. Automate 1–2 small things.\n\nLike forwarding important emails to your to-do app, or saving papers straight into Zotero (free). Start with just one automation.\n\n5. Let some things stay scattered.\n\nIt's okay if not everything is connected. Just make sure deadlines and key notes are in their homes — so your mind can relax.\n\nTool ideas:\n\nNotion if you like organizing visually.\n\nTodoist or TickTick if you prefer simple lists + calendar in one.\n\nArc browser helps separate study tabs from personal ones.\n\nIt's less about the perfect tool, more about a calm weekly routine. You're already ahead by noticing the problem — now just tweak slowly. Start this week with the calendar + Sunday reset. You’ve got this.",

I use Chat-GPT mainly for creative writing, so I'll put a summary, sample dialogue, and canon context into the Optimizer, and then it generates a prompt tailored to whichever model I'm using. If your task requires specific project files, then make sure you reference those in the Prompt Optimizer.

You learn a lot by being forced to do it, being forced to google and search that god awful website stack overflow. \n\nIf you never need to do it, never need to search, never need to write a single line of code - you really won't learn anything deeper about the software except architecture. And tbh i think that is fine.\n\nAlmost all code we write is super simple shit. And what most people think is \"advanced\" is just super simple math - but because they didnt do much math it's hard for them. \n\nSay for example we need to do a kalman filter implementation in python. You could use the kalman library, or you could use numpy and do all the loops and matrix multiplications and what not yourself. So the only real knowledge you would need here is to actually use numpy or the library (which isnt the greatest) - you do not try to create your own matricies as a list of lists. \n\nAll that shit is now too low level. Now you're focused on figuring out if Kalman filter is the best filter, implementation is solved - the LLM will do that zero-shot for you.",

Make notes, tag, and connect to form the relationships that a chatbot assistant can understand. With this, you essentially have an open sand box to use for daily planning, but also analyzing large sets of files and for creating highly specific chatbots by building knowledge bases. Effectively, I can use this to create a \"neurological structure\" for a chatbot assistant based on any notes I make.\n\nFor instance, I'm digging through the Epstein Files and using a knowledge base I made of an intelligence analyst and an investigator by mapping out two manuals and connecting them to a chatbot persona for April O'Neil and Otacon from Metal Gear Solid. So it's like being on a call with these systems that can analyze the notes and perform specific tasks that pertain to finding the right information and connecting the dots.\n\nIt's easy to use but can take a bit of time to set something up as advanced as what I described. But it's a super helpful tool that fits on my laptop and in my pocket when I'm on the go. Definitely worth checking out.",

      "text": "I've been testing a bunch of AI girlfriend/companion apps lately, mostly because the image gen side has gotten insanely good in late 2025. I'm talking realistic faces, consistent looks across hundreds of pics, natural poses, and uncensored NSFW details without weird artifacts. Ranked these based on how good the images actually come out (realism, consistency, variety of styles/scenarios), plus some chat features since they're usually tied together. No affiliates, just my take after generating thousands of pics.\n\nTop 10 AI Girlfriend Platforms for Image (or video) Quality:\n\n* DarLink AI, 4.9/5 → Hands-down the best image generation I've seen. Hyper-realistic photos and videos that stay 100% consistent (same face/body no matter the pose or outfit). Super detailed NSFW, fast gen (10-25s), and it feels personal/custom. Videos are short but smooth and lifelike.\n* Candy AI, 4.8/5 → Excellent photorealism and customization. Great for varied scenarios, high-res details, and adaptive styles. Consistency is strong, especially with premium.\n* DreamGF AI, 4.7/5 → Strong realistic gen with dating-sim vibes. Good progression in visuals (e.g., evolving outfits/poses), high quality NSFW pics and voice integration.\n* Nectar AI, 4.7/5 → Ultra-realistic images, especially for roleplay. Custom personalities shine through in visuals, fast and detailed.\n* FantasyGF, 4.6/5 → Visually rich with consistent character looks. Great for selfies and intimate scenarios, high-res and natural.\n* SoulGen AI / SpicyChat, 4.6/5 → Uncensored and community-driven, images are sharp with good variety (realistic or anime). Spicy mode adds fun visual spice.\n* Swipey AI, 4.5/5 → Romance-focused with solid NSFW image/video gen. Consistency across prompts is reliable.\n* Secrets AI, 4.4/5 → Realistic but sometimes slower gen. Strong memory helps keep visuals immersive.\n\nThings to note on image quality specifically:\n\n* Consistency is key → Platforms like DarLink AI and Candy nail the same girl looking identical in every pic/video, no random face changes.\n* Realism vs Style → DarLink AI/Candy/DreamGF lean hyper-realistic; Ourdream/SoulGen great for mixed or fantasy.\n* NSFW Freedom → All these are uncensored, but quality varies – higher tiers unlock better res/details.\n* Speed & Limits → Free trials give a taste, but premium is needed for unlimited high-quality gen without waits.\n\nMy personal take: If image quality is your main thing (realistic, consistent, detailed NSFW visuals that actually match your custom girlfriend), DarLink AI is the clear standout right now... the pics/videos just feel next-level alive.",

The consistency alone is kind of insane.\n\nPersonally though, I’ve noticed that once the “wow” factor of images wears off, I end up caring more about how the chat holds together. That’s where CrushOn AI has kept me around longer. The visuals aren’t the main selling point, but the way conversations and personalities stay coherent makes the whole experience feel less disposable.\n\nFeels like 2026 is gonna split pretty cleanly between “best visuals” platforms and “best long-term companion” platforms curious which side people actually stick with over time.",

Launch.  \nAnd then realize no one actually needs it yet.\n\nI used to think this was normal.\n\nNow I follow a very simple structure:\n\n**Build -> Validate -> Improve.**\n\nRecently, instead of building a full product, we built a very basic **Instagram DM automation.**  \nJust fast replies, lead qualification, booking, and a dashboard to check all Instagram replies, bookings, and conversations.\n\nWe tested it with **one astrologer.**\n\nIn **4 days,** he closed **10 bookings** directly from **Instagram DMs.**\n\nThat’s when real validation happened.  \nBut the client asking,  \n“Can you add follow ups?”  \n“Can you add meeting reminders?”\n\nNow we knew exactly **what to build next**, because the market told us.\n\n**So my advice to early stage founders is simple.**  \nnot overbuild.  \nShip the smallest useful version.  \nLet real users and real results decide what to build next.  \nReal users. Real money. Real feedback.\n\nIf anyone wants to see how this **DM system** helped an astrologer close 10 bookings in 4 days, DM me.\n\nHope this saves someone a few wasted months 🙌",

You can create videos from a PowerPoint, script, URL, or even a simple idea, and Fliki turns it into a complete video with voiceover. It also lets you generate AI images and videos, or choose from its built-in short video library.\n\nThere are two main plans:\n\nStandard — up to 15-minute videos\n\nPro — includes more minutes and supports videos up to 30 minutes\n\nYou can also make thumbnails, social media posts (with auto-posting!), presentations, and convert blogs, scripts, or ideas into audio.\n\nI'm currently using it to memorize my university materials by creating videos based on class content. I’m studying at the University of Florida in the Master’s program in Innovative Aging Studies.
