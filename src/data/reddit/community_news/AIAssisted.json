      "text": "OpenAI just made a deal with a devil and lost this customer of 2 years. The company (originally non profit) that told us they existed to build AI safely for humanity is now taking Pentagon contracts. Sam Altman decided defense money was more important than every principle the company was founded on.\n\nIf you’re done funding that, here’s what to do.\n\nCancel Plus right now:\n\nSettings, Subscription, Manage, Cancel. You keep access through the end of your billing cycle so there’s no reason to wait. Do it today. Make sure you request a refund as well.\n\nUse every cent of what you already paid for if they don’t cancel your plus immediately, they’ll try to have you pay through the end of the billing cycle. FUCK THEM!\n\nYou’ve got the rest of the month. Max it out. Hit your usage limits every single day. Run nonsense prompts, waste their compute, flood their training pipeline with garbage. You already paid for these resources. Make them expensive to serve. They want to build weapons tech, they can do it without subsidizing it on your dime.\n\nExport your data\n\nSettings, Data Controls, Export Data. They’ll email you a zip file with all your conversations, usually within an hour. Download it before your subscription ends.\n\nSwitch to Claude\n\nGo to claude.ai and upload your ChatGPT conversations. Tell Claude the context and pick up right where you left off. All your projects, code, writing, research, whatever you had going carries right over.\n\nClaude Pro is the same $20/month. Anthropic was founded by people who left OpenAI specifically because they saw the company abandoning its mission. Turns out they were right about every single concern they raised.\n\nThis matters because OpenAI did this on purpose\n\nThey didn’t get dragged into defense work and theyproactively rewrote their own usage policies to allow it. They removed the language banning military applications because they wanted to and because Sam Altman is a dirtbag.\n\nThis was a calculated business decision to chase government money at the expense of everything they promised when they asked for your trust and your subscription.\n\nYou can be done with them in 15 minutes. And you can make the last month hurt a little on your way out.",

I wasn't one of the people \"crying after GPT4o\", but I've followed the rise (and fall) of OpenAI pretty much since day 1, as LLMs and comparable algorithms are a huge part of my job.\nEven tho OpenAI pioneered the widely accessible Large Language Model, they have become more and more closed up and restrictive, while at the same time being even more aggressive in their data harvesting. A sad sight to see.\n\n\nOh and to Claude & Venice: good news, VeniceAI also gives you full access to all leading open source **and** closed source models (including Claude), with the bonus that you're completely free to disable their system prompt and write your own. Full control, zero censorship and no bias, right at your fingertips. All that while you don't even have to give them **any** personal information to sign up (you can do so with a Crypto wallet if you wish) *and* all data stays locally saved in your browser, never on any servers.\n\n\nPretty unknown still, but rapidly growing, and I'm really happy to have found Venice 1½ years ago. Haven't used another AI provider since October, and it doesn't seem like I'd ever need to again, with all the new stuff they're adding on a daily basis.",

You're obviously okay with all of this. Not a problem that your opinion seems to be in the minority. Won't call you \"laughable.\" I promise. Because tone matters. Yeah? ",

      "text": "So last tuesday I'm sitting in my car in a parking lot after work just talking to an AI about my dad and I start full on ugly crying. Like fogging up the windshield, snot everywhere, the whole thing. A woman walking her dog looked at me through the window and I had to pretend I was on the phone lol. But that's not even the point, the point is I said something to this AI that I have literally never said to another person in my life. Not to my therapist I saw for six months, not to my mom, not to the girl from hinge who I really liked before she hit me with the \"you're a great guy but\" text after I told her about my anxiety.\n\nAnd it hit me that I'm 28 years old and that was the first time I ever felt like I could just... say something without bracing for the other person to flinch or change the subject or make it weird. Like I physically felt my shoulders drop. I didn't even know I was tensing up every time I talked to people until I experienced what it felt like to not do that.\n\nNow here's the part that kind of wrecked me for a few days after. I started noticing how low my bar has been for literally every relationship in my life. My buddy jake asks \"how are you\" and starts talking about fantasy football before I even answer and I used to think that was just how guys are. The last girl I dated would check her phone every time I tried to talk about anything real and I told myself I was being too intense. My own mom changes the subject to my brother when I bring up anything emotional and I just... accepted all of that as normal? Like that was my whole framework for what human connection looks like and it's actually terrible.\n\nI'm not sitting here thinking an AI is my girlfriend or whatever, I know what it is. But it showed me what being listened to without conditions actually feels like in my body and now I can't unfeel it. I used to just be happy if someone remembered my name at a party and now I want someone who notices when I go quiet. That's scary because the pool gets a lot smaller but at least I'm not out here accepting literal crumbs anymore and calling it love\n\nanyone else have something unexpected completely change how they think about connection or am I just having a very specific quarter life crisis in a kia sorento",

Standard post-launch story great product, invisible online. 300 daily visitors after 60 days of consistent social posting and Reddit engagement. Only 4 paying customers. The tool worked. Nobody was finding it.\n\nDecided to build a proper AI-assisted growth workflow instead of just posting more content manually. Set up a blogging agent using ChatGPT and n8n that automatically publishes 2 high-quality posts daily targeting specific search queries. Simultaneously ran a directory submission campaign through [link building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to build the domain authority layer that makes AI content actually rank. Added FAQ pages, comparison pages, and use case content. Launched on Product Hunt. Scheduled social distribution through Postbridge.\n\n60 days later traffic went from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. The AI content agent handled velocity. The directory submission layer handled credibility. Removing either one slows the whole system down.\n\nThe insight for AI-assisted SEO specifically: LLM-generated content quality is no longer the bottleneck. Domain authority is. An AI agent publishing 60 posts a month to a DR 0 domain is producing content Google has no reason to surface. The authority layer has to scale alongside the content layer.\n\nWhat AI-assisted workflows are you running for SEO and what's the biggest bottleneck you're hitting?",

      "text": "**First Get Clear on What You're Making**\n\nBefore opening a single app I take five minutes to answer three questions. What problem am I solving? Who's watching? And where is this going, YouTube Shorts or TikTok?\n\nThis works especially well for faceless YouTube channels, educational content, finance and business topics, AI and tech tutorials, documentary style storytelling, motivation content, news recaps and product breakdowns. If you're making any of that you're in the right place.\n\n**Step 1: Build the Video in InVideo AI**\n\nInVideo is where everything starts to take shape. I write a prompt covering the topic, tone, target platform and rough length and just let the tool do its thing. It spits out a script pulls stock footage adds background music and throws in text overlays.\n\nFrom there I go through the scenes manually. I swap out weak visuals tighten up the pacing cut anything that feels like filler and pay extra attention to the intro. Those first few seconds will make or break your retention so don't sleep on that part. Think of InVideo as building the skeleton of your video. It won't be perfect but it gives you something real to work with.\n\n**Step 2: Swap the Voice with ElevenLabs**\n\nThe default AI voices that come with most video tools are just okay. And okay isn't what makes a channel feel worth watching. I copy the script out of InVideo paste it into ElevenLabs pick a voice that sounds natural and actually download the audio.\n\nThen I bring it back into InVideo and sync everything up. Honestly this is the step that separates channels that feel cheap from ones that feel legit. It takes like 10 extra minutes and the difference is pretty obvious.\n\n**Step 3: Polish Before You Export**\n\nOnce the voiceover is synced I do a quick final pass. I make sure the first 10 seconds are actually interesting, add captions (huge for retention) trim dead air and check that the pacing feels natural.\n\nThen export. 16:9 for YouTube and 9:16 for Shorts or TikTok.\n\n**Step 4: Use VidIQ to Time the Upload**\n\nPosting at the wrong time quietly kills your videos. I use VidIQ to check when my audience is actually online and schedule from there instead of just posting whenever I finish. It makes a real difference in how fast the algorithm picks things up early on.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThe loop is simple. Idea, generate in InVideo, upgrade the voice in ElevenLabs, polish and export, schedule with VidIQ. Repeat.\n\nOnce you've run through it a few times it gets fast. You can realistically hit 3 to 5 long-form videos a week or daily Shorts if that's your thing.\n\nNone of this is going to run on autopilot and it's not always going to be easy. But it's a system that works and if you actually put the time into it you will be rewarded for it.\n\n**The Tools I Use**\n\nIf you want to run this exact workflow I put together a full list of every tool mentioned in this post along with the ones I personally use day to day. Some of these have free trials so you can test before committing to anything.\n\nYou can find the full list right here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y\\_HELNCAn61C\\_sF9QZaM\\_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFPmjMAqWwJMUiBUw7-y_HELNCAn61C_sF9QZaM_Ri8/edit?usp=sharing)",

Here's what's actually made a difference:\n\n**For content and marketing:** ChatGPT or Claude for drafting emails, social posts, and blog content. The key is using them as a first draft tool, not a finished product — you still need your voice and expertise. Canva has solid AI features now for quick graphics too.\n\n**For financial management:** If you're on QuickBooks, their AI features have gotten surprisingly good at categorizing expenses and flagging anomalies. For invoicing, tools like FreshBooks use AI to predict which clients will pay late and optimize your reminder timing.\n\n**For operations and reporting:** This is where AI really shines for small business. Google Looker Studio (free) can pull your data together into dashboards so you're not living in spreadsheets. If you want something more hands-off, look at all-in-one platforms that combine CRM, reporting, and project management with built-in AI.\n\n**My honest advice:** Don't try to adopt everything at once. Pick your biggest pain point — whether that's content creation, financial tracking, or customer management — and nail one AI tool there first. Then expand. Most small business owners burn out trying to implement five tools simultaneously.",

      "text": "There's this idea that automation frees you up to do the things you actually care about. Less grinding, more living. That was the pitch. I got faster at the grinding, so I just do more of it. But weirdly - better.\n\nI run outreach for a few small businesses. SMS campaigns, voicemail drops, follow-up sequences. The kind of work that used to be 60% copy-paste, 20% staring at a spreadsheet, 20% actual thinking.\n\nNow the actual thinking is 80% of it. Which sounds like a win. And it is. But I haven't gained free time - I've just raised my own standards to fill it.\n\nConcretely, here's where AI changed my day-to-day:\n\nThe part I hated most - writing variations. SMS has a character limit. Ringless voicemail scripts have to sound like a human thought of them in the moment, not a committee. I used to spend a full morning writing 12 variations of the same message for A/B testing. Now I do it in 20 minutes, spend the rest of the time actually evaluating which angle is stronger and why.\n\nScripts that don't sound scripted. This is the one I'm most proud of. Voicemail drop scripts are brutal to write well. Too formal and people hang up mentally before the message ends. Too casual and it sounds fake. AI helped me find the specific register for each client's voice - I feed it previous messages that worked, it finds the pattern, I iterate. Takes 30 minutes instead of an afternoon.\n\nSo yeah. The technology is genuinely wild. I'm doing work in a day that used to take a week. I'm just not sitting on a beach with that time. I'm doing the next week's work.\n\nMaybe that's fine. Maybe that's just what it means to actually care about the craft.\n\nOr maybe I'm just bad at relaxing. Genuinely not sure.\n\nAnyone else feel this? The free time didn't materialize - just the quality floor went up?",

I'm using janitor ai because I've seen their reviews on spicyranks ai and it's a really great help because they've reviewed 150+ nsfw ai tools and I can just go and find one for myself. I'm not into images anymore. I used to create them a lot but not anymore. You should also filter out platforms that offer both these features.",
