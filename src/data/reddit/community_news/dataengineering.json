      "text": "I'm a data engineer in energy trading. Mostly real-time/time-series stuff. Kafka, streaming pipelines, backfills, schema changes, keeping data sane. The data I maintain doesn't hit PnL directly, but it feeds algo trading, so if it's wrong or late, someone feels it.\n\nI use AI a lot. ChatGPT for thinking through edge cases, configs, refactors. Copilot CLI for scaffolding, repetitive edits, quick drafts. It's good. I'm definitely faster.\n\nWhat I don't get is the vibe at work lately.\n\nPeople are running around talking about how many agents they're running, how many tokens they burned, autopilot this, subagents that, some useless additions to READMEs that only add noise. It's like we've entered some weird productivity cosplay where the toolchain is the personality.\n\nIn practice, for most of my tasks, a good chat + targeted use of Copilot is enough. The hard part of my job is still chaining a bunch of moving pieces together in a way that's actually safe. Making sure data flows don't silently corrupt something downstream, that replays don't double count, that the whole thing is observable and doesn't explode at 3am. \n\nSo am I missing something? Are people actually getting real, production-grade leverage from full agent setups? Or is this just shiny-tool syndrome and everyone trying to look \"ahead of the curve\"?\n\nGenuinely curious how others are using AI in serious data systems without turning it into a religion. On top of that, I'm honestly fed up with LI/X posts from AI CEOs forecasting the total slaughter of software and data jobs in the next X months - like, am I too dumb to see how it actually replaces me or am I just stressing too much with no reason?",

If your company has ample confluence docs, uses jira well, uses datadog or some central observability, GitHub, Aws, then just using the relevant mcps + clis with an agent cli can do pretty wild stuff.

You can use skills that teach it your particular workflows (eg when you make a pr, watch the ci to pass, if it fails investigate logs on circleci using circleci mcp).",

I have been doing A LOT of heavy lifting in my snowflake DB over the last few months. things like data categorizing, describing, etc all via json within column and table comments.  i was able to analyze a table today that was 3b records with 96 columns. in almost 2 hours. extracted the analysis (which was quite good despite some issues), extract the analysis to a word document report, and a powerpoint executive summary.\n\n3. Another webapp hosted on databricks, that stole the scripting from jsoncrack to display all of the executed query stats and explain plans i have been collecting. connect it to the table in snowflake, display the variant column in the graph area.  i did ZERO coding to get this done, it simply ripped off another site.\n\n4.  Yesterday i vibe coded an executable that i could hare across the greater team to get them setup with all of the tools we are being pushed to use by management. double click the icon and it will scan the machine and install anything missing, from VSCode with the required extensions and python, as well as go to jfrog so that the users can register their tokens to access the pip artifactory. \n\nim also doing standard DDL and DML work from VSCode by prompting what i want now that i have a connector file defined in python.  i just tell claude to login to the snowflake account and drop a table by name. it does it. I was able to restore a dropped table via timetravel as well by specifying the date it was dropped on.  it just writes the .py scripts for me and executes them. it shows me the scripts so i can review then before i allow it to do its thing in terminal. \n\nall of that said.  i can only imagine how much this is costing my company, but they dont seem to give two shits.  so im figuring I would engage in some malicious compliance and get EVERYONE using it to blow up the costs.  i probably used enough water to hydrate a small city over the last couple of weeks though.   \n\n  \nVERY cool tool set to have, but it definitely feels icky to use. \n\n  \n23 yrs xp at a fortune whatever company.",

Make sure you like the safety steps, and see if there's a risk for them. \n\nForget the whole \"7 agents at once\" bits: You don't need it. But having a coordinator just spawn a separate context that puts on a \"hat\" to check for observability, or that tries to figure out a good safety check to make sure that the numbers line up from the beginning to the end makes it far more effective than a one-shot.\n\nIs your plan good enough? Sure. And I bet it was good enough with no AI whatsoever. But that's not the question: The question is whether you can end up with a workflow that is faster and just as safe. For me there's many tasks where it just speeds things up. A setup where the agents do absolutely everything takes a lot more tooling around everything, and it might not make sense for you: It sure doesn't for me.

But still, like LLMs, it's just a tool.  \n\nPeople who use it because it exists, or refuse to use it because whatever reason aren't the smartest. You have to know how and why you use it in your environment, to use it or not in an optimal way, and integrated with your process and other tools.\n\nIt requires of course a good evaluation of the tool itself, first by discovering what it can do, then what problems it raises, to finally estimate ROI.\n\nThe question is how do you use them in your process, what activities do you delegate to them, how do you prepare its tasks, what outputs do you check. It will change deeply how we work - what activities we do. And for the moment I've seen nobody using them like that. Even people using agents.\n\nSo yeah, you should see and explore what agents can do. And yeah, people slamming agents everywhere are mostly suffering from shiny tool syndrom. \n\nBut also yeah, AI and agents are a revolution that will deeply impact the SW community. They'll do most of the \"realisation\" steps instead of SW engineers and the valuable skills will change (coding is not valuable anymore).",

      "text": "I am a Senior Manager in Data Engineering. Conducted a third round assessment of a potential candidate today. This was a design session. Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

Almost as if the job is bleeding more into data analytics, which requires content knowledge. \n\nagain, I'm not a talisman nor an expert, my imposter syndrome is huge (an im still not sure if it's justified or not), but I think the \"boiler-room\" style where we need to blindfold code a hardware driver to prove skill is dead. \n\nI started in finance, and there was a lot of eminence based decision making. where some dude who made a killing in xyz business cycle was treated as god because he got lucky and misattributed his luck as skill (look at hedgefund averages against the sp500, active management is a joke).

And perhaps in the future, that gets harnessed to its full effect, and we, humans, become the house pets of a race of AI.\nUntil then, however, my experience with AI is ‘meh’,. I have, perhaps, a 33% success-rate with AI in my day-to-day. it is super helpful with anything code-related (although it tends to over-compensate), however, I find it horrible at troubleshooting (it tends to just regurgitate things I have already tried) and design ( it just spews whatever I can already find on any website/blog)\n\nSo no, I disagree with you. Humans, currently, have elements that an AI doesn’t, and which isn’t just a matter of ‘#of neurons’.\nThe reward function is different. An AI doesn’t need to eat, drink or sleep, doesn’t need to impress a wife/parents/friends. It doesn’t have a social standing. And thus, it does not have the INSPIRATION or the DRIVE that drives novel and creative solution thinking.\nCase in point: the AI never challenges our underlying assumptions or design decisions. It doesn’t evaluate the current-scope challenge in the larger scope of our environment for future scalability. It doesn’t, and cannot, “read the room”, or understand the political environment that might make a sound technical decision impractical. It doesn’t understand the cultural elements of the organisation, technical debt, or key-person dependencies that are outside of the context of my query.\n\nI guess it could do all of this, given the proper programming and proper dat-. But I think you underestimate the amount of information a human processes during the course of a day.\nFor an AI to get that same information, you would need to have audio and video feeds from every coffee machine, hallway and canteen table., background information on every person etc.\n\nAll of the above is what YOU bring to the table, and is where you are needed to evaluate whatever the AI spews out in context. If you can’t show me that YOU have the fundamental knowledge to do that, then you are not interesting as a candidate. \n\nAnyone can operate an AI - not everyone can evaluate its output",

Because humans are liars. We often believe we know things when we are wrong and bias our answers based on what is believed as the socially correct answer. Intent or malice is not necessary for being wrong sometimes. And sometimes we know we are wrong but social pleasantries demand it.\n\nLeadership and those unusually influential people socially do not follow the herd. They are working from a broader set of parameters and step against that grain. When hiring for a role we're looking for a person with expertise in that space. A mix of parameters that if they predict in their domain will be accurate more often than the AI trained on the patterns of the not-experts in that domain.\n\nWith repetition we're going to have our information space conform to what the tools we're using puts out, as we're feeding patterns of data that trains that AI. That's going to form the Instagram effect where the look and the style of large clusters of people conform to a social average. This conversion will happen with AI flavors and if large enough a group will involve a social stickiness to those modes of thinking wrong or not with an emotional reaction enforcing the social blob that comes out of that.\n\nGoing back to basics of learning to think how to think is a useful counter balancing force to this. Carve out the portfolio of where you spend your attention in your information diet to have Plato and Aristotle reps in there. The foundational thinking patterns that blossomed eventually into scientific method. Those human stories in early writing covering ranges of human experience and emotion, detached from the AI blob. Can trim the influence the AI-instagram-effect will have and retain your expertise by continuing to have frameworks for thinking that differs from a social blob of consensus, because that is what expertise is when you're leading.\n\nWe can predict there will be those who spend all of their attention on the AI blob and that will be incredibly sticky. There will be continuation of algorithm-psychosis where groups of people are peering through a funhouse mirror view of reality due to a poor information diet.\n\nI agree navigating hiring through a novel social transformation is a strange time. Good news is that we have pattern recognition from history of similar times and can make some predictions on how that plays out. E.g. introduction of coin for the first time transformed the nature of human connection to neighbors, with transition to purpose in life and spiritual story telling on why we're here. Industrial revolution is one we're still not done working through, transitioning from social story telling oriented on an agriculture lifestyle when we have become urban things with material abundance. And then information abundance with the internet added on top of that. And then an accelerant of even more information abundance faster from AI tools. Going back to the slower velocity data when writing was backed for long stretches of deep thought is a good balance to slow down that information is moving too fast.",

With heavy use of resume screening/ ATS I think hiring process is messed up enough ,but atleast if it can be causal discussion like a brainstorming sessions between team mates on what they are working on or rather kind of work they might be picking up if selected might get us somewhere better than standard set of AI generated questions/ answers in leet code style coding / design rounds avoiding any scope for using our heads.

      "text": "Keen for any thoughts or feedback.\n\nBackground - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.\n\nChallenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’\n\nI’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.\n\nTLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.\n\nYou can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.\n\nUltimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.\n\nIf your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.\n\nI say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.\n\nIf you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

I am sorry to say it, but he is already planning to get rid of you, otherwise your input would be valued.  Don't assume that a long tenure of good work, or good relationships elsewhere in the company, will save you - if your reporting line is against you, it's over (unless you can move laterally within the org, but you would likely have to substantially change roles to get out from under the CTO.)  Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out.  They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.\n\nThe safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust.  Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished.  It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits.  I am sorry you are dealing with this, but you should not pass up outside opportunities while holding onto \"hope\" that something gets better there.",

Far more common than you might think.\n\nThe core problem is your executive leadership has lost confidence in the existing technical organisation and is under pressure to show transformation, likely driven by AI anxiety. They don’t want to hear that the real answer is hiring more operational people. The new CTO’s mission is to shake things up, and you’re perceived as part of the legacy problem. That’s why you’re being sidelined — you’re a threat to the new charter.\n\nWhat comes next? New vendor commitments (to GCP in this case), new hires and contractors (many coming from his personal network) all unfolding rapidly and without involving you. You’ll find yourself outside more and more decisions that you perceive as falling squarely within your domain and hearing of shifts that undermine you second and third hand.\n\nYou have three options.\n\nGet on the bus. Recognise this is a relationship problem between you and the new CTO and invest in aligning yourself with his agenda. This requires swallowing some pride but keeps you relevant and inside the tent. You have to be willing to give everything up. But you may find there is a lot of opportunity to learn new things. You don’t know it all.\n\nRide it out. The CTO will succeed or fail, but it will take 12-18 months to know which. If you choose this path, lay low. Don’t initiate actions that accelerate your own marginalisation — including writing that document you mentioned without being asked for it. And be clear-eyed about what failure actually looks like: it won’t revert to how things were. It will be a Pyrrhic victory. You’ll be in a new fractured world that is in many ways harder to operate within and the core problem with executive leadership will still be there. Your reputation will never return to what it was within the organization.\n\nGet off the bus. If getting on the bus isn’t something you can do with integrity, this is probably your best option. Leave on your own terms, with your reputation intact, before the situation inflicts more damage on your motivation and self worth.",

Or you end in a company on a budget where you have large amounts of data. Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant 😂\n\nBut my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data. At this moment the salary of the experts is ticking, so when the data engineer comes in, he/she is already behind schedule. Therefore you will never be successful.\n\nI think a lot of newcomers experience this. While the data science people will always be against you, because it is easy to blame the data engineer.",

They're composed of a few people who sometimes are not experienced or do not have the resources for an interesting project.

I still keep a DE role part of the time, but it's almost 100% AI agent driven set-and-forget kinda stuff now, for your typical non-global-scale startup or mid sized company, and it wouldn't be unfeasible for me to fully automate it into a strictly supervisory role if I invested the time and energy.\n\nAlso, as a pure DE, I felt no job satisfaction at all as my end users were always internal and companies largely pretend you don't exist until something is broken, then it's your fault. It's a nice feeling to ship features real field customers will use at scale. Whatever beautiful infrastructure or pipelines you build, the consuming analyst or DS will always get the glory/satisfaction of the discovery. There was also always a sense of being a \"fake software engineer\" whose \"code\" is mostly configs and baby scripts for various tools. And don't get me started on the endless tedious SQL some analyst half baked 5 years ago and now it's your responsibility to babysit for eternity in production.",

Why can't we just go back to filling out forms on pieces of paper? Paper doesn't run out of battery or need an internet connection.\n\nHaven't really been in this game that long, although from what I gather it's because data is a lot more complicated now than it was 15 years ago.  So complicated to the point where not everything is one size fits all, thus, you have a lot of tools which do \"the same thing\" except they aren't the same because they might have features others don't and/or fit other use cases better.\n\n>just f’ing get the data into a data warehouse and manipulate the data sql and you are DONE.\n\nSomebody I know has this attitude.  Not quite the same although, in short, they have completely rejected everything about the modern world to the point where they have \"modern tech\" which, ironically, resembles much older tech and struggle participating in society.  Partly due to stubborness, partly due to being a recluse and having nobody around to challenge their worldview.\n\nMy suggestion? It's very unlikely we are going to go backwards, so you may as well get used to it.  Their view point? \"Things should go back to the way I want\".",

          "text": "Ooo ooo ooo! I like this one.\n\nIt’s a mix of business fads, a mini bubble in SaaS, and the natural tendency for SaaS product bloat.\n\nStarting the mid-2000s there were a string of data-centric business fads. “Big data” was the first, followed by “Data Science”, followed by “ML”. Each of these *are* real, legitimate things, but I say “fad” because C-Suite execs didn’t understand them but knew they “had to have them because it’s the future”. This led to wasteful spending but LOTs of company budgets dedicated to data-related tools and teams.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 2010s there was also a mini-bubble among VCs about SaaS companies. My opinion is that there were some embarrassing consumer sector VC-funded busts like WeWork. So VC money pivoted to SaaS. You could also say they were following the dumb easy money that was all those execs throwing money at anything “data” so they can impress their friends.\n\nAround 2020 this started to die down. The market got more competitive. Growth stalled. So a company like Hightouch that built a really good, really specific tool (reverse ETL for non-technical users) started slapping on half-assed features so they can compete on other functionality or create stickiness. (In Hightouch’s case, they invented the concept of “composable CDP” so they could convince execs to keep their product and replace their CDP system.)\n\nSo now the data tool landscape is a data tool hellscape. It’s littered with redundant companies with redundant functionality and nothing is being improved anymore.\n\nI always tell people to at least be familiar with the open source tool set (especially anything from the Apache foundation). They are purpose-focused tools with les bloat. Even if a paid alternative is worthwhile, knowing the open source tools gives you a cleaner landscape of what each tool does and how they work together.",

Yes, that can be super common in some places and spaces.\n\nBut take healthcare in the US for instance - rapidly changing schemas for data is *not* a normal thing. Schema evolution is slow and methodical, on the order of decades, not years.

The daily job applications were inconsistent, and access to some of the “unlimited” support resources wasn’t always available when needed.\n\nI stayed in the program for the full year and remained engaged throughout. By the end of the guarantee period:\n\n* I did not receive a data engineering job offer\n* My refund request under the guarantee was denied\n* I now have a one-year gap in my professional timeline due to participation in the program\n\nBased on my experience, I do not recommend doing business with them.

My manager has the title but zero technical involvement.\n\nThe highlight reel:\n\n\\- Presented a migration to the CTO that saves six figures annually. Built the entire business case, ran the pilot, did the presentation. Manager sat in the room and said nothing. CTO: \"amazing job.\"\n\n\\- I run two vendor negotiations. Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \\~$20K/year tool well within his budget. He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\n\n\\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days. When I nudged him on a CTO-visible thread, he pulled me aside and made it clear he didn't appreciate being called out in front of leadership. The tone was... not great.\n\n\\- His weekly updates to leadership? Written by us. He copy-pastes our summaries.\n\n\\- Forgot to process my contractually agreed bonus. Twice. I had to escalate to the CTO myself.\n\nThe CTO sees my work directly and responds well. I want to have a title + comp conversation, but here's the dilemma: that conversation should technically go through my manager. The same manager who \\*\\*forgot\\*\\* my bonus twice, blocks vendor decisions, and copy-pastes my summaries. Going to the CTO directly feels like the only path that leads anywhere, but I know it's politically risky.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Anyone navigated a title conversation that should go through your manager but realistically can't? How did you handle it?\n\n2. If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?\n\n3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?\n\n4. If the conversation doesn't land, how fast did you leave?\n\nNot trying to destroy the guy. He's not evil, just ... very ineffective and knows the corporate playbook. But honestly I can't keep working with guy he blocks more than he enables.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. \n\nI would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. \n\nI’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. \n\nIf you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

Please note that I have zero responsibility to any result, good or bad, if you follow my recommendations.\n\n  \nBTW this recommendation assumes that what you said is true, and you should be able to find a new employment without too much trouble AND without your manager's recommendation. You know, market is tough.\n\n\n\nIf you have a good relationship with the CTO, mention it to him during a private chat. Ask him advice how to talk to your manager, to guide you as you are an \"inexperienced young man\", and follow with an email to your manager immediately, without mentioning that this comes from the CTO. This is just to show that you respect the chain of command, not that you expect anything to happen.\n\nIf you don't have a good relationship with the CTO (i.e. aside from nudging him about your bonuses, you never talk to him privately), email him and ask for advice, and obviously such an email does not go through your manager as it is just for advice.\n\nWait for 2 weeks. Collect all evidences. Hint to your friend in the team if you trust them, or at least probe around. See if you can make your manage make some small mistakes along the way -- but this is just bonus and 2 weeks is too short. Draft up a plan what you plan to do if you are the manager of your team. Make sure to suck the CTO's ass by mentioning the things that he personally cares about, but in a un-suck-your-ass way. Also make sure to acknowledge that you have good relationships with the leaders of the parallel teams (analytic, DS, etc.). I hope you do. In the meantime also aggressively find interviews -- it's also a bonus, not a must, although you should start this a long time ago.\n\nAfter 2 weeks send another email to your manager, and cc CTO and HR, that you respect your manager's decisions, and you respect his capability, but you have different mindset, so you are leaving in 2 weeks. It is very sad that you have to leave before the IPO happens, but you are sure that said manager can take over the job immediately, given his capacity.\n\nWait for 24 hours (or if your CTO replies). If your CTO replies \"Thank you and good luck\", this is probably not going to work and you should leave anyway. If your CTO doesn't say anything or he asks you to reconsider, whether out of polite or out of real concern, go straight to him, in person, and offer your coup-d'etat plan, the draft you wrote a couple of weeks ago. Ask for 80% of his pay, and 80% of his stock options, and of course his firing.",

I've been tasked with modernizing data infra to move 200+ data pipes from ec2 with worst possible practices. \n\nMade some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.\n\nNow after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. \n\nA lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.\n\nNow we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: \"ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?\" \n\nWhile there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack. \n\nHis proposal was to start using databricks because it's easier for him to schedule jobs there, which I can't blame him for.\n\nI haven't worked with databricks. Are there any problems that might arise?\n\nWe have ~200gb in total in dwh for 5 years. Integrations with sftps, apis, rdbms, and Kafka.

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.\n\nThe real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.\n\nBefore you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.\n\nSometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

But also, what if you just make it easy for him to schedule queries easily? Problem solved.  \nIf a person doesn't want to learn dbt, it's better not to spend time on it. Just make it easy and move on for now. (In your situation).  \nHowever, it'll create lots of problems in the future as well, since his queries will probably be shitty. So, just use an AI agent like Cursor/Claude/Codex etc, and give his query and dbt repo, so your problem will be solved. It's a better solution, and it won't take your time. If you're not using AI agents, I highly recommend it to you.  \n  \nAlso, if you want to move a new platform in AWS, I'd choose Snowflake over Databricks since it's a DWH, not a data lake which will create chaos on you in the future.",

      "text": "Greetings fellow data engineers!\n\nI once again ask you for your respectable opinions. \n\nA couple of days ago had a conversation with a software engineering colleague about providing a table that I had created in prod. But he needed it in test. And it occured to me that I have absolutely no idea how to give this to him, and that our entire system is SQL server on prem, SQL server Agent Jobs - all run directly in prod. The concept of test or dev for anything analytics facing is essentially non-existent and has always been this way it seems in the organisation. \n\n  \nNow, this made me question my assumptions of why this is. The SQL is versioned and the structure of the data is purely medallion. But no dev/test prod. I inquired AI about this seeming misalignment, and it gave me a long story of how data engineering evolved differently, for legacy systems its common to be directly in prod, but that modern data engineering is evolving in trying to apply these software engineering principles more forcefully. I can absolutely see the use case for it, but in my tenure, simply havent encountered it anywhere.\n\n  \nNow, I want my esteemed peers experiences. **How does this look like out there \"in the wild\". What are our opinions, the pros and cons, and the nature of how this trend is developing.** This is a rare black box for me, and would greatly appreciate some much needed nuance. \n\n  \nLove this forum! Appreciate all responses :)\n\n\n\n",

Datasets dev / test (uat) are better shortlived and discarded by making replication and isolation easier on all fronts (separate ETL sys account adn worker queue, DB user, Schema, etc).

This schema and pipelines are in source control, but I have a lot of leeway to make changes. The dataset is also just as complete as Prod. Prod is the functional environment for external customers to access. Again, all under source control with a lot more guardrails around data and code changes compared to QA.\n\nAs a best practice, no changes should go directly to prod except for *maybe* emergency fixes. Even then, QA first would be preferred. Because what you definitely don't want to do is make a change to Prod that breaks things. Because if you have customers and SLAs, when they ask, \"How did this bug get into production?\", the last thing you want to say is \"Because that's the only env we have and we didn't properly test it.\"",

The whole \"medallion architecture\" thing is stupid. It isn't new just new names that actually causes confusion in a field that is already difficult enough. \n\nThe lack of business understanding and thinking tools are the most important part of the job blows me away. I am very comfortable saying that tools are the least important part of the job. You can pick up a tool in a month or so but knowing where and how to use it will take a lot longer.\n\nThe trouble is employers want a way to measure talent.

      "text": "I'm a senior data engineer where our entire team was laid off a few months ago. I got a new cloud data engineer position and half of my new team was just laid off this week -- I probably have 2-3 months left. My friend in a similar role just got laid off this week at the company I worked for before when we both worked together.\n\nSo, I did some research on jobs to upgrade to that won't be replaceable by AI. These were the top 5 that I have an interest in. ChatGPT said these jobs are expected to increase in supply over the years coming up. I checked online and there's currently only 1 of these positions available for every 50 data engineering positions.\n\nIf I teach myself the skills for one of these positions, does anyone think there will be a supply for them in the future? The salary ranges below look a little high based on when I was researching the actual pay for jobs hiring today.\n\n* AI Data Engineer: $180k–$250k\n* AI Infrastructure Engineer: $200k–$300k\n* Applied AI Engineer: $170k–$250\n* AI Platform Engineer: $200k–$320k\n* Quant / AI Finance Engineer: $250k–500k+\n\nI have a plan to create a SaaS website to showcase my pgvector + embeddings + RAG skills to recruiters to get an AI Data Engineer position for $180k - $250k. It would make a database searchable so the user could ask a question and it would give a response or automatically build a pipeline, among other features.\n\nAnd then create another SaaS website that analyzes stock/crypto for trading analysis (and possibly have it auto trade so when LLM models are good enough then I could connect it to my already-built app). This would help get a Quant / AI Finance Engineer position for $250k - $500k.\n\nI think creating a couple of projects / websites might be the quickest way to learn these skills and would also show recruiters that I have real experience doing these things. I already have data engineering, software development, AI LLM API development, and frontend + backend SaaS experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Is this a realistic approach? Are there any other positions I should try to get instead of one of these?",

It has 10 strategies I included based on published systems (though obviously your want to build your own) which you can configure parameters for, back testing, monte carlo testing, walk forward testing, per system risk management, portfolio level risk management. It's actually ridiculous how quick you can get things done. I'm currently playing with agentic systems - I have a bot that looks at some market indicators, asks an llm about it, and either buys, holds or sells Bitcoin based on the answers and provides the justification. I have another agent working on an old piece of software I wrote to refactor it and in future add/update features as my business partner comes up with ideas.\n\n\nIf you can demonstrate the AI skills and have the background of data engineering etc you'll land a good job easily.

Historically, software engineers would focus on transactional data and data folks would focus on batch or analytical.  Once streaming and microservices showed up, the lines really blurred.

Because right now my pipelines are about as self healing as a broken arm. We've got airflow orchestrating about 40 dags across various sources and when something breaks, which is weekly at minimum, someone has to manually investigate, figure out what changed, update the code, test it, and redeploy. That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.\n\nI get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks. If something could genuinely detect that and adapt without human intervention that would actually be worth paying for.",

If a column disappears, the system doesn’t know whether you want to drop it, replace it, backfill it, or redesign downstream logic. That’s not a syntax problem. That’s a decision problem. (Which can be taken by AI, but most of the time it doesn't have enough context)\n\nAutomatic retries and exponential backoff are not self-healing. That’s just basic resilience. Even auto schema detection only gets you part of the way.\n\nWhat I *have* seen work in practice is more boring and more controlled:\n\n1. Detect the break and narrow down what changed.\n2. Create a new branch.\n3. Spin up a sandbox data environment for that branch.\n4. Let an agent attempt a fix there.\n5. Run tests and generate an impact summary.\n6. Ask a human to approve before touching prod.\n\nThat’s not some magical self-repair system. It’s letting a machine try a fix somewhere safe and asking you before it does anything risky.\n\nIf a vendor claims it can fully adapt to major SaaS API changes with zero review, I’d be skeptical. Skipping isolation and approval is how you corrupt downstream models quietly.\n\nEven though I think Airflow is not the best tool for AI, I also don’t think this is really about Airflow vs X vs Y. It’s more about whether your stack is reproducible and easy to run in isolation. Systems that are CLI-friendly and easy to spin up in a sandbox are much easier to automate safely. Highly stateful setups are just harder for any automation to reason about.\n\nSo for me the answer is: true self-healing? Naah, we're not there yet.  \nAI-assisted repair with guardrails? Yes, it works. It makes the boring parts of your job much more easier.",

For example, he'll submit code that doesn't run, is missing requirements clearly laid out in the ticket, or has logical issues such as incorrect data grain. \n\nMy options are to do nothing or to talk to him directly, our tech lead, our PO/PM, or our manager. I'm leaning toward talking to him directly or talking to our tech lead rather than our PO/PM or manager. In addition to his technical issues, he often misses stand up, calls out of work frequently, and I doubt he's ever putting in a \"*full day of work*\" (we're remote). If I talk to our PO/PM or manager I'm worried he'd be let go. I'm big believer in work/life balance, async meetings and Slack > traditional meetings, and output > time spent at work.\n\nIf I talk to him directly, I would offer to pair on his next ticket or during my code review. \n\nHas anyone dealt with someone similar and how did you address it, if you addressed it at all?",

From my experience when shit hits the fan things like this are coming back after some time and then you need a ground proof that you noticed that, and notified the person responsible (manager/supervisor). Especially if you are the one to accept the PRs, it’s a shared responsibility for the code quality. \n\nIf it’s a smaller software house then I would be more persistent, because his performance has bigger impact on the product.
