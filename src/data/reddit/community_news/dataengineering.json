YAML for Docker, dbt configs, random CI settings. I have done it before, but when I need it again my brain is blank.\n\n\\- I get overwhelmed by a small list of fixes. Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\n\n\\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \n\n\\- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\n\n\\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.\n\nI’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.\n\nIf you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? \n\nAny coping systems that actually worked for you? Or do you also feel like you’re constantly re-learning the same tools?\n\nWould love to hear how other people handle it.",

It genuinely makes me feel safer knowing so many of us go through similar things.\n\nI realised I have ADHD a bit late, and I’m still learning how to cope with it. I’m more on the hyperactive side, and for years I’ve lived in a cycle of hyperfocus and burnout. Nothing felt “enough” or “perfect”, so I kept polishing, then I’d burn out and abandon it. In the end, I had lots of half-finished work and very little truly completed.\n\nLately I’m learning to prioritise, and like many of you said, a consistent routine has helped the most. To manage the hyperactive side, the vocal stimming, and my mind wandering, I started going live on Facebook (I just have my famliy members on facebook). Weirdly, that’s helped me stay present and keep the hyperactivity in check.\n\nI also used to take loads of notes, but they were scattered everywhere (notebooks, random apps, GitHub). Now I’ve moved everything into Notion with a proper structure, and it’s made a huge difference\n\nOne thing I still struggle with is the need for validation. I’m starting to accept that this might be something I need to work through properly, and I think therapy is the direction that will actually help long-term.\n\nReally appreciate all of you taking the time to share advice and experiences.",

They're not around anymore and this role is being forgotten.\n\nChanneling that energy to play it forward. With mind toward college and high school aged as audience. A large portion of them are naturally unaware, yet, what habits support feeling good. More than is accurate take on an identity of a neurotic. I think they'd be happier with the cut to the point advice from grandma. Playing it forward, I loved that grandma. She was full of boring advice from grandma you roll your eyes at. Then fifteen years later after trying every nootropic and other option finally tried going to bed earlier and your life falls together and recognize damnit, the boring advice was from grandma was wisdom.",

Insurance is especially heavy on this. Some teams do manage to streamline it with better self-service, platform teams, or looser controls in non-prod, but 60 to 70% overhead isn’t unusual.

And we both know this friction could be reduced by moving a lot of these responsibilities into the cicd pipelines.  \n\nThis type of friction is something unfortunately only certain people can change because it's organizational and requires different c suite and vp's to understand which can be a difficult task. If those people aren't open to it, then switch jobs. Optimizing for machines is easy. Optimizing our companies decisions unfortunately is complicated. \n\nAs my role has increased, my time is being spent more on \"selling\" our devops practices to the right leadership and how these best practices reduce the friction from organizational processes.  There're two paths to adoption in my opinion.\n\nThe first is convincing the leadership in charge of both organizations to see the friction. So a lot of my time is spent on making architectural diagrams, reading the latest research publications to use in presentations and design, generating pretty graphs, etc. I want to showcase where we are spending our time and the value coming out of the different usages of time.\n\nThe second is to convince the leadership and engineers from the team causing friction that there's a better way. For this, I spend time helping my team excel in ways that we always get recognition in organizational announcements. We want to convince leadership and engineers in other organizations to see how efficient we are and come to us to adopt our practices.  \n\nEncouraging education seems to be difficult in this industry. The people in the highest roles often get there over time and often get stuck in their ways. It's not always the case but it happens enough and the research agrees. The DORA research publications have shown that a disconnect between developers and researchers is all too common",

      "text": "Hi DEs,\n\nAnd the people using Fivetran..\n\nWe are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.\n\nPreviously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.\n\nWhat is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?\nFivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.\n\nWill Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

As a small consultancy, we helped a few clients to migrate to dlt from Fivetran because the cost didn't make sense, because the connectors they wanted didn't exist, or just because they didn't like to deal with a balck box (with pricing controlled by others).\n\n2. As organizer of the Data Berlin meetup, I spoke with multiple teams which introduced dlt, initially for limited use cases, then it started to replace more consistent data loads. Once you have dlt in place it makes no sense to spend for loading if you can have it for free (or at least a minimal fraction of what you are paying).\n\nFeel free to ping me in case you want me to elaborate",

No idea - everybody needs to answer that for themselves, but I personally have been bitten by shitty SaaS vendors often enough, that I'll at least think about hosting something on my own every time.",

However, I’d recommend looking for an analyst job that works closely with the engineering team. In my old job, I pretty much was the middle man between the data engineers and any department that had a data related use case. This gave me a ton of experience with gathering requirements, planning go live dates, determining frequency that tables needed to be loaded, etc. I also “mapped” all fields to whatever table they were being added to. So I wrote a lot of SQL transformations and complicated Joins. This was insanely valuable experience. \n\n\nLooking for titles like: BI analyst, BI Engineer, Data Management Analyst. Also any mentions of mapping, data modeling, managing data warehouse logic, or supporting the data engineering team are usually a good sign you will get an opportunity to learn some valuable skills. \n\n\nExtra Tip: When you eventually get an interview, be likable! There are plenty of people in the world that have the skills to be a good DE. Separate yourself by being someone that the interviewer would enjoy working with. My team told me that the last round of my interview was between me and one other person, and they eventually chose me because we got along better. \n\n\n\nSorry for any typos, I don’t have the energy to get up and grab my glasses.",

They got me back into reading, mostly technical books, which has turned into a surprisingly useful hobby.\n\nLately I’ve been making a more intentional effort to level up as a software engineer by reading and then trying to apply what I learn directly in my day-to-day work.\n\nThe next book on my list is Designing Data-Intensive Applications. I’ve heard nothing but great things, but I know an updated edition is coming at some point.\n\nFor those who’ve read it: would you recommend diving in now, or holding off and picking something else in the meantime?",

I do loads of APIs, file stuff, DB work, bulk inserts, merges, stored procedures, orchestration with drivers etc. So I’m not new to data engineering by any means, but whenever I look at other jobs they all want Python, AWS/GCP, Kafka, Airflow, and I start feeling like I’m way behind.\n\nAm I actually behind? Do I need to learn all this stuff before I can get a job that’s “equivalent”? Or does having solid experience with ETL, pipelines, orchestration, DBs etc still count for a lot? Feels like I’ve been doing the same kind of work but on the “wrong” tech stack and now I’m worried.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s made the jump or recruiters, like how much not having cloud/Python really matters.",

If a person has both on-prem and cloud experience equally, the \"majority on-prem\" person would receive 1st priority and 50/50 person would receive 2nd (\"majority cloud\" would be 3rd pick).\n\nThese priorities of course don't take into account how well the interview goes.

They are basically infinitely scalable and have a lot of tools integration that is a lot less likely to be used for on prem data warehouses. Specific cloud implementation you use matters less, but having experience with a cloud platform at all is important in the sense that I would guess recruiters would choose someone with slightly less YoE who knows a cloud platform well over someone who has more YoE but none with any cloud warehouses.",

You can be technically strong and \"not a good fit\" for a massive list of reasons.  Usually, it's just vibes.\n\nMy background is in chemistry.

No idea.\n\n>Its definitely been getting to me I thought i was a pretty good engineer.\n\nLikewise, I thought I was a decent chemist.  I lost my last chemistry job during the pandemic and kept interviewing for places where all of my technical skills lined up.  I didn't struggle in the technicals and seemed to get on with everybody too.  Some places never called me back.  Other places rejected me at the last hurdle.  I even followed up with some of the team members who interviewed me and asked them wtf was up because it was extremely confusing.  The team members said if it was up to them, I'd have been in.  They weren't consulted so it must have been management.\n\nMy personal issue was that I hadn't enjoyed doing chemistry for quite a while before then.  I didn't want to do chemistry anymore, but, I have bills to pay.  I think no matter where I went and no matter how many technicals I would have cleared, every company I would have interviewed for would have said no.  They didn't have to know I had lost my passion for the field although I'm sure, subsconsciously or consciously, they knew something was off.\n\nI changed field to DE.  Best decision ever for me.

I've found that the two together make me into a sort of business superhero: looking for the true meaning of data and the true business problems that need to be solved.\n\nMy advice to any struggling data engineer is to evaluate whether or not you are actually identifying and actually solving business problems. You can be the end-all be-all of Spark, Databricks, etc., and you can build perfectly to provided specifications, but ultimately end up worthless to the business by not actually solving problems.\n\nLearn to interrogate the data, the business constructs, find what people are actually needing and trying to achieve, speak to the stakeholders and understand them, their needs, hell their entire job if you can.\n\nExplain the benefits of modern infrastructure and methods in the context of the business problem and constructs. If you can't bring an engaged layperson to understanding what you put forth, then keep refining your thoughts and approach until you can.\n\nBuild your ability to present such that you can speak to managers and stakeholders. Build your technical understanding such that you can put forth directions on-the-fly and communicate why these directions will lead everyone towards the goal of solving the actual business problem.\n\nBringing this back to my first points: my background in the sciences has so greatly assisted me in all of the above. All too often, I meet technical people who are fantastic developers, but just build things off-kilter and struggle to gather requirements and internalize the business's needs and goals. It'd be like a plumber who doesn't understand what a pipe will be used for - is it the washer/dryer, sewage, a fire hydrant, or what? These developers do the equivalent of building a sewage pipe that emerges in the center of the bathroom floor - it's almost correct, but useless because nobody wants the toilet there.",

I brought up the idea that we should really be separating the orchestration from the actual pipelines.  I suggested that we use the KubernetesOperator to run containerized Python code instead of using the PythonOperator. People looked at me like I was crazy, and there are some seasoned seniors on the team. In reality, is this a common practice? I know a lot of people talk about using Airflow purely as an orchestration tool and running things via ECS or EKS, but how common is this in the real world. ",

Reason is that the PythonOperator, as many noted, runs on airflow compute (workers) and depending on what compute engine airflow sits on this doesn’t scale well for big data volumes. For small things it is fine, but not for reliable production. Airflow uses a central requirements.txt file so managing all the different library versions and conflicts is nightmare and requires a lot of discipline. Using airflow purely as an orchestrator and execute on Faragate for example gives everyone a lot more flexibility and decouples Python dependencies from the workers. It also allows you to use any programming language you prefer.  if you are using MWAA, managed airflow on AWS, it will not allow you to install any dependency you want, mostly pure Python libraries or it gets complicated quickly.\n\nLong story short, outsourcing you compute to WCS or other compute and just use airflow for orchestration leads to a much more stable airflow. A lot of companies are doing this as best practice now.",

RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  \n\nYou can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  \n\nIt's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly.

It caters to both OLTP and OLAP, bringing together the best-in class OSS databases for each (Postgres and ClickHouse) and offering them in the most integrated way. We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

It is the simplest and fastest structure for iterating through provided values.\n\nThe hashing of a set is irrelevant to iterating over all the values. The hash allows for bucketing so that with the hash you can jump to sublists that are much smaller, allowing for faster operations that check for presence of a value, but that's not relevant to iterating over all values.\n\nIs there some deep lore in cpython this relates to?

          "text": "Had very similar experiences. Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

Not the questions where you have to sit and think for a long time, but the questions that you either know the answer to, or you don't, so the candidate is expected to answer quickly, not to think for a minute (\"key difference between PySpark dataframes and Pandas dataframes\", \"How's delta lake different from a plain parquet file storage\", \"OLTP/OLAP diff\", \"ETL/ELT diff\", \"what are SCDs\", \"diff between DLT pipelines and jobs in Databricks\", etc.)\n\n\\- interviews in person, with rare exceptions (e.g. if the candidate is relocating from another state and has passed the 15 min tech pre-screening).\n\n\\- if you don't want enforce in-person interviews, keep it online but make cheating a reason to veto a candidate. The veto must come from the data engineer interviewer who came to the conclusion that the candidate was cheating, from their behavior. The data engineer must be trusted enough in the org the management would rely on their judgement (it's usually practically impossible to proof that someone cheated, with evidence etc., so there're only clues - too perfect answers, too perfect syntax, lag before a response, eyes switching back and forth between the monitors, etc.).",

Do people actually vet the information given and critically assess it, or do they just plug it into whatever pipeline that exists and call it a day?\n\nI have seen a lot of questionable DAX queries from people I assume have very little to no clue as to why they have made it like that. The complexity of the queries are often worrying as it displays a very high level of trust in the result that has been given to them. Stuff that \"works\" in the moment, but can easily break in the future.\n\nWhat are your experiences? Have you seen anything in production that made you go \"oh, this is BAD!\"?",

Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.\n\nLast week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. \n\nSo, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find. We have guardrails on everything, so no one has brought down dev, let alone prod, but jfc it's an exhausting, neverending mess around here.",

If that doesn't work, making a hash that includes a deterministic system attribute, like the source system created or last updated times.\n3. If that doesn't work, because you know current unique combinations might become non unique over time, you can try a dated snapshots approach. Use all attribute columns concatenated into a numeric hash, including the sysdate. This gives a number for everything in that row at that time. If anything changes in the record over time, your ID changes. Even if everything changes back, your ID changes again but stays unique. This allows you to ensure that a recurrence of a previous state gets captured as a new record. I'm not sure if this is standard practice as I never learnt any theory, but I've implemented it at work for something that has been running without failure despite daily scheduled uniqueness unit testing. However if the source system itself has rows that are truly 1:1 and not unique, so completely true indistinguishable duplicates, then all you can do is either have the source team fix the issue (missing distinguishing attributes) or use some rowcount function to increment an ID for each instance, or just only use the first instance (distinct).",

          "text": "I’d argue that HOW you go about “finding a primary key” should depend on the entity you are trying to describe with your table. WHAT you are trying to describe should give you an intuition about which fields could be a candidate key. It’s important to know what the candidate keys SHOULD be so that when you test them, you can look at the potentially duplicate results and rationalize if those make sense.\n\nFor instance, a table describing a customer could have multiple candidate keys (ssn, phone_number, first_name + last_name + middle_initial + address) and potentially a given primary key from the source system (usually just id or customer_id). On the other hand, a table describing customer_actions might only have one candidate key (customer_id + action_at) and no source system primary key (this usually occurs if the event processing system that generated each record has an “at least once” guarantee, not an “only once” guarantee). In both cases, conceptually, you can be relatively sure that those SHOULD be primary keys, and if you are seeing duplicates it then becomes a series of questions: “are the underlying join conditions used to build this table wrong?” “Is there an issue with the upstream data that should be fixed instead?” If there is an issue upstream, but it’s not feasible to fix the upstream source, you’ll likely need to deduplicate the table you’re working on to enforce that primary key, but best practice would be to always fix the source if possible.\n\nAdditionally, as data engineers, some of the work we do requires joining multiple upstream entities (tables) to create a denormalized table that’s more efficient to query. In these cases, the finest grain of those entities becomes your primary key. For example, in retail, an analyst might want to determine the total applied discount $ per discount code over some time period. To create a denormalized table that could help support this question you have to join orders -> order_line_items -> order_line_item_discount_codes. In this case, discount codes are your finest grain entity since multiple discount codes can be applied to a line item. In this case, a candidate key might be (line_item_id + code).\n\nFinally, this still applies even if your organization doesn’t own the source. APIs sometimes provide entity diagrams and usually endpoint documentation detailing what the grain of that endpoint is. \n\nThat being said, if the data is coming from web scraping, that’s another beast all together, but it’s even more important that you can align on WHAT data you’re trying to pull from scraping, because no amount of cleaning and modeling will save you from incorrectly implemented ingestion practices.",

Given the volumes you're dealing with (which are relatively modest), you could query the selected tables directly with DuckDB, land the results in cloud storage (S3, Azure Data Lake Storage), and attach them to Snowflake as external tables. That would be enough for hourly/daily syncs at this scale.\n\nIf you want to keep the streaming approach, a zero-ETL solution would be Kafka Connect with S3 Sink (Iceberg Topics are too much for your case). I'd recommend a metadata-driven approach: extract the Postgres schemas as CSV, let Product/Analytics teams mark which tables they need, and dynamically build your Kafka Connect configs from that. Combined with Kafka Connect S3 Sink (Parquet/Avro) + Snowflake External Tables (zero-copy), you get the same benefits (no ETL, no storage overhead), but with team self-service and without having to manage 10-15 DBs × X tables as separate topics. Schema evolution runs through Schema Registry, and when pipeline issues occur, S3 becomes your buffer instead of the source DB.",
