      "text": "I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

But once your company grows, many different use cases, and if you trying to fit it into old-system dwh, many would fail when you trying to connect it all together.

A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

If those analysis tools get updated, it is still easy to reprocess all the impacted source data to feed it forward.\n\nThe semistructured data, similar thing - you choose what elements to bring forward, and when/how to flatten it so you can combine it with the traditional relational data.  And, you have the raw data so you can reprocess if there is a new or changed requirement.\n\nI'm still convinced however, that all of this variety is a distraction that people get caught up in.

Maybe go watch their technical talk about that as it provides a great explanation for why databases by themselves are limited as well as why blob storage by itself is limited. Traditional databases are basically concurrency managers. They suck at storing any meaningful amount of data however. \n\nLakes, lakehouses are primarily about decoupling storage from compute. It serves two functions when you do this, decreasing cost and decoupling compute scaling. You can have multiple teams scale their own trino or spark or python instances to meet their requirements. \n\nTo the degree they correctly mock religious opposition to structured databases the flip side is just as true. Religious insistence on database engines built for the needs and tradeoffs mainly of the 1970s and 80s is just stupid. \n\nThere are things traditional databases are good at but even comparatively small amounts of data can quickly begin to choke them out. Additionally their scaling properties are complex as they can run into many separate limits that can force scale out or worse yet force a scale up leading to over provisioning. \n\nDatabases are also always hot. They are virtually incapable of handling read almost never data. And you can argue but if it’s almost never going to be read just thrown it away. But that’s not an argument for traditional databases it’s a limitation. \n\nYou are merely lost in the hype of the technology and don’t actually understand the technical tradeoffs being made. There is a ton of money chasing executives to build lakes because there are vendors with lakes to sell. Things built like this are almost always a mess. That not because of the tech but because of who is building it under what pressures. \n\nThat doesn’t make them a bad an idea. They are a specific tool in the toolbox that can handle a variety of issues that affect traditional systems. They especially are good at enabling self serve data analytics, and other such democratization efforts as the materialization of some absurd table for the vp’s personal use is much less likely to effect the rest of the system. \n\nThey also are very good at recording point in time snapshots of data that would be prohibitively expensive to maintain in most traditional databases which can be a critical enabler for challenging ML problems. \n\nThey go hand in hand with event sourcing systems that are recording a change feed of events rather than an absolute state. If your system doesn’t have this point in time requirement it’s easy to see why you would not appreciate the issues lakes set out to solve. \n\nThere are more use cases they shine at but merely because you already have an oltp database that you treat as a magic black box you don’t understand is no reason to dismiss lake technology you also don’t understand.",

But in parallel DWH platforms with native separation of storage and compute started to emerge (Snowflake, BigQuery). \n* After some time with companies having massive data lakes, the need for a better file format/engine came around - and Hudi/Iceberg were born from the OSS community, and Delta from Databricks.\n* Somewhere in between people just started to misuse data lakes as data warehouses because it was cheap and easy to do, and allowed for poor planning. Also open table formats became the hot new tech.\n* Today - Snowflake entered the datalake business, Databricks are entering the datawarehouse business, and AWS/BigQuery lets you do anything. \n* For primarily streaming data, a data lake ingestion is still the best architectural concept.\n\nSo no we are in a situation where any platform allegedly allows you to implement whichever architecture you want, irrespective of the roots of the platform.\n\n* You run AWS? Datalake on S3+Iceberg/Hudi+Athena with Redshift as the DWH\n* You run Snowflake? Datalake on S3+Iceberg with Snowflake as the DWH\n* You run Databricks? Datalake on S3+Delta with Databricks Compute Engine and Postgres OLTP\n* You run GCP? BigQuery + GCS + Iceberg\n\nThis is now why data lakes are misused, because all the vendors wanted a slice of any architecture even if it didn't make sense for their product.",

The traditional database technologies with a Kimball/Inmon style data architecture on top served the structured data storage and querying usecases really well. \n\nIt all turned to shit when companies (and vendors) started abusing it as a “throw all your data here and we’ll think about what to do with it later”. It became an unorganized data swamp right out of the gate. \n\nThen came the newer vendors like Databricks and Snowflake. Layered a distributed, separate compute layer on top of the datalake, added few governance capabilities and it started to become slightly better. However, I see them going down the same path now with crap like “lakebase” (i.e a traditional database but on cloud storage). Why do we even need this shit? We already have dozens of database techniques that do exactly that. \n\nNowadays, I equate datalake with just scalable cloud storage and nothing more.",

So if you take this path, assume you're going to be very focused on data-engineering-applied-to-AI.\n\nNow, given the actual pace at which human institutions move, I am convinced that even if foundation models get _quite a lot better_ it will take five years to reorient a bunch of legacy businesses around the new technology. But from there, all bets are off.\n\nA reorientation around AI may well make _experienced technologists_ even more important as staff for competitive businesses, but don't expect 'data engineering' specifically to still be prominent (consider how the database administrator role has faded in salience due to the Cloud revolution, for comparison).\n\n---\n\nAll in all: don't let AI put you off.

Its much easier to build pipelines and dashboards these days. It means more people from other tech areas transition to DE, increasing the competition. For people in the industries, as long as you're expanding your skill sets, it's OK.

E.g: Theoretically Net Income = revenue - Expenses, but imagine apps A provides Column ABC and XYZ to calc Expenses, and ERP B Provides col C123 and D456 to calc revenue. Requires some window function, sum, and what not.. And col name is not very descriptive enough to tell it’s to calc Revenue, giving 0 context for AI to process\n\nSo, yeah.. in data engineering, AI won’t 100% do the magic.. it can help us faster to build API, make some Pyspark/scala/whatever code, sql (if connected with our metadata), give some reasoning/exploration, etc.. but it can’t remove human entirely.",

          "text": "24 months ago, the smartest people in the world could look at the evidence and call LLMs \"auto-complete on steroids\". I did not agree at the time, but it was a credible assertion. If anyone is still saying that in 2026, they are not credible based on the research that's come out since then. In 2024 people said LLMs can't solve Wordle, and they can't count the Rs in strawberry. No frontier model fails at those tasks in 2026 but people are still repeating the same memes.  \n  \nPeople who are not using AI to (effectively) code think it's supposed to be some kind of maestro that 1-shot generates you a script out of thin air. I would characterize the latest iteration of AI to be more akin to a swarm intelligence. Even a single frontier model agent is not very impressive by itself. I've found that even given a well defined list of tasks, a single Claude agent will degrade rapidly in performance because of context rot. But if you start orchestrating: creating and destroying agents for singular purposes (cattle, not pets), then the capabilities become very impressive. Your agents can make a plan, execute on it, _check the results_, adjust the plan, retry, and so forth all autonomously. This is the scary part, not because it's really good at leetcoding, because planning and iteration is something that's transferrable to all professions.  \n  \nSecondly people misunderstand, especially after the ChatGPT-5 fiasco: GPT-5 is not a single model, it is a router, a reverse proxy, that assesses your query and routes it to one of its 10s of actual models behind the curtain. Despite the marketing it was primarily a cost engineering tool for OpenAI, because it removes choice from the user about what model you are being served with. So you could be using \"ChatGPT-5.2\", and you get some shit answer because it decides your question wasn't worth its time (or their servers are overloaded, or any other reason) and routed your question to some shit model. All frontier \"models' work this way, \"Opus 4.6\" does the same. So all those seemingly cracked models that Google is sending out to dominate benchmarks? Yeah, no guarantee that's the one serving you (or is even one of the possible options).\n  \nThat means you cannot one-shot some chatbot on your free account and have an accurate picture of the state of the art. Anyone who is isn't using harnessed agents and burning tokens have no idea what they're talking about.  \n  \n18 months ago I thought the role of humans will be as model whisperers, guiding these mercurial and finicky chatbots. Well, prompt engineering came and died as a profession in less than 12 months. 3 months ago I thought the role of humans would be building mcp integrations to connect agents to the business domain. Well, Claude is pretty well capable of being pointed at any API and building an integration by itself right now.  \n  \nCurrently I would say my comparative advantages are understanding the business domain, architecture, and security. If you notice, none of these are junior attributes. As an OG AI hater, it pains me to say that if you gave me a list of projects to complete, and I had a choice between an intern or Claude Code and an intern's salary of tokens, for effectiveness I would take Claude Code every time hands down. (I'm not saying that the AI is better in every way, rather there's no comparative advantage).\n  \nAnd I don't even know how long my moats will hold. There is a degree of skill involved with using agents, which can explain why some people are getting poor results, but tbh the skill curve is not that high, and any clever tricks people think of to squeeze more performance out of the agents (e.g. chain-of-thought, ralph-loop, sub-agents) just get baked into the harness and democratized. I think the only reason people don't get better at it is a psychological aversion to AI.\n\nAgainst all odds, my company managed to assemble a competent team of AI engineers that built an in-house agentic framework that _actually delivered business value_...for about 12 months. Now I wonder what was the whole point if every analyst will be rolling with Claude Cowork on their laptop in 6-12 months. If you look at where we were just 24 months ago vs now, it's hard to imagine where we'll be 24 months from now.  \n  \nSo all that to say, we're all guessing for the next 5 years. My hope is a small business renaissance and a democratization of knowledge, but I fear we just end up in a world where 12 rich guys own everything until one day they betray each other. But I wanted to give a deep and nuanced answer, and get my own thoughts out. We can only nudge the world to the better scenario if we're honest to ourselves.",

Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust. So I'm thinking I'm pretty much on the way out as the company is planning to buy software that makes what I'm doing irrelevant (Has its own data warehouse, it's own way of loading data, etc).\n\nOur company is currently all on prem for work, so a big shared drive is our datalake, sql server is our database, and the best I've been able to do to improve/modernize things was to introduce Prefect for our orchestration, make my own libraries in python to make loading data easier, show the usages of PowerBI and Tableau and create a data warehouse that did what the company wanted to do, but now has decided was a waste of time.\n\nI've started go through the AWS Data Engineering Exam and Snowflake exams, and I have projects on Github that show the use of Amazon S3, Athena, and Glue, so I can at least point to those and say I have cloud experience that I've set up myself. I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

It’s frustrating but ultimately I ended up landing somewhere that the tooling was less important since I’m setting a lot of it up.

OP, the way you described what you’ve done already actually screams “modernization / enablement” more than “just a data engineer.”\n\nYou took an on‑prem mess, brought in orchestration, built libraries, introduced BI tools, and designed a warehouse. That’s literally the narrative a lot of companies want for “we’re stuck on old infra and need someone to drag us into 2025 without breaking everything.”\n\nIf you frame yourself as “I specialize in taking legacy on‑prem setups and moving them toward cloud‑ready practices” then the lack of BigCorp‑AWS™ experience hurts less. Pair that story with 1–2 focused certs and a couple of small, very concrete cloud projects and you’re in a much better spot than trying to look like a generic cloud data engineer.\n\nAlso, target places that are mid‑transition, not already full cloud. Those folks value someone who actually knows the ugly side of on‑prem.",

Pass.\n\nAlso got a couple recruiter pokes from the firms that are notable for the churn in their DE orgs, like CapOne, so that's also a hard pass.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

You will move up in no time if you can show value in doing things differently.\n\nWhen I was promoted to DE at my company (analyst for 3 months prior), they also used a drag and drop GUI hooked up to an OLTP database, and frankly the datasets sucked. They had no mechanism to retain historical data for SCDs so there was no historical accuracy. They had created like 6 surviving OBT tables after 3 years and they spent all of their time fixing constant bugs. The data analysts had created a shadow data warehouse that actually ran 95% of the reports.\n\nSo, in my first 6 months I learned about the company and processes and pushed for better practices: git, OLAP database (Snowflake), and proper modeling. I produced 4 datasets that were correctly modeled. I also optimized the daily runtime of the warehouse from 3 hours to 1 hour, and reduced a weekly pipeline from 10 hours to 1 minute, so I built a lot of cred as an expert.\n\nSecond year the company was ready and budgeted for a migration to Snowflake and git. The team was doing PRs and I was setting the standards for code reviews. We set up the platform with basic tooling to deploy, ingest, and transform data, including CDC and SCDs. I introduced some project management frameworks to my manager as well.\n\nThis year I’m hammering on modeling and tooling. I have shown them the value of conformed dimensions and I do the data modeling. I basically mandated no more unmodeled data and no more shadow warehouse moving forward. We also have big capability gaps between ingestion, transformation, automated testing (unit/data quality), orchestration, and more. I’ve put together a roadmap to address these for this year.",

For context, mid sized company, around 50 saas data sources, snowflake as primary destination though we're also testing databricks for some ml workflows and have legacy stuff in redshift we're migrating away from.\n\nFivetran connectors are solid and reliable but the cost at scale gets uncomfortable fast, especially once you're pulling significant volume. Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs.

We barely touch the UI, only for logs and maybe the occasional manual sync. The open source and number of different connectors are worth it. \n\nOnly con for airbyte is that in our opinion the normalization step from having the data in json blob to a RDBMS table takes unnecessarily long. It stupid. \n\nTherefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns.  \n\nFor our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.\n\nAdditionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database. Moreover, we can also write them as dbt models maintaining full lineage from ingestion all the way to Reverse ETL and other exposures.",

Fivetran can get expensive (high MAR usage) when you have cases of large datasets (SaaS or on-prem) that need to get ingested each month but also have low number of updates (meaning you cannot save MAR if rows change may times per month). \n\nI had never heard of 'Precog' before but it seems to only have been around since 2020.

          "text": "Since you (and a couple others) seem to be more or less asking for some structure to learn against, here's what I use or have used in my day-to-day.\n\n- How to install docker, and the follow-ups needed, on your Distro/OS. Windows/Mac are pretty straight-forward. Linux has some steps after install that you need to do.\n\n- Get used to navigating dockerhub, finding official image builds, and how to pull specific versions. Much like Python version pinning, you _certainly_ want to pin versions of infra.\n\n- Read the docs on the most important docker cli commands. Non-exhaustive: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker pull`, `docker exec`, `docker container cp`.\n\n- Learn and practice making [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). Learn the subtle differences between `ADD` and `COPY`. How Layering works. Learn the differences between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, `ARG` and `ENV`. Learn how to expose a port on a container to the host. HINT: it isn't with the `EXPOSE` instruction and if you made it this far without being able to ping your container from your host you should go back one step ;) . Make a `.dockerignore` so you don't put anything you don't want in the container. You can ignore these instructions for now: `HEALTHCHECK`, `LABEL`, `MAINTAINER`, `ONBUILD`, `SHELL`, `STOPSIGNAL`.\n\n- Learn how networking works for Docker. Networking generally is a weak point for most SWEs, and seems to often be doubly so for DEs. In the same vein, read the docs on how Docker Volumes work and how to attach them.\n\nNow, you came to the DE Subreddit to ask this and mention you have 2 YOE already, so I'm going to also mention a couple of more specific things.\n\n1. [Running Airflow in Docker](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html) is D E N S E but obfuscated heavily. As in, it has a lot of levers and knobs, but it mostly assumes the defaults are good enough for this. It also assumes you know docker-compose which I _did_ leave out of the top. The justification I'll give for that is that Docker Compose is great... but you should be using the dockerized airflow mentioned here as a TESTING system ONLY. Thus, get it going following thier instructions, do what you need to do, but don't assume it matches production-grade Airflow deployments.\n\n2. You could (and perhaps should) use [Astronomer's CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview). I don't work for them or anything, but I have used their managed service in the past. The fact that the CLI exists for free is great and should be taken advantage of for local testing.\n\n3. Now that you've seen those two and understand how docker works and have played with the ins and outs, contrary to what others may say, I would then _AND ONLY THEN_ look into Kubernetes. No matter the system, managed or self-hosted, Airflow and it's pipelines ALWAYS run on Kubernetes behind the scenes. The way you build the image for [Airflow will change](https://gist.github.com/wesh92/4ce0634e61949a1679e2ae5a1788cb18) and, thus, how you manage dependancies and the way you need to understand how Kubernetes sees Containers versus how you've seen them thus far at this point. I cannot stress this enough though, DO NOT jump straight to this point. Everything above here should be _weeks_ of testing, toiling, and troubleshooting at a minimum before you try to introduce K8s. When you do, start with a local manager like `k3s`. I would recommend not using `minikube` or `kind` as those are \"k8s in docker\" which is a whole extra layer you don't need. The justification I'll give for including this: I like my local testing env for pipelines to be as close, if not exact, to what I will deploy. For me this means _in kubernetes using exactly what I will deploy_ with as much of the kubernetes weirdness as I can account for. If this doesn't feel important to you, please feel free to ignore!\n\nHope this helps! But please, just start with the Docker basics. You can search up a youtube if your more visually-inclined. Read through the docs and try implementing things if you're more of the experiential kind. Nothing is going to be a cheat code because these are kind of foundational tools for SWE and DE.\n\nEDIT: formatting. reddit pls",

Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I guess they finally stopped pushing it because it stayed off, but for a good 2 years, it was a battle to keep OneDrive off an ms machine.\n\n>Yes, it’s the next lock in. That’s it.\n\nBingo. If you know AI, then you know these big tech companies want control of data. That's the real value and they know it.

I think moving onto the hard questions is good, if you've already done the easy/medium problems. You can always re-visit the Mediums again, and try to speed through them, after going through a few dozen hard problems. You just might be surprised how much faster you can go, after practicing on harder problems, and getting better at pattern recognition. \n\nBesides DataLemur, I think having a proper project to talk about is also super important for Data Engineering interviews. Hopefully, this can be sourced from a past internship – but if not, go make a real portfolio project that's end-to-end, deployed (with a live link), that's also key-word rich (so use AWS, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Python, etc.).

          "text": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",
