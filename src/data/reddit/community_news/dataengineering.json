No exceptions.  \n  \nA word of caution, we had someone on our team write a script with AI and run it without reviewing. They deleted a bunch of data from the database without knowing. We had back ups, but there was data that went missing. When asked about the obviously ChatGPT written script they could not explain what it did or why.",

Though, having restrictions doesn't do much - people still try to cheat by having a second monitor, you can easily tell by their eyes switching between them when typing code. So, the focus is on a candidate being able to explain their train of thought, not solve the tasks like it's a test. The first 5-10 minutes of the interview is usually enough for me to understand if the candidate has the claimed experience or not, and the remainder of the time is for digging to the boundaries of their knowledge, by asking them more and more questions.",

Nowadays everyone can use AI to create perfect resumes, as a result, when picking applications, HRs can't differentiate between the liars and really capable candidates. A significant portion of the candidates I've interviewed for the last year weren't capable of being even juniors, though their resumes said they were practically seniors - 5+ years of experience in all/most tech tools listed for the job, certificates, accomplishments, etc. Imagine having a person stating they've had 5 years of experience designing SQL databases, writing procedures etc., and at the interview they don't know how to write a query to count the number of rows in a table. This takes up a lot of our time, and the experienced real candidates get drowned in this pool of fraudsters. We haven't solved this problem yet, and I'm not sure if it's even solvable.",

We may as well all become unemployed, who knows.\n\nAt the moment AI is making my work easier, this is my personal experience and my reaction to it and I acknowledge your different point of view. It also really depends where you work and what environment you have around. \n\nI am trying to look at the positive side because a lot of people and colleagues see transformation as a bad thing and are concerned, but it really depends and could be both bad and good at different levels...\n\nThe concentration issues you mention have probably already started since social media appeared, it is scary to see people (not only kids) glued to their phone,  jumping from one thing to the next without going deep into anything. I agree that if AI is combined with such a way of living, it will make it worse for many young people who have not seen anything else in their lives. \n\nBut, you can also decide and teach people to make the most out of these tools (going deeper into topics, visualise abstract concepts, etc)...for example in my maths studies it has helped me a lot to go through concepts challenging for me and I believe it would have been not easy for me to grasp them without it. But I still do all the exercises using a pen and calculator. Or when I read a book, I use AI to help me understand better passages that are not clear. But I can also decide to have the AI do all the homework and intellectual work for me and not to learn anything, because why bother with that? \n\nIt is like doing physical activity in the Western world nowadays. You may just decide not to do it because there is no need, we have cars, electric bikes, Amazon and delivery, etc.. but your body will start to suffer because you as a person actually need it.  At the end, it is up to you to take care of yourself.\n\nShould we give up these technologies altogether? I think that is impossible. I also believe the way the big tech companies are exploiting the AI tools, using them just for making profit, going faster etc is having a big impact on all these fears. We have been treated like cogs in a machine, this is why we think we need to remain productive and we are scared of being substituted. I remind myself everyday that I am not my job.\n\nWhat do you think could be a solution to these problems?",

One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.\n\nI’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.\n\nIf you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? \n\nAny coping systems that actually worked for you? Or do you also feel like you’re constantly re-learning the same tools?\n\nWould love to hear how other people handle it.",

If it's a repetitive thing that isn't particularly fast, that's the work that causes me to just freeze up and I struggle with. \n\nI find that to get through those tasks where my brain just has no interest and freezes up, jumping onto other things that are more interesting and then coming back to it helps a lot, so doing it in chunks, whether that is my work or helping someone else. \n\nAlso a 10-minute walk to break up a day really helps me focus, and I do little longer lunch walk on my break and eat at my desk. Those two things help me focus a lot better throughout the day. Also when I started medication in October that really helped as well.\n\nOh one other one, I sometimes get a bit frustrated when people are so much slower at picking up the concept or the problem when they are the decision maker, or blocking something. If it is someone just working at their pace or understanding things as they do that's fine, but when it's a blocker or like I feel like I've explained myself three times, that can be frustrating.

It genuinely makes me feel safer knowing so many of us go through similar things.\n\nI realised I have ADHD a bit late, and I’m still learning how to cope with it. I’m more on the hyperactive side, and for years I’ve lived in a cycle of hyperfocus and burnout. Nothing felt “enough” or “perfect”, so I kept polishing, then I’d burn out and abandon it. In the end, I had lots of half-finished work and very little truly completed.\n\nLately I’m learning to prioritise, and like many of you said, a consistent routine has helped the most. To manage the hyperactive side, the vocal stimming, and my mind wandering, I started going live on Facebook (I just have my famliy members on facebook). Weirdly, that’s helped me stay present and keep the hyperactivity in check.\n\nI also used to take loads of notes, but they were scattered everywhere (notebooks, random apps, GitHub). Now I’ve moved everything into Notion with a proper structure, and it’s made a huge difference\n\nOne thing I still struggle with is the need for validation. I’m starting to accept that this might be something I need to work through properly, and I think therapy is the direction that will actually help long-term.\n\nReally appreciate all of you taking the time to share advice and experiences.",

And we both know this friction could be reduced by moving a lot of these responsibilities into the cicd pipelines.  \n\nThis type of friction is something unfortunately only certain people can change because it's organizational and requires different c suite and vp's to understand which can be a difficult task. If those people aren't open to it, then switch jobs. Optimizing for machines is easy. Optimizing our companies decisions unfortunately is complicated. \n\nAs my role has increased, my time is being spent more on \"selling\" our devops practices to the right leadership and how these best practices reduce the friction from organizational processes.  There're two paths to adoption in my opinion.\n\nThe first is convincing the leadership in charge of both organizations to see the friction. So a lot of my time is spent on making architectural diagrams, reading the latest research publications to use in presentations and design, generating pretty graphs, etc. I want to showcase where we are spending our time and the value coming out of the different usages of time.\n\nThe second is to convince the leadership and engineers from the team causing friction that there's a better way. For this, I spend time helping my team excel in ways that we always get recognition in organizational announcements. We want to convince leadership and engineers in other organizations to see how efficient we are and come to us to adopt our practices.  \n\nEncouraging education seems to be difficult in this industry. The people in the highest roles often get there over time and often get stuck in their ways. It's not always the case but it happens enough and the research agrees. The DORA research publications have shown that a disconnect between developers and researchers is all too common",

Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \\~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.\n\nA little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.\n\nThe core issues:\n\n* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output\n* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy\n* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity\n* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable\n* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview features\n\nThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.\n\nComing from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.\n\nI'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.\n\nDE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.\n\n  \nEDITED: Because there was too much details and colleagues.",

Then the BI experience is insulated from any spikes upstream. If you are still doing import mode for BI reports then you could even just have them in Pro workspaces, based on your user count.\n\nUltimately if you don't like Fabric and want to move to something different, you do you - but those small wins _might_ make it less painful and less necessary to rebuild on a different stack.\n\nFwiw we've not had any \"random\" pipeline failures that we couldn't debug and understand the reason for. There have been a few (very few) examples of python notebooks misbehaving for _odd_ reasons - what feels like problems happening on the level of the underlying Azure infrastructure running Fabric.

Sloppy, thrown together crap to snare the people who'll always prefer to select MSFT, or think synergies (e.g. with PBI) make up for it.\n\nI've always wanted to run a FOSS Spark setup, but I mostly work for enterprises and Databricks handles/integrates *so much* enterprise-required stuff (IAM, access controls/governance, dictionaries etc.) that it's a pragmatic choice. You could put together all those things from FOSS, but it probably adds up to a lot of components and thus a higher complexity burden. An all-in-one solution is pretty appealing.\n\n>since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS\n\nIt's pretty affordable if you manage costs appropriately?

You're already at the company so you have the advantage of either a) being in possession of specific domain knowledge that only someone at Amazon would know, or b) being equipped with resources to help you learn it much easier than an external candidate ever could.  You also understand the culture and what sort of skills are valued there better than an external candidate could.  So focus on your transferable experience and do whatever you can to learn technical skills you feel you have gaps for.\n\nIf you don't have any technical skills at all from the job post above then I would recommend looking for a way to network with a team doing work you're interested in and seeing if you can convince your manager to let you collaborate with them on a stretch project.

We're on a standard stack for a small to midsize - Snowflake, DBT (Cloud), Github, AWS. Our project repo is sitting at about 1600 models currently, though probably has some room to trim. So the what the custom GPT does is it pulls in sql files from the DBT repository, and if the files exist the documentation yml's, to feed into context and help with code generation, downstream documentation when making a new model, and I've even got it setup now to write the custom calcs in Sigma when necessary. \n\nIs it automating my job? Kinda, it saves me a shit ton of time every day. One of the ways is that I don't really field \"What field do I use/Where do I find x\" questions much anymore. It also will generate a really robust yml to load with every model, including the basic tests, so I don't even have to think about it. I just have to review, make edits to descriptions where it got minor things usually wrong and on I go. \n\nMy team uses it every day, my boss uses it every day, our analysts are using it multiple times a week.

Dimensions largely don’t add much value to us, as most of the relationships are just defined as primary to primary or primary to foreign key joins between those tables, and all the columns we need are directly from those tables being joined.

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. \n\nMy current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. \n\nWhen we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",

I look at timestamps, Boolean fields, status fields. \n\n3) Then I'll use functions like QUALIFY to look at records in a table, see what's changing at row level and what's causing that change for a new row. \n\n4) If I don't understand data at that point, then I'll get my SME's into a meeting and get lot more clarification.

          "text": "Totes. The idea that we don’t need modelling anymore could only be pushed by people who have no clue what they are on about, or grifters trying to sell you bullshit snake oil. Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. \n\nData modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.\n\nNow this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. \n\nSo how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!\n\nIf anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.\n\nI am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  \n\nThe way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version.

Datalake is organized by container then sub-folders, one sub-folder per source, then sub-folders below that. Container-level can be Dev, UAT, Prod.\n\nThen Load into staging, with reject management and deletion from source management, adding control columns like hashes and a single column PK (this can be a hashed value of multiple source columns - this is fine).\n\nDeletion tracking requires \"full\" from source if you don't have CDC tracking from source that contains all inserts, updates, deletes. So for these \"full\" cases it's a separate distinct process.\n\nThe layer after staging, Bronze, is vetted information, has control columns, identifies source and SSoT, has flags like IsCurrent, IsDeleted, and lots of datetime columns for inserted, updated, deleted.\n\nEx: a customer table imported from an OLTP ERP system on-prem. You want to capture all changes, like customer address info, so you have a history of when the customer moved to a different location. If customer table are companies, companies get acquired and merged. The business has to give you rules to apply.\n\nSo these topics I mention above, are given at University-level Business Intelligence classes. Some private colleges too.

          "text": "100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.\n\nAs I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.\n\nTLDR;  going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data.\n\n  \nFor some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).\n\nAt first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.\n\nBut in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.\n\nA recent example is that I spent \\~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \\~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

You can be technically strong and \"not a good fit\" for a massive list of reasons.  Usually, it's just vibes.\n\nMy background is in chemistry.  I used to make the active component of pharmaceuticals for a living.  I got rejected for a DE role at a pharma company looking for DEs with a background in the specific chemistry I did which I swear can't be very common.  Reasons? No idea.\n\n>Its definitely been getting to me I thought i was a pretty good engineer.\n\nLikewise, I thought I was a decent chemist.  I lost my last chemistry job during the pandemic and kept interviewing for places where all of my technical skills lined up.  I didn't struggle in the technicals and seemed to get on with everybody too.  Some places never called me back.  Other places rejected me at the last hurdle.  I even followed up with some of the team members who interviewed me and asked them wtf was up because it was extremely confusing.  The team members said if it was up to them, I'd have been in.  They weren't consulted so it must have been management.\n\nMy personal issue was that I hadn't enjoyed doing chemistry for quite a while before then.  I didn't want to do chemistry anymore, but, I have bills to pay.  I think no matter where I went and no matter how many technicals I would have cleared, every company I would have interviewed for would have said no.  They didn't have to know I had lost my passion for the field although I'm sure, subsconsciously or consciously, they knew something was off.\n\nI changed field to DE.  Best decision ever for me.

              "text": "Hey! Fellow chemist data engineer!\n\nI went into a form of organizational sciences after chemistry before finally hopping to data engineering. I've found that the two together make me into a sort of business superhero: looking for the true meaning of data and the true business problems that need to be solved.\n\nMy advice to any struggling data engineer is to evaluate whether or not you are actually identifying and actually solving business problems. You can be the end-all be-all of Spark, Databricks, etc., and you can build perfectly to provided specifications, but ultimately end up worthless to the business by not actually solving problems.\n\nLearn to interrogate the data, the business constructs, find what people are actually needing and trying to achieve, speak to the stakeholders and understand them, their needs, hell their entire job if you can.\n\nExplain the benefits of modern infrastructure and methods in the context of the business problem and constructs. If you can't bring an engaged layperson to understanding what you put forth, then keep refining your thoughts and approach until you can.\n\nBuild your ability to present such that you can speak to managers and stakeholders. Build your technical understanding such that you can put forth directions on-the-fly and communicate why these directions will lead everyone towards the goal of solving the actual business problem.\n\nBringing this back to my first points: my background in the sciences has so greatly assisted me in all of the above. All too often, I meet technical people who are fantastic developers, but just build things off-kilter and struggle to gather requirements and internalize the business's needs and goals. It'd be like a plumber who doesn't understand what a pipe will be used for - is it the washer/dryer, sewage, a fire hydrant, or what? These developers do the equivalent of building a sewage pipe that emerges in the center of the bathroom floor - it's almost correct, but useless because nobody wants the toilet there.",

No idea.\n\nThis reminds me of a short-term contract job that I interviewed for recently.\n\nAlthough I'm not one anymore, I have a background as a data analyst. I worked 5+ years as a data analyst across two different industries.\n\nRecently, a recruiter contacted me about a position that's in one of the niche industries that I used to work in. There are only a handful of major companies in that industry, I've worked for a few of them, and have a combined three years of experience across those companies. The job was for some much smaller company in the same industry. And although the job was remote, the company happens to be in the same city that I'm located in. So we are on the same time zone. And I'd be open to going into the office if they wanted me to do that.\n\nI couldn't even get an interview. Like you, I have no idea why. I didn't get any feedback. And as far as I can tell, the recruiter ghosted me.",

Work in progress there. I would say, though, that having pretty strictly defined schema in the destination table tends to be what saves me. Unless I get pretty much exactly what I expect structurally, the import is going to fail.\n\nDue to the nature of the data I'm integrating and our position as a company, there isn't much I can do in terms of accuracy validation.

RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  \n\nYou can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  \n\nIt's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly.  It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.

We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

I do loads of APIs, file stuff, DB work, bulk inserts, merges, stored procedures, orchestration with drivers etc. So I’m not new to data engineering by any means, but whenever I look at other jobs they all want Python, AWS/GCP, Kafka, Airflow, and I start feeling like I’m way behind.\n\nAm I actually behind? Do I need to learn all this stuff before I can get a job that’s “equivalent”? Or does having solid experience with ETL, pipelines, orchestration, DBs etc still count for a lot? Feels like I’ve been doing the same kind of work but on the “wrong” tech stack and now I’m worried.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s made the jump or recruiters, like how much not having cloud/Python really matters.",

Majority cloud experience was seen as a (very slight) negative because those people often didn't know how to optimize single-node operations.

If a person has both on-prem and cloud experience equally, the \"majority on-prem\" person would receive 1st priority and 50/50 person would receive 2nd (\"majority cloud\" would be 3rd pick).\n\nThese priorities of course don't take into account how well the interview goes.

Now, our new Indian coworkers are copying text from Jira tickets, pasting it into Claude, copying whatever Claude generates, and opening PRs without testing the code. The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. \n\nMy manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.\n\nLast week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. \n\nSo, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find. We have guardrails on everything, so no one has brought down dev, let alone prod, but jfc it's an exhausting, neverending mess around here.",

Designing Data Intensive Applications is excellent, but it’s more of a “why things work this way” book, so it lands better once you’ve built or broken a few pipelines. Zoomcamp will honestly teach you more faster than passive reading, so I’d prioritize that and use the books as references alongside it. Build something, hit a wall, then read the relevant chapters that tends to stick much better than linear reading",
