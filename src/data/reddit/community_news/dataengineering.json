YAML for Docker, dbt configs, random CI settings. I have done it before, but when I need it again my brain is blank.\n\n\\- I get overwhelmed by a small list of fixes. Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\n\n\\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \n\n\\- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\n\n\\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.\n\nI’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.\n\nIf you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? \n\nAny coping systems that actually worked for you? Or do you also feel like you’re constantly re-learning the same tools?\n\nWould love to hear how other people handle it.",

It genuinely makes me feel safer knowing so many of us go through similar things.\n\nI realised I have ADHD a bit late, and I’m still learning how to cope with it. I’m more on the hyperactive side, and for years I’ve lived in a cycle of hyperfocus and burnout. Nothing felt “enough” or “perfect”, so I kept polishing, then I’d burn out and abandon it. In the end, I had lots of half-finished work and very little truly completed.\n\nLately I’m learning to prioritise, and like many of you said, a consistent routine has helped the most. To manage the hyperactive side, the vocal stimming, and my mind wandering, I started going live on Facebook (I just have my famliy members on facebook). Weirdly, that’s helped me stay present and keep the hyperactivity in check.\n\nI also used to take loads of notes, but they were scattered everywhere (notebooks, random apps, GitHub). Now I’ve moved everything into Notion with a proper structure, and it’s made a huge difference\n\nOne thing I still struggle with is the need for validation. I’m starting to accept that this might be something I need to work through properly, and I think therapy is the direction that will actually help long-term.\n\nReally appreciate all of you taking the time to share advice and experiences.",

Insurance is especially heavy on this. Some teams do manage to streamline it with better self-service, platform teams, or looser controls in non-prod, but 60 to 70% overhead isn’t unusual.

And we both know this friction could be reduced by moving a lot of these responsibilities into the cicd pipelines.  \n\nThis type of friction is something unfortunately only certain people can change because it's organizational and requires different c suite and vp's to understand which can be a difficult task. If those people aren't open to it, then switch jobs. Optimizing for machines is easy. Optimizing our companies decisions unfortunately is complicated. \n\nAs my role has increased, my time is being spent more on \"selling\" our devops practices to the right leadership and how these best practices reduce the friction from organizational processes.  There're two paths to adoption in my opinion.\n\nThe first is convincing the leadership in charge of both organizations to see the friction. So a lot of my time is spent on making architectural diagrams, reading the latest research publications to use in presentations and design, generating pretty graphs, etc. I want to showcase where we are spending our time and the value coming out of the different usages of time.\n\nThe second is to convince the leadership and engineers from the team causing friction that there's a better way. For this, I spend time helping my team excel in ways that we always get recognition in organizational announcements. We want to convince leadership and engineers in other organizations to see how efficient we are and come to us to adopt our practices.  \n\nEncouraging education seems to be difficult in this industry. The people in the highest roles often get there over time and often get stuck in their ways. It's not always the case but it happens enough and the research agrees. The DORA research publications have shown that a disconnect between developers and researchers is all too common",

      "text": "Hi DEs,\n\nAnd the people using Fivetran..\n\nWe are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.\n\nPreviously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.\n\nWhat is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?\nFivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.\n\nWill Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

As a small consultancy, we helped a few clients to migrate to dlt from Fivetran because the cost didn't make sense, because the connectors they wanted didn't exist, or just because they didn't like to deal with a balck box (with pricing controlled by others).\n\n2. As organizer of the Data Berlin meetup, I spoke with multiple teams which introduced dlt, initially for limited use cases, then it started to replace more consistent data loads. Once you have dlt in place it makes no sense to spend for loading if you can have it for free (or at least a minimal fraction of what you are paying).\n\nFeel free to ping me in case you want me to elaborate",

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

The easiest way we trapped them to the point they got so scared they left the interview. the key is to ask them some minor topical questions early in the interview loop so you dont waste your time on them. early as in the first 5 mins.   we started asking them technical impossibilities. LLM prompting tends to spit out more detailed responses if give them the context or premise. when you do this, the LLM tends to accept whatever context to give them is true and will attempt to answer in that context. Thus, if give people incorrect context. And a question about something that relies on that context. A person who is good at DE work will know right away you were wrong. But the LLM, because you gave it the context as true, will attempt to answer with hallucinations.\n\nOne of the questions we like to ask is this: Airflow implements a version of a DAG. So does Spark. Our team has been working integrating both DAGs together for improved performance. Guide us from a high level how this can be achieved.  If the LLM tells the candidate they were wrong in the prompt, the candidate is not likely to respond to us that we were wrong but think the LLM is wrong. as they are not technical enough to know how right or wrong the LLM is actually. A good portion of the time, the candidate will just read the gibberish to us with an uneasy look as they are not sure if its right or wrong.  based on these types of questions. We sometimes just end the interview early.  If they can somehow answer the question, we start changing the scenario and going back and forth in the timeline to mess with the LLM's memory.",

When a candidate knows their stuff they can communicate succinctly and confidently. When they are just reading an AI prompt they ramble on and cannot make a clear point. When given a coding challenge if they refuse to show how they think I consider it a fail. Their use of AI is obvious every time.\n\nFor me, a candidate who uses AI to answer questions are demonstrating poor character traits that you do not want on your team such as deception, poor communication, and taking shortcuts. They came to the interview without mastering the material and it’s highly likely they will not correct this gap later. As soon as the use of AI is clear consider ending the interview. Why waste your time?\n\nThe challenging part of your question is filtering candidates to interview. Recruiters may not be skilled at screening. I attempt to adjust for this by going to meetups, making connections with schools, using recruiting firms with similar connections, or requiring in person interviews. Even if you cannot do an in person interviews large recruiting firms have offices in multiple locations and can request the candidate come to a location to be monitored.",

          "text": "\"The only way to know if they are not using AI is to interview them, but how can I prevent interviewing someone that is using AI?\" You're answering your own question. Comes with the job of hiring someone. If interviewing people is part of your role as a manager, then why sweat having these phone calls? You're getting paid to do it. And since you say that HR is giving you resumes, then a logical step you could take if someone is riding you that this is taking too long to hire is to request that you yourself do the resume filtering. \n\nYou'll need to change your interviewing process to prevent this from happening. Before you do a technical Teams call, try a casual-but-technical phone call. See if this helps you weed out the phony candidates.\n\nIn my opinion, at the end of the day, this just comes with hiring. Ask candidates to do in person interviews or in person screening (\"Hey I see you're local, can we meet at a coffee shop to discuss the role and your interest?\") by looking for local candidates. Too many people want to be fully remote and so they are going to keep using AI just like companies keep using AI to filter out candidates. For a role where the user is likely tech-saavy, it's very little effort on their part to mass apply to hundreds of jobs with AI resumes.\n\nImmovable object meets an unstoppable force.",

Do you have some links here?\n\n  \nAlso, while I have to agree that \"rolling your own\" is certainly not for everybody, it does take extra work and  thought, it is not just the extra cost for cloud services you need to consider. Things like lock-in effect, loss of control over your own data, a total inability to pretty much investigate anything when an outage occurs are just some topics one might mention here. Are these things important enough to warrant the extra effort of not just taking an off the shelf cloud solution? No idea - everybody needs to answer that for themselves, but I personally have been bitten by shitty SaaS vendors often enough, that I'll at least think about hosting something on my own every time.",

You add ducklake, airflow, superset etc. in containers or dedicated VPS instances as your needs evolve. Data is stored directly on nvme or hetzners own S3 service, depending on your volume and performance needs.\n\nThis setup is more performant than databricks/spark in almost all cases and almost universally loved by analysts and data scientists, because they often already know these tools (especially jupyterhub).\n\nThis is not out of the box, but it actually is not that hard to learn and less work to maintain and optimize than databricks.\n\nAlso something to consider: Managing bare metal infra and going all-in on open source is going to become a VERY valuable skill again going forward, given the current geopolitical landscape, because it is the ONLY way to be 100% in control of your data.\n\nPM me if you want to know more.

However, I’d recommend looking for an analyst job that works closely with the engineering team. In my old job, I pretty much was the middle man between the data engineers and any department that had a data related use case. This gave me a ton of experience with gathering requirements, planning go live dates, determining frequency that tables needed to be loaded, etc. I also “mapped” all fields to whatever table they were being added to. So I wrote a lot of SQL transformations and complicated Joins. This was insanely valuable experience. \n\n\nLooking for titles like: BI analyst, BI Engineer, Data Management Analyst. Also any mentions of mapping, data modeling, managing data warehouse logic, or supporting the data engineering team are usually a good sign you will get an opportunity to learn some valuable skills. \n\n\nExtra Tip: When you eventually get an interview, be likable! There are plenty of people in the world that have the skills to be a good DE. Separate yourself by being someone that the interviewer would enjoy working with. My team told me that the last round of my interview was between me and one other person, and they eventually chose me because we got along better. \n\n\n\nSorry for any typos, I don’t have the energy to get up and grab my glasses.",

Feels like I’ve been doing the same kind of work but on the “wrong” tech stack and now I’m worried.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s made the jump or recruiters, like how much not having cloud/Python really matters.",

Privacy sensitive, majority on-prem (for the data our team works with, the bank globally uses cloud ofc), python with SQL and dataframes. Majority cloud experience was seen as a (very slight) negative because those people often didn't know how to optimize single-node operations. In our context, \"just scale it up\" isn't an option.\n\nBoth the on-prem person and the cloud person would've been given an interview (because I respect people's experiences and adaptability and don't try to project what they can/can't do), but the \"majority on-prem\" person would've received priority (especially from our businesspeople). If a person has both on-prem and cloud experience equally, the \"majority on-prem\" person would receive 1st priority and 50/50 person would receive 2nd (\"majority cloud\" would be 3rd pick).\n\nThese priorities of course don't take into account how well the interview goes.

It is the simplest and fastest structure for iterating through provided values.\n\nThe hashing of a set is irrelevant to iterating over all the values.

Modeling will make you ship faster with AI-assisted coding. It's also important for certain hyped features such as text-to-SQL. Unless the LLM bubbles burst (meaning it would be prohibitively expensive to use), LLMs will be come one of the main data (model) consumers.\n\nAs for your question: do proper data models and then code with Cursor or Claude Code. It will be much faster than you hand writing transformation code.",

I am presenting to the entire company in a few weeks where we are, why we are doing it, etc. In fact, I could probably use some advice from senior people here on tips for framing this to business users. In my eyes, the value from a business user's POV is simplicity and intuitiveness of a Kimball-style setup, so my current plan is to focus on that.",

There were also several instances where I created an operational data mart, just like Inmon's approach. I also worked on other projects, several of which required their own database models.

No idea.\n\n>Its definitely been getting to me I thought i was a pretty good engineer.\n\nLikewise, I thought I was a decent chemist.  I lost my last chemistry job during the pandemic and kept interviewing for places where all of my technical skills lined up.  I didn't struggle in the technicals and seemed to get on with everybody too.  Some places never called me back.  Other places rejected me at the last hurdle.  I even followed up with some of the team members who interviewed me and asked them wtf was up because it was extremely confusing.  The team members said if it was up to them, I'd have been in.  They weren't consulted so it must have been management.\n\nMy personal issue was that I hadn't enjoyed doing chemistry for quite a while before then.  I didn't want to do chemistry anymore, but, I have bills to pay.  I think no matter where I went and no matter how many technicals I would have cleared, every company I would have interviewed for would have said no.  They didn't have to know I had lost my passion for the field although I'm sure, subsconsciously or consciously, they knew something was off.\n\nI changed field to DE.  Best decision ever for me.

I've found that the two together make me into a sort of business superhero: looking for the true meaning of data and the true business problems that need to be solved.\n\nMy advice to any struggling data engineer is to evaluate whether or not you are actually identifying and actually solving business problems. You can be the end-all be-all of Spark, Databricks, etc., and you can build perfectly to provided specifications, but ultimately end up worthless to the business by not actually solving problems.\n\nLearn to interrogate the data, the business constructs, find what people are actually needing and trying to achieve, speak to the stakeholders and understand them, their needs, hell their entire job if you can.\n\nExplain the benefits of modern infrastructure and methods in the context of the business problem and constructs. If you can't bring an engaged layperson to understanding what you put forth, then keep refining your thoughts and approach until you can.\n\nBuild your ability to present such that you can speak to managers and stakeholders. Build your technical understanding such that you can put forth directions on-the-fly and communicate why these directions will lead everyone towards the goal of solving the actual business problem.\n\nBringing this back to my first points: my background in the sciences has so greatly assisted me in all of the above. All too often, I meet technical people who are fantastic developers, but just build things off-kilter and struggle to gather requirements and internalize the business's needs and goals. It'd be like a plumber who doesn't understand what a pipe will be used for - is it the washer/dryer, sewage, a fire hydrant, or what? These developers do the equivalent of building a sewage pipe that emerges in the center of the bathroom floor - it's almost correct, but useless because nobody wants the toilet there.",

I brought up the idea that we should really be separating the orchestration from the actual pipelines.  I suggested that we use the KubernetesOperator to run containerized Python code instead of using the PythonOperator. People looked at me like I was crazy, and there are some seasoned seniors on the team. In reality, is this a common practice? I know a lot of people talk about using Airflow purely as an orchestration tool and running things via ECS or EKS, but how common is this in the real world. ",

Reason is that the PythonOperator, as many noted, runs on airflow compute (workers) and depending on what compute engine airflow sits on this doesn’t scale well for big data volumes. For small things it is fine, but not for reliable production. Airflow uses a central requirements.txt file so managing all the different library versions and conflicts is nightmare and requires a lot of discipline. Using airflow purely as an orchestrator and execute on Faragate for example gives everyone a lot more flexibility and decouples Python dependencies from the workers. It also allows you to use any programming language you prefer.  if you are using MWAA, managed airflow on AWS, it will not allow you to install any dependency you want, mostly pure Python libraries or it gets complicated quickly.\n\nLong story short, outsourcing you compute to WCS or other compute and just use airflow for orchestration leads to a much more stable airflow. A lot of companies are doing this as best practice now.",

          "text": "The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it.  \n\nBusiness context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs.  RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  \n\nYou can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  \n\nIt's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly.  It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.  It's not going away.",

I work with large dfs often 20m+ and have lot of ram. 256gb+. \n\nAlso, on another note I have never used polars. Is it good and just better than pandas even with pandas 3.0. and can handle most of what pandas does? So maybe instead of going from pandas 1 to pandas 3 I can just jump straight to polars? \n\nI read somewhere it has worse gis support. I do work with geopandas often.

          "text": "So first answer:\n\nFrom pandas 2.0 onwards a lot of change was made to move from numpy into arrow, so you cant just use np.nans as pandas nans now, its pd.NA. Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

I work at a small company and joined a data science team and started writing etl stuff in jupyter notebooks in jupyterlab. and then later even as the project grew I kept writing parameterised notebooks and ran them with papermill. But it's starting to get absurd and I think isn't really common practice at all. But I am not sure how to get out of this habit. \n\nI write data science style procedural code and like to inspect and muck with stuff every step along the way otherwise I feel blind. It feels as I am in a live debugger. Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. \n\nI personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. \n\nI am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data. Thanks guys.",

Each of these bits can then be tested  simply by running examples data through them independently and comparing outputs match expectations (this is basically what unit tests are). \n\nIf done, when someone comes up to you and says I think churn should have been 10% this month but it's showing a negative number you can quickly say oh that's strange I get 20 customers who didn't make an order 300 active customers and 100 new customers (by running the subfunctions) so following the definition I get 20/300-100 which is about -99. And they can go I think maybe you missed some brackets it should of been 20/(300-100) and then you go doh I'll fix that in the calculate user churn function . Or they can go that 100 doesn't sound right and you can go oh let's explore that by looking at _count new customers and so on. \n\nSticking to functions having a single responsibility like this makes reuse easier as code is less tied to single outputs and also makes testing your code through unit tests easier too.",

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.\n\nIt will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you get to this level there is a whole world of code design best practices you can venture into to make your job easier while giving you more confidence in the correctness of your code and its artifacts.",

It’s not totally production ready yet. But it’s already pretty powerful. I think you’ll really like the tracing/replaying feature a lot just based on that quote above. This library was made for the exact kind of workflow you’re desiring, productionizing data science workflows but still having the flexibility to iterate in notebook style environments. It is pretty function based, but imo it makes dealing with/thinking about functions easy since you think of functions as “things you want” (nouns) rather than arbitrary operations (verbs). \n\nhttps://github.com/mitstake/darl#debugging-tracing-and-replaying",

It all sounds fine in theory, but as you mention in the post, you end up doing a full db copy anyways lmao. Messaging Seems like overkill and a solution looking for a problem but maybe you work in a high risk industry like defense or gambling or something idk",

Given the volumes you're dealing with (which are relatively modest), you could query the selected tables directly with DuckDB, land the results in cloud storage (S3, Azure Data Lake Storage), and attach them to Snowflake as external tables. That would be enough for hourly/daily syncs at this scale.\n\nIf you want to keep the streaming approach, a zero-ETL solution would be Kafka Connect with S3 Sink (Iceberg Topics are too much for your case). I'd recommend a metadata-driven approach: extract the Postgres schemas as CSV, let Product/Analytics teams mark which tables they need, and dynamically build your Kafka Connect configs from that. Combined with Kafka Connect S3 Sink (Parquet/Avro) + Snowflake External Tables (zero-copy), you get the same benefits (no ETL, no storage overhead), but with team self-service and without having to manage 10-15 DBs × X tables as separate topics. Schema evolution runs through Schema Registry, and when pipeline issues occur, S3 becomes your buffer instead of the source DB.",
