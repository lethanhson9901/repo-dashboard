There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.\n\n10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.\n\n5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.\n\nIn the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.\n\nIf you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends. The key is identifying the next trend before it happens.",

One of the many reasons the IT market is broken is because people are being coached to mask their lack of knowledge with confidence. Instead of ego-stroking, we should be telling OP to actually study the fundamentals missed during those 4 years of chaos.\n\nI expected the downvotes, and I’m not claiming to have the absolute truth here. This is just my perspective based on how much the market has changed. I believe that being honest about knowledge gaps (while uncomfortable) is more helpful in the long run than a 'feel-good' answer.

All of it is valid. You're not weak for feeling this way. You're human.\n\nAnd asking for help publicly when you're this vulnerable? That takes guts. Most people disappear and suffer in silence. You didn't.\n\nI worked with Data Product Owners at Sky for years, and I mentored quite a few of them. What you're describing isn't unusual.\n\nFour years in chaotic startups with constant restructuring? You've actually learned more than you think. You know how to work without clear processes. You know how to figure things out when nobody gives you a playbook. You know what happens when data governance doesn't exist. Most candidates from stable companies panic when they encounter ambiguity. You won't.\n\nThe fear you're feeling is real, and I won't tell you it's not valid. Take a day or two to feel it. Don't job hunt today. Let yourself be angry, sad, whatever needs to come out.\n\nThen get practical.\n\nWhat a Data PM actually does in a \"normal\" company:\n\n\\- Owns the roadmap for data products (dashboards, pipelines, data contracts, self-service tools)\n\n\\- Translates business questions into data requirements\n\n\\- Prioritizes requests from stakeholders who all think their thing is urgent\n\n\\- Works with engineering to scope what's buildable in what timeframe\n\n\\- Defines success metrics for data initiatives\n\n\\- Manages stakeholder expectations (this is 40% of the job)\n\nYou've probably done most of this informally. The difference in structured environments is documentation and process. That's learnable in weeks.\n\nFor interview prep: Study the Modern Data Stack. Know what dbt does, what data contracts are, what a semantic layer is. Read about data mesh (even if you think it's overhyped, interviewers ask about it). Be ready to talk about trade-offs, not just features.\n\nWhen they ask about your chaotic environments, frame it: \"I had to build processes where none existed.\" That's valuable. Companies with perfect processes don't need strong PMs.\n\nOne thing you won't read in most career advice: if you want to grow fast in this field, find a great data or platform architect who actually wants to work with you. Not just tolerates you, but genuinely enjoys the collaboration. The best Data PMs I've mentored all had this in common. A good architect will teach you how systems actually work, why certain decisions matter, and how to ask the right questions. That partnership changes everything. \n\nYou're not starting from zero. You're starting from four years of learning what doesn't work, which is often more useful than knowing what does.",

You have to consider the value you provided amidst the chaos to make a good story to sell your profile.\n\nRemember, any job wants these things:\n\n1. Cultural fit\n2. Competency to contribute from day 1\n3. A strong indication you will be worth the time and money they invest into you\n\nWhen you apply, study the company and find something you genuinely like about it - learn their mission statement and incorporate it into your cover letter (always write a cover letter for every app).\n\nIf you can contribute from day 1 - let them know what you've done beforehand and how you can do that there - this is easier to do during interviews or by modifying your resume. Make sure your resume always includes responsibilities and accomplishments couched in actual measurable metrics.\n\nLooking like you're worth hiring is hard to do - the hiring manager or team leader reviewing your app or resume or interviewing you does not want to hire someone that does not pan out - that's a big failure on their part and anything you can do to guarantee you're not that person is the type of strategy you want to pursue. 1 and 2 help with this, but what really helps is how you interview and what you can say about your ability to learn and grow at a company.\n\nIf you're saying you didn't learn anything at your job, which I don't think is true in four years, you have to sit with your memories of your experiences and codify them into something concrete. Imagine, if you had more time at any point, how could you have come away from that period feeling like you had learned something? It's fine to admit you had to be quick and dirty during MVP development at your start up - say that was the case and that when you got time, you made sure to review what you learned to be able to cut through the chaos, were you to need to go back to handling those responsibilities.\n\nDon't get in your own way buddy - good luck.",

You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. \n\nFor me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards😝 kinda kidding. \n\nAs an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert.

Here is my take on certificates:\n\nI prefer when candidates understand the engineering concepts and are able to apply them to different platforms. I have interviewed candidates who are certified with multiple platforms like GCP, AWS,...but couldn't answer how indexing works and why it would help in a query. \n\nWhen I do a technical interview with a candidate, I pay more attention to how they approach a problem and their coding habit. I like the candidates who keep their codes in tidy and consistent formatting. To me, these are the ones who can think straight in stressful scenarios, are disciplined and show good communication skills.",

You can earn a bunch of credentials for free (Oracle, GCP, AWS, Microsoft, etc all give out vouchers from time to time through various programs). \n\nIn my mind, certs are basically for two things:\n\n1. Partnership requirements. (e.g., you work for a Google Cloud partner, and they financially incentivize you to have a well-trained, distributed and credentialed staff by gating access to funding opportunities behind certification requirements)  \n\n2. Helping you get past an HR screen. I have a bunch of certs and they're all completely worthless imo, but also they do make it more likely your resume will be reviewed and make it into the right pile, which can help you in the early stages of the hiring process. The more keywords go on your resume, the better. Also, when you have like 10 relevant certs and list them, your resume stands out because you show depth in the field - you must at least know enough and have enough general experience and history in the field to have acquired them.",

Foolishly I thought “hey DE looks like a nice niche. I’ll learn that.” So I used Exercism to learn python and ChatGPT as mentoring. I wanted to build a small oncology knowledge base that was oncogene-agnostic(I used civicdb.org and GraphQL to ingest the raw data based on selected oncogene). Using AI has “helped” in a wierd way. Instead of feeding me production grade tech stack it listened to me as beginner and took me through simple sqlite. Then we migrated that to Postgres and then we started using dbt to create the tables. It was also a complicated journey of learning about start schema, dims, bridges and facts. Obviously SQL came into play early but I was using INSERT OR IGNORE which was not helping with idempotency. I was using for loops to read and transform data from the raw json and then insert it into the tables instead if using dbt to do that properly and enforce rules. I learned how to create CLI commands and flags to trigger the API call and build the raw json and then dbt run to populate tables. I’ve also learned to implemeny very basic CI(linting and formatting mostly) with a few simple pytests. I’ve even created a few marts for some analytical showcasing. It was a grueling and trying experience. Really hard. If I remeber 50% of it O would count myself lucky. But this is for sure: I k ow what it takes to build a pipeline from ingesting to transforming and warehousing. Have not implement orchestration yet but in due time I will. I’ve for ed myself to do it properly using  a Docker container and using github which helped me understand the perils and benefits of branching, pull requesting and merging.\n\nI’m one of the lucky o es because I own a business and I’m not looking for work. I just wanted to have a fallback plan in case my income stream tanked. Always loved the idea of learning to code. Right now I’m following my dream of building a game using Unity and tha github account and knowledge is coming in handy. Python not so much:)) My time is limited but I do what I can. 2 kids and a family will probably leave me up to 1-2 hours of coding. Was lucky to be less busy during autumn and was able to put in a lot more hours. \n\nAnyway, personal projects I feel is the way to go for sure.",

I focus my resume on projects i really applied myself on and either saved the company a lot of money, or fundamentally changed/empowered the workflow for massive efficiency gains. I think the key here is people who think certs help are already thinking a bit too academically in the real world positions they hold. And true value in DE comes from really understanding the jobs beyond yours to see the worthwhile, out of the box solutions. My first big major role was %80-90 on prem, but a huuuge environment. I learned the extreme basics in real world conditions (multiple different sql engines/db styles built/utilized by totally different teams) to solve real pressing business problems with a multitude of frameworks (kube clusters, single standing airflow servers, equipment controller cluster dbs) and beat feet around the office to get face time with the stakeholders to understand the problems as in depth as possible. No point studying models and methods (ESPECIALLY for overpriced low-code crap, thatll be worthless to the company when they switch in a few years and doubly so to you if you happen to get RIF'd and the next company uses something else) when you can learn them/discover them along the way(in what, like a half day of research?) to a solution (plus holy hell do lessons learned this way stick so much better with a long track of a personal endeavor with success at the end(also felt this way about some calc derivative formulas and such in eng school, as it was easier for me to get better at solving the fundamental equation/problem and then just take 5-10 mins at the start and work/write out the ones i knew would be on the test)). With those applied problem solving skills and super long-hour/week grind years, ive never had to prove my worth very hard anymore because my experience ballooned so quick that i can usually relate a lot of new problems to *something* ive seen before. That, and im super lazy once i get out of work so not a lot of drive to build massive things in my spare time (plus not nearly as many resources on my own outside of big companies to work with)(also maybe so lazy bc i dump so much effort into my jobs?// MAW get paid for cooking the noggin). \n\nMain takeaway id like to emphasize is that a good DE doesnt just talk to other comp sci/dba/DE folks... getting out of your comfort zone, getting face time with customers/clients and really trying to see how they find problems and the constraints they face trying to solve them on their own is what generates golden goose value imo... i mean shit half the time i get dirty looks from CS majors for not phrasing something perfectly, but my big picture perspective has always been whats gotten me wins. Get out of your comfort zone, always ask why, chase the big problems, and apply yourself and youll probably surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.",

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

The easiest way we trapped them to the point they got so scared they left the interview. the key is to ask them some minor topical questions early in the interview loop so you dont waste your time on them. early as in the first 5 mins.   we started asking them technical impossibilities. LLM prompting tends to spit out more detailed responses if give them the context or premise. when you do this, the LLM tends to accept whatever context to give them is true and will attempt to answer in that context. Thus, if give people incorrect context. And a question about something that relies on that context. A person who is good at DE work will know right away you were wrong. But the LLM, because you gave it the context as true, will attempt to answer with hallucinations.\n\nOne of the questions we like to ask is this: Airflow implements a version of a DAG. So does Spark. Our team has been working integrating both DAGs together for improved performance. Guide us from a high level how this can be achieved.  If the LLM tells the candidate they were wrong in the prompt, the candidate is not likely to respond to us that we were wrong but think the LLM is wrong. as they are not technical enough to know how right or wrong the LLM is actually. A good portion of the time, the candidate will just read the gibberish to us with an uneasy look as they are not sure if its right or wrong.  based on these types of questions. We sometimes just end the interview early.  If they can somehow answer the question, we start changing the scenario and going back and forth in the timeline to mess with the LLM's memory.",

When given a coding challenge if they refuse to show how they think I consider it a fail. Their use of AI is obvious every time.\n\nFor me, a candidate who uses AI to answer questions are demonstrating poor character traits that you do not want on your team such as deception, poor communication, and taking shortcuts. They came to the interview without mastering the material and it’s highly likely they will not correct this gap later. As soon as the use of AI is clear consider ending the interview. Why waste your time?\n\nThe challenging part of your question is filtering candidates to interview. Recruiters may not be skilled at screening. I attempt to adjust for this by going to meetups, making connections with schools, using recruiting firms with similar connections, or requiring in person interviews. Even if you cannot do an in person interviews large recruiting firms have offices in multiple locations and can request the candidate come to a location to be monitored.",

          "text": "\"The only way to know if they are not using AI is to interview them, but how can I prevent interviewing someone that is using AI?\" You're answering your own question. Comes with the job of hiring someone. If interviewing people is part of your role as a manager, then why sweat having these phone calls? You're getting paid to do it. And since you say that HR is giving you resumes, then a logical step you could take if someone is riding you that this is taking too long to hire is to request that you yourself do the resume filtering. \n\nYou'll need to change your interviewing process to prevent this from happening. Before you do a technical Teams call, try a casual-but-technical phone call. See if this helps you weed out the phony candidates.\n\nIn my opinion, at the end of the day, this just comes with hiring. Ask candidates to do in person interviews or in person screening (\"Hey I see you're local, can we meet at a coffee shop to discuss the role and your interest?\") by looking for local candidates. Too many people want to be fully remote and so they are going to keep using AI just like companies keep using AI to filter out candidates. For a role where the user is likely tech-saavy, it's very little effort on their part to mass apply to hundreds of jobs with AI resumes.\n\nImmovable object meets an unstoppable force.",

It's always important to gather thoughts & answer them.\n\nPerfect response - Everyone uses the star method these days at least was told to do, I perfectly use the sentences to frame it in the star way, because that's what gets ahead of many. \n\nEven the interview prep pdf from the company says gather your thoughts & say it out loud - use the star method.\n\nAnd for the remaining points I think there's no wrong in asking them to share your screen, in many technical rounds I was told to share the screen & I did.\n\nI usually don't prefer putting on headphones or anything because I know it would cause a red flag, it's okay if you can ask them to remove it, if he really wants the interview I don't think he has a problem to do. \n\nIf they look all over the screen or looking elsewhere rather than into the camera maybe you can warn him or put on a red flag. \n\nI get your concern but even some people who are perfect in a way can also be in the loop and yeah I can feel how frustrating it is but not everyone has a delayed response or perfectly framing the sentence is using AI.",

      "text": "Hi DEs,\n\nAnd the people using Fivetran..\n\nWe are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.\n\nPreviously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.\n\nWhat is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?\nFivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.\n\nWill Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

As a small consultancy, we helped a few clients to migrate to dlt from Fivetran because the cost didn't make sense, because the connectors they wanted didn't exist, or just because they didn't like to deal with a balck box (with pricing controlled by others).\n\n2. As organizer of the Data Berlin meetup, I spoke with multiple teams which introduced dlt, initially for limited use cases, then it started to replace more consistent data loads. Once you have dlt in place it makes no sense to spend for loading if you can have it for free (or at least a minimal fraction of what you are paying).\n\nFeel free to ping me in case you want me to elaborate",

Just use bash, python, go and take advantage of linux as an environment. Use as little things as possible and document everything.\n\nBut the truth is that DE has become a \"product/tool\" centric profession.

You add ducklake, airflow, superset etc. in containers or dedicated VPS instances as your needs evolve. Data is stored directly on nvme or hetzners own S3 service, depending on your volume and performance needs.\n\nThis setup is more performant than databricks/spark in almost all cases and almost universally loved by analysts and data scientists, because they often already know these tools (especially jupyterhub).\n\nThis is not out of the box, but it actually is not that hard to learn and less work to maintain and optimize than databricks.\n\nAlso something to consider: Managing bare metal infra and going all-in on open source is going to become a VERY valuable skill again going forward, given the current geopolitical landscape, because it is the ONLY way to be 100% in control of your data.\n\nPM me if you want to know more.

Modeling will make you ship faster with AI-assisted coding. It's also important for certain hyped features such as text-to-SQL. Unless the LLM bubbles burst (meaning it would be prohibitively expensive to use), LLMs will be come one of the main data (model) consumers.\n\nAs for your question: do proper data models and then code with Cursor or Claude Code. It will be much faster than you hand writing transformation code.",

I think it takes me more time to write the explanation than simply write SQL for dbt, using the macro I developed. \n\n\nI use LLM to develop tooling around DBT, but still not for SQL nor modeling.

It's way easier to troubleshoot when you can just run a select statement and say whether the data is wrong or not. The reporting layer should be boring af, imo. If a report is being clever, it should almost certainly be a prototype for logic to be moved into the warehouse.

I then took a 1 week course (can't recall details).  I then started modelling for an inventory solution we were building.  Years later I was thrown into designing data warehouse solutions (I was the defacto candidate since I was the lead Oracle, Dec RBD DBA and have the most experience with modelling and databases.   Read Kimballs book (and Inmons) but I gravitated toward Kimball dimensional.  Again, this was no back in the mid-late 90's and the internet was new so harder to obtain resources we have now.  I even met and had conversations a couple times with Kimball.  I was a nobody attending one of his seminars but he was gracious enough to talk with me and we corresponded a couple times later.  \n\nTimes today are very different and there is a rush to deliver (and skip modelling).  This sort of started with Hadoop and schema on read mentality.  However, modelling is starting to make a minor comeback (solely based on what I read on here and on linked-in).  Joe Reis has been part of the push for this (and others).",

During that time, I learned about normalization and picked up a copy of Object-Oriented Data Warehouse Design, which shows how to create star/snowflake models.\n\nIn my next job, the SQL Server data warehouse replicated objects from the source environment, which relied on a hierarchical structure. This model has some interesting quirks which could require a lot of joins, which resulted in the creation of views to create an easier starting point as the base of the query, and in function was similar to OBT. There were also several instances where I created an operational data mart, just like Inmon's approach. I also worked on other projects, several of which required their own database models. One was a questionnaire, so I had to learn how to create a hybrid relational/object-oriented model to capture the various types of questions and responses.\n\nI guess I was fortunate enough to land in the right places at the right moment where I could build and grow the systems I was hired to support.",

It is the simplest and fastest structure for iterating through provided values.\n\nThe hashing of a set is irrelevant to iterating over all the values.

      "text": "hey guys, I never really migrated from 1 to 2 either as all the code didn't work. now open to writing new stuff in pandas 3.0. What's the practical difference over pandas 1 in pandas 3.0? Is the performance boosts anything major? I work with large dfs often 20m+ and have lot of ram. 256gb+. \n\nAlso, on another note I have never used polars. Is it good and just better than pandas even with pandas 3.0. and can handle most of what pandas does? So maybe instead of going from pandas 1 to pandas 3 I can just jump straight to polars? \n\nI read somewhere it has worse gis support. I do work with geopandas often. Not sure if it's gonna be a problem. Let me know what you guys think. thanks.",

          "text": "So first answer:\n\nFrom pandas 2.0 onwards a lot of change was made to move from numpy into arrow, so you cant just use np.nans as pandas nans now, its pd.NA. Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

I work at a small company and joined a data science team and started writing etl stuff in jupyter notebooks in jupyterlab. and then later even as the project grew I kept writing parameterised notebooks and ran them with papermill. But it's starting to get absurd and I think isn't really common practice at all. But I am not sure how to get out of this habit. \n\nI write data science style procedural code and like to inspect and muck with stuff every step along the way otherwise I feel blind. It feels as I am in a live debugger. Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. \n\nI personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. \n\nI am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data. Thanks guys.",

And there will be a natural way to transfer this to deriving your churn metricsthrough functions.\n\nI.e. your definition might be \"monthly churn is A / B-C  \n\nWhere A is the count of all active customers who haven't made an order at the end of the month, B is the the total number of active customers at the end of the month, C is the number of new customers in a month.\" \n\nIf defined like this a natural structure might be to have a several helper functions like _count_active_customers, _count_new_customers,_count_custoners_who_order,  that handle the aggregations of your data while your your higher level function calculate_user_churn can just handle the mathematical bit of the logic (I.e. the A/B-C logic). Each of these bits can then be tested  simply by running examples data through them independently and comparing outputs match expectations (this is basically what unit tests are). \n\nIf done, when someone comes up to you and says I think churn should have been 10% this month but it's showing a negative number you can quickly say oh that's strange I get 20 customers who didn't make an order 300 active customers and 100 new customers (by running the subfunctions) so following the definition I get 20/300-100 which is about -99. And they can go I think maybe you missed some brackets it should of been 20/(300-100) and then you go doh I'll fix that in the calculate user churn function . Or they can go that 100 doesn't sound right and you can go oh let's explore that by looking at _count new customers and so on. \n\nSticking to functions having a single responsibility like this makes reuse easier as code is less tied to single outputs and also makes testing your code through unit tests easier too.",

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.\n\nIt will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you get to this level there is a whole world of code design best practices you can venture into to make your job easier while giving you more confidence in the correctness of your code and its artifacts.",

It’s not totally production ready yet. But it’s already pretty powerful. I think you’ll really like the tracing/replaying feature a lot just based on that quote above. This library was made for the exact kind of workflow you’re desiring, productionizing data science workflows but still having the flexibility to iterate in notebook style environments. It is pretty function based, but imo it makes dealing with/thinking about functions easy since you think of functions as “things you want” (nouns) rather than arbitrary operations (verbs). \n\nhttps://github.com/mitstake/darl#debugging-tracing-and-replaying",

I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.\"\n\nInstead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?\n\nIf you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).\n\nIf you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).\n\nYou know how to use a hammer very well already. Time to become an architect, too.",

The last SQL Server was switched off 17 years later. \nMy path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I  learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.\n\nBecause of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to.  As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.\n\nI'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs.  Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.\n\nFor Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.\n\nLearn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. \n\nOnce you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.\n\nI built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems.  Databricks has Spark at its heart.\n\nLearn for the job you want and to keep the job you have.",

Given the volumes you're dealing with (which are relatively modest), you could query the selected tables directly with DuckDB, land the results in cloud storage (S3, Azure Data Lake Storage), and attach them to Snowflake as external tables. That would be enough for hourly/daily syncs at this scale.\n\nIf you want to keep the streaming approach, a zero-ETL solution would be Kafka Connect with S3 Sink (Iceberg Topics are too much for your case). I'd recommend a metadata-driven approach: extract the Postgres schemas as CSV, let Product/Analytics teams mark which tables they need, and dynamically build your Kafka Connect configs from that. Combined with Kafka Connect S3 Sink (Parquet/Avro) + Snowflake External Tables (zero-copy), you get the same benefits (no ETL, no storage overhead), but with team self-service and without having to manage 10-15 DBs × X tables as separate topics. Schema evolution runs through Schema Registry, and when pipeline issues occur, S3 becomes your buffer instead of the source DB.",

      "text": "I'm pretty sure this isn't the norm, but I feel so exhausted with my job. The main problem is my team is not good and the company, while overall is very good/well regarded globally/competitive, is very pretentious. \n\nMy job is not very challenging. In fact, it's the mundanity of it that exhausts me. Everything is the same over and over to process client data. There's almost 0 feedback/appreciation for it too, and I'm pretty sure the successor of the data basically passes off my work to others and pretends he did it. I of course could push myself more, learn new tech, and integrate it. But I just don't feel motivated. I still plan to do some online free courses about AI/ML soon.\n\nBut longterm, I'm not sure this job will sustain me. I have a noticeably worse mindsets (become a bit egotistical and negative myself, snarky, etc.). \n\nI'm in my early 30s, but about 10 years ago I switched from pre-medicine to tech. I was heavily invested in the the med route and had already applied to medical school. Then I spent too much time around some people I shouldn't have, and changed paths. Looking back, I probably wish I stayed in healthcare, though it has its own challenges and of course worse lifestyle usually. That said, there's no way I would want to switch back now.\n\nAll that to say, for so much of my life, I was looking at a career that directly helped people...so maybe that is part of my problem now. I could very well be in a 1/3 life crisis now, but overall okay (so dont worry :)). \n\nI'm debating a small to significant career change.\n\nI think at the least, to save my sanity, I absolutely need to change jobs in the next year or two, if even that. Otherwise, I fear what my mind and personality will become. \n\nThings I've considered:\n- online courses (for sure will do in the interim)\n\n- a second masters (in tech related or business related field - my undergrad was economics, which I enjoyed)\n\n- no further education (besides online stuff), but just change jobs\n\n- stay at current job and do bare minimum BUT try to create a startup on the side (one big goal of mine is to be an entrepreneur some day).\n\nAnyways, I digress. One reason for this post is because (1) I want to know if others feel this way in DE and (2) I am wondering if there are more rewarding industries out there. Something I've always been interested in is sustainability or in general, somehow making the world a better place. As cliche as it sounds, it'd be awesome to use my skills to improve the planet/humanity. I'm still looking at jobs and applying, but wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations. \n\n\nMy fear is that whatever company I transition to will just be more of the same. I've been at a number of companies and in different job roles over the years, but there has not been a single one that I just loved (or even half loved). Everything felt like a cog in the wheel, like it doesn't help humanity, and just puts money in someone else's pocket.\n\nCurious to hear if others feel this and if this is just the way of life. Or if there is something more out there that just needs to be found.",

Penn State Uni has one of the best program in the states. I heard their GIS program is also top notch. \nDoing generic IS/IM degrees won't add any value in the future. ",

It's one of the major requirements to be accepted into their MS in Applied Stats program.  \n\nFew years ago, I had a call with a PSU alumni of their MS in Applied Stats program. He was a senior director at some company in Washington DC or somewhere in east coast. He spoke very high about their program and how much value he gained out of it. Also told me that everyone single one of his classmates ended up in good roles across various domains and not a single one has any regrets about the program. That speaks a lot about PSU, every single professor has at least PhD teaching their stats program. ",

Not so much tools, except maybe the analysis if you consider that a tool. But it has to be done a very specific way. I could improve it, but there is almost no incentive to imo. Maybe my view is negative, but it 100% will not get me a promotion or raise. I probably won't even get credit. I've delivered some tools before, one of which was internal and a huge thing and the response was terrible. A huge, if not the whole, part of the problem is my team I guess. \n\nAt that point, it's a weird question to ask yourself because the move somewhere else might be more rewarding, but almost certainly way more work/stress at times, and good chance less pay.

I’m not particularly great at it but I find it satisfying and I love how easy it is - in terms of resources, anyway, all you need is a computer and the internet.\n\nI broke into IT via data analytics and I hated it. The disdain for craft, the continual ad hoc nonsense, and most of all the performative nature of such work in the business world. Usually I’d find myself building some awful dashboard because… someone decided it must be so.\n\n Moving into DE was refreshing for me but I ran into a lot of the same problems. Lack of support, no specific requirements etc. Recently I landed a gig with a SaaS company and the product focused work definitely feels like a step up. I’m starting to work more closely with the software team it feels like that’s where I’d like my future to be.\n\nBut all that said, if I wasn’t actually interested in programming I don’t know how I could put up with this. If it was purely about money there are better professional paths, and if it were purely about satisfaction or helping others I’d be far far away from this industry.\n\nSo, idk, what are you interested in, and what were your expectations for this role?",

Its a job for companies trying to make money or selling insights from data... at best you could only work in some sector like healthcare and humanitarian. There are not many openings and may not pay well. \n\n\nOn the other hands, many healthcare jobs could be soul-crushing. I know nurses working in the emergency and you'd think it's a meaningful job but apparently most of the patients are addicts (at least in that particular hospital). \n\n\nYou could look into donation and ensure your donations go a long way but it'd feel different from being in a healthcare job. There are people working in high paying jobs just to donate 1/10 of their income to developing countries for example. They'd help humanity but they probably don't feel like helping humanity. On the other hand, you could save someone's life with as little as $5000 apparently so your DE income could help many from that angle. But it'd always feel differently from direct interaction with people. \n\n\nI don't have an answer but I don't think being continuing in DE would solve your 1/3 life crisis. Neither is studying more in tech, depending on how severe is the emptiness you're feeling. I personally think my work is meaningless in the grand scheme of thing. My husband who is a gardener probably makes a better impact than me but I earn way more than he does. Someone gotta pay the bill.... ",

Could just be my lack of use in that area but I don’t remember seeing a lot of these in the modern tech stacks when applying for jobs over the years and researching what skills are best to have. \n\nIMO whenever you’re job searching you really need to have your resume(s) pointed towards what you want to work with. Most companies have only a few tools for data engineering, orchestration layer and logic layer. Airflow and databricks for example. Pick a cloud provider, orchestration tool, data lakehouse/warehouse platform and start doing little projects. Like airflow orchestrates databricks notebook that pulls a dataset from azure datalake storage and then run a databricks notebook to convert the file to a delta table. Or durable function pulls API data and writes to bronze layer of databricks. \n\nYou can pick whatever tech you decide I just mentioned those because it’s the route I decided to go down but I also incorporated snowflake just for a more overarching reach. \n\nPython can be learned along the way but it seems a little aimless to just sit down and “learn Python” for something that is as specific as data.engineering",

Now, basically that platform gives you access to their Jupeter Notebooks, and requirements. It is very simple project, where you need to load the .csv file, split it to different .csv files, do some cleaning and tranformations. All the requirements are there. AND, right to the notebook there is AI (LLM, I don't know. You name it.) I took the requirements, give it to AI and asked to write a promt. You see, I even didn't have to write the prompt. Now, next step is give the promt to the AI and ask him wirte python code. Now, it amaizing that the python code is correct. So, all I had to do is click 'Run', and that is it. I sucessfully submitted the project and earned some points. Done. \n\nNow, the question that bothers me is 'what is the future for dataengineering jobs?' Isn't it bothering you guys? How soon we will reach the point when you don't have to learn pandas and numpy and etc. All you have to do is ask AI to do it. Scary.  ",

The major warehouses are shipping with CDC tools to replicate data from your Postgres/MySQL/etc so that you don't have to build that anymore. And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. \n\nWhere I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak \"data reasoning skills\". I don't think AI fixes that because it won't help you if you don't know the right questions to ask. So my bet is that you'll have data engineers/scientists/analysts converging more and more into a role where they need to bridge that gap to make all this data we've collected valuable.",
