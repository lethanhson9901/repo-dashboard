Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

At least in my view:\n\n* Data Lakes started somewhere in 2017 providing two main features; streaming unstructured data into some storage easily, and storing a lot of data cheaply outside of a DWH.\n* Data Lakes were super popular in setups which were either spark native or pricey DWH setups (Databricks, Redshift). But in parallel DWH platforms with native separation of storage and compute started to emerge (Snowflake, BigQuery). \n* After some time with companies having massive data lakes, the need for a better file format/engine came around - and Hudi/Iceberg were born from the OSS community, and Delta from Databricks.\n* Somewhere in between people just started to misuse data lakes as data warehouses because it was cheap and easy to do, and allowed for poor planning. Also open table formats became the hot new tech.\n* Today - Snowflake entered the datalake business, Databricks are entering the datawarehouse business, and AWS/BigQuery lets you do anything. \n* For primarily streaming data, a data lake ingestion is still the best architectural concept.\n\nSo no we are in a situation where any platform allegedly allows you to implement whichever architecture you want, irrespective of the roots of the platform.\n\n* You run AWS? Datalake on S3+Iceberg/Hudi+Athena with Redshift as the DWH\n* You run Snowflake? Datalake on S3+Iceberg with Snowflake as the DWH\n* You run Databricks? Datalake on S3+Delta with Databricks Compute Engine and Postgres OLTP\n* You run GCP? BigQuery + GCS + Iceberg\n\nThis is now why data lakes are misused, because all the vendors wanted a slice of any architecture even if it didn't make sense for their product.",

Iceberg solves problems when you're size of Netflix. Most of my B2B customers have less than 100 million rows in their largest table, schemas don't change, 90% of tables can be easily read in one go without needing delta loads.\n\nI thought about delta loads awhile back. In past companies owned their servers and data transfer and compute was free. It didn't matter if you fetched half of the tables completely every night and ran all through transformation layer since it didn't cost anything. Now that's bad practice because in cloud everything has a cost.\n\nBut that's the way it is and has been. That's what they pay us to do.\n\nEdit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)",

Maybe go watch their technical talk about that as it provides a great explanation for why databases by themselves are limited as well as why blob storage by itself is limited. Traditional databases are basically concurrency managers. They suck at storing any meaningful amount of data however. \n\nLakes, lakehouses are primarily about decoupling storage from compute. It serves two functions when you do this, decreasing cost and decoupling compute scaling. You can have multiple teams scale their own trino or spark or python instances to meet their requirements. \n\nTo the degree they correctly mock religious opposition to structured databases the flip side is just as true. Religious insistence on database engines built for the needs and tradeoffs mainly of the 1970s and 80s is just stupid. \n\nThere are things traditional databases are good at but even comparatively small amounts of data can quickly begin to choke them out. Additionally their scaling properties are complex as they can run into many separate limits that can force scale out or worse yet force a scale up leading to over provisioning. \n\nDatabases are also always hot. They are virtually incapable of handling read almost never data. And you can argue but if it’s almost never going to be read just thrown it away. But that’s not an argument for traditional databases it’s a limitation. \n\nYou are merely lost in the hype of the technology and don’t actually understand the technical tradeoffs being made. There is a ton of money chasing executives to build lakes because there are vendors with lakes to sell. Things built like this are almost always a mess. That not because of the tech but because of who is building it under what pressures. \n\nThat doesn’t make them a bad an idea. They are a specific tool in the toolbox that can handle a variety of issues that affect traditional systems. They especially are good at enabling self serve data analytics, and other such democratization efforts as the materialization of some absurd table for the vp’s personal use is much less likely to effect the rest of the system. \n\nThey also are very good at recording point in time snapshots of data that would be prohibitively expensive to maintain in most traditional databases which can be a critical enabler for challenging ML problems. \n\nThey go hand in hand with event sourcing systems that are recording a change feed of events rather than an absolute state. If your system doesn’t have this point in time requirement it’s easy to see why you would not appreciate the issues lakes set out to solve. \n\nThere are more use cases they shine at but merely because you already have an oltp database that you treat as a magic black box you don’t understand is no reason to dismiss lake technology you also don’t understand.",

So if you take this path, assume you're going to be very focused on data-engineering-applied-to-AI.\n\nNow, given the actual pace at which human institutions move, I am convinced that even if foundation models get _quite a lot better_ it will take five years to reorient a bunch of legacy businesses around the new technology. But from there, all bets are off.\n\nA reorientation around AI may well make _experienced technologists_ even more important as staff for competitive businesses, but don't expect 'data engineering' specifically to still be prominent (consider how the database administrator role has faded in salience due to the Cloud revolution, for comparison).\n\n---\n\nAll in all: don't let AI put you off. But go in with your eyes open: none of us can make precise predictions about 2035, and even on the shorter horizon you need to prepare to be flexible and stay abreast of this new technology.",

It can't see the databases nor final dashboards etc so is missing a lot of information that I hold in my head and get a steer on from SME's across the business.  This information is proprietary and often just held in peoples heads, so there is no way a 'generic' LLM would have access to it.\n\nHaving said this, I think DE’s working in smaller companies with less complex tech stacks and environments and are finding ‘generic’ LLM’s more useful.  I work in a multi-cloud, multi vendor environment.  We have every permutation of pipeline you can imagine weaving its way in and out of multiple platforms.

A few years ago, my job was heavily DE and DA and now it also involves building infrastructure and test suite, which are the jobs of SRE and SDET. Its much easier to build pipelines and dashboards these days. It means more people from other tech areas transition to DE, increasing the competition. For people in the industries, as long as you're expanding your skill sets, it's OK. For someone new, it'll hard to break into, because you might even be competing with SWE, SDET etc who lost their jobs and tried to transition to DE for example. \n\n\nIf you wanna get into tech, be prepared to learn everything from every areas.

Maybe the cost of research kills a bunch of the big companies and the progress slows. Maybe the cost of subs goes so high we can't afford it. Or, maybe things keep going as they have been and agentic tools can fully automate our jobs in 2 years.

          "text": "24 months ago, the smartest people in the world could look at the evidence and call LLMs \"auto-complete on steroids\". I did not agree at the time, but it was a credible assertion. If anyone is still saying that in 2026, they are not credible based on the research that's come out since then. In 2024 people said LLMs can't solve Wordle, and they can't count the Rs in strawberry. No frontier model fails at those tasks in 2026 but people are still repeating the same memes.  \n  \nPeople who are not using AI to (effectively) code think it's supposed to be some kind of maestro that 1-shot generates you a script out of thin air. I would characterize the latest iteration of AI to be more akin to a swarm intelligence. Even a single frontier model agent is not very impressive by itself. I've found that even given a well defined list of tasks, a single Claude agent will degrade rapidly in performance because of context rot. But if you start orchestrating: creating and destroying agents for singular purposes (cattle, not pets), then the capabilities become very impressive. Your agents can make a plan, execute on it, _check the results_, adjust the plan, retry, and so forth all autonomously. This is the scary part, not because it's really good at leetcoding, because planning and iteration is something that's transferrable to all professions.  \n  \nSecondly people misunderstand, especially after the ChatGPT-5 fiasco: GPT-5 is not a single model, it is a router, a reverse proxy, that assesses your query and routes it to one of its 10s of actual models behind the curtain. Despite the marketing it was primarily a cost engineering tool for OpenAI, because it removes choice from the user about what model you are being served with. So you could be using \"ChatGPT-5.2\", and you get some shit answer because it decides your question wasn't worth its time (or their servers are overloaded, or any other reason) and routed your question to some shit model. All frontier \"models' work this way, \"Opus 4.6\" does the same. So all those seemingly cracked models that Google is sending out to dominate benchmarks? Yeah, no guarantee that's the one serving you (or is even one of the possible options).\n  \nThat means you cannot one-shot some chatbot on your free account and have an accurate picture of the state of the art. Anyone who is isn't using harnessed agents and burning tokens have no idea what they're talking about.  \n  \n18 months ago I thought the role of humans will be as model whisperers, guiding these mercurial and finicky chatbots. Well, prompt engineering came and died as a profession in less than 12 months. 3 months ago I thought the role of humans would be building mcp integrations to connect agents to the business domain. Well, Claude is pretty well capable of being pointed at any API and building an integration by itself right now.  \n  \nCurrently I would say my comparative advantages are understanding the business domain, architecture, and security. If you notice, none of these are junior attributes. As an OG AI hater, it pains me to say that if you gave me a list of projects to complete, and I had a choice between an intern or Claude Code and an intern's salary of tokens, for effectiveness I would take Claude Code every time hands down. (I'm not saying that the AI is better in every way, rather there's no comparative advantage).\n  \nAnd I don't even know how long my moats will hold. There is a degree of skill involved with using agents, which can explain why some people are getting poor results, but tbh the skill curve is not that high, and any clever tricks people think of to squeeze more performance out of the agents (e.g. chain-of-thought, ralph-loop, sub-agents) just get baked into the harness and democratized. I think the only reason people don't get better at it is a psychological aversion to AI.\n\nAgainst all odds, my company managed to assemble a competent team of AI engineers that built an in-house agentic framework that _actually delivered business value_...for about 12 months. Now I wonder what was the whole point if every analyst will be rolling with Claude Cowork on their laptop in 6-12 months. If you look at where we were just 24 months ago vs now, it's hard to imagine where we'll be 24 months from now.  \n  \nSo all that to say, we're all guessing for the next 5 years. My hope is a small business renaissance and a democratization of knowledge, but I fear we just end up in a world where 12 rich guys own everything until one day they betray each other. But I wanted to give a deep and nuanced answer, and get my own thoughts out. We can only nudge the world to the better scenario if we're honest to ourselves.",

LLMs.\n\nSo, synthesising this: yes, the tooling will change, but data engineers will only be riding this AI bubble as much as they have been already. Maybe more of them will be data scientists. Maybe more of them will be AI, but I doubt it.\n\nThere might be less of them.

A lot of buzz and noise around those jobs being glamorous but in fact they are not or not all of them. Even as DS, you don't necessarily work on cutting edge work even in Big Tech. Data Engineering is more like backend work that is not visible unfortunately due to different reasons.\n\nOutside big tech, in non-tech companies data teams are rather small and sometimes not formal per say. They're composed of a few people who sometimes are not experienced or do not have the resources for an interesting project. In this case, they're seen more like cost centers rather than profit centers. So they end up doing the work of data engineer, data analyst, analytics, and data science, you name it.",

I still keep a DE role part of the time, but it's almost 100% AI agent driven set-and-forget kinda stuff now, for your typical non-global-scale startup or mid sized company, and it wouldn't be unfeasible for me to fully automate it into a strictly supervisory role if I invested the time and energy.\n\nAlso, as a pure DE, I felt no job satisfaction at all as my end users were always internal and companies largely pretend you don't exist until something is broken, then it's your fault. It's a nice feeling to ship features real field customers will use at scale. Whatever beautiful infrastructure or pipelines you build, the consuming analyst or DS will always get the glory/satisfaction of the discovery. There was also always a sense of being a \"fake software engineer\" whose \"code\" is mostly configs and baby scripts for various tools. And don't get me started on the endless tedious SQL some analyst half baked 5 years ago and now it's your responsibility to babysit for eternity in production.",

          "text": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",

It makes all your technical work way more valuable and helps you prioritize.\n\nRead the existing pipelines like you’re a detective. Trace one important data set from source to final table/dashboard. Take notes. Build yourself a little internal wiki or scratch doc with “this table is used for X, comes from Y.”\n\nGet very comfortable with SQL and debugging. Learn to quickly answer “why is this number wrong?” That’s 70% of the job at a lot of places.\n\nOvercommunicate at the start. Before you build something, repeat back what you think they want and how you’ll do it. Saves a ton of rework.\n\nAlso, don’t try to overhaul everything in month one. Fix small, annoying problems, document stuff, and ask “is there already a standard way we do this?” a lot. That alone will make you look senior faster than flexing some fancy tool.",

For context, mid sized company, around 50 saas data sources, snowflake as primary destination though we're also testing databricks for some ml workflows and have legacy stuff in redshift we're migrating away from.\n\nFivetran connectors are solid and reliable but the cost at scale gets uncomfortable fast, especially once you're pulling significant volume. Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs.

It stupid. \n\nTherefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns.  \n\nFor our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.\n\nAdditionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database.

It can certainly ingest data from SaaS solutions as well as on-prem.  It's not as nice/easy to use for ingestion as Fivetran but it does work.   Fivetran can get expensive (high MAR usage) when you have cases of large datasets (SaaS or on-prem) that need to get ingested each month but also have low number of updates (meaning you cannot save MAR if rows change may times per month). \n\nI had never heard of 'Precog' before but it seems to only have been around since 2020.

The platform requires us to have a webhook URL(s) to receive a set of data so I look for a free webhook URL service.\n\nThe next step is to make endpoints and automate all of these. I realize that I need some kind of an app and fortunately Python has Flask and Django. So build one to satisfy my user (automate lead collection etc).\n\nBut the concepts involved in building the app is rather unfamiliar to me: tunneling, TCP, content-type, etc I rarely heard any of them. I suspect they are not common in data engineering work thus the app I build is not DE at all; this seems to be the work for backend engineers.\n\nHow often do you make webhook at work?

          "text": "Since you (and a couple others) seem to be more or less asking for some structure to learn against, here's what I use or have used in my day-to-day.\n\n- How to install docker, and the follow-ups needed, on your Distro/OS. Windows/Mac are pretty straight-forward. Linux has some steps after install that you need to do.\n\n- Get used to navigating dockerhub, finding official image builds, and how to pull specific versions. Much like Python version pinning, you _certainly_ want to pin versions of infra.\n\n- Read the docs on the most important docker cli commands. Non-exhaustive: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker pull`, `docker exec`, `docker container cp`.\n\n- Learn and practice making [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). Learn the subtle differences between `ADD` and `COPY`. How Layering works. Learn the differences between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, `ARG` and `ENV`. Learn how to expose a port on a container to the host. HINT: it isn't with the `EXPOSE` instruction and if you made it this far without being able to ping your container from your host you should go back one step ;) . Make a `.dockerignore` so you don't put anything you don't want in the container. You can ignore these instructions for now: `HEALTHCHECK`, `LABEL`, `MAINTAINER`, `ONBUILD`, `SHELL`, `STOPSIGNAL`.\n\n- Learn how networking works for Docker. Networking generally is a weak point for most SWEs, and seems to often be doubly so for DEs. In the same vein, read the docs on how Docker Volumes work and how to attach them.\n\nNow, you came to the DE Subreddit to ask this and mention you have 2 YOE already, so I'm going to also mention a couple of more specific things.\n\n1. [Running Airflow in Docker](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html) is D E N S E but obfuscated heavily. As in, it has a lot of levers and knobs, but it mostly assumes the defaults are good enough for this. It also assumes you know docker-compose which I _did_ leave out of the top. The justification I'll give for that is that Docker Compose is great... but you should be using the dockerized airflow mentioned here as a TESTING system ONLY. Thus, get it going following thier instructions, do what you need to do, but don't assume it matches production-grade Airflow deployments.\n\n2. You could (and perhaps should) use [Astronomer's CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview). I don't work for them or anything, but I have used their managed service in the past. The fact that the CLI exists for free is great and should be taken advantage of for local testing.\n\n3. Now that you've seen those two and understand how docker works and have played with the ins and outs, contrary to what others may say, I would then _AND ONLY THEN_ look into Kubernetes. No matter the system, managed or self-hosted, Airflow and it's pipelines ALWAYS run on Kubernetes behind the scenes. The way you build the image for [Airflow will change](https://gist.github.com/wesh92/4ce0634e61949a1679e2ae5a1788cb18) and, thus, how you manage dependancies and the way you need to understand how Kubernetes sees Containers versus how you've seen them thus far at this point. I cannot stress this enough though, DO NOT jump straight to this point. Everything above here should be _weeks_ of testing, toiling, and troubleshooting at a minimum before you try to introduce K8s. When you do, start with a local manager like `k3s`. I would recommend not using `minikube` or `kind` as those are \"k8s in docker\" which is a whole extra layer you don't need. The justification I'll give for including this: I like my local testing env for pipelines to be as close, if not exact, to what I will deploy. For me this means _in kubernetes using exactly what I will deploy_ with as much of the kubernetes weirdness as I can account for. If this doesn't feel important to you, please feel free to ignore!\n\nHope this helps! But please, just start with the Docker basics. You can search up a youtube if your more visually-inclined. Read through the docs and try implementing things if you're more of the experiential kind. Nothing is going to be a cheat code because these are kind of foundational tools for SWE and DE.\n\nEDIT: formatting. reddit pls",

I've been working on an ETL project at work that involves moving data from one platform via an API to a SQL database using Python. I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.\n\nA lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. \n\nI don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. \n\nFrom experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.\n\nBut rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one.

SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.\n\nThe return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.\n\nThe real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.\n\nWorth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance. Sometimes it's a bad experience with a package breaking, which is valid but solvable with pinned versions and testing.",

They're the single best debugging tool when something breaks in prod. Manual logging means you're recreating what the runtime gives you for free, except worse. Might be worth understanding what burned him before. Sometimes it's \"stack traces leaked to users\" which is a presentation problem, not an exception problem.",

I had nobody telling me no, I just communicated to IT what I was doing and got their blessing in email to cover my ass.\n\nAside from that, I think I was also pretty strict about choosing libraries.  I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.\n\nIf a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those.  \n\nIf it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no.  I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time.  \n\nI don't think my situation is a very good comparison.  Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work.  I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table.  Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.\n\nI was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew.  \n\nAgain, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.\n\nIf your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted.  A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess?  \n\nLike, I had nobody to review my code.  If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

      "text": "Hi Everyone \nGood Day!!\n\nI am writing to ask how difficult it's to switch from Data Engineering to Data Science/ML profile. The ideal profile I would want is to continue working as DE with regular exposure to industry level Ai.\n\nJust wanted to understand what should I know before I can get some exposure. Will DE continue to have a scope in the market, which it was having 4-5 years ago? Is switching to AI profile really worth it? (Worried that I might not remain a good DE and also not become a good Data Scientist)\n\nI have understanding of fundamentals of ML (some coding in sklearn), but if it's worth to start transitioning, where should I begin with to gain ML industry level knowledge?",

I’d say DS is a different type of skill but having DE fundamentals has been very beneficial for me. A lot of the problems you’ll be solving in DS/ML won’t be AI related. To me the coding side is never the problem, it’s always been the statistics side. I encourage you to have strong understanding of stats if you want to succeed. Good luck!",

My background is in applied math heavy on stochastics, so my probability theory knowledge is pretty strong (everything from measure theory to Ito calculus), but since I never finished my PhD (have MSc.) it feels like I am stuck. Not a bad place to be stuck, but it would be fun to do something else for a change, or at least a job that doesn't have you plugged in 24/7.\n\nI miss not having to worry about SLAs, having weekends to myself almost surely, feeling good after a productive day. Getting my European 30 days of vacation on top of it all.... sorry for derailing.\n\nAll that having been said, I can keep up theoretically with a DS, but convincing HR/companies with no knowledge of advanced math about your knowledge can seem daunting at times.",

Should I internally find an assignment within my organization and work on a project with AI focus (gen AI, building agentic workflows etc, but not machine learning) and eventually apply in my target companies, probably in a year? \n\nOr should I just start leet coding and apply in those target companies in data engineering now? I am 35 years old right now.\n\nIn my current job, I have an option to build some poc or personal projects and get into AI assignment which may not be possible after I step out. I am looking to develop AI skills that will complement my Data engineering expertise and not looking to completely move away from data engineering. How should I approach this? \n\nI love my data engineering job but also have FOMO in terms of AI",

So fast that it outpaces the slog it takes to get things implemented at an enterprise company. \n\nYour best bet is to find a data engineer or developer role you enjoy, and start using the AI tools to do that job better. \n\nBetter put, focus on the role and supplement it with AI, don’t focus on a role that only exists to promote some x AI tool for your company. \n\nSorry this is long but one more example: my company has “AI engineers” that spend a lot of time and energy making AI agents specific to certain areas - AI agent for M365, an AI document agent, email agent.. you get the idea. Then a few months later the outside world AI space comes out with agents that essentially work in any space, making a lot of their work extremely outdated in a matter of week/months. \n\nI can’t overstate how fast AI is progressing in comparison to how slow companies implement changes.",
