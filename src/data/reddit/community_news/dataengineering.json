They clearly sold us the dream of saving millions, which so far doesn't look like it'll ever be the case. To do their dream stuff, we needed to provide a shit-load of data from all manners of business units in the company. Then this data gets normalized by them and fed in their \"tool\". The tool uses AI to find the \"things to optimize\". Now the department that paid for this crap is trying to pawn the maintenance off on us in IT. The company also doesn't provide help on how to normalize data to fit their tool, and guess who will probably also be in charge of doing it? So far, they have not found any significant savings and the ROI vs how much their cost (1+ million so far) will take years, if it ever pays back.\n\n  \nAs others have said, it's ok because our VPs can say we're AI enabled.",

I've noticed that they absolutely *fixate* on using a particular suite of products even if they're horrendous solutions to the actual problem. It's like they're trying to farm case studies for how good said suite of products is rather than use the best tool for the job.\n\nIn this case: Microsoft stuff. I've got a Synapse instance with a freakish set of pipelines and notebooks to make it function even somewhat like Databricks. This was a clean slate start from only a few years, so they could have chosen any product, but instead they chose to go all-in on Microsoft.\n\nInstead, this client company paid that consultancy tons of money to custom build janky code on an old platform when they could have saved so much time and money by just using tools made for the job. Now they're digging deeper trying to make this weird stuff work. But hey, at least you got a cool PowerPoint with a bunch of tech product logos with arrows pointing between them (and no description about how said diagram represents an actual solution to the problems at hand).\n\nRabble rabble rabble..",

Notebooks *usually* don't have that in practice.  But you can do VC, CI/CD, and testing with notebooks.  If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.\n\n\nSome more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

A PySpark Notebook put into GIT has a bunch of comment lines that are used to parse where a cell begins/ends, magics, different cell languages, etc. ~~BUT, the actual thing in the platform backend is almost surely not a simple \\`.py\\` file, it is something more complex (i.e. \\`.ipynb\\` which is just JSON underneath) as it stores cell outputs, metadata, and other things which are not parsed into a \\`.py\\` file when the object is sync'd to GIT.~~ *Edited for those that can't see the forest through the trees:* this might have changed in DBX but this ultimately doesn't matter to my point that what is deployed to prod at the end of the day is a Notebook experience that comes with Notebook risks. Sure you can mitigate most of the risk with tests (and maybe CI validation to block usage of MAGICS that are untestable) and tight governance on your prod env, but it's still awkward.\n\nSo why does this matter? From a development perspective (and almost surely from a backend storage perspective) it is a Notebook by all measures. This matters as you can arbitrarily decide to use Scala or SparkSQL cells in your Notebook where PySpark is the default language, and when parsed into a \\`.py\\` file, none of those non-default language cells can be tested, type checked, linted, etc.. they show as commented out lines of code with a header that tells the platform's parser to interpret it as a specific language.\n\nSure, you could require your devs to not use multiple languages in a single Notebook and use an awkward process to ensure test coverage (awkward because you can't really start with local development, you'd have to do cloud>local>write tests and repeat, but even then you are still shipping into production something that comes with a built in IDE. At that point, only proper governance and access control can save you from a \"well it's super easy so I just directly applied the change in production\" scenario.",

      "text": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. \n\nOnsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership \n\nThe recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. \n\nThis new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve  met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. \n\nSystem Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.\n\nData Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. \n\nBusiness Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approaches\n\nLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. \n\nQuestions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.\n\nNext day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. \n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone has. ",

Then I suggested YAML. Then he wanted to know how in YAML will I explicitly write for each source . Which IDID! Wrote a pseudo script. Then I moved to design again. He asked multiple questions about each component. Semantic layer was something I couldn’t answer well. I have no idea where thing went wrong , which interview",

Sent the invoice to old contacts intead, we never saw it. \n\nNo past due notice.   \nNo grace period. \n\nThis morning 10;30 am services turned off. \n\nWe're a reverse-ELT shop: data warehouse feed *everything.* Salesforce to ERP. ERP to Salesforce, EAM to ERP, P2P to ERP, holy crap there's so much stuff I've built over the last few years. All down. I mean that's not even calling out the reporting! \n\nWired the payment, proof from the bank send. Know what they said? \n\n\"Reinstatement takes 24-48 hours\"\n\nBro. 31k to 45k in our renewal cycle and we moved connectors off. \n\nI know it's so hot right now to shit on Fivetran. I'm here now. I was a fan (was featured on a dev post too). \n\nI can't get anyone on the phone, big delays in emails. Horror. ",

There was a small period in time, and maybe it's still true, where it was just throw XGBOOST at it and go sip your coffee, and thats what a lot of folk were doing. But that does a disservice to a lot of the actual data scientists out there doing the maths and actually understanding inputs and outputs.\n\nI guess I ranted a bit there, the short story long is, yes, that is common, and I typically avoid it if I can.

      "text": "I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.\n\nWhen I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.\n\nEven at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations. Curious what others think: have you seen the same pattern?",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

They're incredibly risk-averse by nature, so there are tons of lifers here.\n\nI'm a mid-level/senior-ish DE at a F500 insurer these days, after I spent time in higher education, B4 consulting, and then built the data team at a PE-backed startup in the healthcare sector. I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

Granted, that may have taken a hit after the layoffs, but I presume it'll come back pretty well.\n\nYou're not wrong abou the archaic tech stacks, though. USAA was still using Hadoop broadly in 2023 and my current firm is entirely on SQL Server/SSIS. Our \"new technology\" that we're integrating in 2025-2026 is Python.\n\nThat just adds to the stability, though.

I'm now a staff data engineer at a mid-size biotech company. \n\nThere's a point around the $10-$30 million annual revenue mark where companies start to really need to step up their data and analytics practices and will start investing more in personnel and technology. These are great moments to get hired.\n\nIn my experience, these companies often pay above average and offer a lot of learning opportunities. Since there is always so much that needs to be done, I can often pick and choose what I want to work on. If you're in early enough, you get to do a lot of the foundational design of whatever system you need to build. \n\nI prefer this to jumping into a well-established team at a large company where the work is just delegated to you, you have to completely conform to the existing paradigm, and potential for skill or career progression is possibly a little more constrained.",

      "text": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gif\n\nHello all!\n\nI'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.\n\nAs shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.\n\nRecently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)\n\nHe made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.\n\nIt was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.\n\nI'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).\n\nThe idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nThrough this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etc\n\nYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`\n\nI represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.\n\nI'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.\n\nThe next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.\n\nI'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.\n\nIn the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

              "text": "I agree. Expanding more on job leveling processes from an employer perspective.\n\nCompanies look for comparison to other companies to determine what to price their roles at. This is done through compensation surveys with data generally collected each June-July, and results published around November. This is an imperfect process as every company calls roles slightly different so an analyst goes through and tries to match the roles reasonably to a generalized guide of what other companies call this role. Part of this process is it is helpful to level how senior the duties of that role is. Usually this is done with Pay Grades. Because the companies that collect analyze and prepare the compensation surveys are broadly known, their Pay Grades are most often what companies are internally calling their pay grades.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is one of the common surveys. They provide a leveling guide with description of what is generally differences between levels of seniority for professionals. Data engineer is generally going to fall under the Professional (P) classification in the WTW system. Most data engineers would be a P2, and senior a P3. Entry level may be P1. The P4 and P5 is much more rare, usually a professional individual contributor with 20 or 30 years experience, much less common. P3 tends to be the catch all for senior.\n\nA crude difference is that a data engineer can work through core business tasks but generally needs a more senior team member for guidance and some supervision. They can follow processes and best practices. At the senior level they can work more independently thinking through novel challenges that come up, they can create the processes and best practices and serve as a resource for more junior associates when novel challenges come up outside the usual experiences.\n\nA listing of descriptions of the different Professional pay grades can be read here.\n\nhttps://itv.career-navigator.willistowerswatson.com/career-bands/definition/professional?level=P2\n\nThere are other adjustments usually tech roles receive a compensation premium in compensation surveys. They'll denote things like a \"P3 - P\" the - P denoting a tech role premium that may be a flat 15% - 20% over compensation benchmarks depending on the companies policies. With rare skills as is common in tech roles often comp surveys are less useful and they'll perform specialized analysis for compensation plans for these.\n\nNot speaking exhaustively how work gets done but enough to get a sense for the flow of why pay grades exist and a primary source you can familiarize with that are used by companies. There also exist pay grades of other career levels, M is management, senior management are E's, business admin are B's.",

Identify and execute projects that support company objectives, develop relationships within the business, that sort of thing. \n\nThis is why: the next step from senior is often a lead or manager, so to go from junior to senior, you need to demonstrate capability, then when you’re a senior you’ll be refining your capability and starting to demonstrate that you can apply your skill to leading others, which gets you to the next place.\n\nAnd obviously that varies wildly from company to company 😅",

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions.

If you understand that and refer to the Kimball modeling techniques and can actually internalize it that will get you most of the way there. \n\nIt’s not really something that is easy to explain in a video I don’t think.

He admitted himself that there isn't really any documentation for his pipelines and systems, \"it's easy to figure out when you look at the code.\" From what my boss has told me about this client their current pipeline is messy, not intuitive, and that there's no common gold layer that all teams are looking at (one of the company's teams makes their reports using the raw data). \n\nI'm concerned that he isn't going to make this very easy on me, and I've never had a professional industry role before, but jobs are hard to find right now and I need the experience.

It’s not rocket science. \n\nIf your data environment is relatively fixed I would agree there is almost no point. \n\nBut if you’re in the business of having to extract data from dozens of systems, then it’s a matter of “do I pay my engineers to keep the lights on at making sure our data extraction jobs are always running, up to date, and can manage various versions of source systems, or do I simply outsource that part of the value chain and focus on actually making the data usable? \n\nIf you are a company that needs to focus on integrating data from say dozens of ERPs… maybe it’s worth it to let FiveTran expedite when a new ERP hits the market (or one you haven’t seen before). \n\nOr you’re setting up a brand new data infrastructure and your sponsors are breathing down your neck to integrate your new HR system. You can spend days/weeks working through building jobs to extract said data, or have it with FiveTran in minutes. \n\nBecause they typically price on monthly deltas volumes there’s kind of a middle tier where it makes sense as part of your tech stack. Too low and it’s too expensive, and if your data volumes are massive, again, too expensive.

          "text": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.\n\n—-\n\nSo back to my point: I think some of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” It doesnt necessarily mean open source. It’s quite literally about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” since this unlocks so much (minimizing vendor lock-in is the first high level superficial answer).\n\nAs an example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and file formats together. That’s where the real lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really changing is the growth of standardized layers. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all point in the same direction. When data is stored in formats multiple engines __can__ read, compute becomes easier to swap and vendors have to compete more on performance than on lock-in.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model - there’s so much to unpack tho in terms of current technological developments and what future data platform will look like. \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes it’s marketing for sure, but if you follow the current states of technology, there’s real nuance here.",

For some things yes, other no.  We use Fivetran and it works well for us but it's not economic to use is all situations and so we have rolled our own replication processes as needed.",

Im using outdated technology and in this market I keep seeing that classes or certs won't help. I've heard some say they changed directions and I'm curious what people are finding? \n\nI know we can transition to ML but I'm assuming that needs a math background. AI is an option but then you're competing with new grads (do we even stand a chance? Does our background experience help?). I'm asking for more general answers but my background issue is essentially being a jr-mid level at 3-4 different positions, all at smaller companies and more of a startup environment. Platform/cloud (AWS) engineering, bi developer, data engineer and architect. I would be EXTREMELY valuable if this background was at larger companies. \n\nFrom what I can see this isn't valuable unless you're senior/staff or a cloud architect level. They don't bring in jr/mid level and train them, at least not right now. ",

      "text": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. \n\nEarlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...\n\nOn the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:\n\n>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.\n\nThe first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.\n\nThen I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.\n\nA huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:\n\n* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. \n* That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservation\n\nObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…\n\nThe other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.\n\nEarnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)\n\nPlease check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?\n\n",

          "text": "Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.\n\nWhy I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.\n\nDay to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”\n\nStep up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.\n\nBranding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.\n\nGotchas:\nYou will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.\nYou’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.\nIf you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.\n\nWith 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",

Have to decide if I take the uphill battle of learning what I need to know about DE coming from a traditional data warehousing background or pivot to BI/AE. I feel like BI/DE would simply require a class or two on the reporting tools with my background. DE means improving my python, learning spark, creating GitHub projects to show I can do it & really learning code repos, cloud formation and doing everything from an SDK/cloud formation template. I have all those background skills but need an employer to simply show/let me learn the tools/interface",

Their solutions tend to be one off purpose built imports. They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.\n\nWhen you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives. Alot of times this means data driven solutions for DE tasks... and I dont see many DE only peers that use data to drive their pipelines. \n\nThis is a great opportunity for you to *up-skill your DE game.",

Despite consistently delivering across these areas, feedback is frequently non-constructive, and efforts to communicate analytically rather than emotionally often go unappreciated.\n\nIn my experience, job titles and scopes vary significantly depending on the organization. Working in a well-structured environment with managers who possess strong technical and communication skills makes a tremendous difference.

      "text": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \n\n\"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. \n\nIf the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.\n\nStarting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" \n\nI heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",
