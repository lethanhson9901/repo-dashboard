Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Especially when those silos have the different types of data.\n\nIf you are pulling together video, pictures, audio files, stacks of JSON and XML files, streamed IOT readings, and GIS inputs in addition to your structured database sources, the Lake is going to make your life much easier.  \n\nYou can run the analysis processes on the video, pictures, audio, and GIS inputs in place and have that be in the lake too.  If those analysis tools get updated, it is still easy to reprocess all the impacted source data to feed it forward.\n\nThe semistructured data, similar thing - you choose what elements to bring forward, and when/how to flatten it so you can combine it with the traditional relational data.  And, you have the raw data so you can reprocess if there is a new or changed requirement.\n\nI'm still convinced however, that all of this variety is a distraction that people get caught up in.  We don't process as humans this data in binary, vector or unstructured form.  We don't actually get value out of it until it is reduced/restructured into a relational form of some sort that we can use to make a decision and take an action.",

At least in my view:\n\n* Data Lakes started somewhere in 2017 providing two main features; streaming unstructured data into some storage easily, and storing a lot of data cheaply outside of a DWH.\n* Data Lakes were super popular in setups which were either spark native or pricey DWH setups (Databricks, Redshift). But in parallel DWH platforms with native separation of storage and compute started to emerge (Snowflake, BigQuery). \n* After some time with companies having massive data lakes, the need for a better file format/engine came around - and Hudi/Iceberg were born from the OSS community, and Delta from Databricks.\n* Somewhere in between people just started to misuse data lakes as data warehouses because it was cheap and easy to do, and allowed for poor planning. Also open table formats became the hot new tech.\n* Today - Snowflake entered the datalake business, Databricks are entering the datawarehouse business, and AWS/BigQuery lets you do anything. \n* For primarily streaming data, a data lake ingestion is still the best architectural concept.\n\nSo no we are in a situation where any platform allegedly allows you to implement whichever architecture you want, irrespective of the roots of the platform.\n\n* You run AWS? Datalake on S3+Iceberg/Hudi+Athena with Redshift as the DWH\n* You run Snowflake? Datalake on S3+Iceberg with Snowflake as the DWH\n* You run Databricks? Datalake on S3+Delta with Databricks Compute Engine and Postgres OLTP\n* You run GCP? BigQuery + GCS + Iceberg\n\nThis is now why data lakes are misused, because all the vendors wanted a slice of any architecture even if it didn't make sense for their product.",

Iceberg solves problems when you're size of Netflix.

In past companies owned their servers and data transfer and compute was free. It didn't matter if you fetched half of the tables completely every night and ran all through transformation layer since it didn't cost anything. Now that's bad practice because in cloud everything has a cost.\n\nBut that's the way it is and has been.

Maybe go watch their technical talk about that as it provides a great explanation for why databases by themselves are limited as well as why blob storage by itself is limited. Traditional databases are basically concurrency managers. They suck at storing any meaningful amount of data however. \n\nLakes, lakehouses are primarily about decoupling storage from compute. It serves two functions when you do this, decreasing cost and decoupling compute scaling. You can have multiple teams scale their own trino or spark or python instances to meet their requirements. \n\nTo the degree they correctly mock religious opposition to structured databases the flip side is just as true. Religious insistence on database engines built for the needs and tradeoffs mainly of the 1970s and 80s is just stupid. \n\nThere are things traditional databases are good at but even comparatively small amounts of data can quickly begin to choke them out. Additionally their scaling properties are complex as they can run into many separate limits that can force scale out or worse yet force a scale up leading to over provisioning. \n\nDatabases are also always hot. They are virtually incapable of handling read almost never data. And you can argue but if it’s almost never going to be read just thrown it away. But that’s not an argument for traditional databases it’s a limitation. \n\nYou are merely lost in the hype of the technology and don’t actually understand the technical tradeoffs being made. There is a ton of money chasing executives to build lakes because there are vendors with lakes to sell. Things built like this are almost always a mess. That not because of the tech but because of who is building it under what pressures. \n\nThat doesn’t make them a bad an idea. They are a specific tool in the toolbox that can handle a variety of issues that affect traditional systems. They especially are good at enabling self serve data analytics, and other such democratization efforts as the materialization of some absurd table for the vp’s personal use is much less likely to effect the rest of the system. \n\nThey also are very good at recording point in time snapshots of data that would be prohibitively expensive to maintain in most traditional databases which can be a critical enabler for challenging ML problems. \n\nThey go hand in hand with event sourcing systems that are recording a change feed of events rather than an absolute state. If your system doesn’t have this point in time requirement it’s easy to see why you would not appreciate the issues lakes set out to solve. \n\nThere are more use cases they shine at but merely because you already have an oltp database that you treat as a magic black box you don’t understand is no reason to dismiss lake technology you also don’t understand.",

Kimball is probably rolling in his grave (even though he’s still alive) looking at these \"modern\" data lakes",

Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant 😂\n\nBut my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data. At this moment the salary of the experts is ticking, so when the data engineer comes in, he/she is already behind schedule.

I still keep a DE role part of the time, but it's almost 100% AI agent driven set-and-forget kinda stuff now, for your typical non-global-scale startup or mid sized company, and it wouldn't be unfeasible for me to fully automate it into a strictly supervisory role if I invested the time and energy.\n\nAlso, as a pure DE, I felt no job satisfaction at all as my end users were always internal and companies largely pretend you don't exist until something is broken, then it's your fault. It's a nice feeling to ship features real field customers will use at scale. Whatever beautiful infrastructure or pipelines you build, the consuming analyst or DS will always get the glory/satisfaction of the discovery. There was also always a sense of being a \"fake software engineer\" whose \"code\" is mostly configs and baby scripts for various tools. And don't get me started on the endless tedious SQL some analyst half baked 5 years ago and now it's your responsibility to babysit for eternity in production.",

Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

I.e. \" talked to a colleague about kubernetes at the water cooler\" => sufficient kubernetes ✅\n\n3. A recruiter parses 100th of CVs a day for matching the demand ... \" Ah experience im Kubernetes... Good fit. ✅\"\n\n4. Recruiter may or may not give the cover letter to an AI; if the cover letter and CV match the job description. Maybe some background checks. \n\n5. CV and cover letter get passed to the management. Management uses different AI.\n\n6. Management prepares interviews with AI-generated questions. Bases on the job description and maybe the real world idealistic work environment. \n\n7.

Because humans are liars. We often believe we know things when we are wrong and bias our answers based on what is believed as the socially correct answer. Intent or malice is not necessary for being wrong sometimes. And sometimes we know we are wrong but social pleasantries demand it.\n\nLeadership and those unusually influential people socially do not follow the herd. They are working from a broader set of parameters and step against that grain. When hiring for a role we're looking for a person with expertise in that space. A mix of parameters that if they predict in their domain will be accurate more often than the AI trained on the patterns of the not-experts in that domain.\n\nWith repetition we're going to have our information space conform to what the tools we're using puts out, as we're feeding patterns of data that trains that AI. That's going to form the Instagram effect where the look and the style of large clusters of people conform to a social average. This conversion will happen with AI flavors and if large enough a group will involve a social stickiness to those modes of thinking wrong or not with an emotional reaction enforcing the social blob that comes out of that.\n\nGoing back to basics of learning to think how to think is a useful counter balancing force to this. Carve out the portfolio of where you spend your attention in your information diet to have Plato and Aristotle reps in there. The foundational thinking patterns that blossomed eventually into scientific method. Those human stories in early writing covering ranges of human experience and emotion, detached from the AI blob. Can trim the influence the AI-instagram-effect will have and retain your expertise by continuing to have frameworks for thinking that differs from a social blob of consensus, because that is what expertise is when you're leading.\n\nWe can predict there will be those who spend all of their attention on the AI blob and that will be incredibly sticky. There will be continuation of algorithm-psychosis where groups of people are peering through a funhouse mirror view of reality due to a poor information diet.\n\nI agree navigating hiring through a novel social transformation is a strange time. Good news is that we have pattern recognition from history of similar times and can make some predictions on how that plays out. E.g. introduction of coin for the first time transformed the nature of human connection to neighbors, with transition to purpose in life and spiritual story telling on why we're here. Industrial revolution is one we're still not done working through, transitioning from social story telling oriented on an agriculture lifestyle when we have become urban things with material abundance. And then information abundance with the internet added on top of that. And then an accelerant of even more information abundance faster from AI tools. Going back to the slower velocity data when writing was backed for long stretches of deep thought is a good balance to slow down that information is moving too fast.",

          "text": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",

It makes all your technical work way more valuable and helps you prioritize.\n\nRead the existing pipelines like you’re a detective. Trace one important data set from source to final table/dashboard. Take notes. Build yourself a little internal wiki or scratch doc with “this table is used for X, comes from Y.”\n\nGet very comfortable with SQL and debugging. Learn to quickly answer “why is this number wrong?” That’s 70% of the job at a lot of places.\n\nOvercommunicate at the start. Before you build something, repeat back what you think they want and how you’ll do it. Saves a ton of rework.\n\nAlso, don’t try to overhaul everything in month one. Fix small, annoying problems, document stuff, and ask “is there already a standard way we do this?” a lot. That alone will make you look senior faster than flexing some fancy tool.",

I've been tasked with modernizing data infra to move 200+ data pipes from ec2 with worst possible practices. \n\nMade some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.\n\nNow after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. \n\nA lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.\n\nNow we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: \"ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?\" \n\nWhile there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack. \n\nHis proposal was to start using databricks because it's easier for him to schedule jobs there, which I can't blame him for.\n\nI haven't worked with databricks. Are there any problems that might arise?\n\nWe have ~200gb in total in dwh for 5 years. Integrations with sftps, apis, rdbms, and Kafka. Daily data movements ~1gb.\n\nFrom what I know about spark, is that it's efficient when datasets are ~100gb.",

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.\n\nThe real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.\n\nBefore you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.\n\nSometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

For context, mid sized company, around 50 saas data sources, snowflake as primary destination though we're also testing databricks for some ml workflows and have legacy stuff in redshift we're migrating away from.\n\nFivetran connectors are solid and reliable but the cost at scale gets uncomfortable fast, especially once you're pulling significant volume. Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs. Happy to answer questions about specifics.",

We barely touch the UI, only for logs and maybe the occasional manual sync. The open source and number of different connectors are worth it. \n\nOnly con for airbyte is that in our opinion the normalization step from having the data in json blob to a RDBMS table takes unnecessarily long. It stupid. \n\nTherefore, we are pivoting our RDBMS sources to ingest them with Trino. Where we use dbt to write models that serve as ingestion with no transformation. So, Trino + dbt = ingestion. With dbt incremental models you can handle all sorts of ingestion patterns.  \n\nFor our other sources such as sftp, API, sharepoint etc., we keep using airbyte. Around 90% of our sources are RDMS though.\n\nAdditionally Trino can handle reverse etl easily to another database. Moreover, we can also write them as dbt models maintaining full lineage from ingestion all the way to Reverse ETL and other exposures.",

The platform requires us to have a webhook URL(s) to receive a set of data so I look for a free webhook URL service.\n\nThe next step is to make endpoints and automate all of these. I realize that I need some kind of an app and fortunately Python has Flask and Django. So build one to satisfy my user (automate lead collection etc).\n\nBut the concepts involved in building the app is rather unfamiliar to me: tunneling, TCP, content-type, etc I rarely heard any of them. I suspect they are not common in data engineering work thus the app I build is not DE at all; this seems to be the work for backend engineers.\n\nHow often do you make webhook at work? Is it true that this work is for backend engineer?",

The S3 permission thing is a pretty big red flag though, especially if you ever want to expose access to other tools or less trusted users.\n\nOne possible improvement: add a “paranoid mode” section in the repo that documents workarounds for the S3 perms (eg. proxy service, per‑project buckets, or using a separate object store if someone really needs granular ACLs). Also some rough cost sizing examples for different instance sizes would be gold.",

          "text": "Docker and Terraform are the ones you will actually use day-to-day as a DE. Kubernetes is mostly abstracted away by managed services in most data stacks, so I would save that for later unless you are actively building infra from scratch.Starting order that made sense: Docker first. Get comfortable building containers and running data tools locally before touching anything else. The official Docker docs are solid, and TechWorld with Nana has good intro videos if you prefer something visual.For Terraform, Terraform: Up and Running by Brikman is the standard recommendation for good reason. Work through the first few chapters and deploy something real, even if it is just a storage bucket with IAM policies attached. The plan/apply/destroy muscle memory is what makes it click.For CI/CD, GitHub Actions is the lowest-friction starting point for most DE projects. Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main. Once you have done that once, the concepts generalize to Jenkins, GitLab CI, or whatever else you run into.Raw Kubernetes knowledge is rarely needed for DE work specifically. Most orchestration on GKE or EKS you interact with through Helm charts or managed Airflow, and the k8s internals stay hidden. Docker and Terraform solid first.",
