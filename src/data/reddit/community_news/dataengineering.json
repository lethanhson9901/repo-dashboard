Now most teams never think about cluster management.\n- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)\n- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\nWhat stayed the same (unfortunately):\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\nWhat's genuinely better:\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

Moving to the cloud with all our data cost a lot, moving from mainframes cost a lot, and still using sas in most areas which again costs a lot. Still using oracle databases even though we were meant to migrate off in 2014. We now have a double database solution and oracle is meant to stop soon even though the new database is not better just had more development in the past 15 years. Still ml models are scary and we don't hire people who know how to do it so they all end up half arsed. No Python server as we are big into sas although some teams use r to make models. We now have ai which isn't so bad for data as you can't just write stuff as the data is a bit unknown to the AI so it can only build small functions but they are always super complicated and anyone that wants to reuse it has to try really hard to understand the over complexity of a simple task.",

Automation amplifies problems as much as it amplifies solutions.  The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc.  AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Are we going to ship great new dbt features to our paying customers? Of course. But not by keeping important functionality out of dbt Core. The way to do it is to make sure dbt Core (and Fusion) have more powerful and better functionality and then build even better features on top.\n\nGrace and the rest of the Core team can talk about some of the things we've been cooking up there. And most importantly - we \\_always\\_ want to hear from you. What would you like to see in Core?",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

But you then delete said intermediate products presumably because they take up so much space that this saves you money.... And somehow the savings are worth rebuilding it from scratch every time?\n\nI have so many questions; this isn't making sense to me. Feels like either you're overoptimizing for cost when it's really not worth it or else doing something wrong when it comes to query optimization for the intermediate products to truly not be worth keeping around. Are your joins exploding? Is storage really so expensive that rebuilding these intermediates makes sense? Are you doing too much in your final query?

We are on prem, this isn’t about saving cloud costs, it’s about us being somewhat low on storage and trying to minimize how much useless data is just sitting around. We are working on getting budget to expand, but that doesn’t happen immediately. I don’t understand what you mean about doing something wrong with optimization for them to not be worth keeping around. These are models that are run on a daily/weekly/monthly cadence. The previous versions of the intermediate models are useless for the next run. They either cover a completely different date range, and even if there is overlap, we have a decent amount of updates/deletes against old records so we’d want to rerun with the newest versions of the records anyways. And no, our joins aren’t exploding, I’ve actually done a huge amount of work creating optimization guidelines for our models, and will go in to fine tune when needed. Since we are on prem, we aren’t paying for aggregate compute usage. We have a set amount of compute and memory that is always available at any moment. If we just ran one model at a time, we would be massively underutilizing our compute. To make the most out of our compute, we run multiple models at once. But since we aren’t just running one model, we have to set memory limits on all models, by dividing our available memory by the number of concurrent models we run, to ensure we don’t have memory related failures. Also as I mentioned, there are cases where breaking things out into an intermediate model can have massive performance improvements. Our query engine materializes CTE’s every time it is called. If you use the same CTE in a query 5 times, it quintuples the memory and compute usage, versus just running it once into a table and then just referencing the table a few times. It all makes plenty of sense, you are just evaluating it from an invalid context.",

In terms of priorities, here's how I'm thinking about it.  \n\n\n* First and always - ensure that dbt is a great way to do data work for organizations all across the world. You'd be surprised by how much nuance there is in keeping that up. Addressing bugs and community issues, adapters changes from the underlying databases and new releases for things like dbt-utils. I came to dbt from running a data team and more than anything else the question is how can we continue to be a trusted piece of the analytics stack for data teams across the world.\n* Beyond that, I think of the next set of priorities across three primary buckets - the dbt Fusion engine, AI and emerging standard.\n   1. The dbt Fusion engine is a big area of investment for us and we've seen that for projects that are able to successfully adopt, the rust based, strongly typed version of dbt brings a ton of improvements. Things like speed, improved developer experience and the sql comprehension features that power the VS code extension work great. And also - we've seen some challenges in complex projects getting migrated over to Fusion\n   2. AI - I've been obsessed with AI since way before I worked at dbt Labs (fun fact I was an r/futurology mod when it had less than 1000 users). I really believe that AI is going to radically reshape how we do data work - and giving dbt users the tools to do that *right* is very top of mind.\n   3. Emerging standards - Iceberg, arrow and more. We've been watching Iceberg for a few years and now we're starting to see real customers using Iceberg in production for cheaper / more flexible data ingestion, and to use dbt across multiple data platforms",

New data is ingested weekly, and from it new model features are built through a tree of 30+ very complicated tables. Models are then fed these latest features. We're pretty happy with this. \n\n\nBut when we want/need to develope new/different model features, we really struggle with versioning. we only have one database: production. So end up duplicating the entire tree of tables with _version[] appended. The development is then done in the version suffixed tables until eventually it eventually becomes prod and the old tables/definitions are deleted. \n\n\nWhy is this bad? Massive PRs, drift between trees during dev, significant risk of manual mistakes, entire tree must be duplicated even for small changes (complexity and cost).\n\n\nCan DBT help with our architecture problems?",

Cloud data warehouses allowed you to load more data into yuor warehouse, but there wasn't a great way to manage this. Compute was cheap, storage was cheap, but getting useful, structured answers was challenging and difficult.  \n  \nThat technological paradigm isn't going anywhere, but it is going to be changed *a lot* by AI. Something that I'm thinking a lot about is how to make \"the dbt lifestyle\" remains relevant in the AI era.  \n  \nFor example, we saw an interesting article published [this week](https://substack.com/@groupby1/p-187428984) claiming that the \"Modern Data Stack\" worked great for humans, but there are other tools that will perform better for agents. I think it's important to take an honest look here - the experiment run in this wasn't very rigorous from what I can tell, but it might be pointing at something real.  \n  \nBut I really do believe we have an interesting role to play in the AI world. For example - last year we shipped the [dbt MCP server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp) and we just released [dbt agent skills](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills) but the thing that's really exciting to me here is some testing we've been doing around how Fusion (because it's faster, has more metadata awareness and is more strongly typed) can be the best of both worlds- a great experience for human developers and powering agentic workloads.",

I would not be able to understand everything, but seeing that a file of X customer didn't get ingested, or that X parameter was not set as I thought could help me debug the problems faster. \n\nBut yep, in Snowflake they told me that the results of queries were only visible for 24h by the owner of the query, no one else, not even an accountadmin could see the results. Which for me seems madness, and completely different than, if I'm not wrong, BQ, where anyone can see all the queries run, and that let you see/analyze any query and see what was processed, or didn't run as intended.\n\nFor copy into maybe the list of files, or be able to filter and only get the ones that failed to ingest, and trigger an alarm with it.\n\nAnother example could be when I run a MERGE on Snowsight (UI of Snowflake) it returns me the inserted and merged cols I think it is. I built some custom code to retrieve those values to sql variable and store them in a logging table. But it would be good if the tool has the functionality on its own. \n\nOr there is a query where I retrieve the max date of the ingested data, store it in a sql variable, and use it later. From what @dbt-grace said, I would be able to use [log jinja functions](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/log) to print those to the log, that way if we have a problem in the future I will be able to see which data we processed.",

This was actually discussed as well in [a recent episode ](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/apache-iceberg-and-the-catalog-layer)of the Analytics Engineering podcast. There's another episode due out soon where Tristan and I discuss the future of Iceberg.  \n  \nIceberg brings you the flexibility around where your data is stored and what compute you pick, but it adds complexity in having to manage an iceberg catalog. There are a few iceberg catalogs out there but many of them support “part” of the iceberg spec, and finding who supports what is not super easy.  \n  \nIf you are all-in on a data platform and won’t need cross data warehouse compute my take is that Iceberg would not be worth the effort today.\n\nHowever my prevailing opinion is that the Iceberg project is to data what standard-sized ship containers do for global trade. It's not necessarily \"exciting\" per se, but it has undeniable impacts on end users in that it's easier to get your ~~goods~~ data from point A to point B",

This is the area of our product I think about all day, so I’m both sorry to hear that you feel a sense of abandonment and very open to feedback on how my team can revive your confidence that we remain dedicated to both dbt core and the open source community.  \n  \nI am proud of our two big releases of dbt Core last year (`v1.10` and `v1.11`) that included some features I’ve personally been wanting to bring to life for a longtime now ([sample mode](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sample-flag) and [user-defined functions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/udfs), to name two). And, we’ve added even more codebases to the “open source” bucket - we just re-licensed [metricflow under Apache 2](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/open-source-metricflow-governed-metrics), and Fusion includes some [net-new Apache 2 code](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine).  \n  \nIn case you missed it, we also put out a [roadmap update in December](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-12-magic-to-do.md) in the dbt-core repo! I’d encourage you to give it and read, and let me know your thoughts.\n\nWhen I have heard this type of sentiment from other community members, it’s often coming from a feeling of frustration that we haven’t been as responsive to issues and pull requests in our open source repos over the past year. I feel that frustration as well and am working hard to get us back on track! Candidly, our team has been split across two focuses this past year: helping to build the new dbt Fusion engine and evolving the dbt framework across both Core and Fusion. I’m very excited to be onboarding a lot of new team members to dbt Core (this month!) to revitalize our activity in our open source repos and continue to execute on the dbt Core roadmap.",

I truly appreciate the work your team is doing on features like UDFs and Sample Mode.\n\nHowever, I want to be candid: many of us have seen this pattern in the industry before, and we’ve experienced it with dbt Labs specifically. It was the same with the MetricFlow server. While the logic was open, the essential infrastructure to run it effectively was kept behind a paywall.\n\nThis creates a sense that dbt Core is effectively being placed in maintenance mode—receiving incremental updates—while the 'real' future and performance leaps, like the Rust-based dbt Fusion engine, are gated under the ELv2 license.\n\nTo a developer, it feels like dbt Core is the 'bait' to get us into the ecosystem, but the 'magic' that makes the tool 2026-ready is no longer truly open. If the most transformative innovations continue to happen outside of the Apache 2.0 scope, it’s hard to feel that dbt Core remains a first-class citizen rather than just a legacy entry point for dbt Cloud.",

So if you take this path, assume you're going to be very focused on data-engineering-applied-to-AI.\n\nNow, given the actual pace at which human institutions move, I am convinced that even if foundation models get _quite a lot better_ it will take five years to reorient a bunch of legacy businesses around the new technology. But from there, all bets are off.\n\nA reorientation around AI may well make _experienced technologists_ even more important as staff for competitive businesses, but don't expect 'data engineering' specifically to still be prominent (consider how the database administrator role has faded in salience due to the Cloud revolution, for comparison).\n\n---\n\nAll in all: don't let AI put you off. But go in with your eyes open: none of us can make precise predictions about 2035, and even on the shorter horizon you need to prepare to be flexible and stay abreast of this new technology.",

All apps tend to resemble each other and complete codebases for all kinds of apps are available to scrape on the internet, so the models have a wealth of solutions to fall back on.\n\nAs a DE I'm finding its more a glorified google search.  If I unleash it in agentic mode, it utterly balls stuff up.  It can't see the databases nor final dashboards etc so is missing a lot of information that I hold in my head and get a steer on from SME's across the business.  This information is proprietary and often just held in peoples heads, so there is no way a 'generic' LLM would have access to it.\n\nHaving said this, I think DE’s working in smaller companies with less complex tech stacks and environments and are finding ‘generic’ LLM’s more useful.  I work in a multi-cloud, multi vendor environment.  We have every permutation of pipeline you can imagine weaving its way in and out of multiple platforms.  There is no way a ‘generic’ LLM can see across all of it so its usefulness is limited.",

Business people will dabble here and there and might do their own dashboards like a PowerPoint but they have too many meetings to actually do technical works. There are many components but with the help of AI, a very small team can do it all, from deploying cloud infrastructure, testing, data engineer etc. \n\n\nSo a DE will be expected to know SRE, SDET, DE, DA and even ML. A few years ago, my job was heavily DE and DA and now it also involves building infrastructure and test suite, which are the jobs of SRE and SDET. Its much easier to build pipelines and dashboards these days. It means more people from other tech areas transition to DE, increasing the competition. For people in the industries, as long as you're expanding your skill sets, it's OK. For someone new, it'll hard to break into, because you might even be competing with SWE, SDET etc who lost their jobs and tried to transition to DE for example. \n\n\nIf you wanna get into tech, be prepared to learn everything from every areas.

At my job, we test drove a bunch of AI tools last summer and it was a total fail with our codebase. I personally started seeing value around October/November.

Maybe the cost of research kills a bunch of the big companies and the progress slows. Maybe the cost of subs goes so high we can't afford it. Or, maybe things keep going as they have been and agentic tools can fully automate our jobs in 2 years.

Requires some window function, sum, and what not.. And col name is not very descriptive enough to tell it’s to calc Revenue, giving 0 context for AI to process\n\nSo, yeah.. in data engineering, AI won’t 100% do the magic.. it can help us faster to build API, make some Pyspark/scala/whatever code, sql (if connected with our metadata), give some reasoning/exploration, etc.. but it can’t remove human entirely.",

          "text": "24 months ago, the smartest people in the world could look at the evidence and call LLMs \"auto-complete on steroids\". I did not agree at the time, but it was a credible assertion. If anyone is still saying that in 2026, they are not credible based on the research that's come out since then. In 2024 people said LLMs can't solve Wordle, and they can't count the Rs in strawberry. No frontier model fails at those tasks in 2026 but people are still repeating the same memes.  \n  \nPeople who are not using AI to (effectively) code think it's supposed to be some kind of maestro that 1-shot generates you a script out of thin air. I would characterize the latest iteration of AI to be more akin to a swarm intelligence. Even a single frontier model agent is not very impressive by itself. I've found that even given a well defined list of tasks, a single Claude agent will degrade rapidly in performance because of context rot. But if you start orchestrating: creating and destroying agents for singular purposes (cattle, not pets), then the capabilities become very impressive. Your agents can make a plan, execute on it, _check the results_, adjust the plan, retry, and so forth all autonomously. This is the scary part, not because it's really good at leetcoding, because planning and iteration is something that's transferrable to all professions.  \n  \nSecondly people misunderstand, especially after the ChatGPT-5 fiasco: GPT-5 is not a single model, it is a router, a reverse proxy, that assesses your query and routes it to one of its 10s of actual models behind the curtain. Despite the marketing it was primarily a cost engineering tool for OpenAI, because it removes choice from the user about what model you are being served with. So you could be using \"ChatGPT-5.2\", and you get some shit answer because it decides your question wasn't worth its time (or their servers are overloaded, or any other reason) and routed your question to some shit model. All frontier \"models' work this way, \"Opus 4.6\" does the same. So all those seemingly cracked models that Google is sending out to dominate benchmarks? Yeah, no guarantee that's the one serving you (or is even one of the possible options).\n  \nThat means you cannot one-shot some chatbot on your free account and have an accurate picture of the state of the art. Anyone who is isn't using harnessed agents and burning tokens have no idea what they're talking about.  \n  \n18 months ago I thought the role of humans will be as model whisperers, guiding these mercurial and finicky chatbots. Well, prompt engineering came and died as a profession in less than 12 months. 3 months ago I thought the role of humans would be building mcp integrations to connect agents to the business domain. Well, Claude is pretty well capable of being pointed at any API and building an integration by itself right now.  \n  \nCurrently I would say my comparative advantages are understanding the business domain, architecture, and security. If you notice, none of these are junior attributes. As an OG AI hater, it pains me to say that if you gave me a list of projects to complete, and I had a choice between an intern or Claude Code and an intern's salary of tokens, for effectiveness I would take Claude Code every time hands down. (I'm not saying that the AI is better in every way, rather there's no comparative advantage).\n  \nAnd I don't even know how long my moats will hold. There is a degree of skill involved with using agents, which can explain why some people are getting poor results, but tbh the skill curve is not that high, and any clever tricks people think of to squeeze more performance out of the agents (e.g. chain-of-thought, ralph-loop, sub-agents) just get baked into the harness and democratized. I think the only reason people don't get better at it is a psychological aversion to AI.\n\nAgainst all odds, my company managed to assemble a competent team of AI engineers that built an in-house agentic framework that _actually delivered business value_...for about 12 months. Now I wonder what was the whole point if every analyst will be rolling with Claude Cowork on their laptop in 6-12 months. If you look at where we were just 24 months ago vs now, it's hard to imagine where we'll be 24 months from now.  \n  \nSo all that to say, we're all guessing for the next 5 years. My hope is a small business renaissance and a democratization of knowledge, but I fear we just end up in a world where 12 rich guys own everything until one day they betray each other. But I wanted to give a deep and nuanced answer, and get my own thoughts out. We can only nudge the world to the better scenario if we're honest to ourselves.",

No one knows what the industry is going to be calling for.\n\nHowever, and this leads to the second way to answer your question--- look at the fundamentals of what drives demand for data, and, consequently, what drives demand for data engineers.\n\nIt's these things that suck up a lot of data to deliver correlative approximations that can never be accurately used in the exact processes  data engineers excel in. LLMs.\n\nSo, synthesising this: yes, the tooling will change, but data engineers will only be riding this AI bubble as much as they have been already. Maybe more of them will be data scientists. Maybe more of them will be AI, but I doubt it.\n\nThere might be less of them.

I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job.

OP, the way you described what you’ve done already actually screams “modernization / enablement” more than “just a data engineer.”\n\nYou took an on‑prem mess, brought in orchestration, built libraries, introduced BI tools, and designed a warehouse. That’s literally the narrative a lot of companies want for “we’re stuck on old infra and need someone to drag us into 2025 without breaking everything.”\n\nIf you frame yourself as “I specialize in taking legacy on‑prem setups and moving them toward cloud‑ready practices” then the lack of BigCorp‑AWS™ experience hurts less. Pair that story with 1–2 focused certs and a couple of small, very concrete cloud projects and you’re in a much better spot than trying to look like a generic cloud data engineer.\n\nAlso, target places that are mid‑transition, not already full cloud. Those folks value someone who actually knows the ugly side of on‑prem.",

And how they impact the business for the better. This also helps you become more visible if you've been just working with other folks in the company, but not with exec team. Not sure who you report to, but asking these kinds of questions to your direct report also helps.

You satisfy the current needs and start working on things you think are important or necessary to do what they ask you to do (reporting, dashboarding). \n\nOverall, I'd try to communicate a lot more and see what they say.

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.\n\nIf you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.\n\nYou mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.\n\nMaybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

Speaking strictly from career perspective, it's typical to feel that boredom/itch around 2-3 years and it's always good to make your needs/expectations relatively clear.

Keep at it consistently, talk with your manager or your manager+1 about the things you're interested in, ideas you have for other things.\n\nIf you want more, push for more. You're most useful when you're engaged and that'll often show. It doesn't always mean staying with the same company, but often times it does.

You will move up in no time if you can show value in doing things differently.\n\nWhen I was promoted to DE at my company (analyst for 3 months prior), they also used a drag and drop GUI hooked up to an OLTP database, and frankly the datasets sucked. They had no mechanism to retain historical data for SCDs so there was no historical accuracy. They had created like 6 surviving OBT tables after 3 years and they spent all of their time fixing constant bugs. The data analysts had created a shadow data warehouse that actually ran 95% of the reports.\n\nSo, in my first 6 months I learned about the company and processes and pushed for better practices: git, OLAP database (Snowflake), and proper modeling. I produced 4 datasets that were correctly modeled. I also optimized the daily runtime of the warehouse from 3 hours to 1 hour, and reduced a weekly pipeline from 10 hours to 1 minute, so I built a lot of cred as an expert.\n\nSecond year the company was ready and budgeted for a migration to Snowflake and git. The team was doing PRs and I was setting the standards for code reviews. We set up the platform with basic tooling to deploy, ingest, and transform data, including CDC and SCDs. I introduced some project management frameworks to my manager as well.\n\nThis year I’m hammering on modeling and tooling. I have shown them the value of conformed dimensions and I do the data modeling. I basically mandated no more unmodeled data and no more shadow warehouse moving forward. We also have big capability gaps between ingestion, transformation, automated testing (unit/data quality), orchestration, and more. I’ve put together a roadmap to address these for this year.",

          "text": "Your manager is right to question it. 2 million events per day is  what 23 events per second? An $18k Confluent bill at that volume usually means over provisioned clusters or connector sprawl. My first question. Do you actually need sub second streaming? If the business is not triggering automated actions in milliseconds then you are paying for guarantees you do not use. Moving most flows to micro-batch (5-15 minute windows) instantly cuts always on cluster and connector costs.\n\nMany keep Kafka for the truly real time edge cases and replace the rest with scheduled ELT pipelines. Stitch, Integrateio, Airbyte can all pull incrementally from your sources and load in controlled batches without running 24/7 streaming infrastructure. That gives you near real time analytics without cluster babysitting and without that high bill every month.",

I think moving onto the hard questions is good, if you've already done the easy/medium problems. You can always re-visit the Mediums again, and try to speed through them, after going through a few dozen hard problems. You just might be surprised how much faster you can go, after practicing on harder problems, and getting better at pattern recognition. \n\nBesides DataLemur, I think having a proper project to talk about is also super important for Data Engineering interviews. Hopefully, this can be sourced from a past internship – but if not, go make a real portfolio project that's end-to-end, deployed (with a live link), that's also key-word rich (so use AWS, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Python, etc.).

          "text": "Since you (and a couple others) seem to be more or less asking for some structure to learn against, here's what I use or have used in my day-to-day.\n\n- How to install docker, and the follow-ups needed, on your Distro/OS. Windows/Mac are pretty straight-forward. Linux has some steps after install that you need to do.\n\n- Get used to navigating dockerhub, finding official image builds, and how to pull specific versions. Much like Python version pinning, you _certainly_ want to pin versions of infra.\n\n- Read the docs on the most important docker cli commands. Non-exhaustive: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker pull`, `docker exec`, `docker container cp`.\n\n- Learn and practice making [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). Learn the subtle differences between `ADD` and `COPY`. How Layering works. Learn the differences between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, `ARG` and `ENV`. Learn how to expose a port on a container to the host. HINT: it isn't with the `EXPOSE` instruction and if you made it this far without being able to ping your container from your host you should go back one step ;) . Make a `.dockerignore` so you don't put anything you don't want in the container. You can ignore these instructions for now: `HEALTHCHECK`, `LABEL`, `MAINTAINER`, `ONBUILD`, `SHELL`, `STOPSIGNAL`.\n\n- Learn how networking works for Docker. Networking generally is a weak point for most SWEs, and seems to often be doubly so for DEs. In the same vein, read the docs on how Docker Volumes work and how to attach them.\n\nNow, you came to the DE Subreddit to ask this and mention you have 2 YOE already, so I'm going to also mention a couple of more specific things.\n\n1. [Running Airflow in Docker](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html) is D E N S E but obfuscated heavily. As in, it has a lot of levers and knobs, but it mostly assumes the defaults are good enough for this. It also assumes you know docker-compose which I _did_ leave out of the top. The justification I'll give for that is that Docker Compose is great... but you should be using the dockerized airflow mentioned here as a TESTING system ONLY. Thus, get it going following thier instructions, do what you need to do, but don't assume it matches production-grade Airflow deployments.\n\n2. You could (and perhaps should) use [Astronomer's CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview). I don't work for them or anything, but I have used their managed service in the past. The fact that the CLI exists for free is great and should be taken advantage of for local testing.\n\n3. Now that you've seen those two and understand how docker works and have played with the ins and outs, contrary to what others may say, I would then _AND ONLY THEN_ look into Kubernetes. No matter the system, managed or self-hosted, Airflow and it's pipelines ALWAYS run on Kubernetes behind the scenes. The way you build the image for [Airflow will change](https://gist.github.com/wesh92/4ce0634e61949a1679e2ae5a1788cb18) and, thus, how you manage dependancies and the way you need to understand how Kubernetes sees Containers versus how you've seen them thus far at this point. I cannot stress this enough though, DO NOT jump straight to this point. Everything above here should be _weeks_ of testing, toiling, and troubleshooting at a minimum before you try to introduce K8s. When you do, start with a local manager like `k3s`. I would recommend not using `minikube` or `kind` as those are \"k8s in docker\" which is a whole extra layer you don't need. The justification I'll give for including this: I like my local testing env for pipelines to be as close, if not exact, to what I will deploy. For me this means _in kubernetes using exactly what I will deploy_ with as much of the kubernetes weirdness as I can account for. If this doesn't feel important to you, please feel free to ignore!\n\nHope this helps! But please, just start with the Docker basics. You can search up a youtube if your more visually-inclined. Read through the docs and try implementing things if you're more of the experiential kind. Nothing is going to be a cheat code because these are kind of foundational tools for SWE and DE.\n\nEDIT: formatting. reddit pls",

Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I guess they finally stopped pushing it because it stayed off, but for a good 2 years, it was a battle to keep OneDrive off an ms machine.\n\n>Yes, it’s the next lock in. That’s it.\n\nBingo.

I've been working on an ETL project at work that involves moving data from one platform via an API to a SQL database using Python. I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.\n\nA lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. \n\nI don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. \n\nFrom experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.\n\nBut rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.\n\nThe return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.\n\nThe real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.\n\nWorth having a direct conversation about it.

They're the single best debugging tool when something breaks in prod. Manual logging means you're recreating what the runtime gives you for free, except worse.

I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time.  \n\nI don't think my situation is a very good comparison.  Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work.  I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table.  Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.\n\nI was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew.  \n\nAgain, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.\n\nIf your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted.  A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess?  \n\nLike, I had nobody to review my code.  If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.
