There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.\n\n10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.\n\n5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.\n\nIn the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.\n\nIf you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends. The key is identifying the next trend before it happens.",

(Nobody really cared about governance)\n\nMy general take on current direction is that the split is / will be\nplatform - (architecture & platform engineering)\nAI / ML engineering\nBoth on the technical side\n\nAnalytics engineer & governance on the business side\n\nMaturing AI solutions will downgrade technical skill requirements so that non-technical users can perform tasks currently done by data engineering.\n\nI don’t see the distinct data engineer position being here for much longer.",

          "text": "First: I'm sorry. Being fired hits you in the gut, and no amount of \"it happens to everyone\" makes that feeling go away. The shock, the nausea, the panic about what comes next. All of it is valid. You're not weak for feeling this way. You're human.\n\nAnd asking for help publicly when you're this vulnerable? That takes guts. Most people disappear and suffer in silence. You didn't.\n\nI worked with Data Product Owners at Sky for years, and I mentored quite a few of them. What you're describing isn't unusual.\n\nFour years in chaotic startups with constant restructuring? You've actually learned more than you think. You know how to work without clear processes. You know how to figure things out when nobody gives you a playbook. You know what happens when data governance doesn't exist. Most candidates from stable companies panic when they encounter ambiguity. You won't.\n\nThe fear you're feeling is real, and I won't tell you it's not valid. Take a day or two to feel it. Don't job hunt today. Let yourself be angry, sad, whatever needs to come out.\n\nThen get practical.\n\nWhat a Data PM actually does in a \"normal\" company:\n\n\\- Owns the roadmap for data products (dashboards, pipelines, data contracts, self-service tools)\n\n\\- Translates business questions into data requirements\n\n\\- Prioritizes requests from stakeholders who all think their thing is urgent\n\n\\- Works with engineering to scope what's buildable in what timeframe\n\n\\- Defines success metrics for data initiatives\n\n\\- Manages stakeholder expectations (this is 40% of the job)\n\nYou've probably done most of this informally. The difference in structured environments is documentation and process. That's learnable in weeks.\n\nFor interview prep: Study the Modern Data Stack. Know what dbt does, what data contracts are, what a semantic layer is. Read about data mesh (even if you think it's overhyped, interviewers ask about it). Be ready to talk about trade-offs, not just features.\n\nWhen they ask about your chaotic environments, frame it: \"I had to build processes where none existed.\" That's valuable. Companies with perfect processes don't need strong PMs.\n\nOne thing you won't read in most career advice: if you want to grow fast in this field, find a great data or platform architect who actually wants to work with you. Not just tolerates you, but genuinely enjoys the collaboration. The best Data PMs I've mentored all had this in common. A good architect will teach you how systems actually work, why certain decisions matter, and how to ask the right questions. That partnership changes everything. \n\nYou're not starting from zero. You're starting from four years of learning what doesn't work, which is often more useful than knowing what does.",

You have to consider the value you provided amidst the chaos to make a good story to sell your profile.\n\nRemember, any job wants these things:\n\n1. Cultural fit\n2. Competency to contribute from day 1\n3. A strong indication you will be worth the time and money they invest into you\n\nWhen you apply, study the company and find something you genuinely like about it - learn their mission statement and incorporate it into your cover letter (always write a cover letter for every app).\n\nIf you can contribute from day 1 - let them know what you've done beforehand and how you can do that there - this is easier to do during interviews or by modifying your resume. Make sure your resume always includes responsibilities and accomplishments couched in actual measurable metrics.\n\nLooking like you're worth hiring is hard to do - the hiring manager or team leader reviewing your app or resume or interviewing you does not want to hire someone that does not pan out - that's a big failure on their part and anything you can do to guarantee you're not that person is the type of strategy you want to pursue. 1 and 2 help with this, but what really helps is how you interview and what you can say about your ability to learn and grow at a company.\n\nIf you're saying you didn't learn anything at your job, which I don't think is true in four years, you have to sit with your memories of your experiences and codify them into something concrete. Imagine, if you had more time at any point, how could you have come away from that period feeling like you had learned something? It's fine to admit you had to be quick and dirty during MVP development at your start up - say that was the case and that when you got time, you made sure to review what you learned to be able to cut through the chaos, were you to need to go back to handling those responsibilities.\n\nDon't get in your own way buddy - good luck.",

You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. \n\nFor me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards😝 kinda kidding. \n\nAs an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert.

You can earn a bunch of credentials for free (Oracle, GCP, AWS, Microsoft, etc all give out vouchers from time to time through various programs). \n\nIn my mind, certs are basically for two things:\n\n1. Partnership requirements. (e.g., you work for a Google Cloud partner, and they financially incentivize you to have a well-trained, distributed and credentialed staff by gating access to funding opportunities behind certification requirements)  \n\n2. Helping you get past an HR screen. I have a bunch of certs and they're all completely worthless imo, but also they do make it more likely your resume will be reviewed and make it into the right pile, which can help you in the early stages of the hiring process. The more keywords go on your resume, the better. Also, when you have like 10 relevant certs and list them, your resume stands out because you show depth in the field - you must at least know enough and have enough general experience and history in the field to have acquired them.",

It's like a lottery of maybe this manager cares or this recruiter cares, or not.

          "text": "This is like a breath of fresh air to read that hiring managers care more about personal projects. I started learning to code back in May 2025. Foolishly I thought “hey DE looks like a nice niche. I’ll learn that.” So I used Exercism to learn python and ChatGPT as mentoring. I wanted to build a small oncology knowledge base that was oncogene-agnostic(I used civicdb.org and GraphQL to ingest the raw data based on selected oncogene). Using AI has “helped” in a wierd way. Instead of feeding me production grade tech stack it listened to me as beginner and took me through simple sqlite. Then we migrated that to Postgres and then we started using dbt to create the tables. It was also a complicated journey of learning about start schema, dims, bridges and facts. Obviously SQL came into play early but I was using INSERT OR IGNORE which was not helping with idempotency. I was using for loops to read and transform data from the raw json and then insert it into the tables instead if using dbt to do that properly and enforce rules. I learned how to create CLI commands and flags to trigger the API call and build the raw json and then dbt run to populate tables. I’ve also learned to implemeny very basic CI(linting and formatting mostly) with a few simple pytests. I’ve even created a few marts for some analytical showcasing. It was a grueling and trying experience. Really hard. If I remeber 50% of it O would count myself lucky. But this is for sure: I k ow what it takes to build a pipeline from ingesting to transforming and warehousing. Have not implement orchestration yet but in due time I will. I’ve for ed myself to do it properly using  a Docker container and using github which helped me understand the perils and benefits of branching, pull requesting and merging.\n\nI’m one of the lucky o es because I own a business and I’m not looking for work. I just wanted to have a fallback plan in case my income stream tanked. Always loved the idea of learning to code. Right now I’m following my dream of building a game using Unity and tha github account and knowledge is coming in handy. Python not so much:)) My time is limited but I do what I can. 2 kids and a family will probably leave me up to 1-2 hours of coding. Was lucky to be less busy during autumn and was able to put in a lot more hours. \n\nAnyway, personal projects I feel is the way to go for sure.",

I focus my resume on projects i really applied myself on and either saved the company a lot of money, or fundamentally changed/empowered the workflow for massive efficiency gains. I think the key here is people who think certs help are already thinking a bit too academically in the real world positions they hold. And true value in DE comes from really understanding the jobs beyond yours to see the worthwhile, out of the box solutions. My first big major role was %80-90 on prem, but a huuuge environment. I learned the extreme basics in real world conditions (multiple different sql engines/db styles built/utilized by totally different teams) to solve real pressing business problems with a multitude of frameworks (kube clusters, single standing airflow servers, equipment controller cluster dbs) and beat feet around the office to get face time with the stakeholders to understand the problems as in depth as possible. No point studying models and methods (ESPECIALLY for overpriced low-code crap, thatll be worthless to the company when they switch in a few years and doubly so to you if you happen to get RIF'd and the next company uses something else) when you can learn them/discover them along the way(in what, like a half day of research?) to a solution (plus holy hell do lessons learned this way stick so much better with a long track of a personal endeavor with success at the end(also felt this way about some calc derivative formulas and such in eng school, as it was easier for me to get better at solving the fundamental equation/problem and then just take 5-10 mins at the start and work/write out the ones i knew would be on the test)). With those applied problem solving skills and super long-hour/week grind years, ive never had to prove my worth very hard anymore because my experience ballooned so quick that i can usually relate a lot of new problems to *something* ive seen before. That, and im super lazy once i get out of work so not a lot of drive to build massive things in my spare time (plus not nearly as many resources on my own outside of big companies to work with)(also maybe so lazy bc i dump so much effort into my jobs?// MAW get paid for cooking the noggin). \n\nMain takeaway id like to emphasize is that a good DE doesnt just talk to other comp sci/dba/DE folks... getting out of your comfort zone, getting face time with customers/clients and really trying to see how they find problems and the constraints they face trying to solve them on their own is what generates golden goose value imo... i mean shit half the time i get dirty looks from CS majors for not phrasing something perfectly, but my big picture perspective has always been whats gotten me wins. Get out of your comfort zone, always ask why, chase the big problems, and apply yourself and youll probably surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.",

Understand distributed computing and the Spark framework, so you can compute large datasets across many machines. Understand CICD with git and Jenkins. Understand the fundamentals of GenAI and know what it’s good at (summarizing and analyzing large text or logs / finding patterns in data points, deciding next steps in ambiguous situation, generating boilerplate code) and know what it’s not good at (it often will produce incorrect code and may hallucinate so always triple check its work, and does not need to be used to do things that are deterministic - I see a lot of overkill with GenAI which wastes money and time). \n\nOnce you have the foundation, you can adapt to any tool.",

          "text": "What is the source of this image, I really dont understand what this is trying to communicate? Truth be told I think its also pretty reductive, and management slop. If data science is not delivering well tested code, it has a hard time making it into production. If engineering cant keep infra running overnight without an outage you have some architectural issue. But they both feel the impacts of those decisions and your clients 10x more. Separating AI Engineer vs Analytics Engineer vs Data Engineer doesnt really tell me what those roles really do, nor do they show a large enough difference between each other here. AI is not enough a differentiator since the tools to a competent engineer are not magic, nor is implementing AI into a product enough to say its \"different\" or requiring different skills. Putting infrastructure in a bucket separate from the others forces a decision on your users, rather than building with their needs as a primary requirement. L2 makes no sense, none of this shit works without a competency in how data moves, unless you are in a non-technical role, but this is not the subreddit for that role. L3 and L4 are the same thing (maybe) if you are doing modelling, you are thinking all day about inference - full stop thats the job; not every job requires an LLM, in fact I would call an LLM a specialized tool versus other modelling and machine learning paradigms. When it comes to the \"vector\" machine learning models all expect them in some respect, this term has been overhyped by the sales dummies trying to scam boomers with FOMO. Best practice is treating the black box as a software package and building a frame around it that matches the rest of your system's patterns, if you are building a pipeline for example you MUST know that information, where it fits, physically where it runs on planet earth, how the vectors for prediciton are constructed (you find this in your training code). Finally, if you dont have a place for data to land, be viewed by a human, or consumed you dont have a product, you dont have a system, everyone needs expertise in this, REACT vs Prometheus+Graphana vs shoving the vectors back into pgvector, it doesnt matter. Your back end guy has one too, its not *pretty* like powerBI, but it gets the job done. Until you have a user pattern, you minimally have the ugly tooling.",

Transformation on it is not dbt but cognee? Eval etc, different skills.\n\nYou might be unaware because you never tried, considered or talked to anyone who does, but there are agencies that use combination of LLM and determinist generation to create modelled data extremely fast. Once someone has the right incentive to build a public solution here, people will need new jobs.

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

          "text": "sr de here, we interviewed over 100 people last year from mid career to principals. tons of people used llms. The easiest way we trapped them to the point they got so scared they left the interview. the key is to ask them some minor topical questions early in the interview loop so you dont waste your time on them. early as in the first 5 mins.   we started asking them technical impossibilities. LLM prompting tends to spit out more detailed responses if give them the context or premise. when you do this, the LLM tends to accept whatever context to give them is true and will attempt to answer in that context. Thus, if give people incorrect context. And a question about something that relies on that context. A person who is good at DE work will know right away you were wrong. But the LLM, because you gave it the context as true, will attempt to answer with hallucinations.\n\nOne of the questions we like to ask is this: Airflow implements a version of a DAG. So does Spark. Our team has been working integrating both DAGs together for improved performance. Guide us from a high level how this can be achieved.  If the LLM tells the candidate they were wrong in the prompt, the candidate is not likely to respond to us that we were wrong but think the LLM is wrong. as they are not technical enough to know how right or wrong the LLM is actually. A good portion of the time, the candidate will just read the gibberish to us with an uneasy look as they are not sure if its right or wrong.  based on these types of questions. We sometimes just end the interview early.  If they can somehow answer the question, we start changing the scenario and going back and forth in the timeline to mess with the LLM's memory.",

          "text": "\"The only way to know if they are not using AI is to interview them, but how can I prevent interviewing someone that is using AI?\" You're answering your own question. Comes with the job of hiring someone. If interviewing people is part of your role as a manager, then why sweat having these phone calls? You're getting paid to do it. And since you say that HR is giving you resumes, then a logical step you could take if someone is riding you that this is taking too long to hire is to request that you yourself do the resume filtering. \n\nYou'll need to change your interviewing process to prevent this from happening. Before you do a technical Teams call, try a casual-but-technical phone call. See if this helps you weed out the phony candidates.\n\nIn my opinion, at the end of the day, this just comes with hiring. Ask candidates to do in person interviews or in person screening (\"Hey I see you're local, can we meet at a coffee shop to discuss the role and your interest?\") by looking for local candidates. Too many people want to be fully remote and so they are going to keep using AI just like companies keep using AI to filter out candidates. For a role where the user is likely tech-saavy, it's very little effort on their part to mass apply to hundreds of jobs with AI resumes.\n\nImmovable object meets an unstoppable force.",

Modeling will make you ship faster with AI-assisted coding. It's also important for certain hyped features such as text-to-SQL. Unless the LLM bubbles burst (meaning it would be prohibitively expensive to use), LLMs will be come one of the main data (model) consumers.\n\nAs for your question: do proper data models and then code with Cursor or Claude Code.

Even though you might struggle to access all of the data you need at times, this breadth will help a lot and most of all give you some freedom and space to figure it all out.",

          "text": "I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  \n\nFirst, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.\n\nSecond, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.\n\nLastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

Our cheaper envs are $600/month and the more expensive ones exceed $1000/month in total costs (composer, logs, support, taxes...).\n\nIt's also kinda slow and problematic to use with multiple independent projects. The GKE part makes most jobs have 10~20s startup and imo you must containerize most projects if you don't want your team's having issues. It also sucks for DR that you can't have a proper \"cold start\" env.\n\nThe annoying bit with Composer, most projects are probably best off combining BQ and Cloud Run Jobs for actual compute, and for that the orchestrator really shouldn't be doing much, just IO. I took this thinking and deployed a sub $100/month Dagster with single webserver that orchestrates BQ and Cloud Run Jobs, works better imo..",

And yes I agree the GKE does cause a lag for job starts, but we're doing batch data processing so aside from the annoyance when you're trying to ad-hoc run something it doesn't affect us.\n\nFor my company it saved us a nice chunk of cash, relatively speaking, because we came from Prefect. On Prefect we were paying $60k a year (to Prefect) AND the prefect jobs were containerized in our GCP environment and running there as well (meaning we were also paying for container execution ontop of the 60k). This of course could be very different now, we made the decision to switch and save money 3 years ago when Prefect was pushing us to move to Prefect 2. Since upgrading to Prefect 2 was going to require a bit of rework, it was the best time to assess the cost to migrate away. If you have to rewrite code anyway... that makes the decision easier.\n\nOur Composer cost is about $30k a year total for 2 environments (Test & Prod).\n\nBut yeah, if you don't have a lot of jobs or complex stuff going on, I'd just spin up Airflow in a container or VM. I've not used Dagster but I've heard good things.",

Should I be looking at 'EMR Serverless' or just stick to local Spark/Docker until the patterns click?",

Basically just a `pip install`, and you have everything needed to orchestrate on your laptop, including the UI. Having used Prefect and Dagster in production, I personally recommend Dagster for its better overall design, but Prefect is good too. Their tutorials are usually pretty good too.\n\nYou can try to do some ELT based on local file -> DuckDB table -> dbt transformed table, orchestrated with Dagster. 0 cloud bill and already a lot to explore.",

They are hard to maintain, hard to do code reviews, and tend to persuade people to write monolithic spaghetti code as opposed to following good software engineering best principles. Also I don’t see a time id ever need to edit a notebook live with another user in a collaborative fashion. If I did, other cheaper platforms such as AWS Sagemaker exists. \n\nMLflow + Feature Store - Experiment tracking, model registry, feature serving with lineage?\nYeah spinning up an MLflow or WAND tracking server isn’t hard and again you can easily deploy a pre-made one via any other cloud provider much cheaper than databricks. Same thing with feature stores. \n\n\nWorkflow orchestration - Built-in scheduling with Databricks Jobs?\nNah Airflow/Prefect FTW. \n\nUnity Catalog for centralized governance, fine-grained access control, lineage tracking across all your data assets?\nAWS, Snowflake, etc. all have pretty decent catalog tools that are again much cheaper than databricks. \n\n\nI’m not saying databricks is a bad platform. I’m just saying it’s not the right platform for me if I was CTO of my company. I just don’t see the value proposition over using all AWS products and choosing my own DBMS. \n\nI think databricks to me feels like what Apple is for smartphones and laptops. They try to make a suite of tools that integrate well to form a nice ecosystem of products, but it’s a walled garden that doesn’t give you full control over the product you are buying. \n\nOne last example: databricks provides a fully managed delta lake house and SQL engine to query the data. A Delta table is composed of a series of flat files (parquet or some other type of columnar format). But it doesn’t tell you where it stores the files. It abstracts that part from you. It’s silly because we know under the hood they are just storing it in a blob storage like azure blob storage. Why can’t I go to the place where the data files sit and use the blob storage interface to copy/paste, move, or download the files? \n\nIf I want a more performant Delta table I could just use AWS S3 and query results via duckdb or some other data processing API that works with delta and iceberg tables.",

          "text": "Think of data stores being in 3 separate categories:\n\n1. Traditional SQL databases (RDBMS) - MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, etc.\n2. NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J, etc.\n3. Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.\n\nThey all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).\n\nNoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.\n\nWarehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

          "text": "So first answer:\n\nFrom pandas 2.0 onwards a lot of change was made to move from numpy into arrow, so you cant just use np.nans as pandas nans now, its pd.NA. Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

They said Architecture is at most 2 days, and there are only a few tables! I said for a temporary solution since they are interested not to do these excel reports manually most I can offer is an automated excel report, not a full blown cube! Otherwise Im not able to commit a 1.5 months timeline without having seen myself the ERP landscape, ERP connectors, precisely what metrics/kpis are needed etc!

I work at a small company and joined a data science team and started writing etl stuff in jupyter notebooks in jupyterlab. and then later even as the project grew I kept writing parameterised notebooks and ran them with papermill. But it's starting to get absurd and I think isn't really common practice at all. But I am not sure how to get out of this habit. \n\nI write data science style procedural code and like to inspect and muck with stuff every step along the way otherwise I feel blind. It feels as I am in a live debugger. Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. \n\nI personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. \n\nI am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data. Thanks guys.",

Each of these bits can then be tested  simply by running examples data through them independently and comparing outputs match expectations (this is basically what unit tests are). \n\nIf done, when someone comes up to you and says I think churn should have been 10% this month but it's showing a negative number you can quickly say oh that's strange I get 20 customers who didn't make an order 300 active customers and 100 new customers (by running the subfunctions) so following the definition I get 20/300-100 which is about -99. And they can go I think maybe you missed some brackets it should of been 20/(300-100) and then you go doh I'll fix that in the calculate user churn function . Or they can go that 100 doesn't sound right and you can go oh let's explore that by looking at _count new customers and so on. \n\nSticking to functions having a single responsibility like this makes reuse easier as code is less tied to single outputs and also makes testing your code through unit tests easier too.",

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.\n\nIt will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you get to this level there is a whole world of code design best practices you can venture into to make your job easier while giving you more confidence in the correctness of your code and its artifacts.",

I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.\"\n\nInstead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?\n\nIf you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).\n\nIf you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).\n\nYou know how to use a hammer very well already. Time to become an architect, too.",

The last SQL Server was switched off 17 years later. \nMy path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I  learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.\n\nBecause of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to.  As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.\n\nI'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs.  Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.\n\nFor Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.\n\nLearn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. \n\nOnce you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.\n\nI built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems.  Databricks has Spark at its heart.\n\nLearn for the job you want and to keep the job you have.",

My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.\n\n•\tThe Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.\n\nThe Offer (Internal Role):\n\nI have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).\n\n•\tTitle: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).\n\n•\tTech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.\n\n•\tThe “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.\n\n•\tVariable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.\n\nMy Plan / Strategy:\n\n1.\tTech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).\n\n2.\tDomain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.\n\nMy Questions for the community:\n\n1.\tDoes taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?\n\n3.\tHas anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

If it isn't worth it, then the other option is to start actively looking for other 'internal' roles - and of course accepting the risk that it might take you a while to find a role that maintains (or increases) your base salary.\n\nIMO 12.5% comp decrease is not that big a deal if it means aligning yourself to the type of career you want long-term.
