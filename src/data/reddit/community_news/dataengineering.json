      "text": "I recently went through several loops for Senior Data Engineer roles in 2025 and wanted to share what the process actually looked like. Job descriptions often don’t reflect reality, so hopefully this helps others.\n\nI applied to 100+ companies, had many recruiter / phone screens, and advanced to full loops at the companies listed below.\n\n# Background\n\n* Experience: 10 years (4 years consulting + 6 years full time in a product company)\n* Stack: Python, SQL, Spark, Airflow, dbt, cloud data platforms (AWS primarily)\n* Applied to mid large tech companies (not FAANG-only)\n\n# Companies Where I Attended Full Loops\n\n* Meta\n* DoorDash\n* Microsoft\n* Netflix\n* Apple\n* NVIDIA\n* Upstart\n* Asana\n* Salesforce\n* Rivian\n* Thumbtack\n* Block\n* Amazon\n* Databricks\n\n# Offers Received : SF Bay Area\n\n* **DoorDash** \\-  Offer not tied to a specific team (**ACCEPTED**)\n* **Apple** \\- Apple Media Products team\n* **Microsoft** \\- Copilot team\n* **Rivian** \\- Core Data Engineering team\n* **Salesforce** \\- Agentic Analytics team\n* **Databricks** \\- GTM Strategy & Ops team\n\n# Preparation & Resources\n\n1. **SQL & Python**\n   * Practiced complex joins, window functions, and edge cases\n   * Handling messy inputs primarily json or csv inputs.\n   * Data Structures manipulation\n   * Resources: stratascratch & leetcode\n2. **Data Modeling**\n   * Practiced designing and reasoning about fact/dimension tables, star/snowflake schemas.\n   * Used AI to research each company’s business metrics and typical data models, so I could tie Data Model solutions to real-world business problems.\n   * Focused on explaining trade-offs clearly and thinking about analytics context.\n   * Resources: AI tools for company-specific learning\n3. **Data System Design**\n   * Practiced designing pipelines for batch vs streaming workloads.\n   * Studied trade-offs between Spark, Flink, warehouses, and lakehouse architectures.\n   * Paid close attention to observability, data quality, SLAs, and cost efficiency.\n   * Resources: *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann, *Streaming Systems* by Tyler Akidau, YouTube tutorials and deep dives for each data topic.\n4. **Behavioral**\n   * Practiced telling stories of ownership, mentorship, and technical judgment.\n   * Prepared examples of handling stakeholder disagreements and influencing teams without authority.\n   * Wrote down multiple stories from past experiences to reuse across questions.\n   * Practiced delivering them clearly and concisely, focusing on impact and reasoning.\n   * Resources: STAR method for structured answers, mocks with partner(who is a DE too), journaling past projects and decisions for story collection, reflecting on lessons learned and challenges.\n\n**Note:** Competition was extremely tough, so I had to move quickly and prepare heavily. My goal in sharing this is to help others who are preparing for senior data engineering roles.",

Imagine you have a table for customers, in that table you have an address. I have many transactions every day but “a new customer” or change a customer is not something that happens all the time. So that table changes “Slowly”   That’s the SCD. It’s a fancy way to say “A dimensional table that changes” \n\nNow type 1 vs type 2 basically determines what you do when something changes. \n\nLet’s say you changed your address. I can just go and update the customer table with your id and your new address and call it a day. That’s a Type 1. \n\nHowever let’s say you need to retain all the addresses you’ve had historically. So you create some new metadata columns. A “current” column, and a couple of date columns. \n\nSo now when you changed your address I basically copy your line changed the old one “current” to false than when th change happens. And the new one  set current to true. \n\nSo now if I want your address infilter by your id and tha current is True. If I want your old ones. Filter by current is False and the date columns will order them. \n\nDoing that “basically not replacing the line but instead creating a new one for every change “ makes it a Type 2 \n\nSo SCD1 and SCD2 are basically those\n\nEdit: Just realized that I put 1 and 3 at the beginning fixed to 1 and 2",

Bad source data, unclear ownership, changing business logic, SLAs no one documented, and pipelines that need to survive people, not just demos.\n\nTools come and go. For me, the actual work is deciding what deserves to be modeled, what can be wrong, what must never be wrong, and how fast the business needs to know. That’s the part that rarely gets discussed.\n\nAlso yes to the medallion point. Renaming long-standing patterns isn’t innovation, it’s branding. Useful shorthand maybe, but it becomes a problem when people think the diagram is the architecture.\n\nWould love to see more posts on failure modes, trade-offs, and “this looked clean on paper but blew up in prod.” That’s where the engineering actually lives to me.",

I’d love to start a casual weekly call where we can talk data engineering, swap stories, and learn from each other.\n\nOver time, if there’s interest, this could turn into things like a textbook or whitepaper club, light presentations, or deeper dives into topics people care about. Totally flexible.\n\n**What you’d get out of it:**\n\n* Hearing how other people think about DE problems\n* Learning stuff that doesn’t always come up in day-to-day work\n* Getting exposure to different career paths and ways of working\n* Practical ideas you can actually use\n\n**Some topics I’m especially interested in:**\n\n* Performance and scaling\n* Systems thinking\n* Data platforms and infrastructure\n* FinOps / cost awareness\n* Reliability, observability, and ops\n* Architecture tradeoffs (build vs buy, etc.)\n* How data stacks evolve as companies grow\n\nThis is mainly for early-to-mid career folks, but anyone curious is welcome. If this sounds interesting, reach out and we’ll see what happens.\n\n  \n",

Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.\n\nThe criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.\n\nIn my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.\n\nSo I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

But at a huge cost because the columnar databases are not exactly designed for integration work. And then they slapped the keyword \"modern\" to mask the issues and make everyone assume all previous solutions are outdated or not relevant. I believe that is the main critique by Mr.Inmon and I totally agree with him. People were sold a lie and both of these companies willingly participated in that lie.",

This is partly (maybe mostly) caused by consulting companies selling a dream and quick wins when nothing about integrating organizational data is not generally a simple task.  I've seen it time an time again.   There is also a part of this that is due to education.  Many current practitioners also want quick wins, have not really done this type of work before and end up learning the wrong lessons.  I'm a decade younger than Bill and Ralph but have been doing this sort of work for 25+ years.  I see many consultants sell this this a a technology project when it is only partly this.\n\nI think a part of this started with 'schema on read', 'agile (get er done quickly and fail fast) and the era around early 2000's when companies just wanted dashboards (the tip of the iceberg) and didn't care about how that happened.\n\napologies...I'm ranting now :)",

          "text": "I think the core issue here is not Databricks or Snowflake. I mostly agree with the other commentator who said the cause is misidentified. In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.\n\nThat said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.\n\nSo the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

Its a fine distinction, but i think from a big picture tells the same story. Its not just snowflake and databricks, all of the big 3 cloud providers are guilty too. The core problem/cause that links both of your nuanced agree/disagreee statements (and which you and bill acknowledge) is that these service providers willingly sell the lie that proper storage forms are not needed. Which is a mistruth at best and straight up deception at worst. Ive seen this happen several times, often because the people being sold/(lied) to are high level csuites with not experience in data modeling and as that sign off tumbles down the ladder til it gets in front of a skilled DE, no one above them believes (or has the necessary understanding/capacity to) that these older models are necessary anymore (and then gets frustrated when their apps arent fast enough and think the DE is judt picking a bone/lazy about their implementation blaming it on this foreign/alien concept of a proper warehouse structure, that they must so clearly have because its just a digital object where all their disorganized crap goes, and thats what the provider's solution architect said). Idk if some of these execs are really that naive that a 'solutions architect' is just a salesman, theyre slightly aware/embarassed enough of their lack of understanding of the concept to feel they cant admit it and play along in the room, or if they really just get caught up in the sway of wishful thinking (i.e. AI will solve all!!!). I tend to lean towards the last case here and as someone commented on the linkedin post (not on *substack* yet?) It feels a function/product of the quarterly/yearly reporting structure of corporate america.  I sure as hell know my last company did NOT like my diagnosis that 15 years of unstructured (worse, fragmented unstructure) raw data with no underlying, bought in, agreed upon process documentation would take 2 years minimum for me as a one man team magician to set up a modern architecture that could merge with SAP and make something clean enough to run near-live visualizations from. When i came in they had excel sheets everywhere with fragile AF VBA scripts linking across a whole plant to a shared drive... was literally told by one the the heads of IT to just use fabric to directly ingest these sheets like itd be that easy... On a level its almost a tradgedy of the commons in regards to our collective understanding of these concepts battling with our collective understanding to \"look\" busy via measured outputs at an \"acceptable\" pace from the glass office in the sky and therefore no EDW is getting the time or attention it needs for the past 5 years.",

Data has always been complicated (even with the term \"data\" itself), but no matter how complicated, you can always trace a predictable path to achieve something. Data warehousing is a great example: it started as a way to solve reporting and analytics problems. Regardless of industry, size, or type of data, the data-warehousing modeling approach can provide a predictable path to achieve reporting and analytics goals, no matter how complicated. You didn't need many tools: just extraction, transformation, and loading. And yes, the devil is in the details, you're right, but that's precisely where things get complex when you start adding too many moving parts (tools) that create complexity. Complexity is always bad. Always. Remove complexity first, then work out complications.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.\n\nI’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.\n\nDespite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.\n\nI’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.\n\nWhat’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.\n\nI’m trying to understand a few things:\n\n\t•\tIs this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?\n\n\t•\tAre companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?\n\n\t•\tIs the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?\n\n\t•\tFor those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?\n\nI’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.\n\nAppreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.\n\nThanks for reading.",

In my previous roles, I’ve owned production pipelines end to end, worked on large-scale Spark and streaming systems, and supported business-critical use cases. Some companies call that senior, others call it mid-level, and I’m okay with that distinction.\n\nI fully agree with you on networking and the AI screening problem. It really does feel like bots talking to bots right now, which makes the process feel detached from actual engineering ability. I’ve landed roles both through cold applications and through luck, so your point about “applying into the void” resonates.\n\nThe unconventional spaces advice is solid. I’ve started expanding beyond traditional tech companies and am actively looking into healthcare, education, logistics, and other domains where data engineering is needed but hiring is less automated. That shift already feels more promising than chasing only big-name tech roles.\n\nIf you don’t mind sharing, I’d be curious how you’ve approached networking into those spaces. Did you focus on referrals, direct outreach to managers, or something else that worked consistently for you?",

Most of the students with student work visas that were expiring within the next couple years, some h1-b or married to h1-b candidates. \n\nThere were a few green card holders and 2 US born candidates that were extremely unqualified for the role. \n\nAlso every resume seemed to come from the same template and pretty much looked the same with different schools, companies, starting dates but mostly the same skills and general experience. It was very difficult to go thru the stack of candidates because very few stood out as different. \n\nI think this market is broken. Qualified candidates have trouble getting thru the noise and it is flooded with foreign workers. My guess is that most employees are staying out of the market for now and waiting for conditions to improve. Those looking for work are those that were downsized or student workers looking to land someplace to start an h1-b process. \n\nMy analysis may be incorrect but this is what we experienced posting on LinkedIn and indeed.",

Not talking about fancy schools or prestige, just real, practical differences. From your experience, what do strong candidates consistently do better, and what are the most common gaps you see? I’d really appreciate any honest, experience-based insights. Thanks!",

FAANG test right out of the bat on SQL and DSA's, just to weed out candidates. If they go past that, then same concepts are tested at much advance levels. \n\nAll these only come with experience. One of the trickier questions always asked is about the trade-offs for various roles. They're testing to see if a person can think of other ways than just one way. Questions on cost vs speed of data is also asked quite a bit. ",

          "text": "You need to understand and frame your technical work in the context of business problems. What business problem did you encounter? How did you use both business and data engineering expertise to design, propose, modify, and execute a solution? How did you ensure your proposed solution *actually* addressed the business problem?\n\nI'm consulting with a company that used a large vendor to design their data solutions. None of those original solutions actually solved the business problems at hand, despite the fact that they handled all of the data, did transformations, designed and scheduled pipelines, and all of the other data engineering fun stuff.\n\nToo many technical and data folk will specify and build something very technical and impressive looking just enough to get greenlit by managers. Then they go and build said thing and deliver the equivalent to a car whose wheels are on the roof. They met all the expectations: an engine, uses gasoline, produces torque through wheels, has seats, etc., but ultimately built something useless to the business.\n\nReviewing that previous group's work, I've found that their stakeholder presentations are full of technical diagrams outlining the tools and technologies they will use, and how cool said tools are, but overall they contain little about how they will help. Using cars as an analogy (again), it's as if one advertised how great the metallurgy is in the car, what electrical connectors it uses, etc.; that kind of detail is ultimately important, the engineers are interested in it and stakeholders are impressed by it, but what *actually* matters is how the car works. Is the car safe, can it accelerate well, does it have good enough mileage, can it accommodate everybody in it, does it do what you need, and can you explain why and how it achieves all of this?\n\nHow do *you* avoid doing the above and ensure your work fulfills business problems? Can you work both domains simultaneously: both understanding the business *and* having the technical expertise to construct data solutions that solve the problem? Can you show your technical expertise while explaining the business problem, and then show your understanding of the business problem while discussing your technical expertise? Can you keep all of this together in a cohesive story?\n\nLastly, can you demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt? Can you learn new business environments/problems and then describe how you would approach finding a technical solution? Can you show that you're not a one-trick pony and have found proper solutions to things? The way my manager framed it: can you be left alone with a client such that your manager can sleep easy, knowing you will properly present and harvest \n\nBeing able to speak both \"languages\", business and technical, puts you far ahead of other candidates. In interviews, I often find myself interviewing the interviewer, asking about the characteristics of the project, discussing their current solutions, and where they're trying to go. Then from there, I describe technical solutions, the needed labor/resources, and how the outcomes of said solutions will solve their business problems. I interweave past experience into this to demonstrate familiarity and competency. Also, don't be a know it all - when you encounter something you don't know, say so and provide your approach to developing understanding - people can tell when you're bullshitting, and dishonesty is always a major liability.\n\nAnyway, that's my two (hundred) cents.",

They know how to optimize pipelines and save money, but can't even really talk about why the data they are processing is useful, let alone how they would factor in actual business rules when building data marts.\n\n2) Can't go in depth on projects they've worked on. When I ask about projects I'm looking for:\n\n- What the project was\n- Why you were doing it\n- What was the challenge that came up\n- If the challenge was a bug, how did you go about diagnosing it\n- What were some things you did to try to fix it\n- what actually worked.\n\nI basically give people this rubric when I ask the question (as in, I list all the bullet points above). And a lot of answers still don't really cover them.\n\n3) Can't justify decisions or talk about trade-offs. This is for systems design interviews, but a lot of people will be able to talk about scaling and jump to something very large without considering the actual scale of the problem presented. Also, their justifications of tech are \"x scales better\" but they can't describe why.",

I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.\n\nUnfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.\n\nI was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.  \n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n\n\n",

My focus was the getting multiple functional solutions (plus testing and metrics) to demonstrate the different approaches, not making sure my take-home assignment code, written on a short deadline, was production-ready code.",

Pick up the Azure stack as you go as your skills slot directly into it.\n\nI have worked with a lot of people who have your exact stack and they all have what you have which is a lot of T-SQL and not a huge amount of general purpose programming.  This is both good and bad.  Good because if you applied to a Microsoft heavy company, you're probably going to get in.  Bad because it means everybody on your team is likely to be like you i.e. not a huge pool of skills to learn from.  If that isn't a problem for you, then that's cool.  The job advertised is also likely to be on prem only.  Again, depends what you want to do on a daily basis as there are going to be some on-prem only jobs with your stack which pay really well.\n\nIf you want to get away from a Microsoft stack, brush up on DE and cloud fundamentals as well as pick up Python.",

I think certain DE's don't want to invest in learning multiple tools.  Or they have hate for a vendor (msft) and use that vendor's tools as little as possible.  In that case you are making a deliberate compromise, and that is a totally acceptable path as well.",

The UI is clunky, but the schema explorer and cross database support are hard to beat once you tune it a bit.\n\nWhat has helped me more than switching clients is changing how I use them. Smaller result set limits by default, fewer auto refreshes, and leaning on the SQL editor instead of clicking around the tree constantly. That alone fixes most of the sluggish feeling.\n\nI have not found a single tool that nails fast exploration, smart autocomplete, and wide database support without tradeoffs. Most teams I know end up with one main client and a lighter secondary one for quick checks, rather than trying to force one tool to do everything.",

Is it implemented separately outside of the tools provided by the large scale platforms (such as Snowflake, AWS, Databricks) and if so how is it done ?\n\nAsking because I see Joh descriptions explicitly mention Kafka as a experience requirement while also mentioning Snowflake as required experience . What exactly are they looking at and how is it different to know Snowflake streams and separately Kafka.\n\nIf Kafka is deployed separately to Snowflake / AWS / Databricks, how is it done? I have seen even large organisations put this as a requirement.\n\nTrying to understand what exactly to learn in Kafka, because there are so many courses and implementations - so what is a typical requirement in a mid to large organization ?\n\n  \n\\*Edit\\* - to clarify - I have asked about streaming, but I meant to also add Snowpipe.

In 99% of large organizations Kafka is a completely separate standalone cluster. It usually lives in its own VPC on AWS (MSK) or is managed via Confluent Cloud. It sits upstream from your data warehouse.\n\n2. Why use Kafka if Snowflake has Streams?\nBecause Snowflake Streams are proprietary. If u use Snowflake Streams you are locked into Snowflake. But a large enterprise has 50 other systems that need that data (Microservices, Real-time Dashboards, ML Models, Fraud Detection). None of those can read from a Snowflake Stream efficiently in real-time.\n\n3. Typical Implementation Pattern\nSource (App/DB) -> [Kafka Producer] -> Kafka Topic -> [Kafka Connect / Snowpipe] -> Snowflake\n\nu learn Kafka to handle the transport layer. \nu learn Snowflake Streams to handle the ingestion/transformation layer once the data lands. They are complementary not competitive.",

Sure, there are managed cloud solutions thst can probably do the same, but you'll be surprised how many enterprises still have massive on-prem clusters that they need to use until EOL to get value of of their investment.\n\nKafka is, however, unnecessary if you're running a small 10tps streaming service.

Even a few real projects is usually enough to make your profile read as “platform agnostic” instead of “Snowflake only.”\n\nIf your employer gives you legit Databricks work, take it.

Snowflake's sweet spot is still managed warehousing and SQL analytics, but their new AI/ML features are definitely pushing toward a more versatile platform. Databricks, meanwhile, was built for big data and machine learning from the start, so if you want to lean deeper into data science, streaming, or large-scale ETL, it’s a strong addition to your toolbelt.\n\nFrom a career perspective, deep expertise in either is valuable, but having practical, hands-on experience in both will make you stand out. If you can get some Databricks exposure—even in one-off projects—I’d take it. At the very least, you’ll be able to talk intelligently about both in interviews, and more companies are running hybrid stacks.\n\nLong story short: Don’t abandon Snowflake just because Databricks is cool now, but add some Databricks to your arsenal if you can.

I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.\n\nI'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like \"how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?\" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. \n\nThe idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.\n\nOn the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.\n\nIn the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a  healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.\n\nThere seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",

Since you're working with one, I wanna get your thoughts (I haven't used one in production myself).\n\nMy current mental model for a feature store puts it as more like an operational store, in spite of it holding large analytical datasets. I wouldn't want BI analysts, clients, or the platform to be able to see the data in there directly, but then if I ingest raw datasets directly into it I can't present them the core datasets that drive the inference. To present the core data would mean I would have to also copy those raw datasets into the warehouse as well, and retransorm? Or should I just extract the ML feature sets from the feature store into the warehouse? It feels like I should stage the data in the warehouse, do some initial structuring, then join and pull them into a big table in the feature store from there, followed by deriving the more specialized ML features.\n\nI also don't know if it's necessary to land my inferences back in a feature store for analysis, if I'm not going to use those as a feature as well? If my core datasets are in the warehouse, I can dump my inferences as a dataset, present models from them, and dashboard/present them from there. \n\nGiven your experience with a feature store, is my thought process off here?",

Even if you only have a single DE, they can use Kimball to guide the modelling that they do.  And, depending on the needs of the organization, it isn't critical to make the model gigantic and intricate. \n\nLike most things, limit it to what you are working on and the level you need it at.\n\nSome specifics - Mesh is very much a decentralized approach, though the specifics vary quite a bit based on who you talk to.  But in a Mesh environment, pulling a healthy fact table across is what you want to have happen.  It allows that cross-group information flow, while minimally impacting either group.  Yes, it is a dependency, but point to point isn't bad as long as there aren't too many; at which point you start looking at a central repository for these cross-group objects in place of point-to-point.\n\n  \ndbt for all, I agree is not a good ideal and fortunately not one I've come across in the wild.",

For Product website flat tables are king.\n\nI am not sure what you mean by breaking into different definitions. That sounds wired.  Let's make an example.\nYou have 2 tables.\nThe one is about cars, the other one monthly sold cars.\nTable 1 consists of car name, engine type, horsepower, wheels, extras, comment, up.\nThe other table is frame number, car type, sold amount, discount, comment.\n\nNow the keys in your Modell is car name in table 1 and frame number in table 2. If you are lucky you could build a relationship by using frame number and car type if car type is equal to car name. If not, you might need some solution to match both.\nIf you do not have that much luck you need additional data. Many you have a lookup for frame number where you get a better name. Or you use a trained model to make the match from table1.car name to table2.Car type. And that service is again an own source into the model.\n(If we distinguish between business vault and raw vault, the service generated table is in the raw vault and the abstracted relationship would be something on the business vault. But these helps to give you a orientation where the data comes from. Is it derived or external input)\n\nThe approach is that basic, you would not have a different approach.\n\nI had once the case in a finance world, that I had been asked to extract all defaulted accounts. There was a field default, if true it was defaulted.\nI did use that as a filter, send the query back, and I got them the answer that is not what the requested ment he was looking for default per basel3 standard and the field reflected only the institute internal definition.\nYou mean confusion like this?\nThat is data governance. You need to know what field expresses what. And you can have multiple flavors of one and the same thing. It is a good thing to have a clear name in for that. I would create a business board which decides on the naming. Because BI is always business driven.",

This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store).

I had personally just mapped the idea of bronze->silver->gold  to staging->transforming->presentation, but you just mentioned both staging and bronze as separate things, so I'm clearly off here.\n\nEither way, what you're saying is we should look at ML as part of the transformation steps before presentation? That's definitely a different picture, as I was picturing ML as taking the presented fact tables and producing a new inference based dataset from it that itself goes back into staging and transformed into presentation in a new data model. \n\nThis picture makes sense with my work in forecasting, where I generally want a rolling snapshot fact table to already be prepared, and the forecasts can get dumped as jsons or parquet by the ML pipeline, and ingested and transformed into new facts from there. With this, clients can see the same snapshot dataset we trained on as well as the forecast itself. \n\nHow would you ideally want this forecasting example to fit into data modeling the way you did with your customer rating example?",

I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.\n\nQuick overview of inputs/outputs:\n\nEL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.\n\nWhen it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.\n\nFrom there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.\n\nMajority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.\n\nI have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. \n\nCost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.\n\nThanks in advance and curious to see responses.",

If it generates enough business value that you'd carry on (perhaps putting in place a migration plan) - then it's probably fine as a choice. If you're so cost sensitive that a small rise in costs would cause problems, then it's probably not the right choice.\n\nGenerally being heavily invested into Snowflake doesn't concern me too much. Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.\n\nUnless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value. Vendor lock in mainly comes from the fact that it's really good, rather than vendor lock in from being proprietary. Very little of it is highly proprietary unlike a lot of other ETL methodologies.\n\nWhy aren't you at least using internal stages? There's far less overhead in using COPY INTO vs INSERT unless you're inserting a trivial amount of data. External stages and pipes even less overhead and cost.",

Databricks has this AI-powered coding assistant called Databricks Assistant which can help your data analysts with SQL or Python syntax should they need it.\n\nIf any of your software devs (or data scientist turned software engineer) are required to build web applications, there is Databricks Apps to let you build a web app based on popular frameworks like Flask/Streamlit or even NodeJS. Lakebase can also help if you need low-latency OLTP database for your web app.\n\nYou can also open up Databricks to your business users, business stakeholders, or C-level to let them ask questions about data using Genie or to let them view dashboards. If those business users accessing Databricks directly, you can minimize the array of menu down using an access control called Permissions. Or you can also integrate Databricks with BI platform of your choice like Tableau/PowerBI/Superset/Metabase.\n\nI think that covers quite a lot of use case across several teams already.",

These are very good certifications in terms of understanding what databricks actually are. Bit of costly but worth it. Even Udemy has similar courses you can try it out.\n\nAlways start with understanding their infrastructure and architecture and start understanding one by one features in terms of data layout optimizations, table formats, catalog layer, governance layer.\nAlso try setting up each thing in databricks and by the side you will learn all the things.\n\nFrankly speaking I haven't taken any courses but I started exploring the features and did many pocs on each of them. \nAlso my suggestion is that don't try to scope it into your usecase, try out all things and think of it as a data engineering platform journey because you will learn many things over there so.

No links in the ToC and the terms I'm searching for have either 0 or 144 hits in the document. I finally get to the file layout section.

I now need to go read vague 1-liners as to why record 22 is being generated in this or that instance. Turns out I need to go read IRS instructions on 1099R forms to figure out how this code is supposed to be used. Of course, the IRS is not referencing our internal code sets so I need to cross reference all of those too.\n\nI have read through 1000's of pages of documentation over the years and most of the time it only tells me things I already know and doesn't answer my questions.",

There would be documentation developers, documentation PMs, documentation test engineers, senior documentation engineers!

If it is audited and scrutinized in a meaningful way by the FDA for example or it is mission critical for daily operations then it gets prioritized. If it is \"strongly recommended\" then it is a If your leaning your cleaning type of thing that no one wants to do until it creates a problem.\n\nSpeaking of FDA. In pharmaceutical manufacturing the FDA audits the Quality Management System which includes the documentation for all your procedures. If for example an out of date paper copy of a procedure was in a lab or on the line they will send a 483 letter to all your clients and possibly sanction you depending on the circumstances. So in pharmaceutical companies there are Document Control departments and employees specifically for documentation. If you have an SOP that says put container A on the right and employees decided that it goes on the left and didn't update the SOP that is a violation. So documentation is prioritized because it can effect the bottom line",

I keep insisting at my job that documentation should live in GitHub and be subject to the same SDLC as code, with PRs, “code” reviews, etc. I’m a big fan of quarto and using it for documentation. Also mkdocs though I prefer quarto. But that’s just the tooling, it’s still missing what to document, how to document it well, and how to make sure everyone knows where it is. Building a culture around documentation is really hard because most don’t give a shit. Hell, most people don’t even give a shit about code quality either, so then caring about docs is an even bigger stretch. \n\nI’m aware of the four different types of documentation a la: \n- https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/eu/2017/the-four-kinds-of-documentation-and-why-you-need-to-understand-what-they-are-daniele-procida/\n- https://diataxis.fr/\n- https://danielsieger.com/blog/2023/04/24/framework-for-better-documentation.html\n\nBut these sometimes feel like overkill. If you can justify it’s not overkill, then you need management to agree that resources need to be dedicated to generating proper documentation, and often times that doesn’t happen, it’s just “yea make sure this is documented”. \n\nSo genuinely curious what these techniques are and where I can learn more about them.",

          "text": "SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.\n\nI suggest you look at \"Timestamp\" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do \"hashing\" of data, and use a staging layer.\n\nWhen you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a \"raw\" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.\n\nOften it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.\n\nFor example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. \n\nFor delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.\n\nSo basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.\n\nSome people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.\n\nFWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's. I had a great database teacher that was ahead of  his time.",

                  "text": "I don't really see a similarity.  Duckdb is basically a database,  which is different than a semantic model.  A semantic model is an intermediate layer between the database and presentation that allows you to make a data model and transforms and metrics on top of the DB.  It then generates queries that hit the database.   Duckdb is a library/cli that manages access and queries to duckdb data in a file.  You write the SQL in Duckdb and it manages the data access and presents the results.  In a semantic model you query via the model and it translates that query into SQL that it then sends to another application that executes the query and returns the results.  Latency is ultimately determined by the database because it's not going to run a query against your database faster because it's the semantic model asking.  Yeah, you can use a cache layer included in the semantic model, but you can also cache without it.\n\nThe original intent of Duckdb was to allow users to run smaller queries and process data on their laptop, not to play in the same space with managed database services like Snowflake and Databricks.  Basically they noticed that the vast majority of queries executed in a business are not massive, needing the scale of the larger platforms.  People's laptops had enough power to work with that size data so you don't need to pay for saas or hardware to host a DB.  It's a fantastic tool for what it does.\n\nMotherduck did do what you are advocating for and made a managed DB service based on Duckdb so maybe you want to check that out?  They were an independent group from the guys that built Duckdb, but work closely with them.",

      "text": "I’m the only developer at my company. I work on a variety of things, but my primary role is building an internal platform that’s being used by our clients. One of the platform’s main functionalities is ingesting  analytics data from multiple external sources (basic data like clicks, conversions, warnings data grouped by day), though analytics is not its sole purpose and there are a bunch of other features. At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again,  (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of) ",

It’s not like he even asked me, he has little technical knowledge made the decision on his own.\n\n Regardless of that, the agency was onboarded. They initially requested that I provide with the documentation and api access for the services whose data we’re ingesting. They didn’t even acknowledge what I sent them, and a week or two later, they come back and tell me that they’d like to keep everything the same, and that we simply set it up to send the raw data their way and keep everything else the way it is. Throughout all this, my boss somehow thinks that the solution that they are proposing involves storing everything, including non analytical data, but I assumed that this misconception would be cleared after my last discussion with the agency. And then 3 weeks pass and there’s no word from them. \n\nSomeone from the agency asks for a progress update, and realizes that the person previously in charge of the project from his team never sent me the credentials for the new db nor followed up with me after our last call. I assume at this point that the last person was off the team, but the agency never acknowledged that or made that clear in any way. I can then finally begin working on what had been discussed… until we hop on a quick call to discuss progress and he insists that the objective was to replace the entire database. I made the incorrect assumption that my boss still had the wrong idea and had forced them to move forward with it, but In reality it was much worse than that.  The most knowledgeable person on their team was switched out, and the new guy doesn’t understand that the existing db holds much more than analytical data, because he was literally never filled in on what the platform actually does or what was previously discussed. \n\nThe only data that makes sense to be retrieved from the new database would be the analytical data. But my boss’s goal from what I gathered was to utilize the analytics outside the platform we’d built, in which case, I don’t understand his obsession with replacing the existing database in its entirety when it benefits us in now way. ",

      "text": "tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nI'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to \"make the MVP first and ask questions later\", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.\n\nOne of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a \"better\" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).\n\nI know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of \"essential fields\".\n\nMy current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a \"canonical field name\" (e.g., `{\"firstname\", \"first_name\", \"1stname\", etc.} -> \"C_FIRST_NAME\"`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.\n\nInitially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?\n\nI then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.\n\nAfter reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.\n\nTo reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.\n\nI'd appreciate any further direction.",

Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.\n\nDataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. \n\nAdditional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled. \n\nHope it clears things up!!",

I don’t mean to be rude, just being honest. I’m also really tired and about to go to sleep so. \n\nFrom I can tell, you definitely can, and sometimes want to, use pydantic to load in your api data. It will not only parse and validate it, but it can standardize your field naming too. You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it. Really depends on your use case and data volume\n\nAs for landing your raw data and then processing it, that’s a valid way to do it IMO. Land your API responses as JSON and then process with whatever tool you pick.",

Spreadsheets are a dead end and waste time, errors happen often too.\n\nFirst decide what route you want to take.\n\n1. Complete tool\n\nFor example Qlik has everything you need or more. It costs about $200 month. Relatively simple to setup and develop, large userbase for questions and help.\n\n2. Set of different tools\n\nYou need place to store your data, some database or S3 bucket or something, it costs something but not much. Then you need move your data to your chosen storage, for example Python and some orchestration tool. Lastly some tool to show your KPI's, like PowerBI, Astrato, etc. Those cost something too. Starting from zero can be difficult to decide what you need and what to use, solutions have lots of users, help and examples are easy to find.\n\n3. Build everything yourself\n\nThis depends about your skill set, how much time you want to spend with this, how large your userbase etc. Doable but I don't recommend, others have already solved all the problems you have to solve in this, takes much time and security is always worrying. No other users, help can be difficult to find.",

If the business wants the data enough to pay for cleaning old data and keeping it available, we clean and keep it available.\n\nIn practice, I look for migration dates.  When the business moves from one system to a replacement, the quality of the data takes a jump, and anything before that is only useful short term.  Find that date, and show them the issues from the old data; and if you can show how much it is costing to process and keep that data, it gets easier to convince them to archive and start working towards data destruction.\n\nThe company having a data retention policy helps too, as you can tie in to the definitions there.  Even better if it is regulated data with mandated destruction timelines.\n\nBut, you have to know your numbers, and understand their needs and requirements enough to make that proposal.\n\nHonestly, old data is so seldom used that by the time data is more than 2-3 years old, (most industries, not all) only aggregates ever get used, and even those drop off quickly after 5-7 years.  I've never been in a situation where we've wanted to unarchive data.",

Everything else feels additive, but not always essential.\n\nWe mostly use dbt for the transformation layer only, sitting on top of Snowflake or Databricks, with ingestion handled elsewhere. Tests and freshness checks punch way above their weight, especially for client work where trust in the data matters more than fancy metrics layers. Lineage and docs also get used more than people admit once teams grow.\n\nThe newer features are interesting, but I have seen mixed adoption. Semantic layer sounds great, but many teams already solved that in BI tools or code. Sometimes it feels like dbt is trying to be the control plane for the whole stack, which is nice in theory but adds cognitive load. I mostly wish they focused on making the core workflow faster and simpler rather than expanding surface area.",

Turns out Apache Arrow implementation uses wrappers for C++ and is quite heavy. So I created a minimal-dependency pure C library on my own (assisted with Claude Code).\n\nThe library is quite comprehensive and the performance are actually really good notably thanks to SIMD implementation. Build was tested on linux (amd), macOS (arm) and windows.\n\nI though that maybe some of my fellow data engineering redditors might be interested in the library although it is quite niche project.\n\nSo if anyone is interested check the Gituhub repo : [https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet)\n\nI look forwarding your feedback for features suggestions, integration questions and code critics 🙂\n\nHave a nice day!

If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.\n\nThe problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. \n\nTessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.\n\nIt's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. \n\nIf you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tessera\n\nFeedback is encouraged. Contributors are especially encouraged. I would love to hear if this resonates with problems you're seeing!",

E.g. requiring that analytics solutions only use data from gold when in production, but allowing analysts to utilize tables from other layers for their development and testing iterations. \n\n\nDogmatic approaches is reminiscent of the age-old debate/criticism of centralized data warehouses that took years to develop before anyone in the business would get data access, which reduced their value and usefulness and accelerated the development of \"shadow BI\"-setups in business departments that didn't get their needs met. You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery. ",
