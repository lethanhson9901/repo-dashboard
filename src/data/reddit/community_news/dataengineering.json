There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.\n\n10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.\n\n5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.\n\nIn the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.\n\nIf you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends. The key is identifying the next trend before it happens.",

          "text": "What is the source of this image, I really dont understand what this is trying to communicate? Truth be told I think its also pretty reductive, and management slop. If data science is not delivering well tested code, it has a hard time making it into production. If engineering cant keep infra running overnight without an outage you have some architectural issue. But they both feel the impacts of those decisions and your clients 10x more. Separating AI Engineer vs Analytics Engineer vs Data Engineer doesnt really tell me what those roles really do, nor do they show a large enough difference between each other here. AI is not enough a differentiator since the tools to a competent engineer are not magic, nor is implementing AI into a product enough to say its \"different\" or requiring different skills. Putting infrastructure in a bucket separate from the others forces a decision on your users, rather than building with their needs as a primary requirement. L2 makes no sense, none of this shit works without a competency in how data moves, unless you are in a non-technical role, but this is not the subreddit for that role. L3 and L4 are the same thing (maybe) if you are doing modelling, you are thinking all day about inference - full stop thats the job; not every job requires an LLM, in fact I would call an LLM a specialized tool versus other modelling and machine learning paradigms. When it comes to the \"vector\" machine learning models all expect them in some respect, this term has been overhyped by the sales dummies trying to scam boomers with FOMO. Best practice is treating the black box as a software package and building a frame around it that matches the rest of your system's patterns, if you are building a pipeline for example you MUST know that information, where it fits, physically where it runs on planet earth, how the vectors for prediciton are constructed (you find this in your training code). Finally, if you dont have a place for data to land, be viewed by a human, or consumed you dont have a product, you dont have a system, everyone needs expertise in this, REACT vs Prometheus+Graphana vs shoving the vectors back into pgvector, it doesnt matter. Your back end guy has one too, its not *pretty* like powerBI, but it gets the job done. Until you have a user pattern, you minimally have the ugly tooling.",

Once someone has the right incentive to build a public solution here, people will need new jobs.

All of it is valid. You're not weak for feeling this way. You're human.\n\nAnd asking for help publicly when you're this vulnerable? That takes guts. Most people disappear and suffer in silence. You didn't.\n\nI worked with Data Product Owners at Sky for years, and I mentored quite a few of them. What you're describing isn't unusual.\n\nFour years in chaotic startups with constant restructuring? You've actually learned more than you think. You know how to work without clear processes. You know how to figure things out when nobody gives you a playbook. You know what happens when data governance doesn't exist. Most candidates from stable companies panic when they encounter ambiguity. You won't.\n\nThe fear you're feeling is real, and I won't tell you it's not valid. Take a day or two to feel it. Don't job hunt today. Let yourself be angry, sad, whatever needs to come out.\n\nThen get practical.\n\nWhat a Data PM actually does in a \"normal\" company:\n\n\\- Owns the roadmap for data products (dashboards, pipelines, data contracts, self-service tools)\n\n\\- Translates business questions into data requirements\n\n\\- Prioritizes requests from stakeholders who all think their thing is urgent\n\n\\- Works with engineering to scope what's buildable in what timeframe\n\n\\- Defines success metrics for data initiatives\n\n\\- Manages stakeholder expectations (this is 40% of the job)\n\nYou've probably done most of this informally. The difference in structured environments is documentation and process. That's learnable in weeks.\n\nFor interview prep: Study the Modern Data Stack. Know what dbt does, what data contracts are, what a semantic layer is. Read about data mesh (even if you think it's overhyped, interviewers ask about it). Be ready to talk about trade-offs, not just features.\n\nWhen they ask about your chaotic environments, frame it: \"I had to build processes where none existed.\" That's valuable. Companies with perfect processes don't need strong PMs.\n\nOne thing you won't read in most career advice: if you want to grow fast in this field, find a great data or platform architect who actually wants to work with you. Not just tolerates you, but genuinely enjoys the collaboration. The best Data PMs I've mentored all had this in common. A good architect will teach you how systems actually work, why certain decisions matter, and how to ask the right questions. That partnership changes everything. \n\nYou're not starting from zero. You're starting from four years of learning what doesn't work, which is often more useful than knowing what does.",

A lot of times leaders don’t have any clue what to do with data or with their data team. I’m sure you have enough experience and skill to get into data roles. For more technical roles - I suggest you learn some hands skill on a data viz tool, sql and/or data engineering skill. Being a data PM you re already skilled in stakeholder management and you know how to explain data. Good luck with your job search. You got this!",

You have to consider the value you provided amidst the chaos to make a good story to sell your profile.\n\nRemember, any job wants these things:\n\n1. Cultural fit\n2. Competency to contribute from day 1\n3. A strong indication you will be worth the time and money they invest into you\n\nWhen you apply, study the company and find something you genuinely like about it - learn their mission statement and incorporate it into your cover letter (always write a cover letter for every app).\n\nIf you can contribute from day 1 - let them know what you've done beforehand and how you can do that there - this is easier to do during interviews or by modifying your resume. Make sure your resume always includes responsibilities and accomplishments couched in actual measurable metrics.\n\nLooking like you're worth hiring is hard to do - the hiring manager or team leader reviewing your app or resume or interviewing you does not want to hire someone that does not pan out - that's a big failure on their part and anything you can do to guarantee you're not that person is the type of strategy you want to pursue. 1 and 2 help with this, but what really helps is how you interview and what you can say about your ability to learn and grow at a company.\n\nIf you're saying you didn't learn anything at your job, which I don't think is true in four years, you have to sit with your memories of your experiences and codify them into something concrete. Imagine, if you had more time at any point, how could you have come away from that period feeling like you had learned something? It's fine to admit you had to be quick and dirty during MVP development at your start up - say that was the case and that when you got time, you made sure to review what you learned to be able to cut through the chaos, were you to need to go back to handling those responsibilities.\n\nDon't get in your own way buddy - good luck.",

You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. \n\nFor me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards😝 kinda kidding. \n\nAs an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert.

          "text": "This is like a breath of fresh air to read that hiring managers care more about personal projects. I started learning to code back in May 2025. Foolishly I thought “hey DE looks like a nice niche. I’ll learn that.” So I used Exercism to learn python and ChatGPT as mentoring. I wanted to build a small oncology knowledge base that was oncogene-agnostic(I used civicdb.org and GraphQL to ingest the raw data based on selected oncogene). Using AI has “helped” in a wierd way. Instead of feeding me production grade tech stack it listened to me as beginner and took me through simple sqlite. Then we migrated that to Postgres and then we started using dbt to create the tables. It was also a complicated journey of learning about start schema, dims, bridges and facts. Obviously SQL came into play early but I was using INSERT OR IGNORE which was not helping with idempotency. I was using for loops to read and transform data from the raw json and then insert it into the tables instead if using dbt to do that properly and enforce rules. I learned how to create CLI commands and flags to trigger the API call and build the raw json and then dbt run to populate tables. I’ve also learned to implemeny very basic CI(linting and formatting mostly) with a few simple pytests. I’ve even created a few marts for some analytical showcasing. It was a grueling and trying experience. Really hard. If I remeber 50% of it O would count myself lucky. But this is for sure: I k ow what it takes to build a pipeline from ingesting to transforming and warehousing. Have not implement orchestration yet but in due time I will. I’ve for ed myself to do it properly using  a Docker container and using github which helped me understand the perils and benefits of branching, pull requesting and merging.\n\nI’m one of the lucky o es because I own a business and I’m not looking for work. I just wanted to have a fallback plan in case my income stream tanked. Always loved the idea of learning to code. Right now I’m following my dream of building a game using Unity and tha github account and knowledge is coming in handy. Python not so much:)) My time is limited but I do what I can. 2 kids and a family will probably leave me up to 1-2 hours of coding. Was lucky to be less busy during autumn and was able to put in a lot more hours. \n\nAnyway, personal projects I feel is the way to go for sure.",

I focus my resume on projects i really applied myself on and either saved the company a lot of money, or fundamentally changed/empowered the workflow for massive efficiency gains. I think the key here is people who think certs help are already thinking a bit too academically in the real world positions they hold. And true value in DE comes from really understanding the jobs beyond yours to see the worthwhile, out of the box solutions. My first big major role was %80-90 on prem, but a huuuge environment. I learned the extreme basics in real world conditions (multiple different sql engines/db styles built/utilized by totally different teams) to solve real pressing business problems with a multitude of frameworks (kube clusters, single standing airflow servers, equipment controller cluster dbs) and beat feet around the office to get face time with the stakeholders to understand the problems as in depth as possible. No point studying models and methods (ESPECIALLY for overpriced low-code crap, thatll be worthless to the company when they switch in a few years and doubly so to you if you happen to get RIF'd and the next company uses something else) when you can learn them/discover them along the way(in what, like a half day of research?) to a solution (plus holy hell do lessons learned this way stick so much better with a long track of a personal endeavor with success at the end(also felt this way about some calc derivative formulas and such in eng school, as it was easier for me to get better at solving the fundamental equation/problem and then just take 5-10 mins at the start and work/write out the ones i knew would be on the test)). With those applied problem solving skills and super long-hour/week grind years, ive never had to prove my worth very hard anymore because my experience ballooned so quick that i can usually relate a lot of new problems to *something* ive seen before. That, and im super lazy once i get out of work so not a lot of drive to build massive things in my spare time (plus not nearly as many resources on my own outside of big companies to work with)(also maybe so lazy bc i dump so much effort into my jobs?// MAW get paid for cooking the noggin). \n\nMain takeaway id like to emphasize is that a good DE doesnt just talk to other comp sci/dba/DE folks... getting out of your comfort zone, getting face time with customers/clients and really trying to see how they find problems and the constraints they face trying to solve them on their own is what generates golden goose value imo... i mean shit half the time i get dirty looks from CS majors for not phrasing something perfectly, but my big picture perspective has always been whats gotten me wins. Get out of your comfort zone, always ask why, chase the big problems, and apply yourself and youll probably surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.",

I almost never provide actual analytics these days, but If the word “data” comes up in any context it ends up on my desk somehow. That never goes away when you are “the data guy”. \n\nIf you enjoy it, embrace it because it eventually pays very well, and you’ll usually be one of the last people that they’d ever want to get rid of. The job skills are incredibly transferable too, so long as you keep building on them. That’s helpful because the key to making more money is to change companies every few years - ideally around the same industry.\n\nBest wishes for your data guy career!",

You need an always-on Scheduler, Worker and \"Environment\", and you also end up paying for logs which is substantial. Our cheaper envs are $600/month and the more expensive ones exceed $1000/month in total costs (composer, logs, support, taxes...).\n\nIt's also kinda slow and problematic to use with multiple independent projects. The GKE part makes most jobs have 10~20s startup and imo you must containerize most projects if you don't want your team's having issues. It also sucks for DR that you can't have a proper \"cold start\" env.\n\nThe annoying bit with Composer, most projects are probably best off combining BQ and Cloud Run Jobs for actual compute, and for that the orchestrator really shouldn't be doing much, just IO. I took this thinking and deployed a sub $100/month Dagster with single webserver that orchestrates BQ and Cloud Run Jobs, works better imo..",

As I said in my original comment a dedicated orchestrator is great for a complex environment with many different pieces. And yes I agree the GKE does cause a lag for job starts, but we're doing batch data processing so aside from the annoyance when you're trying to ad-hoc run something it doesn't affect us.\n\nFor my company it saved us a nice chunk of cash, relatively speaking, because we came from Prefect. On Prefect we were paying $60k a year (to Prefect) AND the prefect jobs were containerized in our GCP environment and running there as well (meaning we were also paying for container execution ontop of the 60k). This of course could be very different now, we made the decision to switch and save money 3 years ago when Prefect was pushing us to move to Prefect 2. Since upgrading to Prefect 2 was going to require a bit of rework, it was the best time to assess the cost to migrate away. If you have to rewrite code anyway... that makes the decision easier.\n\nOur Composer cost is about $30k a year total for 2 environments (Test & Prod).\n\nBut yeah, if you don't have a lot of jobs or complex stuff going on, I'd just spin up Airflow in a container or VM. I've not used Dagster but I've heard good things.",

They are hard to maintain, hard to do code reviews, and tend to persuade people to write monolithic spaghetti code as opposed to following good software engineering best principles. Also I don’t see a time id ever need to edit a notebook live with another user in a collaborative fashion. If I did, other cheaper platforms such as AWS Sagemaker exists. \n\nMLflow + Feature Store - Experiment tracking, model registry, feature serving with lineage?\nYeah spinning up an MLflow or WAND tracking server isn’t hard and again you can easily deploy a pre-made one via any other cloud provider much cheaper than databricks. Same thing with feature stores. \n\n\nWorkflow orchestration - Built-in scheduling with Databricks Jobs?\nNah Airflow/Prefect FTW. \n\nUnity Catalog for centralized governance, fine-grained access control, lineage tracking across all your data assets?\nAWS, Snowflake, etc. all have pretty decent catalog tools that are again much cheaper than databricks. \n\n\nI’m not saying databricks is a bad platform. I’m just saying it’s not the right platform for me if I was CTO of my company. I just don’t see the value proposition over using all AWS products and choosing my own DBMS. \n\nI think databricks to me feels like what Apple is for smartphones and laptops. They try to make a suite of tools that integrate well to form a nice ecosystem of products, but it’s a walled garden that doesn’t give you full control over the product you are buying. \n\nOne last example: databricks provides a fully managed delta lake house and SQL engine to query the data. A Delta table is composed of a series of flat files (parquet or some other type of columnar format). But it doesn’t tell you where it stores the files. It abstracts that part from you. It’s silly because we know under the hood they are just storing it in a blob storage like azure blob storage. Why can’t I go to the place where the data files sit and use the blob storage interface to copy/paste, move, or download the files? \n\nIf I want a more performant Delta table I could just use AWS S3 and query results via duckdb or some other data processing API that works with delta and iceberg tables.",

Modeling will make you ship faster with AI-assisted coding. It's also important for certain hyped features such as text-to-SQL. Unless the LLM bubbles burst (meaning it would be prohibitively expensive to use), LLMs will be come one of the main data (model) consumers.\n\nAs for your question: do proper data models and then code with Cursor or Claude Code. It will be much faster than you hand writing transformation code.",

I think it takes me more time to write the explanation than simply write SQL for dbt, using the macro I developed. \n\n\nI use LLM to develop tooling around DBT, but still not for SQL nor modeling.

During that time, I learned about normalization and picked up a copy of Object-Oriented Data Warehouse Design, which shows how to create star/snowflake models.\n\nIn my next job, the SQL Server data warehouse replicated objects from the source environment, which relied on a hierarchical structure. This model has some interesting quirks which could require a lot of joins, which resulted in the creation of views to create an easier starting point as the base of the query, and in function was similar to OBT. There were also several instances where I created an operational data mart, just like Inmon's approach. I also worked on other projects, several of which required their own database models. One was a questionnaire, so I had to learn how to create a hybrid relational/object-oriented model to capture the various types of questions and responses.\n\nI guess I was fortunate enough to land in the right places at the right moment where I could build and grow the systems I was hired to support.",

          "text": "Think of data stores being in 3 separate categories:\n\n1. Traditional SQL databases (RDBMS) - MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, etc.\n2. NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J, etc.\n3. Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.\n\nThey all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).\n\nNoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.\n\nWarehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

Gut feel is probably in the realm of like 50-100 tables and like 20-50 pipelines. Idk, kinda depends on the tables and the team.\n\n\n\nBut then it switches back to Lakehouse being more efficient because these cloud warehouses become so expensive at large scale.

          "text": "I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  \n\nFirst, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.\n\nSecond, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.\n\nLastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

What's the practical difference over pandas 1 in pandas 3.0? Is the performance boosts anything major? I work with large dfs often 20m+ and have lot of ram. 256gb+. \n\nAlso, on another note I have never used polars. Is it good and just better than pandas even with pandas 3.0. and can handle most of what pandas does? So maybe instead of going from pandas 1 to pandas 3 I can just jump straight to polars? \n\nI read somewhere it has worse gis support. I do work with geopandas often. Not sure if it's gonna be a problem. Let me know what you guys think. thanks.",

          "text": "So first answer:\n\nFrom pandas 2.0 onwards a lot of change was made to move from numpy into arrow, so you cant just use np.nans as pandas nans now, its pd.NA. Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

There is so much more I could do would have wanted to do. Heck I have just been in one domain also.\n\nMy company lately have been asking us to prepare datasets to feed to agentic AI. While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.\n\nThere are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)\n\nSince it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%.  \nI have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.\n\nIs there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?\n\nThere is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.\n\nAnd last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.\n\nThere is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.\n\nWhat's the motivation to still pursue this field ? I love anything related to data to be honest and for me that is the only one. I love eat and breathe data even if I am jobless now because of AI first policy my company has taken.",

You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic\n* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat\n* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.\n* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)\n* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older\n* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD\n* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers\n* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT\n\nLife as a DE:\n\n* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled\n* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree\n* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable\n* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE\n* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)\n* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl\n* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry\n\nSo what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

I mean, imo there's always going to be stuff ai can't do, at least without an informed human nudging it in the right direction and keeping an eye on the outputs at some point? And we don't even know what *new* data work is going to be opened up/made necessary by ai at this point either really. If you enjoy the work and you're good at figuring new stuff out I'd say there's no need to jump ship to full-time goose husbandry just yet, trust yourself and your abilities and keep following your nose about what's useful/interesting to learn and work on. Yeah a lot of the straightforward stuff can be handled by an agentic approach, but in my experience there's always going to be weird new stuff cropping up and that often needs a meat-based neural net aka a human to figure out 😜",

Performance thinking\\*\\*: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT \\*, think about index usage.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Data quality patterns\\*\\*: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW\\_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Incremental processing\\*\\*: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads - using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*4. Set-based thinking\\*\\*: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*5. Real-world scenarios\\*\\*: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\n\n\\- Detecting duplicate orders\n\n\\- Calculating running totals/moving averages  \n\n\\- Handling NULL values and edge cases\n\n\\- Transforming nested/JSON data\n\n\n\nFor Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"\n\n\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am facing a career dilemma and would love some insights, especially from those who have transitioned from Consulting to an Internal Role (End Client).\n\nMy Profile:\n\n•\tCurrent Role: Data Analyst / BI Consultant.\n\n•\tExperience: 5 years (mainly Power BI, SQL, some Python).\n\n•\tCurrent Situation: Working for a Consulting Firm (ESN) in a major French city. My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.\n\n•\tThe Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.\n\nThe Offer (Internal Role):\n\nI have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).\n\n•\tTitle: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).\n\n•\tTech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.\n\n•\tThe “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.\n\n•\tVariable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.\n\nMy Plan / Strategy:\n\n1.\tTech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).\n\n2.\tDomain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.\n\nMy Questions for the community:\n\n1.\tDoes taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?\n\n3.\tHas anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

If you know this is the path you want to take, then you move on to deciding whether taking a 12.5% salary decrease is an acceptable tradeoff for stronger overall career alignment long-term. If it isn't worth it, then the other option is to start actively looking for other 'internal' roles - and of course accepting the risk that it might take you a while to find a role that maintains (or increases) your base salary.\n\nIMO 12.5% comp decrease is not that big a deal if it means aligning yourself to the type of career you want long-term. You'll make that up relatively quickly if you do well in your role.\n\n*EDIT: My perspective comes from US-based Big 4 consulting experience.

You've already been working with them, that is a massive savings for them in training and onboarding.\n\nI have taken lower pay for a more technical role but it was not like this, it truly was \"we're betting on you\" and honestly I wish I had pushed back on the pay more.\n\nThis sounds more lateral and you're embedded in their team, stack, language, etc.\n\nIt may be uncomfortable, but saying \"I am excited about this opportunity and ready to join the team, all we need to do is meet my current comp level,\" is respectful, and it frames things as the deal already being done, but one little change needing to be solidified. Divorce lawyers use that language to help move things over the line at the very end when people are stuck on one thing, like the dog. \n\nTry it. Then you'll be stoked to join, highly energized, and won't be thinking \"what if I didn't take that pay cut\".",
