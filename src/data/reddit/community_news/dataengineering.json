They clearly sold us the dream of saving millions, which so far doesn't look like it'll ever be the case. To do their dream stuff, we needed to provide a shit-load of data from all manners of business units in the company. Then this data gets normalized by them and fed in their \"tool\". The tool uses AI to find the \"things to optimize\". Now the department that paid for this crap is trying to pawn the maintenance off on us in IT. The company also doesn't provide help on how to normalize data to fit their tool, and guess who will probably also be in charge of doing it? So far, they have not found any significant savings and the ROI vs how much their cost (1+ million so far) will take years, if it ever pays back.\n\n  \nAs others have said, it's ok because our VPs can say we're AI enabled.",

I've noticed that they absolutely *fixate* on using a particular suite of products even if they're horrendous solutions to the actual problem. It's like they're trying to farm case studies for how good said suite of products is rather than use the best tool for the job.\n\nIn this case: Microsoft stuff. I've got a Synapse instance with a freakish set of pipelines and notebooks to make it function even somewhat like Databricks. This was a clean slate start from only a few years, so they could have chosen any product, but instead they chose to go all-in on Microsoft.\n\nInstead, this client company paid that consultancy tons of money to custom build janky code on an old platform when they could have saved so much time and money by just using tools made for the job. Now they're digging deeper trying to make this weird stuff work. But hey, at least you got a cool PowerPoint with a bunch of tech product logos with arrows pointing between them (and no description about how said diagram represents an actual solution to the problems at hand).\n\nRabble rabble rabble..",

Notebooks *usually* don't have that in practice.  But you can do VC, CI/CD, and testing with notebooks.  If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.\n\n\nSome more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

A PySpark Notebook put into GIT has a bunch of comment lines that are used to parse where a cell begins/ends, magics, different cell languages, etc. ~~BUT, the actual thing in the platform backend is almost surely not a simple \\`.py\\` file, it is something more complex (i.e. \\`.ipynb\\` which is just JSON underneath) as it stores cell outputs, metadata, and other things which are not parsed into a \\`.py\\` file when the object is sync'd to GIT.~~ *Edited for those that can't see the forest through the trees:* this might have changed in DBX but this ultimately doesn't matter to my point that what is deployed to prod at the end of the day is a Notebook experience that comes with Notebook risks. Sure you can mitigate most of the risk with tests (and maybe CI validation to block usage of MAGICS that are untestable) and tight governance on your prod env, but it's still awkward.\n\nSo why does this matter? From a development perspective (and almost surely from a backend storage perspective) it is a Notebook by all measures. This matters as you can arbitrarily decide to use Scala or SparkSQL cells in your Notebook where PySpark is the default language, and when parsed into a \\`.py\\` file, none of those non-default language cells can be tested, type checked, linted, etc.. they show as commented out lines of code with a header that tells the platform's parser to interpret it as a specific language.\n\nSure, you could require your devs to not use multiple languages in a single Notebook and use an awkward process to ensure test coverage (awkward because you can't really start with local development, you'd have to do cloud>local>write tests and repeat, but even then you are still shipping into production something that comes with a built in IDE. At that point, only proper governance and access control can save you from a \"well it's super easy so I just directly applied the change in production\" scenario.",

I prefer not to show the code to them, especially if it's in notebooks, and especially now with all this GenAI stuff. It's because notebooks make the code look simple to non technical folks. It's due to the cell layout, I believe, that they get the feeling it's basically not much more than excel formulas, while in reality, there's a huge clusterfuck of moving parts underneath. \n\nAnd there's always this one manager that half assed a Python for DE course on Udemy and \"wants to help\". Of course, we end up losing our precious time by going over their slop because we can't just tell them to fuck off and do their job and we'll do ours. \n\nCode explainability (to stakeholders) should not be a thing, ideally. Basically, development experience beats the explainability argument all day long.",

      "text": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. \n\nOnsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership \n\nThe recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. \n\nThis new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve  met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. \n\nSystem Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.\n\nData Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. \n\nBusiness Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approaches\n\nLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. \n\nQuestions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.\n\nNext day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. \n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone has. ",

Then I suggested YAML. Then he wanted to know how in YAML will I explicitly write for each source . Which IDID! Wrote a pseudo script. Then I moved to design again. He asked multiple questions about each component. Semantic layer was something I couldn’t answer well. I have no idea where thing went wrong , which interview",

In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

Then when you do use AI it can give you wrong answers so hopefully you look at the code that you are putting in. \n\nSo for me AI does not benefit DE and is only to shorten deadlines and put pressure to preform, thus forcing you to use it just to keep up.",

There was a small period in time, and maybe it's still true, where it was just throw XGBOOST at it and go sip your coffee, and thats what a lot of folk were doing. But that does a disservice to a lot of the actual data scientists out there doing the maths and actually understanding inputs and outputs.\n\nI guess I ranted a bit there, the short story long is, yes, that is common, and I typically avoid it if I can.

They're incredibly risk-averse by nature, so there are tons of lifers here.\n\nI'm a mid-level/senior-ish DE at a F500 insurer these days, after I spent time in higher education, B4 consulting, and then built the data team at a PE-backed startup in the healthcare sector. I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

Granted, that may have taken a hit after the layoffs, but I presume it'll come back pretty well.\n\nYou're not wrong abou the archaic tech stacks, though. USAA was still using Hadoop broadly in 2023 and my current firm is entirely on SQL Server/SSIS. Our \"new technology\" that we're integrating in 2025-2026 is Python.\n\nThat just adds to the stability, though.

These are great moments to get hired.\n\nIn my experience, these companies often pay above average and offer a lot of learning opportunities.

My dude, you’re running analytical queries against an OLTP Postgres database and are surprised this is slow? He’s made it increasingly clear that he doesn’t see the value in a data engineer so at this point I’m just doing support functions until I can find somewhere that actually values a data engineer.",

                  "text": "Preface here - this got waaaayyy longer than I thought. Don’t take the “you” defensively below. \n\nI would encourage a little thought experiment here. Initially, take yourself out of the picture. Look at your job description (what you were hired to do). Look for value statements in there (find insights, reduce costs, improve productivity, etc.). This helps quantify “value.” Then look a little broader (Reddit is a good start) - where do data engineers add value. Look at other job descriptions. Once you have a good understanding of where data engineers add value to an organization, that’s your sales pitch to you boss. “I am here to enable our sales and marketing teams to increase revenue by improving the breadth, depth, and quality of data available for our business analysts to use.” Don’t bring that yet. \n\nNext - if someone is questioning the value you bring,  they either don’t have a good understanding of the first part of the exercise, which can happen. That can be solved with a bit of education and managing upward. It may also be your lead is asking on behalf of another person in the organization.\n\nThe other part is that they know what your value should be but does not observe the company getting it (expectations not being met). That could be interpreted as “you don’t know why you’re here and look lost,” “you’re lazy,” “you’re working hard but on the wrong things,” or “you used to engage hard with other people but now you don’t, what’s wrong?” Or, I have seen this occasionally- “Can we replace you with an LLM toolset?”\n\nKeep peeling back the onion here - do a “5 Whys” down various paths. If you do this honestly I think you will find some observations about your role and the organization that are things you can learn from (or put into consideration for your next role). \n\nFor example: “I believe that the value a data engineer, and my role/job description, brings to an organization is X, Y, and Z. I cannot achieve the value that I believe my role as a data engineer should bring because the organization does not have a policy or incentive to put more diverse and higher quality data sets to the Business Intelligence Suite. I don’t have the political acumen or appropriate authorities to drive a change at this level. I could use my 4-6 hours of downtime per day integrating with specific teams for a few weeks at a time. I would need support from leadership to do this because historically, teams are highly siloed and resist me working with them. Here is a plan, a timeline, and here is a specific outcome I hope to achieve.” \n\nThat is a level of maturity that I, as a leader, would respect. Be careful of assigning any blame - you need to talk about impediments to your ability to deliver value. \n\nAs a manager, if one of my employees only “worked two hours a day” and was getting salary, that’s a red flag worth looking into. I like my developers and engineers to have a backlog of work - we currently have several months work per person - and I like to see them showing 6 hours of real good “productivity” each day. I assume that the other two hours are emails, conversations, helping others out - still value add, but it’s the grease in the cogs of the machine.\n\nI would be looking at that 4 hour gap. You said their data and pipelines are garbage despite having a tool. Is the tool hard to use? Do they know how to use it effectively? Are they required to use it? Are they required but don’t see a value/return on investment so they half-ass it?\n\nIf they all use the tool, and the data is great, does that translate into more work for you? Less? Think of an ideal end state. Everyone uses it. The data is fantastic. Sales go up 200%. There is a parade in your honor. What does the job look like then? \n\nAlternatively, you may have already checked out mentally from this job and are just cruising to collect a pay check. Personally I would do the introspection and 5 Whys exercise and see if there’s a path to being engaged again at this job because you want to avoid the same conditions in the future. Some places hired a bunch of “NEW ROLES” for fear of missing out on industry trends with no idea what to actually do with them long term. Or they do know and you’re not delivering (for any number of reasons).\n\nAlso, be aware that, in my observations, the job market is starting to tighten. If you do plan to move companies, can you use your 4-6 hours of downtime per day training on new tools?",

My manager got pressure from his superiors, he came back yelling it us like it why we don’t have a dashboard showing all the critical alerts failing and I was like, the alerts are not even in place. Teams are not using the tool even that you asked them to use it and reach out to us for help.. we need ownership and someone telling them constantly to do it, I tried.",

Left that company after the dust settled and got started in IT at another company.\n\nDid very well in IT for a few years, then was an awful data analyst for a couple years.  But while being terrible at analytics, I did convince IT to spin me up a couple VM servers and I built my own end-to-end orchestration in Python because I hated spending 2 days a week updating dashboards.\n\nThe system I built ended up running all the analyst's updates so they could focus on customers more.\n\n(To anyone thinking of all the things wrong with that, yes I know.  We all knew, which is why it was temporary.  Sometimes you have to pick up a machete and force a path forward.  It worked and I'm retiring those VM shitballs as soon as I can.  I wrote the systems myself and will be the first to say let's burn it all in fire.)\n\nTwo years later we got a director who agreed with me that we need a proper data warehouse.  Surprise surprise, it's amazing and everyone else now realizes it's not as scary as they thought.\n\nEducation - I've got a BS in IT and always strive to follow best practices with coding, governance etc.  I'm not just saying that.

Supposedly the IT profesionsals handling data in the past were too expensive, slow and asking many annoying questions.\n\nThe bussines needed shipping their crappy dahsboards and reports in high frequency. So they gained more and more permissions to achieve just that and do their own crappy tranformations regardless of any modelling aor achitecture.\n\nSurprisingly eventually they are swamped in spaghetti code and tech debt. Eventually the called data analysts has to maintain that crucial report by himself 24/7 and becomes a single dashboard person.\n\nAlso the bussines needs more talking and show off people. And they can´t waste their time with SQL.\n\nAnd so the analytics engineer is born. It´s a developer outside of IT, to do the slave work, but not cool enough to run around with piecharts.\n\nHe does it for the bussines salary , and not the IT professional salary - thats your main identifier, how you will know if you are an IT professional, or a data analytics bozo.\n\n  \nAs for me, since the company started to move to the cloud, I´m fully on data engineering - meaning moving data reliably between systems, in this case from legacy to the cloud. I´m damn gonna make sure to go nowhere near a metric or piechart. Anyway we used to do that too, but freedom was given to the data analysts, to do that.\n\n",

              "text": "I agree. Expanding more on job leveling processes from an employer perspective.\n\nCompanies look for comparison to other companies to determine what to price their roles at. This is done through compensation surveys with data generally collected each June-July, and results published around November. This is an imperfect process as every company calls roles slightly different so an analyst goes through and tries to match the roles reasonably to a generalized guide of what other companies call this role. Part of this process is it is helpful to level how senior the duties of that role is. Usually this is done with Pay Grades. Because the companies that collect analyze and prepare the compensation surveys are broadly known, their Pay Grades are most often what companies are internally calling their pay grades.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is one of the common surveys. They provide a leveling guide with description of what is generally differences between levels of seniority for professionals. Data engineer is generally going to fall under the Professional (P) classification in the WTW system. Most data engineers would be a P2, and senior a P3. Entry level may be P1. The P4 and P5 is much more rare, usually a professional individual contributor with 20 or 30 years experience, much less common. P3 tends to be the catch all for senior.\n\nA crude difference is that a data engineer can work through core business tasks but generally needs a more senior team member for guidance and some supervision. They can follow processes and best practices. At the senior level they can work more independently thinking through novel challenges that come up, they can create the processes and best practices and serve as a resource for more junior associates when novel challenges come up outside the usual experiences.\n\nA listing of descriptions of the different Professional pay grades can be read here.\n\nhttps://itv.career-navigator.willistowerswatson.com/career-bands/definition/professional?level=P2\n\nThere are other adjustments usually tech roles receive a compensation premium in compensation surveys. They'll denote things like a \"P3 - P\" the - P denoting a tech role premium that may be a flat 15% - 20% over compensation benchmarks depending on the companies policies. With rare skills as is common in tech roles often comp surveys are less useful and they'll perform specialized analysis for compensation plans for these.\n\nNot speaking exhaustively how work gets done but enough to get a sense for the flow of why pay grades exist and a primary source you can familiarize with that are used by companies. There also exist pay grades of other career levels, M is management, senior management are E's, business admin are B's.",

The maintenance is very important because long term that is where most costs are generated. This is why lots of senior devs are a bit sceptical about ai and the maintenance costs it will generate.\n\nSo to answer your question: make sure you are exposed to all aspects of a project lifecycle, not just greenfield nice solutions where you have free hands. Also spend time with mid career seasoned guys and listen to them rant.",

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions. It’s more about the patterns one has seen in real scenario's and one’s temperament - that’s hard to train for.",

It’s not rocket science. \n\nIf your data environment is relatively fixed I would agree there is almost no point. \n\nBut if you’re in the business of having to extract data from dozens of systems, then it’s a matter of “do I pay my engineers to keep the lights on at making sure our data extraction jobs are always running, up to date, and can manage various versions of source systems, or do I simply outsource that part of the value chain and focus on actually making the data usable? \n\nIf you are a company that needs to focus on integrating data from say dozens of ERPs… maybe it’s worth it to let FiveTran expedite when a new ERP hits the market (or one you haven’t seen before). \n\nOr you’re setting up a brand new data infrastructure and your sponsors are breathing down your neck to integrate your new HR system. You can spend days/weeks working through building jobs to extract said data, or have it with FiveTran in minutes. \n\nBecause they typically price on monthly deltas volumes there’s kind of a middle tier where it makes sense as part of your tech stack. Too low and it’s too expensive, and if your data volumes are massive, again, too expensive. But if you’re in that sweet spot, it may be worth paying a vendor than paying an engineer to perform those tasks.",

          "text": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.\n\n—-\n\nSo back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!\n\nAs a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha).  \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

Then you look over at all your python ingestion flows (you never moved over) and see them reliably chugging along.",

If you understand that and refer to the Kimball modeling techniques and can actually internalize it that will get you most of the way there. \n\nIt’s not really something that is easy to explain in a video I don’t think.

      "text": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. \n\nEarlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...\n\nOn the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:\n\n>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.\n\nThe first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.\n\nThen I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.\n\nA huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:\n\n* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. \n* That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservation\n\nObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…\n\nThe other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.\n\nEarnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)\n\nPlease check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?\n\n",

AI is an option but then you're competing with new grads (do we even stand a chance? Does our background experience help?). I'm asking for more general answers but my background issue is essentially being a jr-mid level at 3-4 different positions, all at smaller companies and more of a startup environment. Platform/cloud (AWS) engineering, bi developer, data engineer and architect. I would be EXTREMELY valuable if this background was at larger companies. \n\nFrom what I can see this isn't valuable unless you're senior/staff or a cloud architect level. They don't bring in jr/mid level and train them, at least not right now. ",

I think the value is in the modelling/semantic layer, governance, and being git native/BI as code. \n\nI've been through a migration from Tableau to Looker, as well as standing up and maintaining a self hosted Looker instance, both at AWS shops. Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.\n\nThe public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.\n\nQuicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today. There are just too many no contract/free options to create decent reports that would satisfy a startup for quite a while.",
