If you can do your job faster then let’s move up deadlines and if you can get push back it’s pretty much “well AI should make it faster”.\n\nThe other issue is that AI makes senior devs spend more time cleaning up the AI code that gets put into production and it robs junior devs of experience in debugging. \n\nFor me the only reason to use AI is that deadlines become unreasonable and that is in part of people overselling what AI can do. Then when you do use AI it can give you wrong answers so hopefully you look at the code that you are putting in. \n\nSo for me AI does not benefit DE and is only to shorten deadlines and put pressure to preform, thus forcing you to use it just to keep up.",

Now most teams never think about cluster management.\n- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)\n- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\nWhat stayed the same (unfortunately):\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\nWhat's genuinely better:\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

          "text": "One big change accomplished by making data engineering an explicit specialization is that we're now aware of data quality issues that were hidden, or which were just consequences of the data gathering methods prevalent before big data frameworks and methods became available for large scale aggragate mobilization. Automation amplifies problems as much as it amplifies solutions.  The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc.  AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Are we going to ship great new dbt features to our paying customers? Of course. But not by keeping important functionality out of dbt Core. The way to do it is to make sure dbt Core (and Fusion) have more powerful and better functionality and then build even better features on top.\n\nGrace and the rest of the Core team can talk about some of the things we've been cooking up there. And most importantly - we \\_always\\_ want to hear from you. What would you like to see in Core?",

And with Fusion this dbt-related metadata is getting *significantly* more advanced.\n\nWe do have a few integrations where we pull in metadata of downstream artifacts--tableau and powerbi--but certainly we are *nowhere near as comprehensive* as most pure-play catalogs. And that is ok.\n\nOur goal with Catalog is:\n\n* to provide a really amazing catalog experience that can be the ONLY catalog for small-to-medium companies.\n* to provide a really useful development tool for dbt authors at companies of all sizes\n* to provide a high-quality source of dbt metadata for companies of all sizes\n\nOver time, I fully imagine that we will continue to expand our capabilities here (as we have been!).

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

But you then delete said intermediate products presumably because they take up so much space that this saves you money.... And somehow the savings are worth rebuilding it from scratch every time?\n\nI have so many questions; this isn't making sense to me. Feels like either you're overoptimizing for cost when it's really not worth it or else doing something wrong when it comes to query optimization for the intermediate products to truly not be worth keeping around. Are your joins exploding? Is storage really so expensive that rebuilding these intermediates makes sense? Are you doing too much in your final query? Without more info it's hard to say for certain, but intermediate products aside I suspect something isn't as optimal about this scenario as you think.",

                  "text": "You’re making some incorrect assumptions here. We are on prem, this isn’t about saving cloud costs, it’s about us being somewhat low on storage and trying to minimize how much useless data is just sitting around. We are working on getting budget to expand, but that doesn’t happen immediately. I don’t understand what you mean about doing something wrong with optimization for them to not be worth keeping around. These are models that are run on a daily/weekly/monthly cadence. The previous versions of the intermediate models are useless for the next run. They either cover a completely different date range, and even if there is overlap, we have a decent amount of updates/deletes against old records so we’d want to rerun with the newest versions of the records anyways. And no, our joins aren’t exploding, I’ve actually done a huge amount of work creating optimization guidelines for our models, and will go in to fine tune when needed. Since we are on prem, we aren’t paying for aggregate compute usage. We have a set amount of compute and memory that is always available at any moment. If we just ran one model at a time, we would be massively underutilizing our compute. To make the most out of our compute, we run multiple models at once. But since we aren’t just running one model, we have to set memory limits on all models, by dividing our available memory by the number of concurrent models we run, to ensure we don’t have memory related failures. Also as I mentioned, there are cases where breaking things out into an intermediate model can have massive performance improvements. Our query engine materializes CTE’s every time it is called. If you use the same CTE in a query 5 times, it quintuples the memory and compute usage, versus just running it once into a table and then just referencing the table a few times. It all makes plenty of sense, you are just evaluating it from an invalid context.",

I share your view that DVC or Pachyderm or LakeFS, while great, feel like overkill. My brain has been somewhat sniped by the fact that Apache Iceberg tables have a concept of branching.

              "text": "There's a *ton* going on right now! In terms of priorities, here's how I'm thinking about it.  \n\n\n* First and always - ensure that dbt is a great way to do data work for organizations all across the world. You'd be surprised by how much nuance there is in keeping that up. Addressing bugs and community issues, adapters changes from the underlying databases and new releases for things like dbt-utils. I came to dbt from running a data team and more than anything else the question is how can we continue to be a trusted piece of the analytics stack for data teams across the world.\n* Beyond that, I think of the next set of priorities across three primary buckets - the dbt Fusion engine, AI and emerging standard.\n   1. The dbt Fusion engine is a big area of investment for us and we've seen that for projects that are able to successfully adopt, the rust based, strongly typed version of dbt brings a ton of improvements. Things like speed, improved developer experience and the sql comprehension features that power the VS code extension work great. And also - we've seen some challenges in complex projects getting migrated over to Fusion\n   2. AI - I've been obsessed with AI since way before I worked at dbt Labs (fun fact I was an r/futurology mod when it had less than 1000 users). I really believe that AI is going to radically reshape how we do data work - and giving dbt users the tools to do that *right* is very top of mind.\n   3. Emerging standards - Iceberg, arrow and more. We've been watching Iceberg for a few years and now we're starting to see real customers using Iceberg in production for cheaper / more flexible data ingestion, and to use dbt across multiple data platforms",

We're pretty happy with this. \n\n\nBut when we want/need to develope new/different model features, we really struggle with versioning. we only have one database: production. So end up duplicating the entire tree of tables with _version[] appended. The development is then done in the version suffixed tables until eventually it eventually becomes prod and the old tables/definitions are deleted. \n\n\nWhy is this bad?

              "text": "So dbt arose in popularity because of a very specific set of technological circumstances. Cloud data warehouses allowed you to load more data into yuor warehouse, but there wasn't a great way to manage this. Compute was cheap, storage was cheap, but getting useful, structured answers was challenging and difficult.  \n  \nThat technological paradigm isn't going anywhere, but it is going to be changed *a lot* by AI. Something that I'm thinking a lot about is how to make \"the dbt lifestyle\" remains relevant in the AI era.  \n  \nFor example, we saw an interesting article published [this week](https://substack.com/@groupby1/p-187428984) claiming that the \"Modern Data Stack\" worked great for humans, but there are other tools that will perform better for agents. I think it's important to take an honest look here - the experiment run in this wasn't very rigorous from what I can tell, but it might be pointing at something real.  \n  \nBut I really do believe we have an interesting role to play in the AI world. For example - last year we shipped the [dbt MCP server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-mcp) and we just released [dbt agent skills](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills) but the thing that's really exciting to me here is some testing we've been doing around how Fusion (because it's faster, has more metadata awareness and is more strongly typed) can be the best of both worlds- a great experience for human developers and powering agentic workloads.",

This is an area of dbt that we spend a lot of time thinking about, and one exciting feature we have recently shipped is [state-aware orchestration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-about). It lets you build and run based on what’s actually changed (using state comparison and deferral), which can make pipelines a lot more efficient, especially as your project grows. There are also some [advanced configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/state-aware-setup#advanced-configurations) that you can set up to customize at a more granular level and specify what actually gets run. This does require fusion. If you can share what you are looking for when scheduling jobs I'm happy to share some other functionality of the dbt orchestrator.",

Like we have Snowflake, and the Operator of Airflow doesn't show you the results of the query by default, and in Snowflake itself only the owner of the query can check the results for 24h only. So, I thought maybe with dbt I could log this, like for example when I do COPY INTOs be able to see if a file has failed, and other information that comes on that results table, but I suppose the best will be to find some free moment and test it myself.",

Which for me seems madness, and completely different than, if I'm not wrong, BQ, where anyone can see all the queries run, and that let you see/analyze any query and see what was processed, or didn't run as intended.\n\nFor copy into maybe the list of files, or be able to filter and only get the ones that failed to ingest, and trigger an alarm with it.\n\nAnother example could be when I run a MERGE on Snowsight (UI of Snowflake) it returns me the inserted and merged cols I think it is. I built some custom code to retrieve those values to sql variable and store them in a logging table. But it would be good if the tool has the functionality on its own. \n\nOr there is a query where I retrieve the max date of the ingested data, store it in a sql variable, and use it later. From what @dbt-grace said, I would be able to use [log jinja functions](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/log) to print those to the log, that way if we have a problem in the future I will be able to see which data we processed.",

There's another episode due out soon where Tristan and I discuss the future of Iceberg.  \n  \nIceberg brings you the flexibility around where your data is stored and what compute you pick, but it adds complexity in having to manage an iceberg catalog. There are a few iceberg catalogs out there but many of them support “part” of the iceberg spec, and finding who supports what is not super easy.  \n  \nIf you are all-in on a data platform and won’t need cross data warehouse compute my take is that Iceberg would not be worth the effort today.\n\nHowever my prevailing opinion is that the Iceberg project is to data what standard-sized ship containers do for global trade. It's not necessarily \"exciting\" per se, but it has undeniable impacts on end users in that it's easier to get your ~~goods~~ data from point A to point B",

This is the area of our product I think about all day, so I’m both sorry to hear that you feel a sense of abandonment and very open to feedback on how my team can revive your confidence that we remain dedicated to both dbt core and the open source community.  \n  \nI am proud of our two big releases of dbt Core last year (`v1.10` and `v1.11`) that included some features I’ve personally been wanting to bring to life for a longtime now ([sample mode](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sample-flag) and [user-defined functions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/udfs), to name two). And, we’ve added even more codebases to the “open source” bucket - we just re-licensed [metricflow under Apache 2](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/open-source-metricflow-governed-metrics), and Fusion includes some [net-new Apache 2 code](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine).  \n  \nIn case you missed it, we also put out a [roadmap update in December](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-12-magic-to-do.md) in the dbt-core repo! I’d encourage you to give it and read, and let me know your thoughts.\n\nWhen I have heard this type of sentiment from other community members, it’s often coming from a feeling of frustration that we haven’t been as responsive to issues and pull requests in our open source repos over the past year. I feel that frustration as well and am working hard to get us back on track! Candidly, our team has been split across two focuses this past year: helping to build the new dbt Fusion engine and evolving the dbt framework across both Core and Fusion. I’m very excited to be onboarding a lot of new team members to dbt Core (this month!) to revitalize our activity in our open source repos and continue to execute on the dbt Core roadmap.",

I truly appreciate the work your team is doing on features like UDFs and Sample Mode.\n\nHowever, I want to be candid: many of us have seen this pattern in the industry before, and we’ve experienced it with dbt Labs specifically. It was the same with the MetricFlow server. While the logic was open, the essential infrastructure to run it effectively was kept behind a paywall.\n\nThis creates a sense that dbt Core is effectively being placed in maintenance mode—receiving incremental updates—while the 'real' future and performance leaps, like the Rust-based dbt Fusion engine, are gated under the ELv2 license.\n\nTo a developer, it feels like dbt Core is the 'bait' to get us into the ecosystem, but the 'magic' that makes the tool 2026-ready is no longer truly open. If the most transformative innovations continue to happen outside of the Apache 2.0 scope, it’s hard to feel that dbt Core remains a first-class citizen rather than just a legacy entry point for dbt Cloud.",

Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.\n\nThe public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.\n\nQuicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today. There are just too many no contract/free options to create decent reports that would satisfy a startup for quite a while.",

          "text": "When you say the AI team is piggybacking on your work, that would sound like you’re doing some data engineering in order to feed their models/LLMs, but if that’s not the case- then how does that situation look?\n\nHow do these ad-hoc dashboards look? Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.\n\nIf you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.\n\nYou mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.\n\nMaybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",

Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust. So I'm thinking I'm pretty much on the way out as the company is planning to buy software that makes what I'm doing irrelevant (Has its own data warehouse, it's own way of loading data, etc).\n\nOur company is currently all on prem for work, so a big shared drive is our datalake, sql server is our database, and the best I've been able to do to improve/modernize things was to introduce Prefect for our orchestration, make my own libraries in python to make loading data easier, show the usages of PowerBI and Tableau and create a data warehouse that did what the company wanted to do, but now has decided was a waste of time.\n\nI've started go through the AWS Data Engineering Exam and Snowflake exams, and I have projects on Github that show the use of Amazon S3, Athena, and Glue, so I can at least point to those and say I have cloud experience that I've set up myself. I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

People who are doing fine are not posting there. People who are anxious, venting or desperate are. So you're dealing with some serious sampling bias. If you value your mental health I see no point visiting that subreddit.\n\nWith that said - yeah. We are a dime a dozen. So are most people working in the more-or-less modern and commercially relevant branches of software engineering. We are not special, neither are react/node devs, neither are ios/android mobile devs, neither are infra/devops, neither are (run-of-the-mill) data scientists, etc. The non-dime-a-dozen people are those that work in more niche technologies, like dedicated graph DB engineers, or SAP stack devs or maybe these few guys that some US state government urgently hired in 2020 because they knew FORTRAN. \n\nIt's not obvious to me that one is better than the other. If you're niche, you probably have one or two employers that really need your services, but once they finally retire the legacy application they had that required you - you're in a bad position, because you're probably not finding another job. If you're a dime a dozen - you face a lot of competition, but it would be relatively easier to find something new if you lose your job. (This is of course ignoring how good you are - of course there's always many beginners and few extremely knowledgeable people, but that is true with any technology.)\n\nAlso, just a small remark, I'm not sure it is informative to say \"does a lot of SQL\". SQL is a language that has broad support across different databases and data processing engines, it's one thing to be doing a lot of SQL on a huge on-prem Postgres cluster, another to be doing a lot of SQL on a managed platform like Snowflake.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

They had no mechanism to retain historical data for SCDs so there was no historical accuracy. They had created like 6 surviving OBT tables after 3 years and they spent all of their time fixing constant bugs. The data analysts had created a shadow data warehouse that actually ran 95% of the reports.\n\nSo, in my first 6 months I learned about the company and processes and pushed for better practices: git, OLAP database (Snowflake), and proper modeling. I produced 4 datasets that were correctly modeled. I also optimized the daily runtime of the warehouse from 3 hours to 1 hour, and reduced a weekly pipeline from 10 hours to 1 minute, so I built a lot of cred as an expert.\n\nSecond year the company was ready and budgeted for a migration to Snowflake and git. The team was doing PRs and I was setting the standards for code reviews. We set up the platform with basic tooling to deploy, ingest, and transform data, including CDC and SCDs. I introduced some project management frameworks to my manager as well.\n\nThis year I’m hammering on modeling and tooling. I have shown them the value of conformed dimensions and I do the data modeling. I basically mandated no more unmodeled data and no more shadow warehouse moving forward. We also have big capability gaps between ingestion, transformation, automated testing (unit/data quality), orchestration, and more. I’ve put together a roadmap to address these for this year.",

Most engineers see tableau as a \"busy tool\" and prefer things like metabase etc for this reason",

I think moving onto the hard questions is good, if you've already done the easy/medium problems. You can always re-visit the Mediums again, and try to speed through them, after going through a few dozen hard problems. You just might be surprised how much faster you can go, after practicing on harder problems, and getting better at pattern recognition. \n\nBesides DataLemur, I think having a proper project to talk about is also super important for Data Engineering interviews. Hopefully, this can be sourced from a past internship – but if not, go make a real portfolio project that's end-to-end, deployed (with a live link), that's also key-word rich (so use AWS, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Python, etc.).

We might define a relationship that says \"A sibling is defined as someone who shares the same parents.\" The ontology can then (given enough input data) infer these additional relationships logically, even though they've not been expressly provided by the data.",

      "text": "I was running some tests on OneLake the other day and I noticed that its performance is 20-30% worse than ADLS. \n\nThey have these 2 weird APIs under the hood: Redirect and Proxy. Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I guess they finally stopped pushing it because it stayed off, but for a good 2 years, it was a battle to keep OneDrive off an ms machine.\n\n>Yes, it’s the next lock in. That’s it.\n\nBingo. If you know AI, then you know these big tech companies want control of data. That's the real value and they know it. The big winners are going to be people/companies who \"get\" this early and choose the right platforms because if you get stuck on a platform that changes agreements after the fact, that could be a major ouch.",

We stare at operator trees and executor logs, guess at bottlenecks, then trial-and-error code changes that sometimes make it worse.\n\nOnce the job is running in production, the standard Spark UI is verbose and overwhelming, leaving us blind to real-time issues until it's too late.\n\nKey gaps frustrating us right now\n\n*  Default Spark UI hard to read with complex plans and no clear heat maps for slow stages.\n*  No automatic alerts on common perf killers like small files IO, data skew, or partition imbalances during runs.\n*  Debugging relies on manual log parsing and guesswork instead of actionable insights or code suggestions.\n*  No easy way to rank issues by impact (e.g., cost or runtime delta) across jobs or clusters. Team spends too much time firefighting instead of preventing repeats in future pipelines.\n\nSpark is our core engine but we're still debugging it like it's 2014. Anyone running large-scale Spark (Databricks, EMR, on-prem) solved this at scale without dedicated perf engineers?",

You could argue it's overkill in some cases, but being proactive about things like too many small files, being thoughtful about partitions and such can go a really long way.\n\nBut I agree that once you've seen a few bad jobs, you get better at finding the root causes more quickly, or maybe I should say less slowly.",

On the contrary, what i've noticed in my experience working for many years in this field, engineers are rushed to deliver and the people who are taking these arch decisions are also in a rush and juggling around multiple projects and they give us the best practice that they know of which may not always work in production. \n\nI've found, no matter how much we do, things will break at one point and that's the real opportunity to learn and optimize.   \n  \nHeck i used to think big tech is immune to this, remember times when google, chatgpt went down? or the Korian guy making this \"gangnam style\" video and breaking youtubes views pipeline?- all were learning opportunities and DE is same as such.

Integrate structured logging and metrics, for example SparkListener events, Ganglia, Prometheus, so you get live alerts for small files, skew, or memory spills. Use automated stage analysis to highlight the top N bottlenecks by runtime or cost impact. Combine that with CI tests for job profiles, so regressions get flagged before hitting prod. It is not magic, but layering metrics, alerts, and profiling drastically reduces the manual triage.",
