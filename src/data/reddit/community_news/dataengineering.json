Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

At least in my view:\n\n* Data Lakes started somewhere in 2017 providing two main features; streaming unstructured data into some storage easily, and storing a lot of data cheaply outside of a DWH.\n* Data Lakes were super popular in setups which were either spark native or pricey DWH setups (Databricks, Redshift). But in parallel DWH platforms with native separation of storage and compute started to emerge (Snowflake, BigQuery). \n* After some time with companies having massive data lakes, the need for a better file format/engine came around - and Hudi/Iceberg were born from the OSS community, and Delta from Databricks.\n* Somewhere in between people just started to misuse data lakes as data warehouses because it was cheap and easy to do, and allowed for poor planning. Also open table formats became the hot new tech.\n* Today - Snowflake entered the datalake business, Databricks are entering the datawarehouse business, and AWS/BigQuery lets you do anything. \n* For primarily streaming data, a data lake ingestion is still the best architectural concept.\n\nSo no we are in a situation where any platform allegedly allows you to implement whichever architecture you want, irrespective of the roots of the platform.\n\n* You run AWS? Datalake on S3+Iceberg/Hudi+Athena with Redshift as the DWH\n* You run Snowflake? Datalake on S3+Iceberg with Snowflake as the DWH\n* You run Databricks? Datalake on S3+Delta with Databricks Compute Engine and Postgres OLTP\n* You run GCP? BigQuery + GCS + Iceberg\n\nThis is now why data lakes are misused, because all the vendors wanted a slice of any architecture even if it didn't make sense for their product.",

Iceberg solves problems when you're size of Netflix.

In past companies owned their servers and data transfer and compute was free. It didn't matter if you fetched half of the tables completely every night and ran all through transformation layer since it didn't cost anything. Now that's bad practice because in cloud everything has a cost.\n\nBut that's the way it is and has been. That's what they pay us to do.\n\nEdit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)",

Maybe go watch their technical talk about that as it provides a great explanation for why databases by themselves are limited as well as why blob storage by itself is limited. Traditional databases are basically concurrency managers. They suck at storing any meaningful amount of data however. \n\nLakes, lakehouses are primarily about decoupling storage from compute. It serves two functions when you do this, decreasing cost and decoupling compute scaling. You can have multiple teams scale their own trino or spark or python instances to meet their requirements. \n\nTo the degree they correctly mock religious opposition to structured databases the flip side is just as true. Religious insistence on database engines built for the needs and tradeoffs mainly of the 1970s and 80s is just stupid. \n\nThere are things traditional databases are good at but even comparatively small amounts of data can quickly begin to choke them out. Additionally their scaling properties are complex as they can run into many separate limits that can force scale out or worse yet force a scale up leading to over provisioning. \n\nDatabases are also always hot. They are virtually incapable of handling read almost never data. And you can argue but if it’s almost never going to be read just thrown it away. But that’s not an argument for traditional databases it’s a limitation. \n\nYou are merely lost in the hype of the technology and don’t actually understand the technical tradeoffs being made. There is a ton of money chasing executives to build lakes because there are vendors with lakes to sell. Things built like this are almost always a mess. That not because of the tech but because of who is building it under what pressures. \n\nThat doesn’t make them a bad an idea. They are a specific tool in the toolbox that can handle a variety of issues that affect traditional systems. They especially are good at enabling self serve data analytics, and other such democratization efforts as the materialization of some absurd table for the vp’s personal use is much less likely to effect the rest of the system. \n\nThey also are very good at recording point in time snapshots of data that would be prohibitively expensive to maintain in most traditional databases which can be a critical enabler for challenging ML problems. \n\nThey go hand in hand with event sourcing systems that are recording a change feed of events rather than an absolute state. If your system doesn’t have this point in time requirement it’s easy to see why you would not appreciate the issues lakes set out to solve. \n\nThere are more use cases they shine at but merely because you already have an oltp database that you treat as a magic black box you don’t understand is no reason to dismiss lake technology you also don’t understand.",

Worse yet giving it to the homeless guy on the corner. It’s gonna go wrong.\n\nTraditional databases are like giving people specific prepackaged power plants already arranged correctly to harness the fissile material into something comparatively useful and mostly safe. \n\nI just tend to get irked by people who act as if these trades don’t exist. They exist and they can give massive boosts to people who know when and how to make use of them.",

Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

I have, perhaps, a 33% success-rate with AI in my day-to-day. it is super helpful with anything code-related (although it tends to over-compensate), however, I find it horrible at troubleshooting (it tends to just regurgitate things I have already tried) and design ( it just spews whatever I can already find on any website/blog)\n\nSo no, I disagree with you. Humans, currently, have elements that an AI doesn’t, and which isn’t just a matter of ‘#of neurons’.\nThe reward function is different. An AI doesn’t need to eat, drink or sleep, doesn’t need to impress a wife/parents/friends. It doesn’t have a social standing. And thus, it does not have the INSPIRATION or the DRIVE that drives novel and creative solution thinking.\nCase in point: the AI never challenges our underlying assumptions or design decisions. It doesn’t evaluate the current-scope challenge in the larger scope of our environment for future scalability. It doesn’t, and cannot, “read the room”, or understand the political environment that might make a sound technical decision impractical. It doesn’t understand the cultural elements of the organisation, technical debt, or key-person dependencies that are outside of the context of my query.\n\nI guess it could do all of this, given the proper programming and proper dat-. But I think you underestimate the amount of information a human processes during the course of a day.\nFor an AI to get that same information, you would need to have audio and video feeds from every coffee machine, hallway and canteen table., background information on every person etc.\n\nAll of the above is what YOU bring to the table, and is where you are needed to evaluate whatever the AI spews out in context. If you can’t show me that YOU have the fundamental knowledge to do that, then you are not interesting as a candidate. \n\nAnyone can operate an AI - not everyone can evaluate its output",

I.e. \" talked to a colleague about kubernetes at the water cooler\" => sufficient kubernetes ✅\n\n3. A recruiter parses 100th of CVs a day for matching the demand ... \" Ah experience im Kubernetes... Good fit. ✅\"\n\n4. Recruiter may or may not give the cover letter to an AI; if the cover letter and CV match the job description. Maybe some background checks. \n\n5. CV and cover letter get passed to the management. Management uses different AI.\n\n6. Management prepares interviews with AI-generated questions. Bases on the job description and maybe the real world idealistic work environment. \n\n7. Candidate prepares the interview with AI \n\n8. At the interview the company uses tracker and Ai for evaluating the candidate\n\n9. The candidate uses ai for answering the ai questions.\n\n10. Everyone has a bad feeling, feeling insecure, and no one speaks about it and accepts it as it is.\n\n\nThe issue is, people are giving what they are asked for. Even illusory skill/tech stacks. Everything seems fitting because AI is a helpful assistant and highly agreeable and \"knows\" things. \nNot using it will feel like a disadvantage. But your self-esteem, your personality, and your trust are fading.\n\n\nI'm convinced, that Ai is here to stay. And not using it will give a disadvantage.

          "text": "The ideas we can have are bounded by the information diet consumed.\n\nAI is useful as a tool to quickly find ideas we already know and build on them a bit. But AI is a liar. Because humans are liars. We often believe we know things when we are wrong and bias our answers based on what is believed as the socially correct answer. Intent or malice is not necessary for being wrong sometimes. And sometimes we know we are wrong but social pleasantries demand it.\n\nLeadership and those unusually influential people socially do not follow the herd. They are working from a broader set of parameters and step against that grain. When hiring for a role we're looking for a person with expertise in that space. A mix of parameters that if they predict in their domain will be accurate more often than the AI trained on the patterns of the not-experts in that domain.\n\nWith repetition we're going to have our information space conform to what the tools we're using puts out, as we're feeding patterns of data that trains that AI. That's going to form the Instagram effect where the look and the style of large clusters of people conform to a social average. This conversion will happen with AI flavors and if large enough a group will involve a social stickiness to those modes of thinking wrong or not with an emotional reaction enforcing the social blob that comes out of that.\n\nGoing back to basics of learning to think how to think is a useful counter balancing force to this. Carve out the portfolio of where you spend your attention in your information diet to have Plato and Aristotle reps in there. The foundational thinking patterns that blossomed eventually into scientific method. Those human stories in early writing covering ranges of human experience and emotion, detached from the AI blob. Can trim the influence the AI-instagram-effect will have and retain your expertise by continuing to have frameworks for thinking that differs from a social blob of consensus, because that is what expertise is when you're leading.\n\nWe can predict there will be those who spend all of their attention on the AI blob and that will be incredibly sticky. There will be continuation of algorithm-psychosis where groups of people are peering through a funhouse mirror view of reality due to a poor information diet.\n\nI agree navigating hiring through a novel social transformation is a strange time. Good news is that we have pattern recognition from history of similar times and can make some predictions on how that plays out. E.g. introduction of coin for the first time transformed the nature of human connection to neighbors, with transition to purpose in life and spiritual story telling on why we're here. Industrial revolution is one we're still not done working through, transitioning from social story telling oriented on an agriculture lifestyle when we have become urban things with material abundance. And then information abundance with the internet added on top of that. And then an accelerant of even more information abundance faster from AI tools. Going back to the slower velocity data when writing was backed for long stretches of deep thought is a good balance to slow down that information is moving too fast.",

      "text": "Keen for any thoughts or feedback.\n\nBackground - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.\n\nChallenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’\n\nI’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.\n\nTLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.\n\nYou can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.\n\nUltimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.\n\nIf your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.\n\nI say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.\n\nIf you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out.  They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.\n\nThe safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust.  Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished.  It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits.

Far more common than you might think.\n\nThe core problem is your executive leadership has lost confidence in the existing technical organisation and is under pressure to show transformation, likely driven by AI anxiety. They don’t want to hear that the real answer is hiring more operational people. The new CTO’s mission is to shake things up, and you’re perceived as part of the legacy problem. That’s why you’re being sidelined — you’re a threat to the new charter.\n\nWhat comes next? New vendor commitments (to GCP in this case), new hires and contractors (many coming from his personal network) all unfolding rapidly and without involving you. You’ll find yourself outside more and more decisions that you perceive as falling squarely within your domain and hearing of shifts that undermine you second and third hand.\n\nYou have three options.\n\nGet on the bus. Recognise this is a relationship problem between you and the new CTO and invest in aligning yourself with his agenda. This requires swallowing some pride but keeps you relevant and inside the tent. You have to be willing to give everything up. But you may find there is a lot of opportunity to learn new things. You don’t know it all.\n\nRide it out. The CTO will succeed or fail, but it will take 12-18 months to know which. If you choose this path, lay low. Don’t initiate actions that accelerate your own marginalisation — including writing that document you mentioned without being asked for it. And be clear-eyed about what failure actually looks like: it won’t revert to how things were. It will be a Pyrrhic victory. You’ll be in a new fractured world that is in many ways harder to operate within and the core problem with executive leadership will still be there. Your reputation will never return to what it was within the organization.\n\nGet off the bus. If getting on the bus isn’t something you can do with integrity, this is probably your best option. Leave on your own terms, with your reputation intact, before the situation inflicts more damage on your motivation and self worth.",

Always a steamroll, gcp is the answer sorry what is the question, sure yeah we can do that in bigquery we don't need to know how we're doing that at the moment type situation. Really weird phenomenon - i don't know if they're told to ignore whatever their own org says or what, but it's a colonisation, at least here in the UK. My advice would be to ignore that cto and socialise everything you've done, built and exists directly with his own reports to build consensus and get them to ask him questions around what his plan is for replacing what you've built, which require more of an answer than 'gcp can do that, sorry what's that, oh yeah sure'. He's a lost cause and actively working against you now, and this is what you'll have to do, basically quietly explaining said situation to anyone else you can find there that actually cares. I guarantee you that CTO will move on within 6 months of the gcp contract being signed, and you will find people that give a shit about that, but you have to look.\n\nIf you want to do it properly, actually take some time to play with the google tools and do some research to identify concrete points of failure/uncertainty, so that you can use them to lead those discussions. Alternatively, if GCP is actually a good fit, which it might be, you'll end up upskilling and demonstrating genuine concern for the organisation, which can secure you a position as the leading expert on that platform as soon as he does leave (effectively capitalising on a lot of the effort you've  put in so far).

It was like having an ELETL flow!\n\nAnd when someone else here mentioned DAs getting BA work, I also noticed I'm having that situation crop up as well.  So I'd definitely say the boundaries are very murky.",

Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant 😂\n\nBut my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data.

I still keep a DE role part of the time, but it's almost 100% AI agent driven set-and-forget kinda stuff now, for your typical non-global-scale startup or mid sized company, and it wouldn't be unfeasible for me to fully automate it into a strictly supervisory role if I invested the time and energy.\n\nAlso, as a pure DE, I felt no job satisfaction at all as my end users were always internal and companies largely pretend you don't exist until something is broken, then it's your fault. It's a nice feeling to ship features real field customers will use at scale. Whatever beautiful infrastructure or pipelines you build, the consuming analyst or DS will always get the glory/satisfaction of the discovery. There was also always a sense of being a \"fake software engineer\" whose \"code\" is mostly configs and baby scripts for various tools.

My manager has the title but zero technical involvement.\n\nThe highlight reel:\n\n\\- Presented a migration to the CTO that saves six figures annually. Built the entire business case, ran the pilot, did the presentation. Manager sat in the room and said nothing. CTO: \"amazing job.\"\n\n\\- I run two vendor negotiations. Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \\~$20K/year tool well within his budget. He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\n\n\\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days. When I nudged him on a CTO-visible thread, he pulled me aside and made it clear he didn't appreciate being called out in front of leadership. The tone was... not great.\n\n\\- His weekly updates to leadership? Written by us. He copy-pastes our summaries.\n\n\\- Forgot to process my contractually agreed bonus. Twice. I had to escalate to the CTO myself.\n\nThe CTO sees my work directly and responds well. I want to have a title + comp conversation, but here's the dilemma: that conversation should technically go through my manager. The same manager who \\*\\*forgot\\*\\* my bonus twice, blocks vendor decisions, and copy-pastes my summaries. Going to the CTO directly feels like the only path that leads anywhere, but I know it's politically risky.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Anyone navigated a title conversation that should go through your manager but realistically can't? How did you handle it?\n\n2. If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?\n\n3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?\n\n4. If the conversation doesn't land, how fast did you leave?\n\nNot trying to destroy the guy. He's not evil, just ... very ineffective and knows the corporate playbook.

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. \n\nI would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. \n\nI’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. \n\nIf you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

Please note that I have zero responsibility to any result, good or bad, if you follow my recommendations.\n\n  \nBTW this recommendation assumes that what you said is true, and you should be able to find a new employment without too much trouble AND without your manager's recommendation. You know, market is tough.\n\n\n\nIf you have a good relationship with the CTO, mention it to him during a private chat. Ask him advice how to talk to your manager, to guide you as you are an \"inexperienced young man\", and follow with an email to your manager immediately, without mentioning that this comes from the CTO. This is just to show that you respect the chain of command, not that you expect anything to happen.\n\nIf you don't have a good relationship with the CTO (i.e. aside from nudging him about your bonuses, you never talk to him privately), email him and ask for advice, and obviously such an email does not go through your manager as it is just for advice.\n\nWait for 2 weeks. Collect all evidences. Hint to your friend in the team if you trust them, or at least probe around. See if you can make your manage make some small mistakes along the way -- but this is just bonus and 2 weeks is too short. Draft up a plan what you plan to do if you are the manager of your team. Make sure to suck the CTO's ass by mentioning the things that he personally cares about, but in a un-suck-your-ass way. Also make sure to acknowledge that you have good relationships with the leaders of the parallel teams (analytic, DS, etc.). I hope you do. In the meantime also aggressively find interviews -- it's also a bonus, not a must, although you should start this a long time ago.\n\nAfter 2 weeks send another email to your manager, and cc CTO and HR, that you respect your manager's decisions, and you respect his capability, but you have different mindset, so you are leaving in 2 weeks. It is very sad that you have to leave before the IPO happens, but you are sure that said manager can take over the job immediately, given his capacity.\n\nWait for 24 hours (or if your CTO replies). If your CTO replies \"Thank you and good luck\", this is probably not going to work and you should leave anyway. If your CTO doesn't say anything or he asks you to reconsider, whether out of polite or out of real concern, go straight to him, in person, and offer your coup-d'etat plan, the draft you wrote a couple of weeks ago. Ask for 80% of his pay, and 80% of his stock options, and of course his firing.",

          "text": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",

Tiny improvements build trust fast.\n\nAnd write down everything you learn. Backfills, gotchas, who owns what, and how to sanity check outputs.

It makes all your technical work way more valuable and helps you prioritize.\n\nRead the existing pipelines like you’re a detective. Trace one important data set from source to final table/dashboard. Take notes. Build yourself a little internal wiki or scratch doc with “this table is used for X, comes from Y.”\n\nGet very comfortable with SQL and debugging. Learn to quickly answer “why is this number wrong?” That’s 70% of the job at a lot of places.\n\nOvercommunicate at the start. Before you build something, repeat back what you think they want and how you’ll do it. Saves a ton of rework.\n\nAlso, don’t try to overhaul everything in month one. Fix small, annoying problems, document stuff, and ask “is there already a standard way we do this?” a lot. That alone will make you look senior faster than flexing some fancy tool.",

I've been tasked with modernizing data infra to move 200+ data pipes from ec2 with worst possible practices. \n\nMade some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.\n\nNow after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. \n\nA lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.\n\nNow we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: \"ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?\" \n\nWhile there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack. \n\nHis proposal was to start using databricks because it's easier for him to schedule jobs there, which I can't blame him for.\n\nI haven't worked with databricks. Are there any problems that might arise?\n\nWe have ~200gb in total in dwh for 5 years. Integrations with sftps, apis, rdbms, and Kafka.

Your current plan (Dagster+dbt on ECS) is the right tool for this scale.\n\nThe real problem is not technical. A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.\n\nBefore you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.\n\nSometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

Just make it easy and move on for now. (In your situation).  \nHowever, it'll create lots of problems in the future as well, since his queries will probably be shitty. So, just use an AI agent like Cursor/Claude/Codex etc, and give his query and dbt repo, so your problem will be solved. It's a better solution, and it won't take your time. If you're not using AI agents, I highly recommend it to you.  \n  \nAlso, if you want to move a new platform in AWS, I'd choose Snowflake over Databricks since it's a DWH, not a data lake which will create chaos on you in the future.",

      "text": "I'm a senior data engineer where our entire team was laid off a few months ago. I got a new cloud data engineer position and half of my new team was just laid off this week -- I probably have 2-3 months left. My friend in a similar role just got laid off this week at the company I worked for before when we both worked together.\n\nSo, I did some research on jobs to upgrade to that won't be replaceable by AI. These were the top 5 that I have an interest in. ChatGPT said these jobs are expected to increase in supply over the years coming up. I checked online and there's currently only 1 of these positions available for every 50 data engineering positions.\n\nIf I teach myself the skills for one of these positions, does anyone think there will be a supply for them in the future? The salary ranges below look a little high based on when I was researching the actual pay for jobs hiring today.\n\n* AI Data Engineer: $180k–$250k\n* AI Infrastructure Engineer: $200k–$300k\n* Applied AI Engineer: $170k–$250\n* AI Platform Engineer: $200k–$320k\n* Quant / AI Finance Engineer: $250k–500k+\n\nI have a plan to create a SaaS website to showcase my pgvector + embeddings + RAG skills to recruiters to get an AI Data Engineer position for $180k - $250k. It would make a database searchable so the user could ask a question and it would give a response or automatically build a pipeline, among other features.\n\nAnd then create another SaaS website that analyzes stock/crypto for trading analysis (and possibly have it auto trade so when LLM models are good enough then I could connect it to my already-built app). This would help get a Quant / AI Finance Engineer position for $250k - $500k.\n\nI think creating a couple of projects / websites might be the quickest way to learn these skills and would also show recruiters that I have real experience doing these things. I already have data engineering, software development, AI LLM API development, and frontend + backend SaaS experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Is this a realistic approach? Are there any other positions I should try to get instead of one of these?",

Since you are already at a large org, try to reverse engineer one pipeline you can see internally. Ask why it is not streaming, or why it is.

The S3 permission thing is a pretty big red flag though, especially if you ever want to expose access to other tools or less trusted users.\n\nOne possible improvement: add a “paranoid mode” section in the repo that documents workarounds for the S3 perms (eg. proxy service, per‑project buckets, or using a separate object store if someone really needs granular ACLs). Also some rough cost sizing examples for different instance sizes would be gold.",
