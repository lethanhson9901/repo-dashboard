They clearly sold us the dream of saving millions, which so far doesn't look like it'll ever be the case. To do their dream stuff, we needed to provide a shit-load of data from all manners of business units in the company. Then this data gets normalized by them and fed in their \"tool\". The tool uses AI to find the \"things to optimize\". Now the department that paid for this crap is trying to pawn the maintenance off on us in IT. The company also doesn't provide help on how to normalize data to fit their tool, and guess who will probably also be in charge of doing it? So far, they have not found any significant savings and the ROI vs how much their cost (1+ million so far) will take years, if it ever pays back.\n\n  \nAs others have said, it's ok because our VPs can say we're AI enabled.",

I've noticed that they absolutely *fixate* on using a particular suite of products even if they're horrendous solutions to the actual problem. It's like they're trying to farm case studies for how good said suite of products is rather than use the best tool for the job.\n\nIn this case: Microsoft stuff. I've got a Synapse instance with a freakish set of pipelines and notebooks to make it function even somewhat like Databricks. This was a clean slate start from only a few years, so they could have chosen any product, but instead they chose to go all-in on Microsoft.\n\nInstead, this client company paid that consultancy tons of money to custom build janky code on an old platform when they could have saved so much time and money by just using tools made for the job. Now they're digging deeper trying to make this weird stuff work. But hey, at least you got a cool PowerPoint with a bunch of tech product logos with arrows pointing between them (and no description about how said diagram represents an actual solution to the problems at hand).\n\nRabble rabble rabble..",

      "text": "Recently interviewed at DoorDash. \n\nOnsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership \n\nThe recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. \n\nThis new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve  met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. \n\nSystem Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.\n\nData Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. \n\nBusiness Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approaches\n\nLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. \n\nQuestions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.\n\nNext day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. \n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone has. ",

Then I suggested YAML. Then he wanted to know how in YAML will I explicitly write for each source . Which IDID! Wrote a pseudo script. Then I moved to design again.

The job skills are incredibly transferable too, so long as you keep building on them. That’s helpful because the key to making more money is to change companies every few years - ideally around the same industry.\n\nBest wishes for your data guy career!",

You need an always-on Scheduler, Worker and \"Environment\", and you also end up paying for logs which is substantial. Our cheaper envs are $600/month and the more expensive ones exceed $1000/month in total costs (composer, logs, support, taxes...).\n\nIt's also kinda slow and problematic to use with multiple independent projects. The GKE part makes most jobs have 10~20s startup and imo you must containerize most projects if you don't want your team's having issues. It also sucks for DR that you can't have a proper \"cold start\" env.\n\nThe annoying bit with Composer, most projects are probably best off combining BQ and Cloud Run Jobs for actual compute, and for that the orchestrator really shouldn't be doing much, just IO. I took this thinking and deployed a sub $100/month Dagster with single webserver that orchestrates BQ and Cloud Run Jobs, works better imo..",

As I said in my original comment a dedicated orchestrator is great for a complex environment with many different pieces. And yes I agree the GKE does cause a lag for job starts, but we're doing batch data processing so aside from the annoyance when you're trying to ad-hoc run something it doesn't affect us.\n\nFor my company it saved us a nice chunk of cash, relatively speaking, because we came from Prefect. On Prefect we were paying $60k a year (to Prefect) AND the prefect jobs were containerized in our GCP environment and running there as well (meaning we were also paying for container execution ontop of the 60k). This of course could be very different now, we made the decision to switch and save money 3 years ago when Prefect was pushing us to move to Prefect 2. Since upgrading to Prefect 2 was going to require a bit of rework, it was the best time to assess the cost to migrate away. If you have to rewrite code anyway... that makes the decision easier.\n\nOur Composer cost is about $30k a year total for 2 environments (Test & Prod).\n\nBut yeah, if you don't have a lot of jobs or complex stuff going on, I'd just spin up Airflow in a container or VM. I've not used Dagster but I've heard good things.",

They are hard to maintain, hard to do code reviews, and tend to persuade people to write monolithic spaghetti code as opposed to following good software engineering best principles. Also I don’t see a time id ever need to edit a notebook live with another user in a collaborative fashion. If I did, other cheaper platforms such as AWS Sagemaker exists. \n\nMLflow + Feature Store - Experiment tracking, model registry, feature serving with lineage?\nYeah spinning up an MLflow or WAND tracking server isn’t hard and again you can easily deploy a pre-made one via any other cloud provider much cheaper than databricks. Same thing with feature stores. \n\n\nWorkflow orchestration - Built-in scheduling with Databricks Jobs?\nNah Airflow/Prefect FTW. \n\nUnity Catalog for centralized governance, fine-grained access control, lineage tracking across all your data assets?\nAWS, Snowflake, etc. all have pretty decent catalog tools that are again much cheaper than databricks. \n\n\nI’m not saying databricks is a bad platform. I’m just saying it’s not the right platform for me if I was CTO of my company. I just don’t see the value proposition over using all AWS products and choosing my own DBMS. \n\nI think databricks to me feels like what Apple is for smartphones and laptops. They try to make a suite of tools that integrate well to form a nice ecosystem of products, but it’s a walled garden that doesn’t give you full control over the product you are buying. \n\nOne last example: databricks provides a fully managed delta lake house and SQL engine to query the data. A Delta table is composed of a series of flat files (parquet or some other type of columnar format). But it doesn’t tell you where it stores the files. It abstracts that part from you. It’s silly because we know under the hood they are just storing it in a blob storage like azure blob storage. Why can’t I go to the place where the data files sit and use the blob storage interface to copy/paste, move, or download the files? \n\nIf I want a more performant Delta table I could just use AWS S3 and query results via duckdb or some other data processing API that works with delta and iceberg tables.",

They're incredibly risk-averse by nature, so there are tons of lifers here.\n\nI'm a mid-level/senior-ish DE at a F500 insurer these days, after I spent time in higher education, B4 consulting, and then built the data team at a PE-backed startup in the healthcare sector. I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

Granted, that may have taken a hit after the layoffs, but I presume it'll come back pretty well.\n\nYou're not wrong abou the archaic tech stacks, though. USAA was still using Hadoop broadly in 2023 and my current firm is entirely on SQL Server/SSIS. Our \"new technology\" that we're integrating in 2025-2026 is Python.\n\nThat just adds to the stability, though.

Having worked at a very large EHR company, then a start up as the first engineer, and now this, I can safely say it's better. \n\nI grew up in a house where my parents were working on their business all day and into the night. Nothing weird about only stepping down to dinner and then returning to work until 11pm like my dad did my whole childhood. I took that behavior with me to my first couple of jobs and survived and thrived while others burnt out. \n\nBut at this job, I have the constant anxiety that I'm not doing enough because I'm not stressed all the time. I'm not on call, and I don't really work late except a couple nights a year. It's quite chill compared to what I'm used to. \n\nWhile the contractors cycle in and out, I haven't seen many of our IT FTEs leave. The pay is pretty good, only two days a week in office which I like, and good benefits. \n\nThere was a time when I was like \"I'll never do something boring like insurance\" and now I consider myself lucky to have a job with all of the aforementioned qualities. Especially in this economy.",

These are great moments to get hired.\n\nIn my experience, these companies often pay above average and offer a lot of learning opportunities. Since there is always so much that needs to be done, I can often pick and choose what I want to work on. If you're in early enough, you get to do a lot of the foundational design of whatever system you need to build. \n\nI prefer this to jumping into a well-established team at a large company where the work is just delegated to you, you have to completely conform to the existing paradigm, and potential for skill or career progression is possibly a little more constrained.",

Then it’s about finding a company culture that can support such a team stably, instead of grinding it down. Good luck!",

Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:\n\n1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.\n\n2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\n\n3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"\n\n4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\n\n5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\n  ​Detecting duplicate orders\n  ​Calculating running totals/moving averages\n  ​Handling NULL values and edge cases\n  ​Transforming nested/JSON data\n\n​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"\n\n​Good luck!",

      "text": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gif\n\nHello all!\n\nI'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.\n\nAs shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.\n\nRecently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)\n\nHe made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.\n\nIt was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.\n\nI'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).\n\nThe idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nThrough this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etc\n\nYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`\n\nI represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.\n\nI'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.\n\nThe next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.\n\nI'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.\n\nIn the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

              "text": "I agree. Expanding more on job leveling processes from an employer perspective.\n\nCompanies look for comparison to other companies to determine what to price their roles at. This is done through compensation surveys with data generally collected each June-July, and results published around November. This is an imperfect process as every company calls roles slightly different so an analyst goes through and tries to match the roles reasonably to a generalized guide of what other companies call this role. Part of this process is it is helpful to level how senior the duties of that role is. Usually this is done with Pay Grades. Because the companies that collect analyze and prepare the compensation surveys are broadly known, their Pay Grades are most often what companies are internally calling their pay grades.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is one of the common surveys. They provide a leveling guide with description of what is generally differences between levels of seniority for professionals. Data engineer is generally going to fall under the Professional (P) classification in the WTW system. Most data engineers would be a P2, and senior a P3. Entry level may be P1. The P4 and P5 is much more rare, usually a professional individual contributor with 20 or 30 years experience, much less common. P3 tends to be the catch all for senior.\n\nA crude difference is that a data engineer can work through core business tasks but generally needs a more senior team member for guidance and some supervision. They can follow processes and best practices. At the senior level they can work more independently thinking through novel challenges that come up, they can create the processes and best practices and serve as a resource for more junior associates when novel challenges come up outside the usual experiences.\n\nA listing of descriptions of the different Professional pay grades can be read here.\n\nhttps://itv.career-navigator.willistowerswatson.com/career-bands/definition/professional?level=P2\n\nThere are other adjustments usually tech roles receive a compensation premium in compensation surveys. They'll denote things like a \"P3 - P\" the - P denoting a tech role premium that may be a flat 15% - 20% over compensation benchmarks depending on the companies policies. With rare skills as is common in tech roles often comp surveys are less useful and they'll perform specialized analysis for compensation plans for these.\n\nNot speaking exhaustively how work gets done but enough to get a sense for the flow of why pay grades exist and a primary source you can familiarize with that are used by companies. There also exist pay grades of other career levels, M is management, senior management are E's, business admin are B's.",

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries.

      "text": "Switched to data field \\~2yrs back ( had to do a masters degree) while I enjoy it I feel the time I spent in the industry isn't sufficient. There is so much more I could do would have wanted to do. Heck I have just been in one domain also.\n\nMy company lately have been asking us to prepare datasets to feed to agentic AI. While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.\n\nThere are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)\n\nSince it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%.  \nI have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.\n\nIs there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?\n\nThere is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.\n\nAnd last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.\n\nThere is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.\n\nWhat's the motivation to still pursue this field ? I love anything related to data to be honest and for me that is the only one. I love eat and breathe data even if I am jobless now because of AI first policy my company has taken.",

You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic\n* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat\n* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.\n* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)\n* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older\n* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD\n* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers\n* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT\n\nLife as a DE:\n\n* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled\n* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree\n* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable\n* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE\n* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)\n* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl\n* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry\n\nSo what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

The current engineer has only a week and a half left at the company and I observed some friction between him and his boss in our meeting.  For reference, he has no formal education in anything technical and was before this a police officer for a decade. He admitted himself that there isn't really any documentation for his pipelines and systems, \"it's easy to figure out when you look at the code.\" From what my boss has told me about this client their current pipeline is messy, not intuitive, and that there's no common gold layer that all teams are looking at (one of the company's teams makes their reports using the raw data). \n\nI'm concerned that he isn't going to make this very easy on me, and I've never had a professional industry role before, but jobs are hard to find right now and I need the experience. What steps should I take to make sure that I fully understand what's going on before this guy leaves the company? ",

      "text": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. \n\nEarlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...\n\nOn the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:\n\n>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.\n\nThe first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.\n\nThen I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.\n\nA huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:\n\n* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. \n* That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservation\n\nObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…\n\nThe other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.\n\nEarnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)\n\nPlease check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?\n\n",

AI is an option but then you're competing with new grads (do we even stand a chance? Does our background experience help?). I'm asking for more general answers but my background issue is essentially being a jr-mid level at 3-4 different positions, all at smaller companies and more of a startup environment. Platform/cloud (AWS) engineering, bi developer, data engineer and architect. I would be EXTREMELY valuable if this background was at larger companies. \n\nFrom what I can see this isn't valuable unless you're senior/staff or a cloud architect level. They don't bring in jr/mid level and train them, at least not right now. ",

      "text": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \n\n\"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. \n\nIf the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.\n\nStarting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" \n\nI heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

Either Pandas UDFs that get a pandas series and can use the built in pandas stuff, or \"Arrow UDFs\" that get an array and return an array, so they can use other vectorized stuff too\n\nusing these, most of the logic really is usually in C, so the perf diff from java/scala is much smaller\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/udfandudtf.html#Arrow-optimization",
