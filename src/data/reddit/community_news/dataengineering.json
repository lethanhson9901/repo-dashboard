Minutes of hands off work later it was done, it only didn't finish some stuff under special paid apis.\n\nso I think you can prompt for anything (in the realm of basic-engineered data products, even complex ones) now - what you cannot easily prompt for is the understanding of how it all comes together (business, tech) and what to ask for, and how to guide LLMs to implement things that make sense (whatever the use case, be it AI applications or reporting applications)",

If data science is not delivering well tested code, it has a hard time making it into production. If engineering cant keep infra running overnight without an outage you have some architectural issue. But they both feel the impacts of those decisions and your clients 10x more. Separating AI Engineer vs Analytics Engineer vs Data Engineer doesnt really tell me what those roles really do, nor do they show a large enough difference between each other here. AI is not enough a differentiator since the tools to a competent engineer are not magic, nor is implementing AI into a product enough to say its \"different\" or requiring different skills. Putting infrastructure in a bucket separate from the others forces a decision on your users, rather than building with their needs as a primary requirement. L2 makes no sense, none of this shit works without a competency in how data moves, unless you are in a non-technical role, but this is not the subreddit for that role. L3 and L4 are the same thing (maybe) if you are doing modelling, you are thinking all day about inference - full stop thats the job; not every job requires an LLM, in fact I would call an LLM a specialized tool versus other modelling and machine learning paradigms. When it comes to the \"vector\" machine learning models all expect them in some respect, this term has been overhyped by the sales dummies trying to scam boomers with FOMO. Best practice is treating the black box as a software package and building a frame around it that matches the rest of your system's patterns, if you are building a pipeline for example you MUST know that information, where it fits, physically where it runs on planet earth, how the vectors for prediciton are constructed (you find this in your training code). Finally, if you dont have a place for data to land, be viewed by a human, or consumed you dont have a product, you dont have a system, everyone needs expertise in this, REACT vs Prometheus+Graphana vs shoving the vectors back into pgvector, it doesnt matter. Your back end guy has one too, its not *pretty* like powerBI, but it gets the job done. Until you have a user pattern, you minimally have the ugly tooling.",

I spend my days building and maintaining pipelines in airflow, automating different tasks for people with python/sql, developing scripts to ingest data from external sources, writing ad hoc queries, making dashboards, and talking to the non technical folks about their needs. I almost never provide actual analytics these days, but If the word “data” comes up in any context it ends up on my desk somehow. That never goes away when you are “the data guy”. \n\nIf you enjoy it, embrace it because it eventually pays very well, and you’ll usually be one of the last people that they’d ever want to get rid of. The job skills are incredibly transferable too, so long as you keep building on them. That’s helpful because the key to making more money is to change companies every few years - ideally around the same industry.\n\nBest wishes for your data guy career!",

You need an always-on Scheduler, Worker and \"Environment\", and you also end up paying for logs which is substantial. Our cheaper envs are $600/month and the more expensive ones exceed $1000/month in total costs (composer, logs, support, taxes...).\n\nIt's also kinda slow and problematic to use with multiple independent projects. The GKE part makes most jobs have 10~20s startup and imo you must containerize most projects if you don't want your team's having issues. It also sucks for DR that you can't have a proper \"cold start\" env.\n\nThe annoying bit with Composer, most projects are probably best off combining BQ and Cloud Run Jobs for actual compute, and for that the orchestrator really shouldn't be doing much, just IO. I took this thinking and deployed a sub $100/month Dagster with single webserver that orchestrates BQ and Cloud Run Jobs, works better imo..",

As I said in my original comment a dedicated orchestrator is great for a complex environment with many different pieces. And yes I agree the GKE does cause a lag for job starts, but we're doing batch data processing so aside from the annoyance when you're trying to ad-hoc run something it doesn't affect us.\n\nFor my company it saved us a nice chunk of cash, relatively speaking, because we came from Prefect. On Prefect we were paying $60k a year (to Prefect) AND the prefect jobs were containerized in our GCP environment and running there as well (meaning we were also paying for container execution ontop of the 60k). This of course could be very different now, we made the decision to switch and save money 3 years ago when Prefect was pushing us to move to Prefect 2. Since upgrading to Prefect 2 was going to require a bit of rework, it was the best time to assess the cost to migrate away. If you have to rewrite code anyway... that makes the decision easier.\n\nOur Composer cost is about $30k a year total for 2 environments (Test & Prod).\n\nBut yeah, if you don't have a lot of jobs or complex stuff going on, I'd just spin up Airflow in a container or VM. I've not used Dagster but I've heard good things.",

But have to say Airflow is still on the rise. Airflow would be far better for more complex, cross-system workflows (and if I have devs to maintain it). Airflow also provides more control over scheduling, dependencies, retries, and custom logic, which will likely be a more preferable options for bigger companies/projects.",

They are hard to maintain, hard to do code reviews, and tend to persuade people to write monolithic spaghetti code as opposed to following good software engineering best principles. Also I don’t see a time id ever need to edit a notebook live with another user in a collaborative fashion. If I did, other cheaper platforms such as AWS Sagemaker exists. \n\nMLflow + Feature Store - Experiment tracking, model registry, feature serving with lineage?\nYeah spinning up an MLflow or WAND tracking server isn’t hard and again you can easily deploy a pre-made one via any other cloud provider much cheaper than databricks. Same thing with feature stores. \n\n\nWorkflow orchestration - Built-in scheduling with Databricks Jobs?\nNah Airflow/Prefect FTW. \n\nUnity Catalog for centralized governance, fine-grained access control, lineage tracking across all your data assets?\nAWS, Snowflake, etc. all have pretty decent catalog tools that are again much cheaper than databricks. \n\n\nI’m not saying databricks is a bad platform. I’m just saying it’s not the right platform for me if I was CTO of my company. I just don’t see the value proposition over using all AWS products and choosing my own DBMS. \n\nI think databricks to me feels like what Apple is for smartphones and laptops. They try to make a suite of tools that integrate well to form a nice ecosystem of products, but it’s a walled garden that doesn’t give you full control over the product you are buying. \n\nOne last example: databricks provides a fully managed delta lake house and SQL engine to query the data. A Delta table is composed of a series of flat files (parquet or some other type of columnar format). But it doesn’t tell you where it stores the files. It abstracts that part from you. It’s silly because we know under the hood they are just storing it in a blob storage like azure blob storage. Why can’t I go to the place where the data files sit and use the blob storage interface to copy/paste, move, or download the files? \n\nIf I want a more performant Delta table I could just use AWS S3 and query results via duckdb or some other data processing API that works with delta and iceberg tables.",

Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:\n\n1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.\n\n2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\n\n3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"\n\n4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\n\n5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\n  ​Detecting duplicate orders\n  ​Calculating running totals/moving averages\n  ​Handling NULL values and edge cases\n  ​Transforming nested/JSON data\n\n​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"\n\n​Good luck!",

          "text": "I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  \n\nFirst, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.\n\nSecond, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.\n\nLastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

Otherwise Im not able to commit a 1.5 months timeline without having seen myself the ERP landscape, ERP connectors, precisely what metrics/kpis are needed etc! They got mad and accused me of “sales pitching” for presenting the longer timeline of discovery->architecture->data modelling->medallion architecture steps!!",

          "text": "Think of data stores being in 3 separate categories:\n\n1. Traditional SQL databases (RDBMS) - MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, etc.\n2. NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J, etc.\n3. Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.\n\nThey all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).\n\nNoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.\n\nWarehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

They're incredibly risk-averse by nature, so there are tons of lifers here.\n\nI'm a mid-level/senior-ish DE at a F500 insurer these days, after I spent time in higher education, B4 consulting, and then built the data team at a PE-backed startup in the healthcare sector. I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

Granted, that may have taken a hit after the layoffs, but I presume it'll come back pretty well.\n\nYou're not wrong abou the archaic tech stacks, though. USAA was still using Hadoop broadly in 2023 and my current firm is entirely on SQL Server/SSIS. Our \"new technology\" that we're integrating in 2025-2026 is Python.\n\nThat just adds to the stability, though.

      "text": "https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gif\n\nHello all!\n\nI'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.\n\nAs shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.\n\nRecently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)\n\nHe made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.\n\nIt was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.\n\nI'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).\n\nThe idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.\n\nThrough this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etc\n\nYou'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($\"shape\" === \"star\").withColumn(\"color\", lit(\"orange\"))`\n\nI represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.\n\nI'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.\n\nThe next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.\n\nI'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.\n\nIn the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",

              "text": "I agree. Expanding more on job leveling processes from an employer perspective.\n\nCompanies look for comparison to other companies to determine what to price their roles at. This is done through compensation surveys with data generally collected each June-July, and results published around November. This is an imperfect process as every company calls roles slightly different so an analyst goes through and tries to match the roles reasonably to a generalized guide of what other companies call this role. Part of this process is it is helpful to level how senior the duties of that role is. Usually this is done with Pay Grades. Because the companies that collect analyze and prepare the compensation surveys are broadly known, their Pay Grades are most often what companies are internally calling their pay grades.\n\nWillis Towers Watson is one of the common surveys. They provide a leveling guide with description of what is generally differences between levels of seniority for professionals. Data engineer is generally going to fall under the Professional (P) classification in the WTW system. Most data engineers would be a P2, and senior a P3. Entry level may be P1. The P4 and P5 is much more rare, usually a professional individual contributor with 20 or 30 years experience, much less common. P3 tends to be the catch all for senior.\n\nA crude difference is that a data engineer can work through core business tasks but generally needs a more senior team member for guidance and some supervision. They can follow processes and best practices. At the senior level they can work more independently thinking through novel challenges that come up, they can create the processes and best practices and serve as a resource for more junior associates when novel challenges come up outside the usual experiences.\n\nA listing of descriptions of the different Professional pay grades can be read here.\n\nhttps://itv.career-navigator.willistowerswatson.com/career-bands/definition/professional?level=P2\n\nThere are other adjustments usually tech roles receive a compensation premium in compensation surveys. They'll denote things like a \"P3 - P\" the - P denoting a tech role premium that may be a flat 15% - 20% over compensation benchmarks depending on the companies policies. With rare skills as is common in tech roles often comp surveys are less useful and they'll perform specialized analysis for compensation plans for these.\n\nNot speaking exhaustively how work gets done but enough to get a sense for the flow of why pay grades exist and a primary source you can familiarize with that are used by companies. There also exist pay grades of other career levels, M is management, senior management are E's, business admin are B's.",

The maintenance is very important because long term that is where most costs are generated. This is why lots of senior devs are a bit sceptical about ai and the maintenance costs it will generate.\n\nSo to answer your question: make sure you are exposed to all aspects of a project lifecycle, not just greenfield nice solutions where you have free hands.

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions. It’s more about the patterns one has seen in real scenario's and one’s temperament - that’s hard to train for.",

There is so much more I could do would have wanted to do. Heck I have just been in one domain also.\n\nMy company lately have been asking us to prepare datasets to feed to agentic AI. While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.\n\nThere are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)\n\nSince it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing. No I am good at what I do but I won't self proclaim as top 1%.  \nI have very strong skillset to figure things out if I don't know about it. A coworker of mine has been the company for 6 years and didn't even realize how to solve things which I could do it ( even though I had no idea in the first place as well) . I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.\n\nIs there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?\n\nThere is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.\n\nAnd last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.\n\nThere is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.\n\nWhat's the motivation to still pursue this field ? I love anything related to data to be honest and for me that is the only one. I love eat and breathe data even if I am jobless now because of AI first policy my company has taken.",

You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic\n* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat\n* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.\n* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)\n* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older\n* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD\n* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers\n* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT\n\nLife as a DE:\n\n* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled\n* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree\n* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable\n* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE\n* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)\n* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl\n* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry\n\nSo what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

He admitted himself that there isn't really any documentation for his pipelines and systems, \"it's easy to figure out when you look at the code.\" From what my boss has told me about this client their current pipeline is messy, not intuitive, and that there's no common gold layer that all teams are looking at (one of the company's teams makes their reports using the raw data). \n\nI'm concerned that he isn't going to make this very easy on me, and I've never had a professional industry role before, but jobs are hard to find right now and I need the experience.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am facing a career dilemma and would love some insights, especially from those who have transitioned from Consulting to an Internal Role (End Client).\n\nMy Profile:\n\n•\tCurrent Role: Data Analyst / BI Consultant.\n\n•\tExperience: 5 years (mainly Power BI, SQL, some Python).\n\n•\tCurrent Situation: Working for a Consulting Firm (ESN) in a major French city. My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.\n\n•\tThe Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.\n\nThe Offer (Internal Role):\n\nI have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).\n\n•\tTitle: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).\n\n•\tTech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.\n\n•\tThe “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.\n\n•\tVariable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.\n\nMy Plan / Strategy:\n\n1.\tTech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).\n\n2.\tDomain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.\n\nMy Questions for the community:\n\n1.\tDoes taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?\n\n3.\tHas anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

If you know this is the path you want to take, then you move on to deciding whether taking a 12.5% salary decrease is an acceptable tradeoff for stronger overall career alignment long-term. If it isn't worth it, then the other option is to start actively looking for other 'internal' roles - and of course accepting the risk that it might take you a while to find a role that maintains (or increases) your base salary.\n\nIMO 12.5% comp decrease is not that big a deal if it means aligning yourself to the type of career you want long-term. You'll make that up relatively quickly if you do well in your role.\n\n*EDIT: My perspective comes from US-based Big 4 consulting experience.
