          "text": "Whether its a notebook or not isn't really the issue.  The issue is whether there is a proper version control, change control, and rollback process.  Notebooks *usually* don't have that in practice.  But you can do VC, CI/CD, and testing with notebooks.  If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.\n\n\nSome more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

              "text": "I disagree. This works the same in Fabric, Synapse, and likely other platforms as well. A PySpark Notebook put into GIT has a bunch of comment lines that are used to parse where a cell begins/ends, magics, different cell languages, etc. ~~BUT, the actual thing in the platform backend is almost surely not a simple \\`.py\\` file, it is something more complex (i.e. \\`.ipynb\\` which is just JSON underneath) as it stores cell outputs, metadata, and other things which are not parsed into a \\`.py\\` file when the object is sync'd to GIT.~~ *Edited for those that can't see the forest through the trees:* this might have changed in DBX but this ultimately doesn't matter to my point that what is deployed to prod at the end of the day is a Notebook experience that comes with Notebook risks. Sure you can mitigate most of the risk with tests (and maybe CI validation to block usage of MAGICS that are untestable) and tight governance on your prod env, but it's still awkward.\n\nSo why does this matter? From a development perspective (and almost surely from a backend storage perspective) it is a Notebook by all measures. This matters as you can arbitrarily decide to use Scala or SparkSQL cells in your Notebook where PySpark is the default language, and when parsed into a \\`.py\\` file, none of those non-default language cells can be tested, type checked, linted, etc.. they show as commented out lines of code with a header that tells the platform's parser to interpret it as a specific language.\n\nSure, you could require your devs to not use multiple languages in a single Notebook and use an awkward process to ensure test coverage (awkward because you can't really start with local development, you'd have to do cloud>local>write tests and repeat, but even then you are still shipping into production something that comes with a built in IDE. At that point, only proper governance and access control can save you from a \"well it's super easy so I just directly applied the change in production\" scenario.",

I prefer not to show the code to them, especially if it's in notebooks, and especially now with all this GenAI stuff. It's because notebooks make the code look simple to non technical folks. It's due to the cell layout, I believe, that they get the feeling it's basically not much more than excel formulas, while in reality, there's a huge clusterfuck of moving parts underneath. \n\nAnd there's always this one manager that half assed a Python for DE course on Udemy and \"wants to help\". Of course, we end up losing our precious time by going over their slop because we can't just tell them to fuck off and do their job and we'll do ours. \n\nCode explainability (to stakeholders) should not be a thing, ideally.

If you can do your job faster then let’s move up deadlines and if you can get push back it’s pretty much “well AI should make it faster”.\n\nThe other issue is that AI makes senior devs spend more time cleaning up the AI code that gets put into production and it robs junior devs of experience in debugging. \n\nFor me the only reason to use AI is that deadlines become unreasonable and that is in part of people overselling what AI can do. Then when you do use AI it can give you wrong answers so hopefully you look at the code that you are putting in. \n\nSo for me AI does not benefit DE and is only to shorten deadlines and put pressure to preform, thus forcing you to use it just to keep up.",

In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

But you then delete said intermediate products presumably because they take up so much space that this saves you money.... And somehow the savings are worth rebuilding it from scratch every time?\n\nI have so many questions; this isn't making sense to me. Feels like either you're overoptimizing for cost when it's really not worth it or else doing something wrong when it comes to query optimization for the intermediate products to truly not be worth keeping around. Are your joins exploding? Is storage really so expensive that rebuilding these intermediates makes sense? Are you doing too much in your final query? Without more info it's hard to say for certain, but intermediate products aside I suspect something isn't as optimal about this scenario as you think.",

                  "text": "You’re making some incorrect assumptions here. We are on prem, this isn’t about saving cloud costs, it’s about us being somewhat low on storage and trying to minimize how much useless data is just sitting around. We are working on getting budget to expand, but that doesn’t happen immediately. I don’t understand what you mean about doing something wrong with optimization for them to not be worth keeping around. These are models that are run on a daily/weekly/monthly cadence. The previous versions of the intermediate models are useless for the next run. They either cover a completely different date range, and even if there is overlap, we have a decent amount of updates/deletes against old records so we’d want to rerun with the newest versions of the records anyways. And no, our joins aren’t exploding, I’ve actually done a huge amount of work creating optimization guidelines for our models, and will go in to fine tune when needed. Since we are on prem, we aren’t paying for aggregate compute usage. We have a set amount of compute and memory that is always available at any moment. If we just ran one model at a time, we would be massively underutilizing our compute. To make the most out of our compute, we run multiple models at once. But since we aren’t just running one model, we have to set memory limits on all models, by dividing our available memory by the number of concurrent models we run, to ensure we don’t have memory related failures. Also as I mentioned, there are cases where breaking things out into an intermediate model can have massive performance improvements. Our query engine materializes CTE’s every time it is called. If you use the same CTE in a query 5 times, it quintuples the memory and compute usage, versus just running it once into a table and then just referencing the table a few times. It all makes plenty of sense, you are just evaluating it from an invalid context.",

                  "text": "Preface here - this got waaaayyy longer than I thought. Don’t take the “you” defensively below. \n\nI would encourage a little thought experiment here. Initially, take yourself out of the picture. Look at your job description (what you were hired to do). Look for value statements in there (find insights, reduce costs, improve productivity, etc.). This helps quantify “value.” Then look a little broader (Reddit is a good start) - where do data engineers add value. Look at other job descriptions. Once you have a good understanding of where data engineers add value to an organization, that’s your sales pitch to you boss. “I am here to enable our sales and marketing teams to increase revenue by improving the breadth, depth, and quality of data available for our business analysts to use.” Don’t bring that yet. \n\nNext - if someone is questioning the value you bring,  they either don’t have a good understanding of the first part of the exercise, which can happen. That can be solved with a bit of education and managing upward. It may also be your lead is asking on behalf of another person in the organization.\n\nThe other part is that they know what your value should be but does not observe the company getting it (expectations not being met). That could be interpreted as “you don’t know why you’re here and look lost,” “you’re lazy,” “you’re working hard but on the wrong things,” or “you used to engage hard with other people but now you don’t, what’s wrong?” Or, I have seen this occasionally- “Can we replace you with an LLM toolset?”\n\nKeep peeling back the onion here - do a “5 Whys” down various paths. If you do this honestly I think you will find some observations about your role and the organization that are things you can learn from (or put into consideration for your next role). \n\nFor example: “I believe that the value a data engineer, and my role/job description, brings to an organization is X, Y, and Z. I cannot achieve the value that I believe my role as a data engineer should bring because the organization does not have a policy or incentive to put more diverse and higher quality data sets to the Business Intelligence Suite. I don’t have the political acumen or appropriate authorities to drive a change at this level. I could use my 4-6 hours of downtime per day integrating with specific teams for a few weeks at a time. I would need support from leadership to do this because historically, teams are highly siloed and resist me working with them. Here is a plan, a timeline, and here is a specific outcome I hope to achieve.” \n\nThat is a level of maturity that I, as a leader, would respect. Be careful of assigning any blame - you need to talk about impediments to your ability to deliver value. \n\nAs a manager, if one of my employees only “worked two hours a day” and was getting salary, that’s a red flag worth looking into. I like my developers and engineers to have a backlog of work - we currently have several months work per person - and I like to see them showing 6 hours of real good “productivity” each day. I assume that the other two hours are emails, conversations, helping others out - still value add, but it’s the grease in the cogs of the machine.\n\nI would be looking at that 4 hour gap. You said their data and pipelines are garbage despite having a tool. Is the tool hard to use? Do they know how to use it effectively? Are they required to use it? Are they required but don’t see a value/return on investment so they half-ass it?\n\nIf they all use the tool, and the data is great, does that translate into more work for you? Less? Think of an ideal end state. Everyone uses it. The data is fantastic. Sales go up 200%. There is a parade in your honor. What does the job look like then? \n\nAlternatively, you may have already checked out mentally from this job and are just cruising to collect a pay check. Personally I would do the introspection and 5 Whys exercise and see if there’s a path to being engaged again at this job because you want to avoid the same conditions in the future. Some places hired a bunch of “NEW ROLES” for fear of missing out on industry trends with no idea what to actually do with them long term. Or they do know and you’re not delivering (for any number of reasons).\n\nAlso, be aware that, in my observations, the job market is starting to tighten. If you do plan to move companies, can you use your 4-6 hours of downtime per day training on new tools?",

But I presented a roadmap , I said I will onboard teams to the data quality tool , make sure data products upstream assets have the right data quality checks, that there is an incident management response process , follow with tech that the necessary integrations are happening, etc\n\nI started with a team that owned a pipeline working on defining and enabling data quality metrics, sending alerts to them, etc.. was going well, until my manager said that’s not my role. Teams need to define their own metrics, not me, since they understand the data. And data engineers will decide the incident management process not me.. that I should help them enabling the data quality controls in the tool. So basically he reduced my scope when I offered myself as leading the data quality initiative. Few months after that? Very few people enabled alerts, critical pipelines that were used for very important business purposes failed and no one realized. My manager got pressure from his superiors, he came back yelling it us like it why we don’t have a dashboard showing all the critical alerts failing and I was like, the alerts are not even in place. Teams are not using the tool even that you asked them to use it and reach out to us for help.. we need ownership and someone telling them constantly to do it, I tried.",

Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.\n\nThe public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.\n\nQuicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today.

In my opinion from an earlier position and patterns I’ve seen recently, DE is related to the Data Architecture and ingestion to a level of making the bulk data work. The AE is tasked with an overlap of the translation of ingested data but in a BI level foresight of what the data will be used for in its final destination. They are often a main resource of denormalizing the data into special groups for the analytics and dashboards. One of the best and most haunting quotes I remember from an article was “the best AE is able to get the questions answered before they are even asked.”",

We all knew, which is why it was temporary.  Sometimes you have to pick up a machete and force a path forward.  It worked and I'm retiring those VM shitballs as soon as I can.  I wrote the systems myself and will be the first to say let's burn it all in fire.)\n\nTwo years later we got a director who agreed with me that we need a proper data warehouse.  Surprise surprise, it's amazing and everyone else now realizes it's not as scary as they thought.\n\nEducation - I've got a BS in IT and always strive to follow best practices with coding, governance etc.  I'm not just saying that.

Supposedly the IT profesionsals handling data in the past were too expensive, slow and asking many annoying questions.\n\nThe bussines needed shipping their crappy dahsboards and reports in high frequency. So they gained more and more permissions to achieve just that and do their own crappy tranformations regardless of any modelling aor achitecture.\n\nSurprisingly eventually they are swamped in spaghetti code and tech debt. Eventually the called data analysts has to maintain that crucial report by himself 24/7 and becomes a single dashboard person.\n\nAlso the bussines needs more talking and show off people. And they can´t waste their time with SQL.\n\nAnd so the analytics engineer is born. It´s a developer outside of IT, to do the slave work, but not cool enough to run around with piecharts.\n\nHe does it for the bussines salary , and not the IT professional salary - thats your main identifier, how you will know if you are an IT professional, or a data analytics bozo.\n\n  \nAs for me, since the company started to move to the cloud, I´m fully on data engineering - meaning moving data reliably between systems, in this case from legacy to the cloud. I´m damn gonna make sure to go nowhere near a metric or piechart. Anyway we used to do that too, but freedom was given to the data analysts, to do that.\n\n",

If you understand that and refer to the Kimball modeling techniques and can actually internalize it that will get you most of the way there. \n\nIt’s not really something that is easy to explain in a video I don’t think.

              "text": "To be fair, the value proposition of FiveTran is always competing against a “roll your own” extracting method. It’s not rocket science. \n\nIf your data environment is relatively fixed I would agree there is almost no point. \n\nBut if you’re in the business of having to extract data from dozens of systems, then it’s a matter of “do I pay my engineers to keep the lights on at making sure our data extraction jobs are always running, up to date, and can manage various versions of source systems, or do I simply outsource that part of the value chain and focus on actually making the data usable? \n\nIf you are a company that needs to focus on integrating data from say dozens of ERPs… maybe it’s worth it to let FiveTran expedite when a new ERP hits the market (or one you haven’t seen before). \n\nOr you’re setting up a brand new data infrastructure and your sponsors are breathing down your neck to integrate your new HR system. You can spend days/weeks working through building jobs to extract said data, or have it with FiveTran in minutes. \n\nBecause they typically price on monthly deltas volumes there’s kind of a middle tier where it makes sense as part of your tech stack. Too low and it’s too expensive, and if your data volumes are massive, again, too expensive. But if you’re in that sweet spot, it may be worth paying a vendor than paying an engineer to perform those tasks.",

          "text": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.\n\n—-\n\nSo back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!\n\nAs a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha).  \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

People who are doing fine are not posting there. People who are anxious, venting or desperate are. So you're dealing with some serious sampling bias. If you value your mental health I see no point visiting that subreddit.\n\nWith that said - yeah. We are a dime a dozen. So are most people working in the more-or-less modern and commercially relevant branches of software engineering. We are not special, neither are react/node devs, neither are ios/android mobile devs, neither are infra/devops, neither are (run-of-the-mill) data scientists, etc. The non-dime-a-dozen people are those that work in more niche technologies, like dedicated graph DB engineers, or SAP stack devs or maybe these few guys that some US state government urgently hired in 2020 because they knew FORTRAN. \n\nIt's not obvious to me that one is better than the other. If you're niche, you probably have one or two employers that really need your services, but once they finally retire the legacy application they had that required you - you're in a bad position, because you're probably not finding another job. If you're a dime a dozen - you face a lot of competition, but it would be relatively easier to find something new if you lose your job. (This is of course ignoring how good you are - of course there's always many beginners and few extremely knowledgeable people, but that is true with any technology.)\n\nAlso, just a small remark, I'm not sure it is informative to say \"does a lot of SQL\". SQL is a language that has broad support across different databases and data processing engines, it's one thing to be doing a lot of SQL on a huge on-prem Postgres cluster, another to be doing a lot of SQL on a managed platform like Snowflake.",

Now most teams never think about cluster management.\n- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)\n- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\n\\*\\*What stayed the same (unfortunately):\\*\\*\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\n\\*\\*What's genuinely better:\\*\\*\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

We might define a relationship that says \"A sibling is defined as someone who shares the same parents.\" The ontology can then (given enough input data) infer these additional relationships logically, even though they've not been expressly provided by the data.",
