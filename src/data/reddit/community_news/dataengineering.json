Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).\n\nWe then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.\n\nBut every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"\n\nEvery single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.\n\nI can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Though, having restrictions doesn't do much - people still try to cheat by having a second monitor, you can easily tell by their eyes switching between them when typing code. So, the focus is on a candidate being able to explain their train of thought, not solve the tasks like it's a test. The first 5-10 minutes of the interview is usually enough for me to understand if the candidate has the claimed experience or not, and the remainder of the time is for digging to the boundaries of their knowledge, by asking them more and more questions.",

Nowadays everyone can use AI to create perfect resumes, as a result, when picking applications, HRs can't differentiate between the liars and really capable candidates. A significant portion of the candidates I've interviewed for the last year weren't capable of being even juniors, though their resumes said they were practically seniors - 5+ years of experience in all/most tech tools listed for the job, certificates, accomplishments, etc. Imagine having a person stating they've had 5 years of experience designing SQL databases, writing procedures etc., and at the interview they don't know how to write a query to count the number of rows in a table. This takes up a lot of our time, and the experienced real candidates get drowned in this pool of fraudsters. We haven't solved this problem yet, and I'm not sure if it's even solvable.",

Dude needs to be straight up fired but the manager is afraid of hurting peoples’ feelings and won’t even mention there is a problem.\n\nSo, I can’t build new stuff that actually works because he whines about being dependent on some software, and the manager refuses to let me build it because he won’t take sides and we don’t have consensus on how to proceed.",

Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \\~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.\n\nA little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.\n\nThe core issues:\n\n* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output\n* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy\n* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity\n* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable\n* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview features\n\nThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.\n\nComing from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.\n\nI'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.\n\nDE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.\n\n  \nEDITED: Because there was too much details and colleagues.",

Then the BI experience is insulated from any spikes upstream. If you are still doing import mode for BI reports then you could even just have them in Pro workspaces, based on your user count.\n\nUltimately if you don't like Fabric and want to move to something different, you do you - but those small wins _might_ make it less painful and less necessary to rebuild on a different stack.\n\nFwiw we've not had any \"random\" pipeline failures that we couldn't debug and understand the reason for. There have been a few (very few) examples of python notebooks misbehaving for _odd_ reasons - what feels like problems happening on the level of the underlying Azure infrastructure running Fabric.

Even if they advertise exactly-once, the CAP theorem is just a basic fact of mathematics: you are trading consistency over availability. Not to mention how hard it is to tune the various timeouts and parameters both server and client side and when transactions get stuck, it's an absolute hell to debug. Every single actor and library involved has to be aware of this transactional mode or else you will see duplicates. It's not worth it.\n\nAnd even in at-least-once, you need to discuss beforehand the need for timeouts, heartbeat adjustments, the need for an idempotency/deduplication ID and event_time parameter... Applications tend to just be set up with default parameters without discussing any of that which is a recipe for headaches. Hell, I've seen deployments without as much as a group ID set up saying \"hey it worked without it\". And specially the thundering herd (?) problem in case of rebalancing is quite tricky to explain to people, it seems. Your apps and pipelines need to be able to handle these, and that's an architectural decision, it's not just plug and play.\n\nAnd that's me mostly just using it client side as a developer/engineer, having to help Ops debug server side issues occasionally. You need a lot of observability over Linux data syscalls and disks, and it seems to me that the default dashboards only have CPU, memory, at most disk usage.\n\n~~But I would be even warier of building custom stuff on NAS storage, but hey, that's why I don't work at Ops~~ EDIT: sorry, misread it as NAS storage for some reason. BTW, just to make sure, you weren't trying to use them as persistence for Kafka, were you? I've had to discourage people from doing it, very few databases would handle being persisted to network storage well",

Don't get me wrong, I do love NATS and use it for few projects\n\nBy the sound of it, you don't really need persitence and Kafka was not needed to start with.\n\nBy the way, there's a feature in NATS which I found very useful: you can have topic and you can have subtopic, and you can listen to subtopics by wildcard. We have a case of replicating over 400 tables from bunch of teams. In Kafka you should just create 400 topics, listen them one by one. Good luck maintaining that... In NATS that can be a single topic 🙂",

FK constraints in your schema will murder performance, and make online schema migration a nightmare once you are at the point where blocking writes for ALTER TABLE is not an option.\n\nThe phrase I liked to use was that we avoided using \"scale limiting features\".  FK constraints are a huge one; triggers (non-trivial ones anyway) and stored functions are some others.  It is shocking how fast MySQL stays if you are mainly using it for indexing, and stick to basic feature usage.  Millisecond lookup on random data keys is the killer feature that no cloud DB gets you, combined with a full SQL engine that can leverage that for join performance as well.\n\nThe thing that often kills you in cloud db land is read amplification, for lookups or joins.  You might have to read MB's or TB's of data to get the same handful of records that MySQL or Postgres could find in a few KB of I/O.",

I agree - my point is more that this is a PK/FK constraints are a \"gotcha\" that just because Snowflake allows in the syntax PK and FK, they are simply a visual reference, a way to document your tables.\n\nBack in the 90's we'd actually future allocate empty rows in binary tables on disk and the code would find a blank and update it, this was faster than locking the table, adding a physical row, unlocking the table. Multiple users accessing the same data row on update, semantic locking. Basically doing what early MSSQL 2000 did with it's paging engine.\n\nSo we were able to achieve crazy efficient speeds, span many disks volumes. This was in Unix of course. The early days of Informix or previously Universe. Our biggest issue was that the OS was 32 bits, so this limited file sizes.",

Because it was built with zero analysis, built by software engineering team. While the data team was left stranded with SSRS reports. \n\nNow after full release, they want us to make reports about how good it’s doing, while it’s doing shite. \n\nI am under a group who wants to make AI as a big thing inside the company but all these corporate people talk about is I need something to be automated. How dumb are people? People considering automation as AI! These are the people who are sometimes making decisions for the company. \n\nThankfully my team head has forcefully taken all the AI Modelling work under us, so actually subject matter experts can build the models.\n\nSorry I just had to rant about this shit which is pissing the fuck out of me.

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. \n\nMy current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. \n\nWhen we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. \n\nData modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.\n\nNow this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. \n\nSo how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!\n\nIf anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.\n\nI am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  \n\nThe way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version. In the end, you don't want to have senior level management have a discussion in a meeting about what a cost center is, what data is correct, on what date FTE stats are calculated for reports and what the source is of all of this (that, in effect, will surge your indirect costs, drop the trust in your solution and eventually have management question why in gods name they hired those engineers).",

ProductSense means that you have the ability to work backwards from the product to the data pipelines. Understanding what needs to be measured, how to measure it, and then building the pipelines.\n\nSome core skills that you need to be really good at in todays modern data tech stack world are these:\n\n- Strong SQL, i.e. its like reading and writing english\n- DBT, don’t let a new tool intermediate you, it’s just SQL queries orchestrated in an autogenerated DAG. \n- Data QA, building pipelines where data quality tests are first class citizens. The moment your dashboard shows one wrong number people instantly loose trust in your data assets. Better to delay data availability then delivering and redacting later.\n\nSome tools to look into:\n- Airbyte for data ingestion\n- Superset and Metabase for BI tools\n- Duckdb",

Then another one had a live python coding exam which I just totally bombed tbh.  That’s what I can remember off the top of my head - I figured getting airflow and dbt should be my priority based off that.

Datalake is organized by container then sub-folders, one sub-folder per source, then sub-folders below that. Container-level can be Dev, UAT, Prod.\n\nThen Load into staging, with reject management and deletion from source management, adding control columns like hashes and a single column PK (this can be a hashed value of multiple source columns - this is fine).\n\nDeletion tracking requires \"full\" from source if you don't have CDC tracking from source that contains all inserts, updates, deletes. So for these \"full\" cases it's a separate distinct process.\n\nThe layer after staging, Bronze, is vetted information, has control columns, identifies source and SSoT, has flags like IsCurrent, IsDeleted, and lots of datetime columns for inserted, updated, deleted.\n\nEx: a customer table imported from an OLTP ERP system on-prem. You want to capture all changes, like customer address info, so you have a history of when the customer moved to a different location. If customer table are companies, companies get acquired and merged.

About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

Work in progress there. I would say, though, that having pretty strictly defined schema in the destination table tends to be what saves me. Unless I get pretty much exactly what I expect structurally, the import is going to fail.\n\nDue to the nature of the data I'm integrating and our position as a company, there isn't much I can do in terms of accuracy validation. The source of truth is external to us, so if it's incorrect we're sort of in a \"we're just the pipes\" situation.

(Then again, IDK how brutal the market is where you are. Maybe you really do need to optimize down to specific technologies.)\n\nIf I really had to name some technologies, I'd say yes, knowing Databricks and Snowflake helps, they hold a lot of mindshare. Knowledge of DBT and EL connectors still seems very relevant to ELT-focused places. Kafka is relevant in real-time contexts. Airflow is not \"cool\", but still relevant, although knowing more modern alternatives like Prefect, Dagster, etc would not hurt. \n\nI would also say that knowing cloud solutions from hyperscaler vendors is relevant - I mean, those besides the DE domain. A DE that is not afraid of HCL and can write or read and make sense of a Terraform module, and knows different AWS solutions (we're an AWS shop), would be valuable in the org where I currently work.",

I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.\n\nOver the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer. Most of my work involved data administration, Python automation, some cloud services, cloud data warehouses, basic data modelling, and a few simple Airflow pipelines that pulled data from APIs and loaded it using pandas. I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.\n\nNow that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior  roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.\n\nI’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort. I’m just unsure if it’s too late at this stage or if taking a pay cut is the only way to reset my career. Is there a smarter way to transition into real data engineering without completely derailing things?\n\nAny honest advice would really help.\n\nTL;DR: 5+ YOE with a Data Engineer title but limited real DE experience. Now expected to be senior without Spark or large-scale pipeline work. Junior roles mean a big pay cut. Looking for guidance.",

We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

How is it at your work? Do people actually vet the information given and critically assess it, or do they just plug it into whatever pipeline that exists and call it a day?\n\nI have seen a lot of questionable DAX queries from people I assume have very little to no clue as to why they have made it like that. The complexity of the queries are often worrying as it displays a very high level of trust in the result that has been given to them. Stuff that \"works\" in the moment, but can easily break in the future.\n\nWhat are your experiences? Have you seen anything in production that made you go \"oh, this is BAD!\"?",

Now, our new Indian coworkers are copying text from Jira tickets, pasting it into Claude, copying whatever Claude generates, and opening PRs without testing the code. The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. \n\nMy manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.\n\nLast week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. \n\nSo, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find.

Some done 1-2 projects of data pipeline within 2-3 years and abit of databricks then call themselves an Architect. Some people have same coding test answer 1 another (GPT copy paste), etc.\n\nBut again, not everyone is bad.. I got people that don’t even know how to write sql agg and sometimes just copy paste code from gpt without even think.. and 1 guy that damn good in many stacks. Stream, batch, api, coding, sql, etc.. \n\nBottom line is, 1st: there’s chance to find gold in contractors, our task to find one… 2nd: we both know we should run away from this company because they might not know how to appreciate engineering.

Manager postponed the meeting to 3 days later cuz no one had the time to read that. \n\nIn the end, maybe only the manager read the doc. Not even sure of that.\nRest of us just gave a go ahead without reading the whole shit. And the dude is so proud that he has contributed to documentation in extreme detail. 100% no one is going to follow through that shit.\n\nNow when you slack the guy, he'll reply with obviously AI generated messages.
