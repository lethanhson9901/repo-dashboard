Would you do the same for anime character?

But.... when it comes to prompting and getting each to give me what I want from a text prompt (starting with an image), they're both woefully difficult.  Sometimes you get something you like but rarely do you get what you specifically asked for.  When I started using AI for video and images a few years ago, it was just as difficult to get a character to do something seemingly simple like walking through a door entering a room as it is today so while the quality of the video and the processing/rendering speed have really improved, I'm not so sure the output and control of the output has improved at nearly the same rate.",

I have some pretty negative opinions about that typeface overall, but the big issue here is that it was developed in 1982, and the style of this video is decidedly earlier than that. The color, texture, and set pieces approximate 1960s futurism. The vehicle body styles are obviously not real, but look like the styles you might see around 1974-1976. And I could buy that as a window of time a real film like this could have been created. But, if you were to swap in older 1960s car models, that would be even more in the pocket.\n\nAnyway, a better typeface choice (though it may be a bit on-the-nose) would be [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile). Other good options might be: [Recta \\(bold\\)](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/recta-font-canada-type), Helvetica, or (if you want some more whimsy) [Craw Modern](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/craw-modern-font-grouptype). These would have been very on-brand for a retro-futuristic film from the 1960s.",

There is no SLI, no NVLink, no Crossfire support, SD will always run on **one GPU per job**.\n\nSo in practice, they will only be able to use **one 5090 at a time** for each generation. Yes, they *can* choose which card to run on by adding `--cuda-device 1` to their launch arguments, but that still means only **one** card is doing the actual work. And from what I can tell by their server rack, this is probably what they are doing. I just hope they do not plan to host THAT for stuff like AI videos, because those are still quite slow on RTX 5090 series, and this is going to suck if only 12 people can generate at the same time.\n\nAt that point, an RTX 6000 Ada would have been a much better choice. More VRAM per card and much better stability for heavy workloads. But my guess is their setup is probably not for the public but themselves and probably relatives.",

This is nothing like a true NVlink server setup and very far removed from it. With 2 x 5090 you can layer an LLM over both to quasi \"pool\" the memory but thats about where that ability ends. For image gen or video gen you cant do that. I suppose OP could be running an LLM that fits within 64GB VRAM with context on each rig.",

Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

          "text": "Cool build, but let’s drop the fantasy: this is NOT “unified VRAM” and it’s NOT “1.5TB+ VRAM.” It’s 12 GPUs with 32GB each = 384GB total, distributed, and each job still sees 32GB per GPU. Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

It's just the language of the format, and it gives creators the most options when editing stuff together. It is the art form, in a way. \n\nIt's also a matter of style; some directors like quick cuts, like Michael Bay and most superhero films, others like long takes with one or several continuous shots.

From the moment we released, this community jumped in and started creating configuration tweaks, sharing workflows, and posting optimizations here, on, Discord, Civitai, and elsewhere. We've honestly lost track of how many custom LoRAs have been shared. And we're only two weeks in.\n\nWe committed to continuously improving the model based on what we learn, and today we pushed an update to GitHub to address some issues that surfaced right after launch.\n\n**What's new today:**\n\n**Latent normalization node for ComfyUI workflows** \\- This will dramatically improve audio/video quality by fixing overbaking and audio clipping issues.\n\n**Updated VAE for distilled checkpoints** \\- We accidentally shipped an older VAE with the distilled checkpoints. That's fixed now, and results should look much crisper and more realistic.\n\n**Training optimization** \\- We’ve added a low-VRAM training configuration with memory optimizations across the entire training pipeline that significantly reduce hardware requirements for LoRA training. \n\nThis is just the beginning. As our co-founder and CEO mentioned in last week's AMA, LTX-2.5 is already in active development. We're building a new latent space with better properties for preserving spatial and temporal details, plus a lot more we'll share soon. Stay tuned.\n\n",

It's a running video so it's more complex to fix than simply better architecture and better datasets obviously. But this is an obvious flaw that I noticed\n\n2. Anytime the word \"asian\" come up, I noticed some generation burns subtitles into the generation. The correlation is there as the more \"asian\" word is mentioned the more likely the generation has burned subtitles in it. I assume this is because you train on asian movies with burned subtitles as well, but you should clean this up on the dataset.\n\n3. Better support for external audio. While it works, there is some conflict between the audio latent and the prompt. I notice the audio words usually tied to a character emotion and thus effect the character action eventhough the prompt says differently. Perhaps a strength dial would be great here between audio and prompt.",

                  "text": "This implementation looks very strange. Presumably the idea is to suspend sampling at some particular step, scale down the audio latent and then resume. The way it is implemented is definitely _not_ doing that. It is effectively doing a Euler step to 0 from whatever the current sigma is, then renoising with the same noise, same seed as the beginning. The only way this could be resuming sampling is if the model had predicted the initial noise exactly at each step which would never happen. This is likely to produce some very weird effects, especially if you do it multiple times in a generation. What you're trying to do would work much more reliably as something like a model patch.\n\nIf you really want to do it in a sampler, since the sampler returns both a noisy latent and the clean latent, you actually could extract the noise, scale the latent, and then using the existing noise to resume sampling. You would need to make an instance of ComfyUI's noise generator object to pass in that returns that specific noise. See: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/blob/0c6b36c6ac1c34515cdf28f777a63074cd6d563d/comfy_extras/nodes_custom_sampler.py#L697\n\nThe general idea would be something like:\n\n    noisy_latent, clean_latent = SamplerCustomAdvance(...)\n    clean_samples_scaled = your_scaling_stuff(clean_latent[\"samples\"])\n    noise_pred = noisy_latent[\"samples\"] - clean_samples_scaled\n    # You probably have to scale it back to unit strength.\n    noise_pred = noise_pred * (1 / current_sigma)\n    # ^^ Use this for NOISE when you resume sampling.\n\nI recommend doing it with a model patch instead but resuming with the existing noise would be a lot less likely to cause strange results.\n\nJust dividing the audio latent by 4 at specific steps also seems strange and is going to be very, very dependent on the exact schedule used and the exact number of steps and probably break or cause undesirable results otherwise. This will also degrade history samplers like SA solver, res_2m, etc because interrupting sampling like the current approach forces them to throw away all the history. ComfyUI model patches can see the current sigmas so this would probably work more reliably if you based audio latent strength scaling on the current sigma, or something like sampling percent (can be calculated from sigma with the model_sampling object).",

Please work on the hand Lora, focus animations Lora, and human anatomy Lora to refine the next update, as it's necessary and urgent.\n\nIf anyone saw the subtitles, I only saw them in the full model and tested them all without exception. For some reason, they never appear in the destilled version, so it might be an issue with this it Lora: ltx-2-19b-distilled-lora-384.safetensors. It would be good if you looked into that.\n\nCould be good if you reduced the number of cartoons like SpongeBob and others, and instead focused on adding more data from movies or scenes where the human anatomy looks correct. I know how complicated this's for the AI, but if you don't, the model won't advance significantly in its next version.\n\nP.S.: Words can always be misinterpreted, so please be understanding and tolerant of those who don't think like you or say something incorrect. There're many people like me who don't speak perfect English and rely on a translator who might make mistakes. Have a great day! 😎",

I'm not really interested in perfect photographic realism at all and more focused on artistic styles and creativity and from that perspective Klein 9b is blowing everything else away for me.  Excellent style representation and it does a brilliant job at blending multiple styles together as well, though I will still be happy when some good LORA's have been released for more manual control of that.  The prompt adherence is excellent and it makes pleasing and artistically minded compositional decisions.  It's also very nice to have the base models available already, I usually prefer what the distilled is putting out by default, but if I'm not happy with it or just want a lot more variation then I can always switch the base model for a huge amount of creative variation from the model.  The base of course supports CFG with negative guidance as another lever I can pull, which is something we never had from Flux Dev.  On top of all this the performance is amazing which is allowing me to iterate and experiment so much faster than on the older Flux models, it feels more like I'm using SDXL but with much more sophisticated prompt capabilities and better handling for higher and oddball resolutions (I like to do 32:9 and SDXL did not handle that nearly as well as Flux).  \n\nI agree ZIT gives more realistic skin detail and is better in terms of hands and fingers and text.  But right now it's limited without a base model and you can really only use one LORA at a time.  And I never one shot my images anyway.  I use a variety of workflows, photoshop edits and mix models together for different parts of the process.  I can do a refinement pass with ZIT if I wanted to do something photorealistic to layer on the skin tone and I can edit the image in a bunch of ways to fix the hands and any other anatomy issues.  And for that matter I CAN STILL use ZIT too!  I don't know why there seems to be a zero sum attitude about these models.  Different models are good for different things.  Nano Banana Pro is an amazing edit model but for anything remotely artistic is the dullest most lifeless model out there.  And while ZIT is great for photorealism and skin, there's very little variation in what it produces and is not nearly as good as Flux for artistic styles (IMHO).  Use the model that's best for what you want to do, but there's no reason to trash a model for not being exactly what you need for your usage.\n\nAnyway, I for one am so happy that BFL released all these models and look forward to seeing what creative opportunities it will provide for my projects.",

A second model that generates images with different breeds for different seeds with that same prompt, also has high adherence but it still has \"creativity\" too. \n\n Adherence only measures how well the output matches whatever you put in the prompt.

Fast, maybe, but it has tons of anatomical issues and struggles with longer text rendering. To be fair, Z Image has huge struggles with text as well. But IMO, ZIT and NanoBanana are still the most capable of truly realistic output, and Qwen Image Edit is king for long text rendering. Just my 2 cents.",

The Z-image turbo model is a terrible model to fine tune on yet it has over 20 fine tuned variations now. And the only reason it doesn't have a lot more is because everyone is waiting on the base model to go crazy with it. While Flux is so hard to fine tune that the only fine tuned community model I know exists is Chroma. Flux has lost its good will with the AI bro community for a while now and these communities are ravenous. \n\nIMO Klein is dead in the water too, 4b is so small that its practically SDXL, it hallucinates heavily because of its size, and the 9b model is dead in the water too, nobody can train on it because of its license and size.",

          "text": "I know the video isn’t perfect, but my goal was to push the video length as far as I could on my modest hardware. Limiting the video to 40 seconds and pushing higher resolutions, the results are far more impressive. So how does it work? If you’ve ever used the 2x Spatial Upscaler to double your video resolution in a second pass, you’re halfway there. That same upscaler can actually be applied to the empty latent video output in the first pass to greatly reduce computational overhead, but we’re going to talk about something else.  \n  \nIn the same LTX-2 repo as the Spatial Upscaler, I noticed there was a 2x Temporal Upscaler, so I tried swapping it out with the Spatial Upscaler in my 2-step workflow. The result was a video twice the length of my original, but with the sound cutting out halfway through. The process was just as fast as the Spatial Upscaler, so I knew I was onto something. I tried doubling the number of audio frames in the first pass, and holy crap, I got a 40-second video, with sound throughout, and it only took 80 seconds to generate, so I did some research.  \n  \nBy applying a 2x temporal upscale to the empty latent, you’re essentially tricking the AI. Instead of making it imagine every frame from scratch, the model only has to calculate half of the frames, while the upscaler handles the filler frames in between. The AI is doing less work because the mathematical distance between frames is wider. This principle is the same for the Spatial Upscaler, but with the video resolution.  \n  \nIn my workflow, you can see options to chain both upscalers together in either the first or second passes, and I’ve experienced success with many combinations. I’ve even daisy chained multiple instances of the same upscaler together, for stupid fast generations with mostly coherent videos. The only thing that really suffers at extreme video lengths, is the AI-generated audio, since the temporal upscaler only works on the video frames. Anyway, this has been a lot of fun to tinker with, especially since I don’t have to wait ages for results. I can’t wait to see what other users come up with.  \n  \nLink to my workflow: [https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup](https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup)  \n  \nLink to the LTX-2 Temporal Upscaler: [https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors)",

This is because after your input frames are converted into latents, the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\" node doubles the amount of latents. These doubled latents are then fed into the sampler for inference, which is no different from directly increasing the number of latents.\n\nSince the official documentation doesn't explain it, I believe the actual usage is like this: take the result output by the sampler inference, feed it into the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\", and then perform an action similar to RIFE VFI frame interpolation. Consequently, you will get smoother footage, and naturally, the FPS count will double.",

And the music is actually something I could listen to on repeat! Great job! Thanks for sharing!\n\nIf you ever decide to post a step by step tutorial on how you achieved this, I’d be interested.

Even though it accidentally amputated a few fingers, it looks pretty good overall. Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes. I say this because a lot of people use them without reading the terms of service. That was awesome, man!. 😎",

I don't feel as excited. In fact, it made me remember of Ananta, and I'm even more stoked for that game.\n\nToo many games are obsessed with making things feel \"realistic\" that they forgot the \"fantasy\" in these games. Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

So 2.6 seconds for 4 steps? Not bad! ZIT takes around 3.5 seconds on my machine, but you often need more than 4 steps, so it ends up being like 5-8 seconds.\n\nLooks like serious competition.\n\nEDIT - Actually, [I just found a benchmark comparison](https://www.trooper.ai/benchmarks-compare-RTX-Pro-6000-Blackwell-with-RTX-3090?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that suggests the 2x figure could be way off. This comparison suggests the Blackwell is 550% faster at image gen, which, if holds true for this model, means Klein is not even close to the speed of ZIT. So... ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯",

The results of those edits are a mixed bag. Qwen Image Edit gave better results, but finding a prompt that actually did what I want would take a lot of trial and error. Flux2 Klein 4b would happily change the image (with a lot of nosense added on top).\n\n9b can trade blows with Qwen Image and Z-Image Turbo and does a decent edit in half the time it takes Qwen Image Edit (finally 1024x1024 edit job fits into VRAM).",

Also set \"eta\" to 0.0 and CFG to \\~5 (if using the Klein Base model). Then, plug the \"ClownOptions Extra Options\" node to the ClownsharKSampler and type \"default\\_dtype=float32\" (without the quotes) in the text box.

You're using the Base model which is un-distilled, therefore you don't need the FluxGuidance node. This node may cause undesirable results with un-distilled Flux models.\n2. 20 steps seems low considering you're using an un-distilled model. Try something like 40 at least. I would even aim at 50. If that's too much wait time for you, consider using [the distilled version of FLUX.2-Klein 9B](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B). You'll lose the negative prompting though, and also the image quality might not be as good as base with \\~50 steps.\n3. Uni PC is not a sampler I've seen commonly used with these new rectified flow models. Can you try Euler and see if you get better results with it?\n4. Consider using \"denoised\\_output\" instead of \"output\" in the Ksampler when VAE decoding the final image.",

Also set \"eta\" to 0.0 and CFG to \\~5 (if using the Klein Base model). Then, plug the \"ClownOptions Extra Options\" node to the ClownsharKSampler and type \"default\\_dtype=float32\" (without the quotes) in the text box. This seems to further decrease censorship in my tests. You might have to try a few seeds before you land on one that's uncensored.\n\nYou also need to know how to prompt it, but it's really not that difficult. Just be clever with explaining. Explain what you want to see literally, going into detail, as if talking to a person that has never seen what you're trying to describe. You also need to use supplementary wording for reinforcement of the concepts. The biggest mistake is using very short prompts and expecting results. And don't forget to use the negative prompt!",

It can do arbitrary length videos if you use the ContextOptions node from Wan Video Wrapper, just use only a LOW model (no HIGH) and set denoise to 0.7 or lower, and use a relevant pic as a reference image.\n\nIt's basically a free quality pass on any video and if you use a good reference image it'll easily clean up the plastic skin issue (among other things). Just make sure you only do it once when there's dialogue, repeated refinements might ruin the lip syncing.\n\nEdit: here's a workflow for it [https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep](https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep)",

I was using my own workflow and for the sake of speed of testing - the distilled model. At 1920x1080x24x900 I let it run for like 20 minutes and it wasn't able to complete a single step (although I didn't get an OOM in that timeframe either).\n\nI dropped to 600 frames to see how that went, and it did improve inference time from 682.47s/it without to 266.77 with. *But here's the thing...* When I drop to 481 (20 second video) I can get 36.05s/it without needing it. \n\nSo in other words, I think that inference speed is a larger bottleneck when dealing with very high frame counts than the VRAM requirement (at least on a 5090), making it far more efficient to simply just generate shorter clips to extend via LTX's native video extension capabilities rather than a longer clip in one shot. \n\nBut, if you must generate in a single run and have the extra time to spare I do think this can work. \n\nWith all of that said, I'm curious what others find to see if maybe I'm missing something.",

Ahora, para acceder a los pesos, la ruta se ha convertido en algo como: diffusion\\_model.double\\_blocks.0.img\\_mod.ff.\\_ffn\\_ref.net.0.weight (Debido a que guardaste el original dentro de self.\\_ffn\\_ref).\n3. **El Conflicto:** Cuando el sistema de parches de ComfyUI (ModelPatcher) intenta aplicar el LoRA, busca la ruta original. Como has sustituido el objeto original por tu wrapper, la ruta ya no existe o no coincide, y lanza el error de \"KeyError\" o dice que las claves no coinciden.\n\n# La Solución: \"Monkey Patching\" del método forward\n\nEn lugar de reemplazar el **objeto** (el módulo entero), debes reemplazar solo su **comportamiento** (el método forward). De esta forma, la estructura del modelo y los nombres de las capas permanecen intactos, y los LoRAs pueden encontrar las capas para modificarlas.\n\nAquí tienes el código corregido. He modificado la clase para que inyecte la lógica de chunking directamente en el módulo original sin cambiar su identidad.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

She has clear blue eyes, an alternative edgy aggressive aesthetic, wearing gothic-punk style clothing that reveals cleavage, dyed hair at the ends, and heavy goth makeup including dark eyeliner and pale foundation. Her posture is relaxed as she uses her phone while surrounded by blurred commuters in the background, creating a sense of intimacy and spontaneity with shallow depth of field focusing on her.\n\nThe scene is bathed in soft lilac lighting that filters through gaps in the train car ceiling to create a dreamy, pastel glow, contrasted by hazy amber-colored atmosphere where dust motes dance in shafts of light. The background features muted tones of dusty rose and faded gold with subtle reflections on metal surfaces, enhancing the moody yet ethereal ambiance. Lighting is directional from above-left, casting gentle shadows while maintaining a soft volumetric quality that emphasizes texture and depth without harshness, all rendered in a photorealistic style with natural color grading dominated by lilac, amber, and muted pastel tones for cinematic realism.\n\nFlux.2 Klein 9b\n\n10 Steps CFG 2\n\n[https://civitai.com/posts/25936395](https://civitai.com/posts/25936395)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrq9pkbo3udg1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=03cdcf45b3098f44e6c00845d596513f4ec6b652",

It contains contradictory elements like lilac and purple lighting; if you want to include both, you need to be more specific how they are part of the scene.\n\nThe Z-image result is surprisingly good, given your prompt. However, certain elements like the amber light and hair dyed at the \"points\" are missing. But with a better prompt, Flux Klein performs much better than the example you gave for it. (And I bet the Z-image result would improve too.)\n\nI would recommend this post from a while back, which offers some [tips on better prompting](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1k15w9p/avoid_purple_prose_prompting_instead_prioritize/), which are applicable to most contemporary models.\n\n*Shot from a few seats away inside a crowded commuter metro train. young woman is sitting naturally with crossed legs looking away.

But my bias is towards photorealism, I hate hyperrealism that comes out like a video game scene or oil painting maybe someone smarter than me can explain why the Qween based models turn out different from the Z-Image ones aren’t these both products of Alibaba? The depth adherence on the Z-Image one and the blending between the foreground and background really stands out to me, secondary to its photorealistic quality, the only thing close to this is NPB. Compare that to flux it looks cartoonish, the other side of the bus is a different scene, no depth adjustment between the foreground and background, less textures, the extra hazy mist, the extra limb not even in the same league here in my opinion.
