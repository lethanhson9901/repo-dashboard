Even if the model was never shown a woman lying like some people were spouting back then, it clearly knows what a humanoid looks like when lying down so it should have been able to generalize. \n\nThe saddest part is SD3.5 Medium is actually a [really interesting model for art](https://postimg.cc/gallery/grmwg4F), and from memory it was trained completely different than SD3 and 3.5 Large but for whatever reason Stability believed the SD3 brand wasn't complete poison by that point. If Medium was called SD4 and it might have had a chance.\n\nNot gonna lie though, as much as I love playing around with ZiT and Klein and appreciate the adherence the new training style brings, I miss models trained on raw alt-text. There was something special about prompting your hometown and getting photos that looked like they could have been taken from there.",

It's possible they could have trained an entirely new model between the API release and open release and botched it, but that seems wasteful even for Stability.\n\nI did a lot of testing trying to figure out what the issue was and it felt like they specifically targeted certain concepts, or combinations of concepts.

You can train back whatever you want and the model won't fight you on it.

The models people gravitated toward vs. the ones they rejected weren't just about technical quality — they mapped pretty closely to different aesthetic sensibilities. Some people were all about photorealism, others wanted painterly, others wanted weird surreal outputs. The \"best\" model was never universal, it was always personal. Kinda interesting how our AI art preferences end up being a fingerprint of taste.*",

With basic controls for temperature, max tokens, top-P, etc. \n\nI'd kinda like something like this UI to just run in the background and endlessly generate songs while I work. But I don't want to have to go in and manually type lyrics every time. If you do add an endless mode, to prevent disk wear, maybe have it cache the last N songs in memory (up to like 1024 MB or something, make it configrable), and then have a little button next to the songs on the song list to save it to disk. Allowing you to only save the songs you want. And then just prune any songs pushed out of the cache (FILO) that weren't manually saved pruned from the song list. \n\nAnd then for seamless/gapless playback have it generate 1 (or some other value, also configrable) songs ahead so there's no gaps. And then add song crossfading as an option if you don't have it already. \n\nI can add this feature and submit a PR if it's not something you want to work on. I've done a bit of work with openai and vLLM API interfaces in the past. Though my JS skills aren't super polished. I'm mostly a python, C/C++, and assembly kind of guy (I like reverse engineering).",

For me, one of the bigger things about AI music is the vocals, because if it was just instrumentals, that's nothing special that I could not already do. Even now I produce music in FL studio, remix it with Suno to add a little more extra to it and to give me a vocalist.\n\nBut for fun, I do prompt some music for the challenge in it.\n\nFor me equally, if there is going to be local gen worthy of cancelling Suno over, it's gotta have that vocalist ability (I know there are some standalone AI vocalist things, but I rather have a one in done shot). I am DYING to be able to train an AI music model as I have some fun things to toss at it. \n\n>I wish a lot of generative AI would focus more on being an asset (like a piece of background music for a video game, or a TV show, or whatever), rather than a standalone piece.\n\nLike these?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltqFda08D6Y\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UWnrVxn9Dk4\n\nLTX2 for video. Suno (Latest v5 model even) for the audio. Instrumental Dark ambient music prompted using some music theory to shape the prompt. Many of my dark ambient tracks to me are more background music for videos, now thanks to comfyUI, I can now put some visualizations around that and am working on some things.\n\nBut I think for any local model to even compete at a non-vocal level it needs to be able to solo instrument ability. People will try to argue that no AI model can do that (even most suno users argue it's not possible), but I can do that all day long in Suno and even enjoy the fight to be able to prompt it. I even publish these following tracks for proof they were generated via prompt only in suno.\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/bIheMysrBnWtm2rE\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/3p35kBh6qpigv9YY\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/84zIw834kpLvWB4C\n\nEven uncanny instrument pairings with only a piano and theremin https://suno.com/s/IToFQB6qL5BvZA57 \n\nWhen the local models can do that, those models can be more idea for video and game use as not everything will require a full band performance.",

The current version is locked to this specific atlas layout (grid) because that's what was in the dataset.\n3. You're right about SpriteFonts! Since the output is already a consistent grid, it should be pretty easy to slice and use in game engines.\n\nIf you try it with different inputs, let me know how it goes!",

Good work.\n\nThere's some interesting bias on the S and g (in those cases), it seems like the model, at least from the just examples, likes to keep those as close to standard as possible, even when the design might not look best in that shape (see g in #4 example).\n\nBut that's 3 or 4 letters to design instead of 62+ which is a huge boon to fun font designers. I'm keen to see if I could design a font at this point now, it could be really cool with your pipeline to a ttf.",

Since Flux has such a strong internal understanding of typography, it sometimes tries to 'correct' the shape back to a standard form if the style isn't aggressive enough.\n\nHowever, looking at the generations, I've seen it produce quite a variety of 'g' styles (open, looped, cursive) depending on the input. It’s a balancing act between the LoRA's style and the model's priors. But yeah, saving time on the other 60+ glyphs is the main goal!",

Structured fonts with outlines and shadows are definitely the 'final boss' for this V1. The main bottleneck is the 1024x1024 resolution—when you fit 50+ glyphs into that space, each individual letter has very few pixels to define complex details like double outlines or consistent shadows.\n\nYour suggestion about iterating through letter pairs is a great one for high-end quality, though it would sacrifice the 'one-shot' speed which was the main goal for this version.\n\nI agree that it’s not a 100% replacement for a pro typographer yet, but I hope it still serves as a solid starting point that saves at least some of the grunt work.

It is actually **pre-loaded** in the CLIP Text Encode node (the green one) in the included ComfyUI workflow, and there’s a Note node right above it explaining exactly that.\n\nHowever, I see your point: not everyone starts with the workflow. I’ll add the prompt directly to the HuggingFace, GitHub and Reddit descriptions to make it clearer for everyone.\n\nAs for the LoRA’s role: you nailed it! That’s why I called it a **contextual LoRA**. FLUX is amazing at understanding style from a reference, but it doesn't know how to organize that style into a structured 8x9 alphabet atlas on its own. The LoRA provides that 'logical bridge' and ensures the grid consistency. Without it, the model just generates a mess of styled characters, as seen in your example.",

Sure, there are richer, more interactive textbooks (more like were; that was a brief blip in history where people had hope in tablets, and started designing textbooks with deep, interactive infographics... it was a vision for the future that never panned out). But what even is critical thinking in this context? Room fell silent and the mood was ICY. Thankfully for Apple, there's an 'assume positive intent' rule in place and I asked a legitimate question, but man did the managers stare daggers into me. Nobody had an answer.\n\nOnly a few short years later, it turned out iPads were frying kids' brains, and companies stopped trying to make useful, creative, and informative apps, and rushed to cash in on addictive, exploitative user interface design. That was one of the most sickening forks in the road of human history that I had the misfortune of bearing firsthand witness to.\n\nBut yeah... This video brought back some memories.",

Few minor problems like his hairline shifting at 21 to 22 seconds etc.  But this is great, I can tell a lot of work went into making this unlike most ai slop.\n\nNothing a half hour in after effects couldn't clean up to make it look perfect.  You could just use Mocha to mask him and then apply an edge gausian blur of like 0.1px in some scenes to soften him, fix the hairline manually it's just like 3 frames, and add some directional blur to some spots (mostly the feet) and match the original shot pretty much 1:1.\n\n\nThe annoying part is you would have to color grade pretty hard to get rid of that weird contrasty look LTX gives every i2v video making it pretty much useless for extending real footage that it didn't originally create.",

Looks more like a counterpart of Udio at this point. Also, I was unable to produce any cover, based on the uploaded song. It just generates an empty song with periodic \"Sputnik 1\" sounds inbetween. Making the song parodies based on existing works was #1 reason why I wanted a local counterpart of Suno.",

But in other people's cases that I saw, the generation can take for over a minute or even several minutes, even though their GPU can fit the model fully. So I suppose it depends on your hardware, since the DiT model simply does more things than unet model.\n\nGranted, this speed difference is justified to me by better details on the same resolution and better prompt adherence.",

The Anima (preview) is so undertrained that it's quality is closer to SD 1.5 in that regards. SDXL (Illustrious) has come a long way to this point, and I think Anima would took much more finetunes to get it right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9u9iq2my6ig1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c94b558f337ffa62da455a5dee016447c33460d3\n\n*(left) Anima preview; (right) Illustrious finetunes: UnholyDesireMix v7*\n\nBoth is using similar prompt without additional refining/LoRA at 512x512 resolution, only using inherent artist tag prompt:\n\n    @mika_pikazo. masterpiece, best quality. 1girl, score_8, score_9. murasaki shion from hololive, she is wearing white summer dress, looking at viewer with annoyed face, she is holding a greatsword with both hands, the sword design reminds of magic knight rayearth swords. white background. chromatic aberration. modern anime style, late 2020. multiple splash of paint decoration in background with colors: cyan, shocking pink, and yellow. Giant stylish text written \"ASUNA\" with smaller text written \"pactio\".\n\nwith negatives:\n\n    worst quality, low quality, score_1, score_2, score_3, score_4, score_5, score_6, blurry, jpeg artifacts, sepia, badly drawn finger\n\nI'm trying to jumble up as many unrelated things in one composition to see how it goes **(characters) (clothings) (items from other IP) (color sampling) (multiple text formats)**. With Illustrious removed the score tags and replaced \"@\" with \"by\" for the artists tag. What most people didn't seems to know is that Illustrious model also capable of natural language prompt to some degree.\n\nI love what Anima brings to the table as 2B model, more model variations for us to use is always welcome but I think the quality needs further refine. Also no, it's not '*Illustrious killer*' as many people prophesize it to be, at least not yet with this quality. If there is one thing that I would say stood up against SDXL right now is how it could renders written text better, but the longer your prompt the less likely it succeed in doing so.",

The lighting is harsh, resembling a cheap camcorder flash or washed-out indoor lighting. In the bottom left corner, there is a glowing white, pixelated digital timestamp that reads '11:27 PM' with a slight black drop shadow.

Any checkpoint trained now will have compatibility issues with Loras trained on later previews and might inherit issues that will be solved in later previews. Any good practices researched/discovered now might get outdated in the next versions.\n\nSo yeah, we'll need to wait for the official release, or at least for very late previews.

I should be able to enable two loras, prompt the characters, and have them function properly with natural language just like characters the base model knows.

But now I select the accelerator nodes and BYPASS them:\n\n* High: 4 steps (5,28s/it)\n* Low: 8 steps (5,89s/it)\n* Total: 90,63 seconds\n\nJust... how? When I try to run another resolution it fails: RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (104) must match the size of tensor b (160) at non-singleton dimension 4\n\nThen I just disable the bypass, run once with the nodes enabled, 5 seconds, 832x480, but now 4 steps. Nodes enabled:\n\n* High: 1 steps (2,27s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (3,33s/it)\n* Total: 29,07 seconds\n\nDisable the node:\n\n* High: 1 step (2,26s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (2,04s/it)\n* Total: 19,98 seconds\n\nVideo's came out fine, no weird stuff. But it's cache, so I changed the prompt a little: basically same vid no prompt adherence (same time, about 21 sec). Changed the prompt more:\n\n* High: 1 step (2,32s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (2,09s/it)\n* Total: 29,22 seconds\n\nThis is more like the regular speed. Don't have time right now but I will certainly investigate this further. \n\nAfter not-bypassing and bypassing the nodes, I can change the seed, bump up the amount of steps (with visible improvements) but when I try to make the video longer it fails.

Comfy exists because of them, and this grant is our way of giving back and continuing to empower the ecosystem.\n\nI know, I know, $1M alone won’t train a state-of-the-art foundation model today. That’s okay. This is just the starting point. Beyond direct funding, we also support grantees with real-world evaluation, production testing, and promotion across the Comfy platform.\n\nGrant recipients retain full control over their model and license (as long as it remains open) and can automatically enroll in our Cloud revenue share program to further sustain the project.\n\nWe can’t wait to see all the amazing open source models that come out of this effort.\n\nApply for the grant at [https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant](https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant)\n\nFYI: you can try out the Anima model here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima)",

While it was said to be for ease of organization, the reality is that this makes it easy to replace anyone from top to bottom. \n\nThese kind of moves, along with throwing around big money, and corps seeing monetary interest in the project, tend to signal a coming buyout by a big investor. Whether or not comfy will be able to withstand temptation when that arrives, or for how long, is a situation that the SD community needs to realistically consider. \n\nAt the moment, their flagship platform remains available by the good will of one person.

Add on QoL and Bonus features like Vibe Transfer, Character Reference, and the new “Prompt Chunks” incantation system, and it is a gold standard that, while it is DEFINITELY at risk of losing its position, is currently still worth the money, if it can be afforded.\n\nThat being said, I am DEFINITELY excited at the premise of not having to pay money for that level of quality, so I will watch this grant and its supportees with GREAT anticipation.",

It feels like a hybrid approach, which actually works really well.\n\nIn my opinion, Anima has the potential to replace both IllustriousXL and Z-Image for anime use cases.\n\nThat said, I still feel like we’re missing the definitive model for this niche.  \nIllustriousXL looks great and is uncensored, and its tag-based caption system is convenient but limitations.

A lot of modals work in different ways, lots of options have been removed and just left. For example we had this old asset list with all generations. That was good, it opened on single click. Now we have a new asset list where we need to double click. (why?) And even worse, the new asset list just stops workling after a couple of hundred gens. Sometimes earlier. Never happened with the old asset list. \n\nThe we have this new panel on the right. The job queue. It cumbersome and doesnt really help me. No way to hide it. It shows super small thumbnails and parts of my filename. Dont need this taking away my screenstate... except when i need to cancel queued jobs\n\nWe had cancel and stop buttons. What a great invention that was. Until you took them away. Cancel button is back now (thanks!!!) but stop button still missing. Of course i can click that weird icon in the job-queue that will cancel all other jobs except the current on. But if i am on instant gen (and i am often on instant gen) it keeps going. I have to switch to single run, click run, cancel the other jobs, cancel the current job just to stop it all. It was a single button before all these updates. It takes me 4 clicks now to stop the instant generations. its painful.\n\nI dunno. The UI in comfy is all but comfy. I know this is free software. I did not a pay a cent. But all these options were in there at one point and then the enterprisification of the software has started. \n\nSo please bring back the stop button. That would be real nice.",

We don't have a proper idea of how it does with modern anime screencaps, or even retro anime screencaps, which are what most people would expect from this kind of model.\n\nAt first, I thought it was weird the creator posted that only super low quality flash art example and the first two threads didn't even attempt to use examples people would legitimately care about, but since then this response has continued in every single Anima post I can find it has now become weird. Can it really just not do 90s, 2000s, etc. anime screen-cap outputs? Is it really that biased and trained almost exclusively on Deviant art and such works? I've seen two iffy random user comment examples, and one was extremely bad as if it couldn't understand the prompt.\n\nWell, utterly poor publicity and information aside I don't want to assume it DOA until it has a chance to prove itself but I'm definitely not feeling hopeful about it at this point. It is kind of looking to potentially be ultra niche though...",

The preview model was trained, as far as I was told, on 512px images, but generates 1024px at the moment (can have issues with higher res).\n\nAs for being \"just another model\", it already caught attention of the community, even though it's just a preview.
