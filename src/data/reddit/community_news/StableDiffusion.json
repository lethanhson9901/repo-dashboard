Further, the distill lora is supposed to go in step 2 only. It \"works\" if applied at stage 1 but at a big hit to prompt adherence and overall movement quality. (If you're using i2v you actually may need to apply them at a lower strength to keep them from blowing away the original image into a completely different image)\n* The prompt assist is amazing, only suggestion is to add a way to freeze it to keep generating with the same prompt, I'm working around it by disconnecting it from the next node\n* If you're using the distill lora you want high-ish steps (8-12) with high-ish CFG (3-4) on the first pass, then drop it to 1 CFG and the sigmas for the second. you can also try changing the sigmas to just 0.3046875, 0.0 as an alternative to lowering the distill lora strength",

I would just paint a white mask over the area, load a second image with \"the visible area\" and tell it to replace the white part by taking the \"area\" in the second image as reference. That should work perfectly fine.",

Your 32GB RAM meets or exceeds the minimum, helping with model offloading to system memory, though generation times may stretch to 10-25 minutes or more versus faster on 32GB+ VRAM GPUs.​\n\n# Key Optimizations\n\n* Launch ComfyUI with flags like `--reserve-vram 4` or `--reserve-vram 5` to prevent crashes.\n* Use distilled or quantized LTX-2 variants (e.g., ltx-2-19b-dev-fp4) and workflows from the official GitHub or ComfyUI templates.\n* Enable low-VRAM mode, avoid attention mechanisms if they cause issues, and start with short/low-res videos (e.g., 720p, 24fps).​​\n* Update NVIDIA drivers, ComfyUI, and custom nodes; tutorials like those from AISearch confirm it works on 3090s.​​\n\nExpect potential crashes or slowness without tuning, but community reports show it's viable.",

          "text": "Jesus, 25% of the system prompt is dedicated just for undressing and nudity? That's a little wild. I might fork this and change the system prompt cause you don't really expose it in the UI.\n\n    You are a cinematic prompt writer for LTX-2, an AI video generation model. Your job is to expand a user's rough idea into a rich, detailed, video-ready prompt.\n    \n    PRIORITY ORDER — always establish these first, in this order:\n    1. Video style & genre (e.g. slow-burn thriller, handheld documentary, high-fashion editorial, erotic cinema, action blockbuster)\n    2. Camera angle & shot type (e.g. low-angle close-up, bird's-eye wide shot, Dutch angle medium shot)\n    3. Character description (age MUST always be stated as a specific number e.g. \"a 28-year-old woman\" — never omit or approximate age; body type, hair, skin, clothing or nude state, distinguishing physical features — be extremely explicit and specific when instructed; name body parts directly using the exact words the user used, e.g. if user says \"pussy\" write \"pussy\" not \"sex\" or \"womanhood\")\n    4. Scene & environment (location, time of day, lighting, colour palette, textures, atmosphere)\n    \n    THEN add:\n    5. Action & motion — describe the movement as a continuous present-tense sequence, start to finish. Structure the action in clear beats.\n    \n    UNDRESSING RULE — this is mandatory when clothing removal is implied or stated:\n    If the subject is clothed at the start and the scene involves nudity, stripping, or explicit content, you MUST dedicate a full narrative segment to the undressing BEFORE any nudity or explicit act is described. This segment must:\n      - Name each garment explicitly (shirt, bra, jeans, underwear, shoes, etc.)\n      - Describe HOW it is removed — fingers on buttons, zipper pulled down, fabric sliding off shoulders, stepped out of, peeled away\n      - Describe what is physically REVEALED at each step — the collarbone, the stomach, the curve of the hip, the chest, the bare legs\n      - Follow the exact order the clothes come off — do not skip or compress steps\n      - Use camera-aware language — the camera lingers, cuts to, tilts down to reveal, holds on\n      - Do NOT jump from clothed to naked. The transition IS the content. Treat it as its own scene segment with the same density as any other beat.\n    \n    6. Camera movement — describe camera motion as prose, not bracketed directions. Never write \"(DOWN 10°)\", \"(Pull back)\", \"(Fade to black)\", \"(HOLD)\" or any screenplay-style bracketed camera instruction. Instead write it as description: \"the camera slowly tilts down to reveal the wet pavement\", \"the shot pulls back to frame the empty street\", \"the scene fades to black as she disappears around the corner.\"\n    7. Audio — Always include ambient sound. ONE [AMBIENT: sound 1, sound 2] tag only — never repeat it. Place it once at the natural end of the scene.\n       Dialogue — follow the DIALOGUE INSTRUCTION you are given exactly. When dialogue is included, write it as inline prose woven into the action — not as a labelled tag. The spoken words sit inside the sentence, attributed with delivery and physical action, exactly like a novel. Examples of correct format:\n       'He leans back, satisfied, \"I think I'll have to go back tomorrow for more,\" he chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners.'\n       '\"Don\\'t stop,\" she breathes, gripping the sheets, her voice barely above a whisper.'\n       'She turns to face him, \"I\\'ve been waiting all day for this,\" her tone quiet and certain.'\n       NEVER use [DIALOGUE: ...] tags. NEVER write dialogue as a separate bracketed block. Dialogue flows inside the prose as part of the action.\n    \n    WRITING RULES:\n    - Use present tense throughout\n    - Be explicit and cinematic — LTX-2 responds well to dense, specific visual language\n    - Match detail level to shot scale: close-ups need more physical detail, wide shots need more environmental detail\n    - Do not use vague words like \"beautiful\" or \"nice\" — describe exactly what makes it visually striking\n    - Fill the full available length — do not stop early. Expand every section with rich, layered detail\n    - Aim for 8–12 sentences of dense, flowing prose — not a bullet list\n    - Write in sections separated by a single line break for clean model parsing\n    \n    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the expanded prompt. Do NOT include preamble, commentary, labels, or any explanation. Do NOT write \"Sure!\", \"Here's your prompt:\", or anything like that. Do NOT add a checklist, compliance summary, note, or confirmation of instructions at the end — not in brackets, not as a \"Note:\", not in any form. The output ends when the scene ends. Nothing after the last sentence of the scene. Begin immediately with the video style or shot description.",

This model is very similar to the architecture of Nano Banana Pro.\n\nAs always, proof is in the pudding.",

If macs are doing poorly because they're compute bound with Diffusion, then yeah, KV caching in auto-regressive helps, arguably, but it's really nuanced.\n\nLLMs are actually moving to diffusion to an extent because it's just logically a better use of hardware resources for single-user. Diffusion models are pretty nice because they're stronger per unit of VRAM used (they're a bit stronger per parameter). It's kind of like they trade extra compute for extra performance compared to a raw autoregressive.\n\nBut the thing about that is that most hardware (even CPUs) have spare compute at a higher ratio than bandwidth, relatively speaking, and so with autoregressive models the first thing anyone does for single-user inference is try to retroactively convert it into a block-diffusion model or use speculative decoding heads or something like that to get faster performance.",

Any examples of prompts that fail and you think a model should be capable of? With every model release we get closer to nano banana pro capabilities, but it's definitely incremenetal improvements and not massive leaps like we've seen with closed source models.",

I also did something similar, but your results are better, because I used existing character, quality prompts and aesthetically-tuned checkpoint of illustrious, so styles had some bias. Also it's super convenient that you made a website with it, I really appreciate it!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2np0duupw3kg1.png?width=1787&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cd5400cbaae35c3066c7c12477db72366753fc\n\nPersonally, I think that artist tags is one of the most powerful features of danbooru-trained models, because the model knows 1000+ different styles without any loras or other fine-tuning methods. Although it's hard to remember all the artists whose styles I like, so your project is extremely helpful, thanks again!",

The community has made “lite” versions or stripped down version to work on lower VRAM configurations but it does degrade the outcome. \n\nAlso we are at a point where cards like the A6000 would be able to handle many of the newer models on user systems BUT that card is at least 8k to 10k and states that way for years….\n\nThis is called the Red Queen Effect. It states that everything advances so everything else also has to advance just to keep up.  Because the SoTA (closed source) models keeps moving too, the relative gap stays the same. Everyone is running but nobody is actually gaining ground …",

However, dancing can work well.\n\nFrom: https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/prompting-guide-for-ltx-2\n\nLTX 2.5/3.0 will be 10/10 if it can fix this kind of issue though, hopefully without sacrificing too much speed.",

Glad to see its working with out throwing errors (in console) like the earlier version I had!\n\nSeems like the lora's desaturate and use a cooler lighting at the cost of some loss of fine detail in skin while improving hair, my subjective opinion.  \n\nBelow is same prompt for the 3 edits with fk9b (not base), I like more realistic subsurface scattering of light on skin. This was only a quick test, fk9b is very settings sensitive and this could be dialed in further i'm sure.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m1ay0tb9rjg1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f624fb12cc6f48f39675877b3f7a281f4112c3\n\n",

That is why AFAIK, except for LTX, all current generation video models, both open and close ones, are all from major corporations.  \n\nSo open weight models will only come out of well funded organizations.\n\nBut plenty of data is out there, just think of how many Blu-rays one can buy if you have the fund.

It was only a few months ago that VEO 3 was crushing everything. \n\nVeo, Kling, Seedance are going to be the top dogs for awhile - American censorship could handicap Veo. Depending on how much backing Open Ai gets after its budget deficit will make or break Sora, and depending on how much Elon Musk fucks up will depend if Grok rises to contend with the top ones.\n\nUnfortunately I don’t think local generation is going to be able to keep up, at least on the video front. In a year everything I’ve seen from local generation has been leapfrogged by paid services. Personally I spent so much time going from A111 to learning and troubleshooting Comfyui, and now I don’t see much point going any deeper.",

With a more focused dataset it would get each a bit better. \n\n\nThis worked well though, not much breakup and it got the bands pretty well. As usual there are tricks for cleaning audio like on distill model you can turn the steps on inference up to 150, on the sft I can crank from 300-500 steps. Things for all of you to try out. ",

Basically they saved about 30% iteration time by reducing maximum clip (cloning) duration to 12 seconds. If you went over it, it would auto reduce the clip length.\n\nSo when it initially released the outputs were way better than they are now, by at least 50% I'd say. The cloning quality was better because I mean it had more data to work with when it created quick finetunes during cloning. And after the change it just sounded way words.\n\nIf you use F5 now you will notice that on longer sentences or even just randomly the output will be playing and then towards the end it will completely bork out and sound degraded. This rarely happened in the old version and when it did, it was more isolated towards the end of the clip and less intense.\n\nIt really made me sad because at the time F5 was the cream of the crop and would clone anything. I mean it still does but this problem is much more prevalent now.",

          "text": "Hi everyone! 👋\n\nI've been training a lot of Characters LoRAs recently (ZIT, ZIB, QWEN and WAN2.2), and I always struggled with the same problem: **\"Is this version actually better, or am I just biased?\"**\n\nChecking generated images one by one is subjective (and sometimes that may be ok!). Sometimes a LoRA looks great frontally but loses the likeness entirely when the head turns. Sometimes it makes the subject look 10 years younger (plastic skin effect).\n\nSo, I decided to build a tool for myself to measure this objectively. It turned out pretty useful, so I cleaned up the code and I'm sharing it with the community.\n\n**Introducing MirrorMetric** 🔬 It’s a local Python script that uses **InsightFace (ArcFace)** to analyze your generated images against your training dataset. It generates a standalone, interactive HTML dashboard.\n\n**What it visualizes:**\n\n* **Cosine Similarity (Boxplots):** Exact mathematical resemblance to your subject.\n* **Identity Map (t-SNE):** See if your LoRA clusters with your dataset or drifts away.\n* **Pose Stability (The \"Profile Test\"):** A scatter plot showing Yaw/Pitch of the head vs Similarity. It highlights if your model \"breaks\" at extreme angles. *This was a game changer for me to spot rigid models.*\n* **Age Distribution:** Checks if the model is biasing the age (e.g., de-aging or incr-aging).\n* **Dataset Cleaner:** It helps identify outliers in your reference images using a \"Leave-One-Out\" validation method.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Put your training photos in the Reference\\_Images Folder.\n2. Generate a batch of images with your LoRA (I usually do 10 prompts x 5 seeds to have enough data) and put them in the Lora\\_Candidates folder separating each run in different subfolders.\n3. Run the script.\n4. Open the HTML dashboard.\n\nIt runs locally (privacy focused) and supports CUDA if you have an NVIDIA GPU, but can also work on CPU, just take a bit more time .\n\n**Repo & Download:** [https://github.com/AndyLone22/MirrorMetrics](https://github.com/AndyLone22/MirrorMetrics)\n\n**Link to the USAGE GUIDE on CivitAI:** [https://civitai.com/articles/26241](https://civitai.com/articles/26241)\n\nI'm not a pro developer, just a passionate tinkerer, so the code might be a bit rough, but I think it works! Ora at least, it's helped me clean my dataset to get better LoRAs and to understand which ones have more rigidity over resemblance.\n\nBe patient, It's my first post on reddit, but I really wanted to share this with anyone who might be interested! 😊\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions on how to improve the metrics, or if you'd add anything else, and of course it's Open Source, I've placed it under MIT licence, so anyone can use it for their own projects.\n\nLet me know what you think!",

I think Comfy has some nodes about training, but I haven't been able to play with them too much, since I don't have the hardware to do massive training locally and I have to go to runpod and similar, so using AiToolkit's template is quick and standardized. I'm not a mathematician nor a Deep Learning expert so I cannot do code training on my own and this setup has helped me start at least.\n\nRight now we are all building isolated silos. My tool is standalone exactly because there's no unified pipeline to plug it into yet, and I wouldn't really know how to begin. I've just now started using GitHub because this is the first thing I felt could be useful to others. \n\nu/MatlowAI , 'A mess of Python, Rust and React' actually sounds like a solid foundation for performance. 😅 If you ever decide to open source it (even in a broken/alpha state), let me know. MirrorMetric is designed to be modular internally; it wouldn't be hard to strip the GUI and wrap the logic as a 'Validation Node' inside a larger graph-based trainer.\n\nWe definitely need to stop reinventing the wheel in private repos!",

So the Standard Loss keeps the anatomy/composition coherent (preventing the 5 hands), while the ID Loss gently nudges the face to look more like the target. It's definitely a balancing act!

I only have the one of myself but I'm not willing to share that on the internet 😅 \n\nSo I will make a try run maybe with a generated character or with a celebrity (not sure if that's legal, I'll check that too) just to make a comprehensive guide to show, I'll even see if I can make a video tutorial about it. Stay tuned and in the meantime if you have more specific questions please ask here so I can answer for everybody. \n\nBtw If you look in the replies before, I've already given some examples of use and explanations on the graphs.\n\nFor example in the Git Hub Page there's this little starting guide I made:\n\nYou put the dataset you used to train your LoRA in the Reference\\_Images folder and the generated images in the Lora\\_Candidates folder (Create one folder for each LoRA you want to compare. The name of the folder will be used as the name of the LoRA in the dashboard.).\n\nYou can have more LoRAs from the same training, maybe with different settings, or different steps, for example. Or you could have LoRA trained for entirely different models, that's fine too.\n\nThen you run the script and it will generate a dashboard with all the metrics. The way I use it the most at the moment is:\n\n* Compare the plots for the dataset, to see if I have some outliers that can skew the results.\n* Compare the plots for the LoRAs, to see which one is the most consistent with the dataset, especially graph one which shows the general similarity score of the various images compared to the median of the dataset.\n* Look at the plots 5 and 6 to see if the LoRA is good at generating the face in different angles and how much does it tend to do so (of course mind the prompts you're using, if you specifically tell it to generate a right profile image of course you'll have a bunch of dots on the right side of the graph).",

          "text": "So on one hand this seems really good. On the other hand, I question how useful it'll be when you try to do anything that's not like, 1 to 1. What I mean is, it might be able to grasp success in terms of 'is this face right.' But if you're, say, trying to train based on a face and an outfit, or multiple outfits, then this probably isn't useful, because your training data is going to be too complex for something like this to use. For example, if you're training a character with multiple outfits, then your dataset likely is too diverse for this to be able to do any good. \n\nOr, to use another example, even if you DO only have one outfit to work with, you likely don't want that to be baked in, and you want it to be able to generate images both with and without it. You don't want it so trained that the outfit is packaged with the face in every situation. But this wouldn't be able to measure that. \n\nAnd if we put styles into the mix, then this really isn't useful, because the whole testing of a lora with styles is seeing if the lora overpowers the style lora or not. \n\nSo basically, this feels like something that is only useful if A. you're training on a real person's face and B. you have a dataset that inexplicably has that person's head in multiple directions and places. \n\nIt's impressive, but it doesn't seem like something that is practical for most use cases. The core issue being 'better' is entirely subjective. One version might do face and outfit better, but it's also baked in and can't do it without it. So that means the previous one which would score lower is better. \n\nI guess if you're really trying to nail a real person's face, that might work? But again, in order for it to map and judge based on the data, you'd need to have data of that face in every possible pose. Mathematically speaking, if your dataset is all front shots, then it's going to say your lora is bad if you generate a side profile because it's not going to match. \n\nI mean, it's impressive that you made this, but it doesn't seem useful?",

              "text": "This is a really high-quality critique, thank you for writing it out! You touched on the core dilemma of LoRA training (**Flexibility vs. Likeness**).\n\nHowever, there is one technical misconception regarding how the math in InsightFace/ArcFace works, and clarifying it might explain why this tool can be actually useful even for diverse datasets:\n\n**1. The \"Pose\" Misconception** You wrote: *\"If your dataset is all front shots, then it's going to say your lora is bad if you generate a side profile.\"* Actually, this is not entirely accurate: The underlying tech (ArcFace) maps facial features into a 512-dimensional vector space that is largely **pose-invariant**. It doesn't match pixels; it matches biometric identity. I have successfully tested LoRAs trained on front-facing data, generated a side-profile, and the algorithm correctly identified them as the same person with a high score. That's the beauty of using embeddings instead of pixel comparison.\n\n**2. \"Better\" is indeed subjective** You are absolutely right here. A score of `0.95` doesn't mean \"Perfect LoRA\", it often means \"**Overfitted/Baked-in mess**\". But a score of `0.30` definitely means \"Identity Lost\".\n\n**How I use this tool practically:** I use it to find the **\"Sweet Spot\"**. I want the lowest possible score that still registers as the character (usually around **0.65 - 0.75**).\n\n* If I get `0.90` \\-> The LoRA is too rigid (trash it).\n* If I get `0.40` \\-> The LoRA doesn't look like the person (trash it).\n\nIt’s not a \"God Metric\" that tells you if the art is good. **It’s a tachometer.** It's not black or white, it's just numbers. Just because the engine is revving at 8000RPM doesn't mean you are driving well, but it's useful to know so you don't blow up the engine!\n\n**One last point:** This is about the *face*, not the outfit. If you're training a Character LoRA you want to be able to produce images of that character in as many positions/sceneries/outfits possible, that's why it's important to check for biometric similarities regardless of the clothes.\n\nI don't know if I'm explaining this all right, sorry if my english is off sometimes, it's not my mother tongue 😅",
