However, the solution is the lack of a LoRa for hands, object and person focus, feet, faces, and human anatomy. I say this because I saw the first LoRas in Civitai and I'm surprised by how much they improve in several of the aspects I mentioned.\n\nAlso, the best clip I've seen with complex scenes is the one uploaded by the user with an RTX 6000 Pro: [reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1q9cy02/ltx2\\_i2v\\_quality\\_is\\_much\\_better\\_at\\_higher/](http://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1q9cy02/ltx2_i2v_quality_is_much_better_at_higher/), but it was created at extremely high resolutions that can't be reproduced on consumer hardware. Even so, it's not perfect, but it looks much better than this example in this clip.\n\nI know everyone loves nsfw LoRas because they create adult content, but I wish they could also create generic LoRas. I would create them, but it's impossible without the necessary datasets and the right hardware. I hope the community can help. It's not their obligation, But it would allow many of us to use this model Professionally! 🤗\n\nAnd I hope that Ltx-2 will make improvements with an upscaler since it's the king of OEMs...",

The distortion's minimal, with a quality similar to Wan2.2 including background sharpness.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem with LTX-2's with distant shots: it doesn't focus well and distorts people, objects, and especially hands at the resolutions used by those of us with more modest hardware. I say this because the A6000 costs more than a SUV.\n\nThe most stable shots with LTX-2're close-ups, where the subjects're more visible and the distance to the background isn't as large.\n\nI know many people don't like comparisons, but I often work with distant shots, and there's not much that can be done about it. Besides, it's unavoidable because they're currently the two best video generators, and many of us, like myself, don't need audio in some projects!😉",

It looks complicated and can be pretty intimidating at first, but if you give it a chance, after a few weeks it’ll start to make sense without much trouble.\n\nThere are tons of tutorials there, although a lot has changed since then. ComfyUI looks different now, the models used in those tutorials are already outdated, and some of them aren’t really used anymore because we have much better models today.\n\nThat said, it’s still worth watching because it explains very clearly what does what and how the tool works overall.\n\nGood luck!",

But.... when it comes to prompting and getting each to give me what I want from a text prompt (starting with an image), they're both woefully difficult.  Sometimes you get something you like but rarely do you get what you specifically asked for.  When I started using AI for video and images a few years ago, it was just as difficult to get a character to do something seemingly simple like walking through a door entering a room as it is today so while the quality of the video and the processing/rendering speed have really improved, I'm not so sure the output and control of the output has improved at nearly the same rate.",

          "text": "Wow, great work, I'm glad the workflow I made is working out for you, but Kijai definitely deserves the credit for creating the initial i2v workflow on the distilled model (8 steps LCM simple) that accepts an uploaded sound file. \n\nI've done a LOT of testing with that workflow over the past few days and for \"real\" persons I can say it's NOT a good workflow. If you start with a realistic person photo, the face typically distorts into plasticky/waxy skin and start to all look alike unless the anatomy of the face was really distinctive. The body will distort quite a bit as well and any skin details in the image either get distorted or completely lost.\n\nThat being said, this workflow is fantastic for Animated 3D CGI looking images like the one you used. \n\nFor realistic image i2v using a submitted audio file, I've actually switched to the latest Wan2GP using Pinokio. The latest version of Wan2GP does fantastic, it has some really improved memory handling and I can do 720p videos 20seconds long with lip sync on a 4090 and 64gb system RAM. \n\nOn both Wan2GP and the ComfyUI workflow referenced in this post, it's super important to use the static camera lora if you want to get videos working on Portrait images. I'll update my original wokflow to include a download link to that lora and where to plug it in.",

From the moment we released, this community jumped in and started creating configuration tweaks, sharing workflows, and posting optimizations here, on, Discord, Civitai, and elsewhere. We've honestly lost track of how many custom LoRAs have been shared. And we're only two weeks in.\n\nWe committed to continuously improving the model based on what we learn, and today we pushed an update to GitHub to address some issues that surfaced right after launch.\n\n**What's new today:**\n\n**Latent normalization node for ComfyUI workflows** \\- This will dramatically improve audio/video quality by fixing overbaking and audio clipping issues.\n\n**Updated VAE for distilled checkpoints** \\- We accidentally shipped an older VAE with the distilled checkpoints. That's fixed now, and results should look much crisper and more realistic.\n\n**Training optimization** \\- We’ve added a low-VRAM training configuration with memory optimizations across the entire training pipeline that significantly reduce hardware requirements for LoRA training. \n\nThis is just the beginning. As our co-founder and CEO mentioned in last week's AMA, LTX-2.5 is already in active development. We're building a new latent space with better properties for preserving spatial and temporal details, plus a lot more we'll share soon. Stay tuned.\n\n",

It's a running video so it's more complex to fix than simply better architecture and better datasets obviously. But this is an obvious flaw that I noticed\n\n2. Anytime the word \"asian\" come up, I noticed some generation burns subtitles into the generation. The correlation is there as the more \"asian\" word is mentioned the more likely the generation has burned subtitles in it. I assume this is because you train on asian movies with burned subtitles as well, but you should clean this up on the dataset.\n\n3. Better support for external audio. While it works, there is some conflict between the audio latent and the prompt. I notice the audio words usually tied to a character emotion and thus effect the character action eventhough the prompt says differently. Perhaps a strength dial would be great here between audio and prompt.",

                  "text": "This implementation looks very strange. Presumably the idea is to suspend sampling at some particular step, scale down the audio latent and then resume. The way it is implemented is definitely _not_ doing that. It is effectively doing a Euler step to 0 from whatever the current sigma is, then renoising with the same noise, same seed as the beginning. The only way this could be resuming sampling is if the model had predicted the initial noise exactly at each step which would never happen. This is likely to produce some very weird effects, especially if you do it multiple times in a generation. What you're trying to do would work much more reliably as something like a model patch.\n\nIf you really want to do it in a sampler, since the sampler returns both a noisy latent and the clean latent, you actually could extract the noise, scale the latent, and then using the existing noise to resume sampling. You would need to make an instance of ComfyUI's noise generator object to pass in that returns that specific noise. See: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/blob/0c6b36c6ac1c34515cdf28f777a63074cd6d563d/comfy_extras/nodes_custom_sampler.py#L697\n\nThe general idea would be something like:\n\n    noisy_latent, clean_latent = SamplerCustomAdvance(...)\n    clean_samples_scaled = your_scaling_stuff(clean_latent[\"samples\"])\n    noise_pred = noisy_latent[\"samples\"] - clean_samples_scaled\n    # You probably have to scale it back to unit strength.\n    noise_pred = noise_pred * (1 / current_sigma)\n    # ^^ Use this for NOISE when you resume sampling.\n\nI recommend doing it with a model patch instead but resuming with the existing noise would be a lot less likely to cause strange results.\n\nJust dividing the audio latent by 4 at specific steps also seems strange and is going to be very, very dependent on the exact schedule used and the exact number of steps and probably break or cause undesirable results otherwise. This will also degrade history samplers like SA solver, res_2m, etc because interrupting sampling like the current approach forces them to throw away all the history. ComfyUI model patches can see the current sigmas so this would probably work more reliably if you based audio latent strength scaling on the current sigma, or something like sampling percent (can be calculated from sigma with the model_sampling object).",

But we would like to see more attention given to your own model.\n\nImprovements're improvements, and minor updates or fixes are always welcome. Please work on the hand Lora, focus animations Lora, and human anatomy Lora to refine the next update, as it's necessary and urgent.\n\nIf anyone saw the subtitles, I only saw them in the full model and tested them all without exception. For some reason, they never appear in the destilled version, so it might be an issue with this it Lora: ltx-2-19b-distilled-lora-384.safetensors. It would be good if you looked into that.\n\nCould be good if you reduced the number of cartoons like SpongeBob and others, and instead focused on adding more data from movies or scenes where the human anatomy looks correct. I know how complicated this's for the AI, but if you don't, the model won't advance significantly in its next version.\n\nP.S.: Words can always be misinterpreted, so please be understanding and tolerant of those who don't think like you or say something incorrect. There're many people like me who don't speak perfect English and rely on a translator who might make mistakes. Have a great day! 😎",

Yeah, I need to really do prompt enhancement using the built in node to an LLM, but right now I'm just testing for i2v quality. I haven't invested time in prompt exploration yet. The CFG is set to 3 by the way, you can change that as you see fit. There's also a detailed negative prompt in the workflow but the node needs to be expanded to see what's in it.\n\nYou're literally the first person to ask about the prompt. I guess I can edit the body of the post to include that note.",

Using AI to analyze the image and give a fairly short prompt and then LTX2 just moves camera. Like some kind of filter or default behavior. When I type out a simple prompt it generally has worked, but even then I saw a short simple prompt have 1 person blink and all 3 subjects stayed motionless as it zoomed in on the person that blinked. Pretty sure I included static camera. Often enough I sent I sent them a message cause I'm paying through official API and expected better output.\n\n\nI havent used ComfyUI in awhile and im curious what your using it on/through.

For 20s, it's between 6-8 minutes on my system and I think that's a great sweet spot. Plus, with a static camera lora, the video just becomes uninteresting focused on one shot for that long. I feel this workflow is limited to being just one tool for a nice close up or portrait of a lip sync shot for either music or dialogue.   \n  \nA lot of people use iterations per second as a performance measurement but for me I think a more useful statistic to mention would be: How many seconds does it take to produce 1s of video at resolution X and overall video length Y - hopefully that makes sense. \n\nI'm fine with producing videos in short chunks from 5s to 20s and then stitching them together later and even going back and adding higher quality dialogue/music in the post process. This is just an opinion, but  I don't think a video model really needs to be able to do videos longer than 20s. With wan 5-8seconds was definitely too short, but LTX-2 does really well between 10s-20s on most hardware and I think that's fantastic especially since it includes audio or the ability to have lip synced external audio.",

Prompts that describe the person speaking and actually including some of the words spoken in the audio like the first sentence or first 3-5 words of the vocals if it's a music track.\n\n3. Prompt the speaking style or emotions\n\n\"A video of a woman singing. She sings with subtle and fluid movements and a happy expression. She sings with emotion and passion. static camera.\"\n\n  \nIf none of those tips work, maybe try another image as a sanity check or make sure the image you're using has a visible face (eyes, mouth, nose), etc. \n\nLastly, if you don't mind sharing your start image, I can try to see if I can get it to work.

Every system will have a different sweet spot for resolution and length that won't give an OOM or won't take more than 10 minutes so that's why I haven't made notes saying this workflow will achieve a certain performance on X system. Anyone who uses this workflow has to experiment for themsevles to see if will be useful to them or not. I guess I need to add that as a disclaimer, lol.",

This is only 1 tool for LTX-2, I'm sure newer ones or better ones will come along. I'm just glad there's a way to get a decent quality by messing with the distill lora strength in the upscaler which is really the point of this video - to show quality improvement from literally 1 little setting in the workflow.",

I started out with the distilled models but then tried the \"non\" distilled one finally and immediately saw better results. Another redditor who I credited in the body of the post pointed out that quality is better when you use the non-distilled model which has the 384 lora in only the upscaler second stage at .6 strength and that's when I went back and made this video once I confirmed they were totally right.\n\nI haven't even looked at the GGUFs yet since the non-GGUF non-distilled model works really well for me. I don't know if there is a non-distilled GGUF out there but switch to that if you can.\n\nAnother property of the non-distilled is that you have to use 20-25 steps.

So ideally it should come with benefits. But it doesn't because there is nothing gained except 'cleaning up'... but a well laid out workflow with a user familiar with comfyui will find it easier to get used to nodes, than all the get/set which is obfuscating the process employed.\n\nI agree it can look messy, but it's just part and parcel of node based workflows. But it's hugely readable.\nYou can click any node on the board and see where it links to, and where links come in from.\nYou can then go straight to them in moments. You can click the wire and drop in new nodes.\n\n\nWith any tool you want to remove stuff you don't need. But we NEED the wires. They give us a lot of useful information in a visual way very simply.\nGet/set hides the information, hides the link, hides where else it's used.\n\n\nPerhaps if ComfyUI had tools to manage get/set so you could click a set, and the gets that are linked flashed or something to get your attention easily (like wires), then fine.\nBut they don't.\n\n\nLay it out well with the node links visible. Show your working and play to the strengths of the node based workflow.\nHiding it plays to it's weaknesses and without replacing those revealed weaknesses with nothing better you're just creating worse work.\n\nAt no point do you hide the wires, unless you want to make your life hell when you come back to a project a year or two later!\n\n\nI suppose I should be grateful things are spread out a bit and the get/set aren't hidden under the larger nodes haha.

I think instead of ruining our childhoods, the worst part is going to be validating weird fuzzy memories of a half-remembered scene that got meme'd to death.\n\nWhat's funny to me is that the gen ai community is so split between people who hyperfixate on the f8p20bt2v64gbmp3iptv4k settings and the people who think you just click a link to make Cookie Monster swear.  Any given day, someone could put out 3 lines of code and this sub is flooded by amazing quality creations by people who just casually understood that it's a function they unlock using an Xbox controller on Club Penguin.  Or it's \"bro, can you just send me the json because my prompt of 'Tswift saying Arnold I love you you're my real love 4k nude stunning no moustache -horse -ugly' made my Gameboy camera lose a pixel.\"\n\nRight now there's absolutely one group figuring out how to use this to make their coterie of gacha girls mew for them, and another who think they're mad hackers because they typed \"clip of Pinkie Pie saying fart on me\" into a box and the result was less than nightmare fuel.",

LTX-render 1280x720 took 140seconds.\nWAN2.2 video is ONE SHOT. It got the prompt right *immediately*. And it's not slow mo. Took 100 seconds. And all I would need to do is detail upscale it. Because LTX-2 actually renders at 1/2 res and then upscales, I set WAN to render at 640x536. At the res, with speed up loras its just as fast at LTX-2. Sure, ok then I'd have to upscale it . Big deal since it GETS THE PROMPT RIGHT.(I already interpolated to 32fps in WAN)\nThe biggest flaw of LTX is the entirely bad prompt following. Yes I've written books. It doesn't help. It simply doesn't understand many things.\n\nYou might say \"well in WAN 2.2 she's not really lifting it right\" . I don't think you read my first sentence where I said that LTX literally could NOT lift the damn car AT ALL until I ran that freaking workflow over 20 times. Yes it's that bad.",

Found a good looking female character that is charming for me from civitai to be the singer, then i drafted a basic script of how i wanted the scenes to be.

At this stage, i used adobe premier, some color grading, some cuts and jumps...",

I'm not really interested in perfect photographic realism at all and more focused on artistic styles and creativity and from that perspective Klein 9b is blowing everything else away for me.  Excellent style representation and it does a brilliant job at blending multiple styles together as well, though I will still be happy when some good LORA's have been released for more manual control of that.  The prompt adherence is excellent and it makes pleasing and artistically minded compositional decisions.  It's also very nice to have the base models available already, I usually prefer what the distilled is putting out by default, but if I'm not happy with it or just want a lot more variation then I can always switch the base model for a huge amount of creative variation from the model.  The base of course supports CFG with negative guidance as another lever I can pull, which is something we never had from Flux Dev.  On top of all this the performance is amazing which is allowing me to iterate and experiment so much faster than on the older Flux models, it feels more like I'm using SDXL but with much more sophisticated prompt capabilities and better handling for higher and oddball resolutions (I like to do 32:9 and SDXL did not handle that nearly as well as Flux).  \n\nI agree ZIT gives more realistic skin detail and is better in terms of hands and fingers and text.  But right now it's limited without a base model and you can really only use one LORA at a time.  And I never one shot my images anyway.  I use a variety of workflows, photoshop edits and mix models together for different parts of the process.  I can do a refinement pass with ZIT if I wanted to do something photorealistic to layer on the skin tone and I can edit the image in a bunch of ways to fix the hands and any other anatomy issues.  And for that matter I CAN STILL use ZIT too!  I don't know why there seems to be a zero sum attitude about these models.  Different models are good for different things.  Nano Banana Pro is an amazing edit model but for anything remotely artistic is the dullest most lifeless model out there.  And while ZIT is great for photorealism and skin, there's very little variation in what it produces and is not nearly as good as Flux for artistic styles (IMHO).  Use the model that's best for what you want to do, but there's no reason to trash a model for not being exactly what you need for your usage.\n\nAnyway, I for one am so happy that BFL released all these models and look forward to seeing what creative opportunities it will provide for my projects.",

Its restrictive license, the 'Flux chin' artifacts, its sheer bloat, and its total lack of fine-tuned ability are exactly why Z-Image is winning people over right now. The Z-image turbo model is a terrible model to fine tune on yet it has over 20 fine tuned variations now. And the only reason it doesn't have a lot more is because everyone is waiting on the base model to go crazy with it. While Flux is so hard to fine tune that the only fine tuned community model I know exists is Chroma. Flux has lost its good will with the AI bro community for a while now and these communities are ravenous. \n\nIMO Klein is dead in the water too, 4b is so small that its practically SDXL, it hallucinates heavily because of its size, and the 9b model is dead in the water too, nobody can train on it because of its license and size.",

Also set \"eta\" to 0.0 and CFG to \\~5 (if using the Klein Base model). Then, plug the \"ClownOptions Extra Options\" node to the ClownsharKSampler and type \"default\\_dtype=float32\" (without the quotes) in the text box. This seems to further decrease censorship in my tests. You might have to try a few seeds before you land on one that's uncensored. Also, don't forget to use the negative prompt!",

You just can't leave the prompt blank. The word static camera needs to be in the prompt as well. I just realized I haven't exactly made any references to what the prompt should be to get better results, but the static camera lora is pretty vital for triggering motion (or any camera lora) and what you do or don't put in the prompt has a big effect. Sometimes it helps to even put the first few words of what the character is going to sing/say. That may jump start things on the results you are getting with slow/no motion. On i2v, the model has to guess what is happening - based on the image if there is not enough info in the prompt to help it.",

So 2.6 seconds for 4 steps? Not bad! ZIT takes around 3.5 seconds on my machine, but you often need more than 4 steps, so it ends up being like 5-8 seconds.\n\nLooks like serious competition.\n\nEDIT - Actually, [I just found a benchmark comparison](https://www.trooper.ai/benchmarks-compare-RTX-Pro-6000-Blackwell-with-RTX-3090?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that suggests the 2x figure could be way off. This comparison suggests the Blackwell is 550% faster at image gen, which, if holds true for this model, means Klein is not even close to the speed of ZIT. So... ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯",

The results of those edits are a mixed bag. Qwen Image Edit gave better results, but finding a prompt that actually did what I want would take a lot of trial and error. Flux2 Klein 4b would happily change the image (with a lot of nosense added on top).\n\n9b can trade blows with Qwen Image and Z-Image Turbo and does a decent edit in half the time it takes Qwen Image Edit (finally 1024x1024 edit job fits into VRAM).",

Also set \"eta\" to 0.0 and CFG to \\~5 (if using the Klein Base model).

You're using the Base model which is un-distilled, therefore you don't need the FluxGuidance node. This node may cause undesirable results with un-distilled Flux models.\n2. 20 steps seems low considering you're using an un-distilled model. Try something like 40 at least. I would even aim at 50. If that's too much wait time for you, consider using [the distilled version of FLUX.2-Klein 9B](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B). You'll lose the negative prompting though, and also the image quality might not be as good as base with \\~50 steps.\n3. Uni PC is not a sampler I've seen commonly used with these new rectified flow models. Can you try Euler and see if you get better results with it?\n4. Consider using \"denoised\\_output\" instead of \"output\" in the Ksampler when VAE decoding the final image.",

Also set \"eta\" to 0.0 and CFG to \\~5 (if using the Klein Base model). Then, plug the \"ClownOptions Extra Options\" node to the ClownsharKSampler and type \"default\\_dtype=float32\" (without the quotes) in the text box. This seems to further decrease censorship in my tests. You might have to try a few seeds before you land on one that's uncensored.\n\nYou also need to know how to prompt it, but it's really not that difficult. Just be clever with explaining. Explain what you want to see literally, going into detail, as if talking to a person that has never seen what you're trying to describe. You also need to use supplementary wording for reinforcement of the concepts. The biggest mistake is using very short prompts and expecting results. And don't forget to use the negative prompt!",

It can do arbitrary length videos if you use the ContextOptions node from Wan Video Wrapper, just use only a LOW model (no HIGH) and set denoise to 0.7 or lower, and use a relevant pic as a reference image.\n\nIt's basically a free quality pass on any video and if you use a good reference image it'll easily clean up the plastic skin issue (among other things). Just make sure you only do it once when there's dialogue, repeated refinements might ruin the lip syncing.\n\nEdit: here's a workflow for it [https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep](https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep)",

I was using my own workflow and for the sake of speed of testing - the distilled model. At 1920x1080x24x900 I let it run for like 20 minutes and it wasn't able to complete a single step (although I didn't get an OOM in that timeframe either).\n\nI dropped to 600 frames to see how that went, and it did improve inference time from 682.47s/it without to 266.77 with. *But here's the thing...* When I drop to 481 (20 second video) I can get 36.05s/it without needing it. \n\nSo in other words, I think that inference speed is a larger bottleneck when dealing with very high frame counts than the VRAM requirement (at least on a 5090), making it far more efficient to simply just generate shorter clips to extend via LTX's native video extension capabilities rather than a longer clip in one shot. \n\nBut, if you must generate in a single run and have the extra time to spare I do think this can work. \n\nWith all of that said, I'm curious what others find to see if maybe I'm missing something.",

Not to say your contribution isn't badass even if it doesn't, and it should be super helpful for synching audio on longer song clips without having to make them postage stamp size. Also, no requirements.txt makes me a happy boi. Thx for this!",

Ahora, para acceder a los pesos, la ruta se ha convertido en algo como: diffusion\\_model.double\\_blocks.0.img\\_mod.ff.\\_ffn\\_ref.net.0.weight (Debido a que guardaste el original dentro de self.\\_ffn\\_ref).\n3. **El Conflicto:** Cuando el sistema de parches de ComfyUI (ModelPatcher) intenta aplicar el LoRA, busca la ruta original. Como has sustituido el objeto original por tu wrapper, la ruta ya no existe o no coincide, y lanza el error de \"KeyError\" o dice que las claves no coinciden.\n\n# La Solución: \"Monkey Patching\" del método forward\n\nEn lugar de reemplazar el **objeto** (el módulo entero), debes reemplazar solo su **comportamiento** (el método forward). De esta forma, la estructura del modelo y los nombres de las capas permanecen intactos, y los LoRAs pueden encontrar las capas para modificarlas.\n\nAquí tienes el código corregido. He modificado la clase para que inyecte la lógica de chunking directamente en el módulo original sin cambiar su identidad.",
