It's too hard to get actual consistency and you have little control over the action, requiring a lot of redos. Which takes a lot more time then you would think. Even the closed source models are really unreliable in generation\n\n\nWhenever you see someone's video that \"looks finished\" they probably had to gen that thing 20 times to get what they wanted, and that's just one chunk of the video, most have many chunks. If you are paying for an online service that's a lot of wasted \"credits\" just burning on nothing\n\n\nI want to like doing video and want to think it's going to allow people to make stories but it just not good enough, not easy enough to use, too unpredictable, and too slow right now. Even the online tools aren't much better from my testing .",

In the case of avatar, what you see on screen is the result of hundreds of hours of artist work time, discussion and dailies which have resulted in a collaborative creative effort which is refined and refined and refined and then tested and then refined again. \n\nAI predicts, selects and outputs. Meaning is not part of the creative process, it is retroactively inferred by the viewer or prompter but was not part of the decision process. What AI generates is inherently incestuous, it’s why you see so many things on this sub like this OP - it’s someone else’s idea, rebundled.\n\nAI gestures towards meaning without being responsible for it. That’s why I’d like to see people use it more intentionally, creating things that can be critiqued on their own merit and not as knock offs. Is that possible with training? I don’t see how. You can’t teach AI classicism and then use it to discover Impressionism. That takes creativity rooted in experience, something AI doesn’t have.",

If the karras schedular (sigmas) steps dont show, remove the object connected to steps and add them manually. Also sampler custom I had to add boolean to make the add noise stay True, and added seed(rgthree node) generation for the noise seed. \n\nI had to do these steps before it worked because I have a custom node giving problems and not letting nodes carry values. \n\nWorks great after these tweaks, 10/10 Great job good sir.\n\nAlso if your like me and have problems being smart, The prompts go on the left, not in the final text box that cant be edited.

He has a regular, fit build, athletic and healthy but not overly muscular, with natural proportions. He is wearing a yellow long-sleeve superhero suit made of high-tech tactical material, form-fitting yet flexible, with a subtle reflective sheen. The suit is divided into segmented panels with slightly raised ridges and subtle armor-like padding along the shoulders, chest, and torso, giving structure without bulk. Micro-texture patterns cover the fabric, and mesh ventilation panels run under the arms and along the sides for functionality and detail. The sleeves extend fully to the wrists beneath the gloves, with slight contouring along the arms and forearms to suggest natural muscle tone and movement. The top of the outfit features a flat white band-style collar with a short functional zipper at the front.\n\nThe belt portion of the suit is black, seamlessly integrated into the overall outfit, with a round yellow buckle that matches the suit’s fabric. The crotch area of the suit is reinforced with subtle paneling and slightly thicker material, designed to smooth the silhouette naturally without showing any anatomical bulge. He wears red gloves that extend up his forearms, worn over the sleeves, made from reinforced flexible material with visible seams, subtle texturing, and tactical paneling to match the suit. His red boots are made from the same material as the gloves, with paneling, reinforced areas, and subtle wear, designed to complement the suit’s high-tech aesthetic.\n\nThe cape is white, modernized to match the tactical aesthetic of the suit: made of slightly stiffer, high-tech fabric with subtle paneling and tonal texturing, cut to fall naturally from the shoulders but maintaining shape without billowing excessively. It integrates seamlessly with the shoulder design of the suit, giving a functional, cohesive appearance.\n\nHe is walking down an abandoned part of the city, holding two brown paper grocery bags, one in each hand. The environment is desolate and run-down, featuring cracked pavement, broken windows, graffiti, scattered debris, and empty, deteriorating buildings. His expression is famously blank and emotionless, and he is not looking at the camera instead, he gazes off into the distance, seemingly without a thought in the world. His posture is relaxed and casual, walking naturally through the abandoned street. Lighting is soft but slightly directional, emphasizing the textures of the suit, cape, and environment, highlighting micro-texture, paneling, and armor lines, while maintaining photorealistic realism and a slightly moody, deserted atmosphere.",

Flux 2 dev (even with turbo) still beats it on all the little text bits in this prompt, but this still looks awesome aside from that. prompt: A highly advanced gynoid assassin unit designated \"YUKI-7\" stands in the rain-slicked back alleys of Osaka's Shinsekai district at 2AM, her pristine white ceramic helmet gleaming under flickering neon signs advertising pachinko parlors and izakayas, the kanji \"零\" (zero) etched in crimson across her faceplate as raindrops streak down its seamless surface. Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

An optional upscale with SeedVR2 (default settings) adds about 5 seconds but in my opinion it makes the image even more \"AI-ish\".\n\n* skin still looks unrealistically smooth/plastic/AI look/blurry, Z-image-turbo gives comparable if not better results with 9 steps\n* even when requesting a woman I would sometimes get a man\n* 04 steps lora does not seem to work with GGUF\n* 40 steps takes 64 seconds\n* 24 steps takes 38 seconds, changes to facial structure, result is fairly comparable, in the example below the text is even better than at 40 steps\n* 12 steps takes 20 seconds, result is fairly comparable, small text starts being glyph\n* 08 steps takes 13 seconds, result is barely passable, small text becomes unreadable\n* 04 steps (without lora) takes 7 seconds, result is unusable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o1z15c42jag1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e953b0a6e4432b97b0e6a4c6bfd910a72925ada4\n\n  \nPositive prompt :  \nwoman, sharp professional shot, shoulder high close up, european woman, walking in the street, holding a cardboard sign with the text \"Gooner 2512\" in a stylized font, the sign masks her breasts, detailed skin, blue eyes, the woman is wearing a blue and yellow leather jacket and a green shirt. She has the word \"Nvidia\" tatooed on her neck.\n\nNegative prompt :  \nmale, blurry, bad, low quality, fur, 3D render, uncanny, gritty, noisy texture, harsh shadows, horror, angry expression, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, extra fingers, asymmetrical eyes, cross-eyed, text glitches, misspelled text, watermark, logo",

This model's used to create (t2i), although the first version natively supported images. Don't confuse it with Qwen Image Edit 2509 or 2511 (i2i). The first version came out about five months ago and was quite good in terms of realism for creating 1girl datasets; I saw in their examples that they polished it. I like that they're working on it, and there're already several GGUFs on Huggingface. This model's great, but I'll pass on it since we have zit and sd xl for realism. Don't get me wrong, I use 2509 as my main model daily; I hope the Chinese don't make a mistake and continue to offer us useful products because, after all, we're their guinea pigs. We, the users, save companies millions of dollars by improving and refining their open-source models and providing them with constant feedback. They're provided with free LoRa and upgrades to retrain their AI models, which're then only available via web APIs. And as someone said, we get the scraps! 🫶",

Many expect models like WAN2.5 to be open source, but the reality's we're lucky if we can run multitalk and similar tools in a decent amount of time. Well, that partly explains how WAN2.5 and WAN2.6 were trained. I love AI and working with it daily, but the reality's that local AI isn't for the poor. I have 16 GB of VRAM, and it was hard to get my graphics card and setup, and even then, I work under precarious conditions. I won't deny that we're sticking with models, but they're getting bigger and bigger, and it's not just for capacity or small improvements, but because their purpose's that sooner or later you end up using APIs, since quantized models're pretty bad. That's why I use Q8, FP8, FP16, or BF16 to avoid sacrificing quality, as I don't like distorted generations. I'm not attacking local AI, much less this model, but I keep seeing new users who think the world of AI's all about happiness and unicorns, when we've been manipulated since before we even set up our systems, not to mention the RAM monopoly and inflated graphics card prices.

And even then there is a limit of expressing it with words and you will get like 3-4 variations out of it at best, and usually despite changing half the prompt and descriptions, ZIT will still give you 80-100% similar face/person.

Everything is very smooth and natural. And not only in the full-length output, but also in the shorter clips (I set up a node to save each individual clip before joining everything together at the end, so I could follow each stage). I don’t know if this is due to some action of SVI Pro on each individual clip, but the result is amazing. And you’ve given me the best gift of the year! Because the SVI Pro workflows I tested here before didn’t work! Truly, thank you very much. No more pay for Kling or Hailuo! (Even paying this shit, i had hallucinations all the time!)",

Should I be duplicating the seed to be identical at each segment or does that not matter?\n\nIn my video, I took a front view of somebody walking, and just smiling and looking side to side as they walk. At each segment, it sort of rapidly fades/transitions - there's no break in the video, but say the head position suddenly is pointing a different way and it continues to the next segment where the same thing occurs, etc.",

She is positioned center-right, looking directly at the camera with a playful expression. Her head is tilted left, her right hand resting on her head, fingers pushing into her hair. She has light green eyes with bold, black winged eyeliner, shaped dark brown eyebrows, and light freckles across her nose and cheeks. She wears a strapless, form-fitting top in a dark brown color. Visible tattoos include a large black and grey sunflower on her right forearm; a circular design in an ornate, baroque-style frame below her right elbow; a small, partially visible dark tattoo on her left shoulder; and a sun with a face rising above clouds on her lower left arm. She is outdoors under a covered porch/awning attached to a building with light beige vertical siding and a paneled metal roof. In the background is a white-framed window, a chain-link fence, and a grassy area. String lights with black, wireframe, geometric diamond shades hang from the awning, and a traditional brass wall lantern is mounted on the wall. The ground has dry grass, a white gutter downspout with a black shovel leaning at its base. The upper left corner shows a blue sky with wispy clouds. The photo is taken in bright, natural daylight. The shallow depth of field, sharp focus, and high-angle perspective suggest a smartphone selfie.  \n\nSeed: 411478554767843  \nCFG: 4  \nSampler / Scheduler: DPM++ 2S Ancestral Linear Quadratic  \n50 steps for both @ native 1140x1472, using the BF16 versions of both models.",

Most will be similar, but there's more variety.\n\nWith ZIT, this isn't possible. If you generate 20 images, it will generate almost the same image 20 times. No variations in pose, objects, clothing, etc. Therefore you cannot use ZIT to explore. You gotta use custom nodes to create prompt variety, or use img2img from another model's gens, etc.",

It is **intentionally slightly overfit** to lock in this aesthetic across scenes, rather than maximize flexibility.\n\nBecause of this, it performs best **below full strength**.\n\n## Works well for\n- Studio & environmental portraits  \n- Editorial / lifestyle images  \n- Product shots with atmosphere  \n- Landscapes & architecture  \n\n## Technical notes\n- DSLR-style sharpness without harsh micro-contrast  \n- Natural lighting behavior with preserved shadow detail  \n- Strong subject separation and depth cues  \n\n## Important usage note\n- **LoRA strength:** ~**0.7 recommended**  \n- The model is intentionally overfit to stabilize the look  \n- Pushing it toward **1.0 may introduce artifacts or reduce realism**\n\n## Prompt guidance\n- 500–1300 characters recommended  \n- Weak prompts and poor base workflows will be more visible  \n\n🔗 **CivitAI link:**  \nhttps://civitai.com/models/2234406?modelVersionId=2551211",

Apologies for not posting examples; I always test things with private projects and I don't have permission to publish them. My only issue's that, in the same amount of time, I can create two images with Qwen Image Edit 2509 or 2511 versus one image with Flux2 Dev under the same conditions, and Qwen Image Edit 2509 maintains better character consistency. 2511 isn't suitable for this. 2511's a disaster at maintaining realistic characters; they ruined it with so much LoRa, but it's better for other uses. Although Flux2 Dev's better for text, posters, anime, and advertising—and perhaps that's what you need!✌️",

Even though Qwen Image Edit and Flux2 Dev're large models doesn't mean they can do everything. People don't understand that to achieve that kind of adherency responsiveness and multi-image editing, you have to overtrain something, and in both cases lose skin quality's sacrificed. That's where smaller models shine as refiners. Z Image Turbo's good for many tasks, but in my case, it's a model I don't even use, since for my projects with Qwen, SD XL, some Flux models, WAN 2.2, TTS, some music generators, etc... I use a wide variety of tools, that's more than enough for me. The key's for each user to take advantage of the strengths of each model and use what works best for their needs or projects!👌",

Here is a reddit post with a workflow [https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1pi2i67/when\\_an\\_upscaler\\_is\\_so\\_good\\_it\\_feels\\_illegal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1pi2i67/when_an_upscaler_is_so_good_it_feels_illegal/)\n\nThere are also some Chinese nodes you can swap in with English ones because they are hard to find. For example there is \"text box\" node, just put in any \"text\" node with \"string\" as the output and reconnect it . You will just have to type in \"Anime characters transformed into realistic live-action\" into it. \n\nI just started using Comfy like two days ago so it's not really the best workflow tbh. Runpod has so many Chinese nodes and models that are super hard to find and I usually just swap them out for similar things in Comfy. Sorry for the trouble friend",
