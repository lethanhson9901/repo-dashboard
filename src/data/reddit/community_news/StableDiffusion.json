From changes in grammar to what kind of jokes are considered proper to the fact that farm life involves a lot of death and disease.

Even if the model was never shown a woman lying like some people were spouting back then, it clearly knows what a humanoid looks like when lying down so it should have been able to generalize. \n\nThe saddest part is SD3.5 Medium is actually a [really interesting model for art](https://postimg.cc/gallery/grmwg4F), and from memory it was trained completely different than SD3 and 3.5 Large but for whatever reason Stability believed the SD3 brand wasn't complete poison by that point. If Medium was called SD4 and it might have had a chance.\n\nNot gonna lie though, as much as I love playing around with ZiT and Klein and appreciate the adherence the new training style brings, I miss models trained on raw alt-text.

It's possible they could have trained an entirely new model between the API release and open release and botched it, but that seems wasteful even for Stability.\n\nI did a lot of testing trying to figure out what the issue was and it felt like they specifically targeted certain concepts, or combinations of concepts.

You can train back whatever you want and the model won't fight you on it.

That's insane. Even 10-year-old used GTX 1060 6Gb like mine are going for between £90-£200.\n\nI read somewhere on reddit someone did some sort of analysis on Nvidia's finances and costs, and that they're making an average of 90% markup on every card they sell. It really annoys me if that's true.",

Kinda interesting how our AI art preferences end up being a fingerprint of taste.*",

It is actually **pre-loaded** in the CLIP Text Encode node (the green one) in the included ComfyUI workflow, and there’s a Note node right above it explaining exactly that.\n\nHowever, I see your point: not everyone starts with the workflow. I’ll add the prompt directly to the HuggingFace, GitHub and Reddit descriptions to make it clearer for everyone.\n\nAs for the LoRA’s role: you nailed it! That’s why I called it a **contextual LoRA**. FLUX is amazing at understanding style from a reference, but it doesn't know how to organize that style into a structured 8x9 alphabet atlas on its own. The LoRA provides that 'logical bridge' and ensures the grid consistency. Without it, the model just generates a mess of styled characters, as seen in your example.",

I find that blending their styles with a more realistic painter, or even mixing a painter with a sculptor, can achieve the modern retro-Art deco immitation look I like. Honestly, some fringe cases of Art Nouveau artists can be made to look Deco by negative prompting away the curves and florals. \n\nSorry that turned rambly lol.",

          "text": "A good, long time ago, after the iPad first came out but before people realized it was about to ruin masses of children and bring about the advent of iPad kids, I was working in an Apple Store, as a Creative.\n\nOne day, we all gathered for our Daily Download, and the managers had a video clip of Tim Cook answering some questions on the news about how iPads are displacing Windows PCs in schools, and promise to make learning richer and build critical thinking skills.\n\nThe way our senior manager just enthusiastically gibbered \"critical thinking\" over and over was EXACTLY the way this Nvidia voice model fell into a loop saying 'You know, like, you know, like, I love, like, you know like.\" I had to stand there for a solid minute hearing this coked out moron repeat \"critical thinking\" like he was trying to be Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nNaturally, I raised my hand, and politely asked, in case any parent or educator would like to learn more about this, how \\*exactly\\* is an iPad supposed to teach critical thinking. Sure, there are richer, more interactive textbooks (more like were; that was a brief blip in history where people had hope in tablets, and started designing textbooks with deep, interactive infographics... it was a vision for the future that never panned out). But what even is critical thinking in this context? Room fell silent and the mood was ICY. Thankfully for Apple, there's an 'assume positive intent' rule in place and I asked a legitimate question, but man did the managers stare daggers into me. Nobody had an answer.\n\nOnly a few short years later, it turned out iPads were frying kids' brains, and companies stopped trying to make useful, creative, and informative apps, and rushed to cash in on addictive, exploitative user interface design. That was one of the most sickening forks in the road of human history that I had the misfortune of bearing firsthand witness to.\n\nBut yeah... This video brought back some memories.",

You could just use Mocha to mask him and then apply an edge gausian blur of like 0.1px in some scenes to soften him, fix the hairline manually it's just like 3 frames, and add some directional blur to some spots (mostly the feet) and match the original shot pretty much 1:1.\n\n\nThe annoying part is you would have to color grade pretty hard to get rid of that weird contrasty look LTX gives every i2v video making it pretty much useless for extending real footage that it didn't originally create.",

Looks more like a counterpart of Udio at this point. Also, I was unable to produce any cover, based on the uploaded song. It just generates an empty song with periodic \"Sputnik 1\" sounds inbetween. Making the song parodies based on existing works was #1 reason why I wanted a local counterpart of Suno.",

The Anima (preview) is so undertrained that it's quality is closer to SD 1.5 in that regards. SDXL (Illustrious) has come a long way to this point, and I think Anima would took much more finetunes to get it right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9u9iq2my6ig1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c94b558f337ffa62da455a5dee016447c33460d3\n\n*(left) Anima preview; (right) Illustrious finetunes: UnholyDesireMix v7*\n\nBoth is using similar prompt without additional refining/LoRA at 512x512 resolution, only using inherent artist tag prompt:\n\n    @mika_pikazo. masterpiece, best quality. 1girl, score_8, score_9. murasaki shion from hololive, she is wearing white summer dress, looking at viewer with annoyed face, she is holding a greatsword with both hands, the sword design reminds of magic knight rayearth swords. white background. chromatic aberration. modern anime style, late 2020. multiple splash of paint decoration in background with colors: cyan, shocking pink, and yellow. Giant stylish text written \"ASUNA\" with smaller text written \"pactio\".\n\nwith negatives:\n\n    worst quality, low quality, score_1, score_2, score_3, score_4, score_5, score_6, blurry, jpeg artifacts, sepia, badly drawn finger\n\nI'm trying to jumble up as many unrelated things in one composition to see how it goes **(characters) (clothings) (items from other IP) (color sampling) (multiple text formats)**. With Illustrious removed the score tags and replaced \"@\" with \"by\" for the artists tag. What most people didn't seems to know is that Illustrious model also capable of natural language prompt to some degree.\n\nI love what Anima brings to the table as 2B model, more model variations for us to use is always welcome but I think the quality needs further refine. Also no, it's not '*Illustrious killer*' as many people prophesize it to be, at least not yet with this quality. If there is one thing that I would say stood up against SDXL right now is how it could renders written text better, but the longer your prompt the less likely it succeed in doing so.",

(see my post history for experiments with modern models) I think we need to post more experiments and techniques here on reddit, NOT on discord, to keep the interest alive. \n\nI see it like the heyday of hip hop - taking something made by someone else and mashing it up to make something totally new. It goes beyond just typing two artists at random and seeing what comes out. I spend hours on image search engines to find artists that might mesh well, using controlnets to guide composition, etc. \n\nModern models are hit or miss. I am a proponent of the Flux2 family after being a staunch Flux1 dev hater because they have *some* artist knowledge. A good foundational artist knowledge is crucial to this use, as no amount of manual of LLM-generated style descriptors can capture a look. The Chinese teams behind Qwen and Z image lack of concern for copyright would have been promising but they don't seem interested in artist tagging, at least in English. \n\nWhile the edit models are somewhat promising for style transfer, they don't hold a candle to SDXL's IPadapter and the tools developed by /u/Matt3o back when he was active in this space [he has since left the Comfy community, sadly). What we need is someone to get really invested in better controlnets and IPadapter stand ins. QRcode controlnets were a HUGE boone in SD1.5 and SDXL eras, something which people have forgotten with the newer unified controlnets. \n\nThose are my rambling thoughts. \n\ntl;dr people interested in remixing artist styles and making visually cool stuff still exist. We need to post more. Share workflows, experiments, and ideas on reddit. We can keep this going, maybe even revitalize the interest among newcomers.",

For any modern model, you have to apply loras for every style you’re trying to achieve, which is untenable if you like to blend together lots of artists. In many styles I’ve created I’ll blend 4 or 5 artists.\n\nModern models are just really bad at the nuance of art styles.",

              "text": "I wonder if theres a way through coding to emulate high variation without losing final \"specifcity\" of an image. \n\nI was originally replying to your comment in a much simpler way but it got me thinking and I ended up reasoning about it much more than I planned. \n\n**Don't feel like you are obligated to read it**, but im gonna post it anyways just so i can reference later and in case anyone else wants to try this\n\n---\n\n# Idea\n\n## Background\nI'm basing this of my experience with tensorboard where even though a model has hundreds of dimensions, it will surface the top 3 dimensions in terms of spread across latent space according to the initial word list you fed it. \n\n\nI'm probably explaining all of this poorly but basically its giving you the most useful 3d view of something with WAY more than 3 dimensions. If you google a tensorboard projection map or better yet try one yourself my idea might make more sense.\n\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Make a \"variation\" word list containing common modifiers. Generate embeddings for these with a given model's text encoder\n \n\n2. Take the image gen prompt and chunk it according to semantic boundaries that make the most sense for the model type (i.e.  by sentence boundary for LLM text encoder models or by new line for CLIP or T5). \n \n\n3. Generate embeddings of each prompt chunk. You may decide to cluster here to limit number chunks to keep the final results more generalized thus coherent.\n \n\n4. Combine the variation embedding list with your prompt chunk list. Use a weighting factor (k) to represent the prompt chunks at an optimal ratio vs word list (as determined by testing)\n \n\n5. Calculate the top n dimensions of highest variability for this combined list (this is where the weight ratio we apply to prompt chunks matters). The value for n would be a knob for you to choose but \"3\" seems like a good starting point and also what you need for that super cool tensorboard projection map.\n \n\n6. For each of your (n) dimensions sample the top (y) nearest neighbors from variation embeddings to each prompt chunk (c) embedding (closeness can be calculated a few different ways, but i'll assume cosine distance for now)\n \n\n7. Now you have a list of variation embeddings that are semantically related to your prompt. The quantity of variation embeddings will be equal to the product of (n)(y)(c) \n\n>    (n: number of most expressive dimensions sampled)\n> x (y: number of nearest neighbors in each dimension for a given prompt chunk)\n> x (c: number of prompt chunks)\n> = (total number or \"semantically coherent\" variation embeddings)\n\n\n8. During diffusion you inject one of the (y) per (n) per (c) into the process. You would probably want to do so according to a schedule:\n\n> early steps for structural variation\n\n> later steps for fine detail variation. \n\nYou never inject more than one variation embedding for a given dimension for a given prompt chunk, you don't want to cause a regression to the mean which would happen if you nearest neighbors were of approx. equal but opposite vectors from the prompt chunks\n\n### Refinements\n\n- You could make targeted \"variation\" word lists that focus on describing variations for a specific topic. Perhaps a \"human morphology\" list, an \"art style\" list (if your text encoder understands them), or even a specialized \"Domain specific\" list containing niche descriptive words most salient in a specific domain like \"Star Wars\" or something\n\n\n- Remember that we are going to weight the relative strength of the word list vs prompt chunks list (k factor). This is a powerful coarse knob that controls for \"relatedness\" to the original prompt. This will be the first knob I go to if my idea is yielding too strong or too weak of an effect\n\n\n- Instead of choosing (y) nearest neighbors for a given dimension, perhaps grab the closest nearest neighbor, then grab the 2nd closest neighbors BUT only from the opposite direction in relation to the specific prompt chunk embedding. \n\n> Think of it as a line with our prompt chunks embedding as point on the line. We are choosing the next closest point, then the next closest point on the other side of the line relative to chunk embedding.",

Why push for development in more creative art styles when we already know AI can already achieve good results?\n\nI think once consistently good anatomy for people is achieved it'll come back around again. All of this is community driven by the needs of the community, and currently for those that want creative art styles are generally satisfied with 1.5 for now.

          "text": "Along your point : picking the model's intricacies was great fun and finding something, some combination \"that was ours\" was a great great feeling. \n\nOf course it all came down  to a wide range of visual and artists styles that were \"easily\" recoverable from the model. And you'll agree that it's easier to say \"in the style of Monet and (Mucha:1.1)\" that saying \"impressionist  painting using medium to large touches in slow progressing gradients with low to medium thickness and medium to high paint mixing, cross referenced with (detailed and intricate.... Yadyayada:1.1)\". For the first and simple reason that tokens are expensive, and overflowing the maximum gave you basic random omissions (which has its perks but increases the slot machine effect).\n\nNow that the SD styles era is past (except maybe with ZIB and SDXL revivals), if one wants to \"pick the model\" for creativity, it has to use the basic blocks available, such as the long and detailed descriptions of what one expects from the model : tool, influence, touch, color, hues, gradients, forms, eras, etc, which is very fine if you know your art history, and leaves all who don't in the mud. A lot of people here have learned HEAPS of visual language by trying, looking at prompts, studying the images etc, and those are the ones who came to better control their outputs, even back in the SD era.\n\nBut with modern models (and maybe encoders too idk about that) , I have this feeling that the open source releases are geared towards our of the box utility. I think (and may be wrong) rhat it's why ZImage released the photo-focused Turbo first - they had to make a great impression that works right outside the box. If they'd let Base out first (on top of maybe be unfinished back then) literally every post in this sub would have been \"Flux does it better\" and it would have taken years to get off. \n\nOne of the reasons, I think, is because most open source users aren't power users or commercial users with intent. They're just happy to explore, but there's little \"need\" from them to go beyond what the défaut 1girl prompt would provide. And so, in part, this killed some of the open source model's \"creativity\". Again I don't like to employ that word here, because to me as a former graphics designer, the creativity is never in the tool, no matter how potent. \n\nPeople used the infamous \"high seed variation\" SDXL for years generating huge batches of the same prompt and trashing the output until the image they wanted stood out - if that's what everyone calls creativity, I gotta swap planets. But when they have an idea even partial and try stuff and mix and match and refine and go back and most importantly end up saying \"I won't go further this is final\" they made a decision, they brought it there, and this they created.\n\nI'd argue that SD1.5 and SDXL are extremely useful today for generating basic elements that are refined and reworked with the precision and prompt adherence or modern models ! Finding pieces and bits that could be used in CREATIVE ways, assembled and refined to look like something else, and finally tell a story that would take 20x the prompt context to explain with the perfect words (hoping that the model, your own expression in English/Chinese, the quantization of your TEs and your models etc etc etc would let all the nuances through) - that's the future  of creativity in AI gens. Not T2I alone, not I2I alone, but a mixture of everything that you, the user, keeps on making happening - not because the \"model is capable\" with lazy prompts.",

You cannot watch a movie for the first time again. Not only is there a lot that's better, and a lot that's being innovated on, the peak was certainly not more than two years ago. Nowhere close. \n\nAI is no longer a novelty. It is maturing and becoming the sort of thing that is specialized. And so if you want the kind of creativity you're talking about, the avant garde surrealism that comes from a lower powered model, you can still make that! In fact, you can make it easier and better now. \n\nBut no one can recapture your wonder of discovering something new for the first time. ",

But the trend accelerated and everyone model hops too quickly to learn the finer details of what can be done. \n\nHonestly, it gives me great hope, although it causes issues in the short-term, because it makes it near impossible to put the genie back in in the bottle. If anyone tries to legislate this stuff out of existence, it really can't happen. \n\nDouble edged sword. But I think we'll continue to see rapid growth for the immediate. But for image gen to get it's photoshop adoption cycle it needs actual artists to use it, to find ways to use it with more fine-grained control, and to spend longer in general pushing the boundaries of the tools.

I have literally hundreds of GB of near perfect art outputs in any style or medium that will be used to train an art model that will in turn oversaturate with more art because my dopamine brain tells me better is better.\n\nWe as a species worry that AI might take over by force, but to be honest our self created apathy and burnout might just do that before a super intelligence even has to lift a finger",

          "text": "Had this conversation recently with my colleagues at the AI agency (tv ads, shows, movies) I work for.\n\nSd1.5 and it’s strangeness, speed and knowledge of artists names and styles is what brought me into AI in the first place. \n\nThe change happened pretty slowly, now I rarely use AI for personal visual pleasure and more only for work; it became boring. The other day I build a workflow to generate artistic images with sd1.5 and then passes the results to Flux Klein to improve it without dropping the visual quality: I found myself again hooked for 4 hours straight in a continuous dopamine rush. \n\nSd1.5 knows almost any artists, architect and designer you can name; my huge pleasure is mixing names of artists in various promoted weights and seeing what the heck comes out, plus you had embedding which were like loras but easy, intuitive, fast and didn’t break the images. \n\nThe reason why artists have been scraped out of models is frankly respectable. There are huge copyright and intellectual property issues which had to be addressed. In a more ‘correct’ world a Rembrandt Lora should be trained and sold or given for free by the Rijksmuseum, maybe in collaboration with other museums and each should be able to decide if giving it for free or for a price. \n\nThat said you can train Loras for everything still today and it works, but it’s not the same thing: we mostly use flow distilled models today so the results are often limited and too influenced by realism; the sd1.5 results were amazing because the model gave completely varied result and the generation was influenced by the enormous amount of art inside the dataset; so words like “golden ratio, modernist, abstract” gave amazing results while Klein or Zimage will just prefer to generate triangles and spirals. \n\nSd1.5->Klein is still my way to go for personal pleasant time generating; the only thing that could change that at the moment is a complete finetune of the 9b Klein model. This would cost millions of $, thousands of hours of work and it would be highly illegal, that’s why I don’t see that happening soon. \n\nIt could happen as some guerrilla-like hidden project where lots of people put together the enormous dataset (and captions, I think that’s the hardest part to do well) and then collect a big sum of money to train with pro gpus in cloud. \n\nAnother solution which would also be legal would be train a paid model (maybe 30$ per month fee?) which gives the artists money each time their particular work is used in generations. This would be legal, socioeconomically fair, decentralized, but I don’t see this happening either for a variety of reasons. \n\nCreativity in AI in the end is always handled by your own human talent, so with Sd1.5 creativity did not die, it just requires way more human effort to get there, (other than training Lora’s you can use an artwork or even your sketch to mildly denoise an image with any model) which probably is a good thing for artists, designers, architects; I’m not 100% sure though, it’s something that should be debated by someone with way more culture than the one I possess.",

Or there's a huge market for realistic girls.\n\nYes, there is absolute a huge market for realistic 1girls.  Just look at the top models on Civitai.\n\nBut no, A.I. is not overtrained in art.  In fact, most artists have not been trained into LoRAs.  I've trained hundreds of them, and there are thousands more to go if I want to continue 😅: [https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models](https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models)\n\nNow back to SD1.5 \"creativity\" vs the supposed \"lack of creativity\" in newer models.\n\nA.I. models are mainly used in two ways.  One is for \"brainstorming\", where one tries out simple ideas and let the A.I. \"fill in the blanks\".  This is where SD1.5/SDXL's higher level of hallucinatory \"creativity\" may be useful.\n\nThe other is to use A.I. as a tool with a high level of control, where the A.I. responds precisely to a detailed prompt as one refines one's idea as to what the image should look like. \n\nIn general, most people who are \"serious\" about using A.I. as a creative tool will pick control over hallucination, in the same way that one would want an assistant that will follow precise instruction to carry out a task rather than one that just goes off and do thing according to his own whims.\n\nWith current SOTA models, users who have the creativity and the imagination, can create most thing (except those involving complex interactions between two characters) that they can envision ([a bad workman blames his tools](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bad+workman+always+blames+tools)) 😅\n\nMaybe the ideal A.I. model is one that can do both, and to some extent, Chroma and ZiBase are heading in that direction, but many users are not happy with the fact that a lot more trial and error involving more negative prompt and other incantation such as \"aesthetic 11\" are involved due to the more \"creative\" nature of these less \"tuned\" models.\n\nFinally, if one wants modern models to hallucinate like SD1.5 in the good old days, there are random prompt generators, wildcards, and even noise injection nodes.",

They are also epsilon prediction models, which is important too.\n\nSD and SDXL are basically working like this \"I will take this prompt and explore my way to get to somewhere close to what it says.\" (or not, lol)\n\nFLUX, Z-image and so on are \"I will take this prompt and give you almost exactly what you want, every time, with every seed.\"\n\nFlow models dont need to find the way, they basically know the way.\n\nIf you want to have it even worse, there are methods to train flow model that basically skips any search and jumps almost straight to result. Good for impatient people and video models (altho I think no video model uses it, yet). Also obviously makes generation a lot faster and more accurate (to some extent, its only as accurate as training data).\n\nThere are \"between\" things, like DMD2, which is almost like flow, but not really. While its good, it has sort of its \"idea how things should look\" which tend to override any model tied to it. Plus it obviously limits variability a quite a bit and can, if not merged right, cause model to become pretty dumb. IMHO one of few cases where I dont know if merging it in model is better or worse.",

They tried to make realistic SD 1.5 fine tunes and posted countless threads with titles like \"does this look realistic?\" (and still do). Whenever someone released a new fine tune, one of the first questions was always \"how good is it at realism?\".\n\nWhen Pony v6 was released, some of them got really angry by the fact that it didn't do realism. They explained that realism and one day being able to use it for virtual reality was the ultimate goal of generative AI and something everyone should be striving towards.\n\nPersonally, I have zero interest in realism. I find realism boring. From the very start, I've wanted to create something that looks like the comics that I grew up with. That has been quite hard to find. Everything is focused on either realism or anime. I've often ended up using furry models to generate human characters since they tend to have a more Western cartoon and comic book style. I finally found the Arthemy Illustrious models which are fairly close to what I've been looking for.\n\n>Pony was the peak\n\nI feel this too in a way. For me, it was the biggest leap in usability, when I could suddenly generate all the character portraits I had tried to make since the SD 1.4 days. Illustrious is better, but it feels more like a gradual improvement. Z-Image-Turbo is the first model in years that made me feel truly excited since it makes it easy to create complex scenes with multiple characters. My goal is to create images that tell a story.",

The community quickly developed ways to literally make it do anything at all, period. \n\nNow we have several frontier models that will be creative to your heart’s content but because they are run by large companies they have safety rails on them to keep users from generating adult / violent / controversial / defamatory content.  When people run local models these days it sure seems like they are doing it because they want to explore off the rails.  It’s not that creativity is dead, it’s just that nanobannana will make that Michelangelo painting of your dog  perfectly in seconds, so why spend 3 hours downloading things trying to get a local model to get it just right?",

I should be able to enable two loras, prompt the characters, and have them function properly with natural language just like characters the base model knows.

Comfy exists because of them, and this grant is our way of giving back and continuing to empower the ecosystem.\n\nI know, I know, $1M alone won’t train a state-of-the-art foundation model today. That’s okay. This is just the starting point. Beyond direct funding, we also support grantees with real-world evaluation, production testing, and promotion across the Comfy platform.\n\nGrant recipients retain full control over their model and license (as long as it remains open) and can automatically enroll in our Cloud revenue share program to further sustain the project.\n\nWe can’t wait to see all the amazing open source models that come out of this effort.\n\nApply for the grant at [https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant](https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant)\n\nFYI: you can try out the Anima model here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima)",

Hopefully the inevitable enshittification doesn't get overbearing.  (Ie: No more portable, you got to login, UI changes to remove/change functionality for no good reason)\n   \nI mean, it's cool they're training models I guess, but Comfy is what it is thx to the open source community migrating to it in droves after they got a head start on implementing SDXL. Stability gave them the model early and A1111 didn't have support for a few weeks. Trouncing A1111 there, and yellling fowl at lllyasviel for using Comfy code in Forge, gave them a monopoly here. They've stated lofty goals to be the app for all AI models -going big time.

What a great invention that was. Until you took them away. Cancel button is back now (thanks!!!) but stop button still missing. Of course i can click that weird icon in the job-queue that will cancel all other jobs except the current on. But if i am on instant gen (and i am often on instant gen) it keeps going. I have to switch to single run, click run, cancel the other jobs, cancel the current job just to stop it all. It was a single button before all these updates. It takes me 4 clicks now to stop the instant generations. its painful.\n\nI dunno. The UI in comfy is all but comfy. I know this is free software. I did not a pay a cent. But all these options were in there at one point and then the enterprisification of the software has started. \n\nSo please bring back the stop button. That would be real nice.",

We don't have a proper idea of how it does with modern anime screencaps, or even retro anime screencaps, which are what most people would expect from this kind of model.\n\nAt first, I thought it was weird the creator posted that only super low quality flash art example and the first two threads didn't even attempt to use examples people would legitimately care about, but since then this response has continued in every single Anima post I can find it has now become weird. Can it really just not do 90s, 2000s, etc. anime screen-cap outputs? Is it really that biased and trained almost exclusively on Deviant art and such works? I've seen two iffy random user comment examples, and one was extremely bad as if it couldn't understand the prompt.\n\nWell, utterly poor publicity and information aside I don't want to assume it DOA until it has a chance to prove itself but I'm definitely not feeling hopeful about it at this point.

A generation on my 5060 Ti 16GB / 3000 Mt/s RAM with your default settings got me the atlas in 7min 20s.\n\nHere's one test I did:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o3597anw9ig1.jpeg?width=1946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bfa9622e84250bdf1ae063b611c836937b01808\n\n\\- The image demonstrates some problems. In the generated atlas, the letter E's top line is not connected to the rest of the letter, so it got ignored by the ttf converter. Quotation marks are also pretty pretty commonly used, so it'd be nice they'd be included in atlas (or just more glyphs in general). I also think the lowercase letters don't look as \"unique\" as my \"a\" was, but I think that could be solved with adjusting the LORA's strength.\n\n\\- I believe I’ve also found a bug in the ttf converter: if the atlas filename is a single word with a capital letter, the resulting ttf font name is forced to lowercase. However, if the filename contains multiple parts, the original capitalization is preserved. Example: `Name.png` \\-> `name.ttf`, but `Name_01.png` \\-> `Name_01.ttf`.\n\n\\- I removed \"Generate letters and symbols\" from the prompt and didn't see it affecting the output. I did limited testing, but the more simple a base prompt is, the better UX it is for user.\n\nOverall, I'm quite impressed. Nice work!",

In the current script, 'E' is treated as a single-part letter. If the top bar is disconnected, the script discards it as noise. Try running it with --min-component-area 1 and increase --keep-components to 5. I will update the script to include more letters in the \"multi-part\" list.  **Edit: I updated the script in GitHub Repo.**\n2. **TTF Filename Bug:** Great catch! I'll look into the sanitize\\_name function and how the FontBuilder handles case sensitivity.\n3. **Prompt:** I haven't tried making the prompt shorter, but if it works, that's great!\n4. **More Glyphs:** Definitely planned for V3!\n\nThanks again, this helps a lot to make the tool better!",

Pushing it significantly higher might break the spatial logic of the atlas.\n\nAs for the reference characters: the LoRA was specifically trained on the 'Aa' pair to provide enough stylistic context (uppercase vs lowercase). I haven't experimented with single characters yet, but it’s an interesting direction for future research!",

I'm going through a tough time; I'm sick, but I still have to work, and the release of Ace-stepv1.5 has really brightened my day.\n\nI don't use Suno or any paid music software; I prefer to work locally, with all the limitations that entails.\n\nPlease note that some audio normalization and vocoder nodes're missing. I recommend checking out this developer repository: [github.com/jeankassio/JK-AceStep-Nodes](http://github.com/jeankassio/JK-AceStep-Nodes), as there're several settings that can significantly improve this model.\n\nYou could also review the text encoder, as it takes almost 90 seconds to load, and I don't use any of the ComfyUI -flags options. The rest of the setup's extremely fast with 16 GB of VRAM and 96 GB of RAM.\n\nI really enjoy creating songs as a hobby, but anyone with basic musical knowledge can use this model and produce professional-quality work. I can't thank you enough, Ace-step team. I was using the previous version of this model, and this one's so much better for ever. Thanks again!. I hope you continue with this it and that all your projects reach new sky! ❤️",

That said, I do think it’s impressive that it can generate a 4-minute piece of music (even if the quality isn’t very high yet), and that the lyrics are implemented fairly well.\n\nAs the community grows and more external fine-tuning efforts are made, won’t the model’s performance inevitably improve?\n\nWe’re seeing a very similar situation right now with open-source image generation models as well.  \nNew models that look capable of replacing heavily fine-tuned SDXL are being released, and they’re currently waiting for further tuning and refinement.",

My point is that the audio quality is so bad it makes it useless for anything other than helping with ideas. I would much rather have something that can produce 10 seconds of good quality audio than something that can generate a whole track that sounds like garbage. \n\nIf this was an image model it would be the equivalent of it producing blurry 256x256 images.\n\nI also just find it weird that people are gushing over it and trying to hype it up as better or as good as Suno. Unless a person spends their time listening to low quality MP3s playing through their phone speakers, anyone with working ear drums should be able to hear that the sound quality is awful.",

Used in web platforms or apps it can be more appealing to some because of the more predictable outputs and no need for an API call. ",
