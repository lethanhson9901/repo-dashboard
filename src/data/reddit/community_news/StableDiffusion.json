I'm struggling though to make it work, and I'm sure it's my bad, but when I try to run the t2v workflow (first time, trying to download the model) I get the following error:   \nPrompt outputs failed validation:  \nLTX2PromptArchitect:  \n\\- Required input is missing: bypass  \n\\- Required input is missing: invent\\_dialogue\n\nFor i2v instead I get a missing node: LTX2VisionDescribe\n\nI cloned the repo and typed pip install transformers qwen-vl-utils accelerate (which it DID download stuff). Also, I noticed that when I ran the workflow many fields where filled incorrectly and I had to refill them => I don't know if this is related somehow. \n\nI'd really need your help here, sorry to bother!\n\n",

Your 32GB RAM meets or exceeds the minimum, helping with model offloading to system memory, though generation times may stretch to 10-25 minutes or more versus faster on 32GB+ VRAM GPUs.​\n\n# Key Optimizations\n\n* Launch ComfyUI with flags like `--reserve-vram 4` or `--reserve-vram 5` to prevent crashes.\n* Use distilled or quantized LTX-2 variants (e.g., ltx-2-19b-dev-fp4) and workflows from the official GitHub or ComfyUI templates.\n* Enable low-VRAM mode, avoid attention mechanisms if they cause issues, and start with short/low-res videos (e.g., 720p, 24fps).​​\n* Update NVIDIA drivers, ComfyUI, and custom nodes; tutorials like those from AISearch confirm it works on 3090s.​​\n\nExpect potential crashes or slowness without tuning, but community reports show it's viable.",

          "text": "Jesus, 25% of the system prompt is dedicated just for undressing and nudity? That's a little wild. I might fork this and change the system prompt cause you don't really expose it in the UI.\n\n    You are a cinematic prompt writer for LTX-2, an AI video generation model. Your job is to expand a user's rough idea into a rich, detailed, video-ready prompt.\n    \n    PRIORITY ORDER — always establish these first, in this order:\n    1. Video style & genre (e.g. slow-burn thriller, handheld documentary, high-fashion editorial, erotic cinema, action blockbuster)\n    2. Camera angle & shot type (e.g. low-angle close-up, bird's-eye wide shot, Dutch angle medium shot)\n    3. Character description (age MUST always be stated as a specific number e.g. \"a 28-year-old woman\" — never omit or approximate age; body type, hair, skin, clothing or nude state, distinguishing physical features — be extremely explicit and specific when instructed; name body parts directly using the exact words the user used, e.g. if user says \"pussy\" write \"pussy\" not \"sex\" or \"womanhood\")\n    4. Scene & environment (location, time of day, lighting, colour palette, textures, atmosphere)\n    \n    THEN add:\n    5. Action & motion — describe the movement as a continuous present-tense sequence, start to finish. Structure the action in clear beats.\n    \n    UNDRESSING RULE — this is mandatory when clothing removal is implied or stated:\n    If the subject is clothed at the start and the scene involves nudity, stripping, or explicit content, you MUST dedicate a full narrative segment to the undressing BEFORE any nudity or explicit act is described. This segment must:\n      - Name each garment explicitly (shirt, bra, jeans, underwear, shoes, etc.)\n      - Describe HOW it is removed — fingers on buttons, zipper pulled down, fabric sliding off shoulders, stepped out of, peeled away\n      - Describe what is physically REVEALED at each step — the collarbone, the stomach, the curve of the hip, the chest, the bare legs\n      - Follow the exact order the clothes come off — do not skip or compress steps\n      - Use camera-aware language — the camera lingers, cuts to, tilts down to reveal, holds on\n      - Do NOT jump from clothed to naked. The transition IS the content. Treat it as its own scene segment with the same density as any other beat.\n    \n    6. Camera movement — describe camera motion as prose, not bracketed directions. Never write \"(DOWN 10°)\", \"(Pull back)\", \"(Fade to black)\", \"(HOLD)\" or any screenplay-style bracketed camera instruction. Instead write it as description: \"the camera slowly tilts down to reveal the wet pavement\", \"the shot pulls back to frame the empty street\", \"the scene fades to black as she disappears around the corner.\"\n    7. Audio — Always include ambient sound. ONE [AMBIENT: sound 1, sound 2] tag only — never repeat it. Place it once at the natural end of the scene.\n       Dialogue — follow the DIALOGUE INSTRUCTION you are given exactly. When dialogue is included, write it as inline prose woven into the action — not as a labelled tag. The spoken words sit inside the sentence, attributed with delivery and physical action, exactly like a novel. Examples of correct format:\n       'He leans back, satisfied, \"I think I'll have to go back tomorrow for more,\" he chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners.'\n       '\"Don\\'t stop,\" she breathes, gripping the sheets, her voice barely above a whisper.'\n       'She turns to face him, \"I\\'ve been waiting all day for this,\" her tone quiet and certain.'\n       NEVER use [DIALOGUE: ...] tags. NEVER write dialogue as a separate bracketed block. Dialogue flows inside the prose as part of the action.\n    \n    WRITING RULES:\n    - Use present tense throughout\n    - Be explicit and cinematic — LTX-2 responds well to dense, specific visual language\n    - Match detail level to shot scale: close-ups need more physical detail, wide shots need more environmental detail\n    - Do not use vague words like \"beautiful\" or \"nice\" — describe exactly what makes it visually striking\n    - Fill the full available length — do not stop early. Expand every section with rich, layered detail\n    - Aim for 8–12 sentences of dense, flowing prose — not a bullet list\n    - Write in sections separated by a single line break for clean model parsing\n    \n    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the expanded prompt. Do NOT include preamble, commentary, labels, or any explanation. Do NOT write \"Sure!\", \"Here's your prompt:\", or anything like that. Do NOT add a checklist, compliance summary, note, or confirmation of instructions at the end — not in brackets, not as a \"Note:\", not in any form. The output ends when the scene ends. Nothing after the last sentence of the scene. Begin immediately with the video style or shot description.",

I trust you definitely needed to iterate on it like that because it looks like an instruction born of frustration.

Use SigmaPreview node from RES4LYF to see what it does.   \n  \nWhen u sample with 20 steps , what happens ? At every step a certain amount of noise is removed. You start from a full noise and in the end you get clean image. This schedule of removing noise is called \"**sigma schedule**\" . All the schedulers you choose (beta, karras, simple) are just different sigma schedules.Sigma\\_value= 1 is full noise. Sigma\\_value = 0 is clean image. \n\nWhat happens when you increase shift. You put more steps is high sigma range. High sigma is where the image is still very noisy and compositional changes can happen. After sigma of 0.75 , the composition has \"settled\" and u only add bit of details. ",

You’re kind of shifting the whole \"noise -> clean image\" curve left or right.\n\nIn videos, that can show up as more or less motion depending on how early the structure gets locked in. In images, shifting it one way can make the model commit to the overall structure earlier (which can give a stronger, more stable composition but less flexibility), while shifting it the other way keeps things noisy for longer (which can sometimes give more variation, texture, or slightly less stability).\n\nThat’s just my understanding though, but I might be oversimplifying it",

In the high sigma zone when the image still is a lot of noise, compositional changes can happen.  \nThough for a non-distilled model, if you change the seed, you change the initial noise entirely so the image should be different.   \nDue to distilled nature of ZIT , seed variance is hugely suppressed , so forcing the sampling to spend steps in high sigma can enforce a newer composition.",

Depending on steps used (4,8,20,etc), Some focus on composition (better understanding of prompt, no extra limbs, etc), and some focus on adding details. Shift on the ModelSampling SD3 node will tweak the scheduler. Hence, change the final output. Increase it, it will improve the composition, decrease it, It will improve the details. If you generate image/video, using 4 or 8 steps. Its important for you to find it's sweet spot. Anyway, it just an extra node to help you out.

With a more focused dataset it would get each a bit better. \n\n\nThis worked well though, not much breakup and it got the bands pretty well. As usual there are tricks for cleaning audio like on distill model you can turn the steps on inference up to 150, on the sft I can crank from 300-500 steps. Things for all of you to try out. ",

Yeah, this tip works great when you use style LoRA. But not so great when you literally need 1.0 strength to make it work.

Your Slavic fantasy image here is a perfect example of this. \n\nAs an alternative to LoRAs to improve variety in ZIT, you can also do a hybrid workflow of ZIB>ZIT, where ZIB crates the initial image, which is then denoised partially by ZIT.  It takes longer than ZIT but not as long as just using ZIB since you don’t have to fully generate the ZIB image, and can also upscale your latent between steps (so only ZIT does the full resolution).

          "text": "OP, I have some ideas that you can test that might change your opinions on ZiT vs Zi.  The more I use ZiT, the more I encounter the limitations of distillation.  I'm not shitting on ZiT here - overall quality and speed are great - I'm just pointing out its limitations.\n\n### Caveats for all my tests:\n* You have to use a detailed prompt because the more detail you add, the more ZiT looses diversity\n* Yes, it's possible to *sometimes* do any of these things with enough rerolls and careful prompt tweaking, but then all speed advantage of ZiT is lost\n* Yes a lora can fix any individual issue here, but every lora decreases diversity in things unrelated to the lora, even sliders.  Once you use multiple loras, diversity loss gets extreme\n* These are just the examples I can remember, but I've banged my head against many other knowledge limitations of distillation\n\n### Lighting\n* ZiT strongly leans towards boring simplistic lighting:\n  * Either frontal flash photography (like your computer room example)\n  * Or simple outdoor sunlight (like your bicyclist and princess peach examples)\n* Try testing:\n  * indoor setting without sunlight (e.g. in a bar)\n  * outdoor setting at night time\n  * prompting for specific lighting like rim-light, specific directionality, specific colors\n * in your octane render example, the ZiT lighting looks great (are you sure you didn't accidentally switch ZiT and Zi?).  But I bet if that if you add specific details about clothes, hair, and background objects, the ZiT lighting will get boring\n\n### Hairstyles\n* ZiT knows very few hairstyles, and certain hairstyles keywords are strongly associated with certain ages/ethnicities/makeup/etc.\n* Try testing:\n  * caucasian woman with pink hair\n  * pink hair but without dark roots\n  * short hair but without bangs\n  * sculpted cosplay/wig style (like your princess peach example) but with normal clothes\n  * classic 90s blowout hair or \"pageant\" hair (google to see example).  ZiT thinks \"blowout\" means curly\n\n### Facial expressions\n* ZiT can only do extreme expressions - e.g. tongue out is waaaay out, pouting is like they just bit into a lemon, surprised is like a soyjak meme\n\n### Blending anything\n* ZiT is very blending concepts creatively.  People often mention the issue with seed diversity (e.g. composition), but SVE node at least helps with that.  Nothing can fix the general lack of concept diversity and ability to blend them.\n* Try testing:\n  * Blend clothes styles of two characters ZiT knows (e.g. princess peach and lara croft)\n  * Blend cyberpunk or mecha with princess-style ornate dress\n  * harder examples like blending a motorcycle and a toy horse\n\n### Body poses\n* ZiT often makes boring body poses.  If you try to tell it where each limb goes, it's like a limp marionette.  \n* Non-photo style has better posing - like you got great results in your isekai example.\n* Try testing:\n  * standing but with legs crossed\n  * kneeling with only one knee touching the ground\n  * running hand through hair (not pulling hair away)\n  * any interesting standing pose (google \"standing pose ideas\") any try to imitate with prompting",

Comics and manga specifically need an understanding of page layouts and panel framing; you can tell when this is done well and when it's done poorly. \n\nBut the bottlenecks in this case are *not* the tools you're using. Krita itself isn't needed here; you could use comfy or forge and then generate images and then arrange them into pages via panels via gimp, for example. \n\nBut the core hurdle with both comics and anime is that most AI models, even today, do not understand things like *spacial dynamics* or *perspective* beyond the standard ones. Why? Because they're all trained on 'good' art which for training purposes is almost always splash pages or covers or figure drawing. I actually find it impressive that you've gotten some unique perspectives here. \n\nBut then, you said you used controlnets and and loras and you're the one who is storyboarding and sketching what you want, so honestly, the models aren't really doing a ton of heavy lifting. At this point you're basically still doing it all yourself! \n\nHowever, the answer I gave you before (I think) still applies here: the question is not whether you could do it, because you could train a model to do the art, it's whether or not you as the creator grasp how panels are placed and how things are cropped. \n\nSo basically, this is more a proof of concept for *you* as a storyboarder and panel setter.",

It wouldn't be impossible, but it would add a fair amount of time since you'd have to be constantly exporting or importing things between programs, adding time that would stack up into something fairly substantial by the end of a project. KRITA AI keeps everything in one interface, allowing you to make minor adjustments or quickly access tools without having to re-export things each time.\n\nThis video is the closest thing I have to my current process, so maybe this will help highlight the subtle but important differences:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHo2Gh9O-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHo2Gh9O-c)\n\nBut yes, I agree that ultimately whether something succeeds or fails is ultimately if I can put together a series of images in sequence and have it resonate with the reader.\n\n",

Even if the work comes across as amateurish, that's exactly what I am: an amateur. This is not an easy art form to get to grips with. Some people spend decades producing manga and comics and only make their debuts later in life, so without actually know my process, this kind of \"feedback\" comes across more as rude than actually criticism. \n\nBut I also wonder if it's not just a purist thing considering how you pointed out the way the character would act.\n\n\\>go read Nisekoi Chapter 1. it's in my humble opinion one of the best made manga in terms of layout, flow, timing, etc.\n\nThanks.

I am not aware of any developments that would enable something like \"deviate from the norm in an interesting way\" while not having to be very specific about what kinds of deviations you want exactly... \n\n\n\n\\> since greatness usually comes from experimenting and breaking the rules\n\n\n\nSort of.\n\n\n\nSo, just generalizing from a book about photography I read some time ago, one interesting aspect was \"you should either make your photo straight (then it looks like you know what you are doing), or with 10+° twist (then it looks like an intentional 'artistic' deviation), but don't do it only slightly off, because then it looks just accidental and therefore bad\". So, more generally, the idea is probably something like you should first learn the rules, and then break them deliberately and strongly, so you get a sense of the motivation behind them. It also means you should probably not break too many rules at once, particularly not at the beginning, because then it will also just look random and messy... but all of that is more of a \"general art thing\", than something specific to AI. However, AI probably enables you to more quickly iterate over and thereby learn all the various rules, so... that's definitely a good thing.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah, it's certainly interesting to see this result you made here, because (similar to programming), you still have to understand the fundamental principles relatively well (in some ways this is even getting more important), it's just that the execution-part itself becomes significantly less important.",

I don't trust it with the figure drawing as I have more stylistic preferences. \n\n1) first image. the pose in the clock image is too flat, imo. You can stick the clock in the back of the first image.\n\n2) not really, yet. It looks good, but to really take advantage of A.I, I'd expect at least the visual quality of mitsuyoshi kanketsuhen.

That on its own is a little mini project and I'm just trying to get the comic itself finished.\n\nSo I've dabbled with backgrounds and found that the SDXL models I've tried are generally pretty good at them. Effects are another story. At this point I tried using Flux2 Klein 9b and it's very hit and miss at adding effects. However, there has been some happy accidents with screen tones and shading that it made that have given me some ideas.",

I've found the fill-in from rotoscoping things with VACE to be very imprecise, it misses grey sections quite a lot, particularly on the outlines of the masks - have to do a ton of post-processing/editing to fix it.

Even your \"2.2 workflow\" seems to just be a 2.1 workflow that loads the 2.2 low noise t2v model instead of the 2.1 t2v model.\n\nCan you say why this is? I'm curious. For what I do with it, Fun VACE produces superior results (motion, image quality) to 2.1 VACE. But I know the community tends to dismiss Fun VACE because it's not \"real\" VACE.

The first video is generated well using an inpainted reference image.  I used sam3 for masking and ImageCompositeMasked for grey masking. To maintain consistency, I use the last frame of the first video as the reference image for the second video. because if I provided another inpainted image for the second clip the shape would never match. anyway then I realized I can send bunch of imgs to ref image input in WanVaceToVideo Node. I think this way feels better Idk. However, I’ve noticed that the color and shape of the hat change significantly starting from the second video. This issue becomes particularly severe when the video exceeds 3 seconds even in the first clip. so I changed my plan to make 2 seconds long videos then stich them up. but it still produce some color and shape shifting. I chained the process  until 5 clips. then at 5 clip, it always ruined the whole shape.  They say wan2.2 fun vace is better but its node doesn't have mask input so there's no way for object swap in wan 2.2 fun vace. Do you have any solutions to resolve this? I'm sure there is because I've seen 1min long video where some objects are removed but there was no color shifting and weird artifacts. I compare it to the original video, it was beautifully done. I just don't know how. been asking around this and no one answered. ",

The scenario is I train the LoRA, run it through your program and find the offender, then I throw it out and retrian. Cool, but what I'd rather do is to have a program that looks at my training dataset and tells me how many redundant photos I have. I have noticed that very often with training datasets, less is more. Adding more photos just makes training go longer without any real change. The tool I \"need\" is one that can scan through a lot of photos and rank them in order of similarity to the rest of the dataset.\n\nI don't know if that completely makes sense, but I'm hoping you are getting the gist of what I am talking about.",

          "text": "Hi everyone!\n\n\n\nLast week I shared \\`MirrorMetrics\\`, a local tool to evaluate LoRAs using biometric telemetry (InsightFace) instead of just \"vibes\". The feedback was amazing, and thanks to a user's insight about dataset consistency, I realized we were missing a critical piece of the puzzle: \\*\\*Forensics.\\*\\*\n\nI just released \\*\\*v0.10.0\\*\\*, and it introduces two major features based on your requests:\n\n\n\n\\### 1. The \"Copycat\" Detector (Forensic Analysis) 🕵️‍♂️\n\nWe all fear overfitting. But usually, we just look at a generated image and think \"This looks stiff.\"\n\nNow, the tool runs a \\*\\*Nearest Neighbor Search\\*\\* in the vector space.\n\n\\* It compares every generated image against your entire training dataset.\n\n\\* It generates a visual report (see screenshot) showing exactly WHICH training image inspired the generation.\n\n\\* \\*\\*The Utility:\\*\\* If you see a similarity score > 0.90, your model isn't learning concepts; it's photocopying pixels. You can now pinpoint exactly which images are \"poisoning\" your training.\n\n\n\n\\### 2. Macro/Close-up Rescue (Smart Padding) 🔭\n\nA limitation of InsightFace/RetinaFace is that it often fails to detect faces in extreme close-ups (because the face fills the frame, hiding the edges).\n\nI implemented a \\*\\*\"Rescue Mode\"\\*\\*: if a face isn't found, the tool automatically applies a smart padding (\"zoom out\") and retries.\n\n\\* \\*\\*Result:\\*\\* In my tests, this recovered about \\*\\*10-15% of valid dataset images\\*\\* that were previously ignored. These are often the high-texture images crucial for skin/age evaluation!\n\n\n\n\\### Links\n\nThe tool is 100% Open Source and runs locally on your GPU.\n\n\n\n\\* \\*\\*GitHub (Code & Install):\\*\\* [https://github.com/AndyLone22/MirrorMetrics](https://github.com/AndyLone22/MirrorMetrics)\n\n\\* \\*\\*CivitAI (Full Guide):\\*\\* [https://civitai.com/articles/26241/stop-training-on-vibes-a-visual-guide-to-biometric-lora-diagnosis-mirror-metrics](https://civitai.com/articles/26241/stop-training-on-vibes-a-visual-guide-to-biometric-lora-diagnosis-mirror-metrics)\n\n\n\nLet me know if the \"Copycat\" report helps you prune your datasets! I'm currently experimenting with 3D Latent Space visualization for the next update. 🚀",

          "text": "I know I'm basically saying what I said before but I genuinely don't understand what you're trying to do here conceptually speaking. You keep throwing in things and it's not clear where or how they come into effect. For example, you cite nano banana pro, which is a paid model you can't train loras for. So I don't know what you're doing there, or with gemini. \n\nUnless you're trying to generate people via their paid model, and then tell them to generate more images with that same person? And if so, I have no idea why you need or would want a lora for that? Just use a real person at that point? \n\nLike I don't know what you're doing here, training wise. Are you just training loras, saving every epoch, and then generating images based on the same prompts as your dataset? Because if so, you'd *want* them to look as similar as possible, that's the whole point. And obviously, if your outputs don't look right, that is also obvious that it's undertrained. \n\nA very normal way to test if something is overtrained or overfitted is to just put it in a pose or a perspective that isn't in your dataset *at all*, such as over the shoulder from behind or from above or something. \n\nI'm really not trying to be mean but you seemed to have created a lot of data, but none of the data really *means* anything and it's not that you've stopped working off of vibes, you've just created infographics for those vibes? Because the data is no less vibes based than just eyeballing it, and when it's *not*, it's rather obvious. \n\nAgain, I don't know what you're trying to do; if you're trying to measure how accurate a realistic lora is for a person, then there is a single baseline, which is 'how close to the training data can it get while being able to replicate it *outside of your training data.*' Right now, it's unclear you're testing anything in a way that would give you good results that's not vibes based, because you proved for yourself that you don't need a computer to tell you that it's over or underfitted based on the output images.\n\nMeaning that in the course of generating the images you learned the same thing all the random data you gathered told you. That means it's not needed because you already have the info. \n\nThe sole time this is useful is if you're trying to judge between two or three near identical checkpoints. But even *then* that's just vibes because the amount of things each one can do is going to vary due to how LORAs learn. The one that might produce better front results might do worse from the side, and the one with better results from the side might do worse from the front. \n\nBut nothing you've made makes the process and more accurate. It's just datasets showing you what you already know. \n\nAnd it's not a case of removing data; if you remove the data because you think that image is overfitted, that's not going to result in a more accurate result, it's going to result in something completely different, namely the model being now overfitted on those images. \n\nWhen you prune datasets, the things you want to remove are not the things it does *well,* but the things it does *poorly,* because it's confusing the model and skewing results. If you're overfitting to one thing, that means you need *more varied data* not *less data overall.* \n\nIt just seems like everything you're doing here is counterproductive and not likely to give you better, more accurate results with any local model.

              "text": "Thanks for the detailed feedback!  \nI think there is a significant misunderstanding regarding the workflow and the goal of this tool (my bad surely, I must be more precise when I write). Let me clarify:\n\n**1. The Workflow (No paid models involved)** Nano Banana was only used to generate the images needed to show CLEAR results on the charts and I needed to have them fast to simulate precise results and create the guide. If you look at the guide I made in CivitAI it should be clear from the first graph: overfit, undertrain, ok. [https://civitai.com/articles/26241](https://civitai.com/articles/26241)\n\nNow to create a graph showing exactly what this tool is capable of, I would've had to make at least 2 overly and intentionally wrong trainings, which would have resulted in a waste of compute (and money in my case since I don't have big harware and should've rented it on cloud).\n\nHope this clarifies why the use of Nano Banana (which is a paid model, and out of the scope of this tool, as you suggested, but a necessary evil in the name of clarity).\n\n**2. \"Vibes\" vs. Metrics (The core disagreement)** You say: *\"You proved for yourself that you don't need a computer to tell you that it's over or underfitted based on the output images.\"*\n\nI'm not sure I agree with this, and I say it from experience. The \"Eyeball Test\" (Vibes) works fine if you are checking 5 images (the examples created for the guide are extremized to show clearly the difference, as I mentioned before). But it fails completely if you are comparing:\n\n* 5 different checkpoints (Epoch 10 vs 15 vs 20).\n* 3 different learning rates.\n* A batch of 100 generated images across multiple angles.\n\n**MirrorMetrics** turns *\"I think this looks a bit like him\"* into *\"Cosine Similarity: 0.78\"*. It turns *\"This model seems stiff\"* into *\"Pose Variance: Low\"*. It allows you to **quantify** the trade-off between flexibility and likeness. It's the difference between cooking by smell and cooking with a thermometer. Of course, both methods work, and one might say that the better chef cooks just by tasting and smelling, but the mathematical method is in my opinion a \"good addition to the toolkit\".\n\n**3. Overfitting & The Copycat Detector** You mentioned: *\"If you remove the data because you think that image is overfitted... it's going to result in the model being now overfitted on those \\[other\\] images.\"*\n\nThis is technically incorrect in the context of Deep Learning. If a specific image in your dataset has a similarity of >0.95 with the output (meaning the model is memorizing/photocopying it regardless of the prompt), that image is acting as a **\"Gradient Black Hole\"**. It's overpowering the weights. Removing or fixing the caption of that specific outlier allows the model to distribute its attention better across the rest of the dataset, actually **increasing** generalization, not reducing it.\n\n**TL;DR:** The tool is for users who want to move from \"feeling\" that a model is ready to \"knowing\" it is ready based on biometric data (InsightFace), especially when fine-tuning delicate parameters.\"\n\nBut, as I mentioned from the beginning: this is just a tool, it should be taken as such.  \nOther thing I mentioned before: I love Data Science and pretty graphs, so... there's that too. 🤣",

          "text": "Been using the model for a little bit now, and for anyone wondering, so far my positives are that it learns much faster than Noob/Illustrious. In my experience doing style loras, it takes around half or a quarter of the steps (usually I do 1000 at batch 4 on Noob) without having to deal with annoyances like MinSNR or EDM2 for vpred, Multires Noise for eps, or just SDXL refusing to learn styles in general due to the useless VAE. It also doesn't seem to overfit nearly as hard on stuff such as backgrounds or text (unlike Noob, which made Lora mixing very inconsistent sometimes). Anima also does have better prompt comprehension and colors, and will likely have better details once the 1024 res model is trained. With that being said though the finetunes or merges of Anima right now on Civit are all pretty bad, I would not recommend bothering with them. There's NL too, which actually does work decently well.\n\nAs for the negatives, the main one is that the dataset contains Deviantart... I have no idea what the idea was behind that. There also seems to be issues with forgetting when training character or concept loras, and finally, the use of Qwen 0.6B which is just laughably small. 2B or even 4B would barely impact prompt processing while still fitting under 8GB Vram anyways, 0.6B would just be a mistake to go forward with imo. Anima is also very bad at upscaling right now without a proper CN tile model, and seems to have bad artifacting for upscaling vertical images.\n\nAt the very least, there are much better practices being taken for Anima's training compared to Noob, which is that tag dropout is actually being used, and the 2 extra datasets (ye-pop and Deviantart) were actually labeled. Overall I think Anima will be a hard replacement for Illustrious once it's done and at worst a sidegrade for Noob. (And if it wasn't obvious already, this model literally only does anime. It might do some realism due to the laion pop dataset, but it won't look good).\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, if you're using Illu/Noob in 2026, then yes, Anima does do NSFW completely fine. However it is lacking somewhat in the details, though this will likely improve by the final model",

It's the same size as SDXL, I think people expect too much because it outperforms SDXL in some ways. There were a bunch of experiments to change the CLIP to something smarter and it made a tiny amount of difference in quality while absolutely trashing the runtime speed.\n\nThink of it this way, if you teach your dog to speak and think in English, would the dog be as smart as a human?

It runs a watermarked image through a diffusion model and the output looks the same but the watermark is gone. A single pass at low strength fools SynthID. There's also a CtrlRegen mode for higher quality. Strips all AI metadata too.\n\nMostly built this for research and education, wanted to understand how these systems work under the hood.

Of course you can right-click and open image in a new tab, but a single click would be nice.\n\nThere's also a lot of space for more formatted items, so perhaps the seed, steps, cfg, sampler, scheduler and parsed fields, since this appears to be geared towards ComfyUI-generated images.  But some of those may be more challenging to parse, since different custom nodes may use slightly different names for the tokens.  Just some ideas.",

Before this, I had a tool that extracted the entire workflow json, but I had to manually cut out the prompt itself.\n\nI integrated your HTML file with my AI image gallery app (XnView) and file browser using applescripts (I guess Windows has a similar tool).  So now I can right-click any image from the gallery app or the file browser and easily grab its prompt.\n\nThe script opens your HTML file in the browser and copies the image to the clipboard.  It could even automate the paste action, but that would require choosing a degraded browser security level.  So I'd rather just paste.",

But that also means it tends to tunnel to solutions more aggressively, which this lora hopes to fix.",
