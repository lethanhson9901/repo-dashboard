I find that blending their styles with a more realistic painter, or even mixing a painter with a sculptor, can achieve the modern retro-Art deco immitation look I like. Honestly, some fringe cases of Art Nouveau artists can be made to look Deco by negative prompting away the curves and florals. \n\nSorry that turned rambly lol.",

The current version is locked to this specific atlas layout (grid) because that's what was in the dataset.\n3. You're right about SpriteFonts! Since the output is already a consistent grid, it should be pretty easy to slice and use in game engines.\n\nIf you try it with different inputs, let me know how it goes!",

The culprit was a bug in my dataset generation script that caused the letters to 'jump' slightly, and the LoRA learned those patterns perfectly.\n\nI've actually just finished fixing the dataset script, and the results are looking much better now. Internal tests show a far more consistent baseline and spacing.\n\nI'll be working on retraining the LoRA with this clean data for V2.",

Structured fonts with outlines and shadows are definitely the 'final boss' for this V1. The main bottleneck is the 1024x1024 resolution—when you fit 50+ glyphs into that space, each individual letter has very few pixels to define complex details like double outlines or consistent shadows.\n\nYour suggestion about iterating through letter pairs is a great one for high-end quality, though it would sacrifice the 'one-shot' speed which was the main goal for this version.\n\nI agree that it’s not a 100% replacement for a pro typographer yet, but I hope it still serves as a solid starting point that saves at least some of the grunt work.

I’ll add the prompt directly to the HuggingFace, GitHub and Reddit descriptions to make it clearer for everyone.\n\nAs for the LoRA’s role: you nailed it! That’s why I called it a **contextual LoRA**. FLUX is amazing at understanding style from a reference, but it doesn't know how to organize that style into a structured 8x9 alphabet atlas on its own. The LoRA provides that 'logical bridge' and ensures the grid consistency. Without it, the model just generates a mess of styled characters, as seen in your example.",

You could just use Mocha to mask him and then apply an edge gausian blur of like 0.1px in some scenes to soften him, fix the hairline manually it's just like 3 frames, and add some directional blur to some spots (mostly the feet) and match the original shot pretty much 1:1.\n\n\nThe annoying part is you would have to color grade pretty hard to get rid of that weird contrasty look LTX gives every i2v video making it pretty much useless for extending real footage that it didn't originally create.",

The Anima (preview) is so undertrained that it's quality is closer to SD 1.5 in that regards. SDXL (Illustrious) has come a long way to this point, and I think Anima would took much more finetunes to get it right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9u9iq2my6ig1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c94b558f337ffa62da455a5dee016447c33460d3\n\n*(left) Anima preview; (right) Illustrious finetunes: UnholyDesireMix v7*\n\nBoth is using similar prompt without additional refining/LoRA at 512x512 resolution, only using inherent artist tag prompt:\n\n    @mika_pikazo. masterpiece, best quality. 1girl, score_8, score_9. murasaki shion from hololive, she is wearing white summer dress, looking at viewer with annoyed face, she is holding a greatsword with both hands, the sword design reminds of magic knight rayearth swords. white background. chromatic aberration. modern anime style, late 2020. multiple splash of paint decoration in background with colors: cyan, shocking pink, and yellow. Giant stylish text written \"ASUNA\" with smaller text written \"pactio\".\n\nwith negatives:\n\n    worst quality, low quality, score_1, score_2, score_3, score_4, score_5, score_6, blurry, jpeg artifacts, sepia, badly drawn finger\n\nI'm trying to jumble up as many unrelated things in one composition to see how it goes **(characters) (clothings) (items from other IP) (color sampling) (multiple text formats)**. With Illustrious removed the score tags and replaced \"@\" with \"by\" for the artists tag. What most people didn't seems to know is that Illustrious model also capable of natural language prompt to some degree.\n\nI love what Anima brings to the table as 2B model, more model variations for us to use is always welcome but I think the quality needs further refine. Also no, it's not '*Illustrious killer*' as many people prophesize it to be, at least not yet with this quality. If there is one thing that I would say stood up against SDXL right now is how it could renders written text better, but the longer your prompt the less likely it succeed in doing so.",

It goes beyond just typing two artists at random and seeing what comes out. I spend hours on image search engines to find artists that might mesh well, using controlnets to guide composition, etc. \n\nModern models are hit or miss. I am a proponent of the Flux2 family after being a staunch Flux1 dev hater because they have *some* artist knowledge. A good foundational artist knowledge is crucial to this use, as no amount of manual of LLM-generated style descriptors can capture a look. The Chinese teams behind Qwen and Z image lack of concern for copyright would have been promising but they don't seem interested in artist tagging, at least in English. \n\nWhile the edit models are somewhat promising for style transfer, they don't hold a candle to SDXL's IPadapter and the tools developed by /u/Matt3o back when he was active in this space [he has since left the Comfy community, sadly). What we need is someone to get really invested in better controlnets and IPadapter stand ins. QRcode controlnets were a HUGE boone in SD1.5 and SDXL eras, something which people have forgotten with the newer unified controlnets. \n\nThose are my rambling thoughts. \n\ntl;dr people interested in remixing artist styles and making visually cool stuff still exist. We need to post more. Share workflows, experiments, and ideas on reddit. We can keep this going, maybe even revitalize the interest among newcomers.",

              "text": "I wonder if theres a way through coding to emulate high variation without losing final \"specifcity\" of an image. \n\nI was originally replying to your comment in a much simpler way but it got me thinking and I ended up reasoning about it much more than I planned. \n\n**Don't feel like you are obligated to read it**, but im gonna post it anyways just so i can reference later and in case anyone else wants to try this\n\n---\n\n# Idea\n\n## Background\nI'm basing this of my experience with tensorboard where even though a model has hundreds of dimensions, it will surface the top 3 dimensions in terms of spread across latent space according to the initial word list you fed it. \n\n\nI'm probably explaining all of this poorly but basically its giving you the most useful 3d view of something with WAY more than 3 dimensions. If you google a tensorboard projection map or better yet try one yourself my idea might make more sense.\n\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Make a \"variation\" word list containing common modifiers. Generate embeddings for these with a given model's text encoder\n \n\n2. Take the image gen prompt and chunk it according to semantic boundaries that make the most sense for the model type (i.e.  by sentence boundary for LLM text encoder models or by new line for CLIP or T5). \n \n\n3. Generate embeddings of each prompt chunk. You may decide to cluster here to limit number chunks to keep the final results more generalized thus coherent.\n \n\n4. Combine the variation embedding list with your prompt chunk list. Use a weighting factor (k) to represent the prompt chunks at an optimal ratio vs word list (as determined by testing)\n \n\n5. Calculate the top n dimensions of highest variability for this combined list (this is where the weight ratio we apply to prompt chunks matters). The value for n would be a knob for you to choose but \"3\" seems like a good starting point and also what you need for that super cool tensorboard projection map.\n \n\n6. For each of your (n) dimensions sample the top (y) nearest neighbors from variation embeddings to each prompt chunk (c) embedding (closeness can be calculated a few different ways, but i'll assume cosine distance for now)\n \n\n7. Now you have a list of variation embeddings that are semantically related to your prompt. The quantity of variation embeddings will be equal to the product of (n)(y)(c) \n\n>    (n: number of most expressive dimensions sampled)\n> x (y: number of nearest neighbors in each dimension for a given prompt chunk)\n> x (c: number of prompt chunks)\n> = (total number or \"semantically coherent\" variation embeddings)\n\n\n8. During diffusion you inject one of the (y) per (n) per (c) into the process. You would probably want to do so according to a schedule:\n\n> early steps for structural variation\n\n> later steps for fine detail variation. \n\nYou never inject more than one variation embedding for a given dimension for a given prompt chunk, you don't want to cause a regression to the mean which would happen if you nearest neighbors were of approx. equal but opposite vectors from the prompt chunks\n\n### Refinements\n\n- You could make targeted \"variation\" word lists that focus on describing variations for a specific topic. Perhaps a \"human morphology\" list, an \"art style\" list (if your text encoder understands them), or even a specialized \"Domain specific\" list containing niche descriptive words most salient in a specific domain like \"Star Wars\" or something\n\n\n- Remember that we are going to weight the relative strength of the word list vs prompt chunks list (k factor). This is a powerful coarse knob that controls for \"relatedness\" to the original prompt. This will be the first knob I go to if my idea is yielding too strong or too weak of an effect\n\n\n- Instead of choosing (y) nearest neighbors for a given dimension, perhaps grab the closest nearest neighbor, then grab the 2nd closest neighbors BUT only from the opposite direction in relation to the specific prompt chunk embedding. \n\n> Think of it as a line with our prompt chunks embedding as point on the line. We are choosing the next closest point, then the next closest point on the other side of the line relative to chunk embedding.",

Why push for development in more creative art styles when we already know AI can already achieve good results?\n\nI think once consistently good anatomy for people is achieved it'll come back around again. All of this is community driven by the needs of the community, and currently for those that want creative art styles are generally satisfied with 1.5 for now. But the community that needs good anatomy aren't satisfied and are driving most of the changes at the moment. Once that is done, who knows what will be on the cards for new developments?",

          "text": "Along your point : picking the model's intricacies was great fun and finding something, some combination \"that was ours\" was a great great feeling. \n\nOf course it all came down  to a wide range of visual and artists styles that were \"easily\" recoverable from the model. And you'll agree that it's easier to say \"in the style of Monet and (Mucha:1.1)\" that saying \"impressionist  painting using medium to large touches in slow progressing gradients with low to medium thickness and medium to high paint mixing, cross referenced with (detailed and intricate.... Yadyayada:1.1)\". For the first and simple reason that tokens are expensive, and overflowing the maximum gave you basic random omissions (which has its perks but increases the slot machine effect).\n\nNow that the SD styles era is past (except maybe with ZIB and SDXL revivals), if one wants to \"pick the model\" for creativity, it has to use the basic blocks available, such as the long and detailed descriptions of what one expects from the model : tool, influence, touch, color, hues, gradients, forms, eras, etc, which is very fine if you know your art history, and leaves all who don't in the mud. A lot of people here have learned HEAPS of visual language by trying, looking at prompts, studying the images etc, and those are the ones who came to better control their outputs, even back in the SD era.\n\nBut with modern models (and maybe encoders too idk about that) , I have this feeling that the open source releases are geared towards our of the box utility. I think (and may be wrong) rhat it's why ZImage released the photo-focused Turbo first - they had to make a great impression that works right outside the box. If they'd let Base out first (on top of maybe be unfinished back then) literally every post in this sub would have been \"Flux does it better\" and it would have taken years to get off. \n\nOne of the reasons, I think, is because most open source users aren't power users or commercial users with intent. They're just happy to explore, but there's little \"need\" from them to go beyond what the défaut 1girl prompt would provide. And so, in part, this killed some of the open source model's \"creativity\". Again I don't like to employ that word here, because to me as a former graphics designer, the creativity is never in the tool, no matter how potent. \n\nPeople used the infamous \"high seed variation\" SDXL for years generating huge batches of the same prompt and trashing the output until the image they wanted stood out - if that's what everyone calls creativity, I gotta swap planets. But when they have an idea even partial and try stuff and mix and match and refine and go back and most importantly end up saying \"I won't go further this is final\" they made a decision, they brought it there, and this they created.\n\nI'd argue that SD1.5 and SDXL are extremely useful today for generating basic elements that are refined and reworked with the precision and prompt adherence or modern models ! Finding pieces and bits that could be used in CREATIVE ways, assembled and refined to look like something else, and finally tell a story that would take 20x the prompt context to explain with the perfect words (hoping that the model, your own expression in English/Chinese, the quantization of your TEs and your models etc etc etc would let all the nuances through) - that's the future  of creativity in AI gens. Not T2I alone, not I2I alone, but a mixture of everything that you, the user, keeps on making happening - not because the \"model is capable\" with lazy prompts.",

You cannot watch a movie for the first time again. Not only is there a lot that's better, and a lot that's being innovated on, the peak was certainly not more than two years ago. Nowhere close. \n\nAI is no longer a novelty. It is maturing and becoming the sort of thing that is specialized.

They tried to make realistic SD 1.5 fine tunes and posted countless threads with titles like \"does this look realistic?\" (and still do). Whenever someone released a new fine tune, one of the first questions was always \"how good is it at realism?\".\n\nWhen Pony v6 was released, some of them got really angry by the fact that it didn't do realism. They explained that realism and one day being able to use it for virtual reality was the ultimate goal of generative AI and something everyone should be striving towards.\n\nPersonally, I have zero interest in realism. I find realism boring. From the very start, I've wanted to create something that looks like the comics that I grew up with. That has been quite hard to find. Everything is focused on either realism or anime. I've often ended up using furry models to generate human characters since they tend to have a more Western cartoon and comic book style. I finally found the Arthemy Illustrious models which are fairly close to what I've been looking for.\n\n>Pony was the peak\n\nI feel this too in a way. For me, it was the biggest leap in usability, when I could suddenly generate all the character portraits I had tried to make since the SD 1.4 days. Illustrious is better, but it feels more like a gradual improvement. Z-Image-Turbo is the first model in years that made me feel truly excited since it makes it easy to create complex scenes with multiple characters. My goal is to create images that tell a story.",

The other day I build a workflow to generate artistic images with sd1.5 and then passes the results to Flux Klein to improve it without dropping the visual quality: I found myself again hooked for 4 hours straight in a continuous dopamine rush. \n\nSd1.5 knows almost any artists, architect and designer you can name; my huge pleasure is mixing names of artists in various promoted weights and seeing what the heck comes out, plus you had embedding which were like loras but easy, intuitive, fast and didn’t break the images. \n\nThe reason why artists have been scraped out of models is frankly respectable. There are huge copyright and intellectual property issues which had to be addressed. In a more ‘correct’ world a Rembrandt Lora should be trained and sold or given for free by the Rijksmuseum, maybe in collaboration with other museums and each should be able to decide if giving it for free or for a price. \n\nThat said you can train Loras for everything still today and it works, but it’s not the same thing: we mostly use flow distilled models today so the results are often limited and too influenced by realism; the sd1.5 results were amazing because the model gave completely varied result and the generation was influenced by the enormous amount of art inside the dataset; so words like “golden ratio, modernist, abstract” gave amazing results while Klein or Zimage will just prefer to generate triangles and spirals. \n\nSd1.5->Klein is still my way to go for personal pleasant time generating; the only thing that could change that at the moment is a complete finetune of the 9b Klein model. This would cost millions of $, thousands of hours of work and it would be highly illegal, that’s why I don’t see that happening soon. \n\nIt could happen as some guerrilla-like hidden project where lots of people put together the enormous dataset (and captions, I think that’s the hardest part to do well) and then collect a big sum of money to train with pro gpus in cloud. \n\nAnother solution which would also be legal would be train a paid model (maybe 30$ per month fee?) which gives the artists money each time their particular work is used in generations. This would be legal, socioeconomically fair, decentralized, but I don’t see this happening either for a variety of reasons. \n\nCreativity in AI in the end is always handled by your own human talent, so with Sd1.5 creativity did not die, it just requires way more human effort to get there, (other than training Lora’s you can use an artwork or even your sketch to mildly denoise an image with any model) which probably is a good thing for artists, designers, architects; I’m not 100% sure though, it’s something that should be debated by someone with way more culture than the one I possess.",

Or there's a huge market for realistic girls.\n\nYes, there is absolute a huge market for realistic 1girls.  Just look at the top models on Civitai.\n\nBut no, A.I. is not overtrained in art.  In fact, most artists have not been trained into LoRAs.  I've trained hundreds of them, and there are thousands more to go if I want to continue 😅: [https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models](https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models)\n\nNow back to SD1.5 \"creativity\" vs the supposed \"lack of creativity\" in newer models.\n\nA.I. models are mainly used in two ways.  One is for \"brainstorming\", where one tries out simple ideas and let the A.I. \"fill in the blanks\".  This is where SD1.5/SDXL's higher level of hallucinatory \"creativity\" may be useful.\n\nThe other is to use A.I. as a tool with a high level of control, where the A.I. responds precisely to a detailed prompt as one refines one's idea as to what the image should look like. \n\nIn general, most people who are \"serious\" about using A.I. as a creative tool will pick control over hallucination, in the same way that one would want an assistant that will follow precise instruction to carry out a task rather than one that just goes off and do thing according to his own whims.\n\nWith current SOTA models, users who have the creativity and the imagination, can create most thing (except those involving complex interactions between two characters) that they can envision ([a bad workman blames his tools](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bad+workman+always+blames+tools)) 😅\n\nMaybe the ideal A.I. model is one that can do both, and to some extent, Chroma and ZiBase are heading in that direction, but many users are not happy with the fact that a lot more trial and error involving more negative prompt and other incantation such as \"aesthetic 11\" are involved due to the more \"creative\" nature of these less \"tuned\" models.\n\nFinally, if one wants modern models to hallucinate like SD1.5 in the good old days, there are random prompt generators, wildcards, and even noise injection nodes.",

Good for impatient people and video models (altho I think no video model uses it, yet). Also obviously makes generation a lot faster and more accurate (to some extent, its only as accurate as training data).\n\nThere are \"between\" things, like DMD2, which is almost like flow, but not really. While its good, it has sort of its \"idea how things should look\" which tend to override any model tied to it.

When people run local models these days it sure seems like they are doing it because they want to explore off the rails.  It’s not that creativity is dead, it’s just that nanobannana will make that Michelangelo painting of your dog  perfectly in seconds, so why spend 3 hours downloading things trying to get a local model to get it just right?",

A generation on my 5060 Ti 16GB / 3000 Mt/s RAM with your default settings got me the atlas in 7min 20s.\n\nHere's one test I did:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o3597anw9ig1.jpeg?width=1946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bfa9622e84250bdf1ae063b611c836937b01808\n\n\\- The image demonstrates some problems. In the generated atlas, the letter E's top line is not connected to the rest of the letter, so it got ignored by the ttf converter. Quotation marks are also pretty pretty commonly used, so it'd be nice they'd be included in atlas (or just more glyphs in general). I also think the lowercase letters don't look as \"unique\" as my \"a\" was, but I think that could be solved with adjusting the LORA's strength.\n\n\\- I believe I’ve also found a bug in the ttf converter: if the atlas filename is a single word with a capital letter, the resulting ttf font name is forced to lowercase. However, if the filename contains multiple parts, the original capitalization is preserved. Example: `Name.png` \\-> `name.ttf`, but `Name_01.png` \\-> `Name_01.ttf`.\n\n\\- I removed \"Generate letters and symbols\" from the prompt and didn't see it affecting the output. I did limited testing, but the more simple a base prompt is, the better UX it is for user.\n\nOverall, I'm quite impressed. Nice work!",

In the current script, 'E' is treated as a single-part letter. If the top bar is disconnected, the script discards it as noise. Try running it with --min-component-area 1 and increase --keep-components to 5. I will update the script to include more letters in the \"multi-part\" list.  **Edit: I updated the script in GitHub Repo.**\n2. **TTF Filename Bug:** Great catch! I'll look into the sanitize\\_name function and how the FontBuilder handles case sensitivity.\n3. **Prompt:** I haven't tried making the prompt shorter, but if it works, that's great!\n4. **More Glyphs:** Definitely planned for V3!\n\nThanks again, this helps a lot to make the tool better!",

Comfy exists because of them, and this grant is our way of giving back and continuing to empower the ecosystem.\n\nI know, I know, $1M alone won’t train a state-of-the-art foundation model today. That’s okay. This is just the starting point. Beyond direct funding, we also support grantees with real-world evaluation, production testing, and promotion across the Comfy platform.\n\nGrant recipients retain full control over their model and license (as long as it remains open) and can automatically enroll in our Cloud revenue share program to further sustain the project.\n\nWe can’t wait to see all the amazing open source models that come out of this effort.\n\nApply for the grant at [https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant](https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant)\n\nFYI: you can try out the Anima model here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima)",

While it was said to be for ease of organization, the reality is that this makes it easy to replace anyone from top to bottom. \n\nThese kind of moves, along with throwing around big money, and corps seeing monetary interest in the project, tend to signal a coming buyout by a big investor.

Now we have a new asset list where we need to double click. (why?) And even worse, the new asset list just stops workling after a couple of hundred gens. Sometimes earlier. Never happened with the old asset list. \n\nThe we have this new panel on the right. The job queue. It cumbersome and doesnt really help me. No way to hide it. It shows super small thumbnails and parts of my filename. Dont need this taking away my screenstate... except when i need to cancel queued jobs\n\nWe had cancel and stop buttons. What a great invention that was. Until you took them away. Cancel button is back now (thanks!!!) but stop button still missing. Of course i can click that weird icon in the job-queue that will cancel all other jobs except the current on. But if i am on instant gen (and i am often on instant gen) it keeps going. I have to switch to single run, click run, cancel the other jobs, cancel the current job just to stop it all. It was a single button before all these updates. It takes me 4 clicks now to stop the instant generations. its painful.\n\nI dunno. The UI in comfy is all but comfy. I know this is free software. I did not a pay a cent. But all these options were in there at one point and then the enterprisification of the software has started. \n\nSo please bring back the stop button. That would be real nice.",

Every single example is not what the core anime-centric community is wanting. They're all uber retro, even among retro, art style examples and literal fan art quality examples. We don't have a proper idea of how it does with modern anime screencaps, or even retro anime screencaps, which are what most people would expect from this kind of model.\n\nAt first, I thought it was weird the creator posted that only super low quality flash art example and the first two threads didn't even attempt to use examples people would legitimately care about, but since then this response has continued in every single Anima post I can find it has now become weird. Can it really just not do 90s, 2000s, etc. anime screen-cap outputs? Is it really that biased and trained almost exclusively on Deviant art and such works? I've seen two iffy random user comment examples, and one was extremely bad as if it couldn't understand the prompt.\n\nWell, utterly poor publicity and information aside I don't want to assume it DOA until it has a chance to prove itself but I'm definitely not feeling hopeful about it at this point. It is kind of looking to potentially be ultra niche though...",

          "text": "The author, \"None-南,\" reports that despite the community spending significant money (tens of thousands in compute costs) and countless hours tuning parameters for the new Z-Image model, training results were consistently poor. Users experienced issues such as grey images, structural collapse, and instability (oscillating between overfitting and non-convergence).\n\n**The Root Cause: The \"Ancient Bug\"**  \nAfter deep analysis and log auditing with the Z-Image team, the culprit was identified as the **bitsandbytes AdamW8bit optimizer**.\n\n* Z-Image is a DiT model with a single-stream architecture that requires High Dynamic Range (HDR) precision.\n* The AdamW8bit optimizer relies on an outdated `Uint8` format. This format has a too narrow range for Z-Image's needs, causing minute gradients to be truncated or zeroed out during training. Essentially, the model was \"slacking off\" and not learning.\n\n**The Solution: Switching to FP8**  \nThe author suggests abandoning the 8bit optimizer entirely and has released a custom-wrapped **FP8 optimizer** (based on native PyTorch support).\n\n* **Results:** Switching to FP8 resulted in approximately **40% faster convergence**, eliminated strange noise, improved composition stability, and ensured compute cost translated directly into model quality.\n\n**Additional Training Tips from the Author:**\n\n* **Rank:** Needs to be 64+; Alpha should typically be half of the Rank.\n* **Captioning:** Avoid being too brief or writing overly complex \"essays.\" Use moderate, concise, and accurate descriptions.\n* **Steps:** DiT models (like Z-Image) have high internal precision requirements; aim for 1000+ steps (Repeat \\* Epoch).\n* **Loss:** A value between 0.2 and 0.25 typically indicates good performance.\n\nThe author has provided the code and configuration demo on GitHub for users to implement immediately.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/None9527/None\\_Z-image-Turbo\\_trainer/blob/omni/src/zimage\\_trainer/optimizers/adamw\\_fp8.py](https://github.com/None9527/None_Z-image-Turbo_trainer/blob/omni/src/zimage_trainer/optimizers/adamw_fp8.py)",

But \"full-length\" is useless because it's not distinguishable feature from any other photo in my dataset. \"outdoor\" is redundant, that information is already implicit in other parts of the caption. And while the sky is indeed \"clear\" and \"blue\" it's not perceptibly more bright than any other clear blue sky... that's just fluffy bullshit. So, the sentence becomes:\n\n> This is a photograph taken on a sandy beach under a clear, blue sky.\n\nYou could probably also cut out the word \"sandy\" since virtually all beaches are sandy.

They seem to have just \"discovered\" that bitsandbytes uses integer math instead of FP8. FP8 doesn't inherently provide a higher dynamic range, it's the same amount of data. The \"unsigned int\" needs to approximate a signed real number regardless, and there are many ways to do that. The main advantage of FP8 is speed due to hardware acceleration. GGUFs use integers and they provide the same level of quality (or better) compared to equivalently sized float quants. It could very well be that the way AdamW8Bit does it is not optimal for certain scenarios, but it's extremely popular and many papers have referenced it without finding any glaring flaws, as far as I'm aware.",

Since Nano Banana which has been available for several months can achieve this, I think Flux 2 Klein (or Qwen, ZIT, ZIB) can do it too. Around 100-200 image pairs are likely sufficient but let's say your first training session yields only 70-80% accuracy. You should repeatedly adjust parameters, retrain, and test. You can also add successful outputs to the training dataset (but don't overdo it) and merge promising Loras. This cycle can take 4-6 weeks or months (or 2 days if you're lucky). You could also hire a trainer to speed things up but that creates dependency for future updates though.",

Front Render : UV Mask\n\n2. Front Render (nano banana photorealistic edit) : UV Mask\n\nDo this for all your data. That doubles your data as well as giving samples that are more photographic and how they map to a UV mask so the model doesn't suck when given more realistic images at inference time. \n\nAlso if people are taking selfies, they will not always be perfectly 0.0 degrees dead center shots, you should augment your renders and randomly apply a rotation.  You could increase your data size be like 10x doing this. \n\nAlso consider how you crop, users opening their cell phone and taking selfies are again not always going to spit out a perfect zoom level.  You might try figuring this out at inference time with segmentation model to identify autocropping. \n\nAlso, focal length, lighting conditions, etc.  You should augment data for this, research it.  \n\nYou also need to consider how you deal with backgrounds at inference time, and that will inform how you deal with it backgrounds training time.  Using background removal is probably easiest, then you can apply black background and do all training on black background, much easier.  You won't need to really augment your training data this way, just choose a fixed solid color background and always use that.",
