The adult humans don’t have a “childish misunderstanding of what acting is,” they are intentionally acting as children since they are stand-ins for the generated child characters they are being replaced with. This is on purpose, they were hired to do this.\n\nThe idea that these actors were accidentally acting like children because they didn’t know how to act as adults is funny though",

My read on it is they know exactly what they're doing, it's just you need more stage acting skills than film acting skills for this kind of performance transfer to work well. At least for now.\n\nStage actors need to play for the benefit of the people in the back of the crowd, so all their movements and expressions are exaggerated to make it obvious what's happening. Pro wrestlers are especially good at this, you can make out John Cena's expression from the back seat of an arena.\n\nFilm actors are more subtle, with smaller natural movements and micro-expressions that would be completely lost on a person further away than a couple feet, but that's fine because everyone watching is only as far away as the camera.\n\nOnce you compress your video of the film actors doing their film acting to the right input resolution, then use the VAE to compress it further, is there enough information left in their movements for the model to really latch onto?\n\nCompare the facial expressions when the goblin is touching the car at 00:43. Despite the overacted facial expression from the actor, it's a little more subtle than her other expressions so doesn't translate to the character at all. If the model can't translate that exaggerated expression, it doesn't stand a chance reproducing a real expression of awe and wonder.",

On the counter sits a white ceramic fruit bowl placed slightly off-center to the right. Inside the bowl are clearly visible incorrectly colored fruits: a blue banana, a bright purple orange, a red lime, a glossy black apple, and a translucent green strawberry with its seeds visible inside the fruit.\n\nNext to and slightly closer to the camera than the bowl is a clear glass of water. The fruit bowl and fruit are accurately reflected and refracted through the curved surface of the glass with realistic distortion, and the glass casts a soft shadow to the left. Tiny water droplets are visible on the counter near the glass.\n\nBehind the bowl is a rectangular mirror tile backsplash. The mirror reflection shows the back of the fruit bowl and the window light source, but does not show the camera. Faint fingerprints are visible on the mirror surface.\n\nOn the counter to the left of the bowl are exactly three asymmetrically arranged objects: a small metal spoon bent slightly upward with a small scratch on its surface, a folded yellow sticky note with visible paper texture and the handwritten text “7:42 PM”, and a single black chess knight piece. The spoon points toward the bowl, and the chess knight points away from the bowl.\n\nOn the right side of the bowl there is only one object: a half-peeled orange whose fruit inside is normal orange color, but whose outer peel is shaped into sharp geometric cube-like edges.\n\nLighting is strong directional daylight from the right with soft fill shadows, realistic ray-traced reflections, sharp but natural shadows, and no studio lighting look. The materials are physically accurate: glass, metal, ceramic, paper, and fruit surfaces rendered realistically. Camera uses a 50mm lens with shallow depth of field, focus on the fruit bowl and the front rim of the glass, with slightly softer background reflections. Hyperrealistic photograph style, high dynamic range, natural color grading, extreme material and optical accuracy.\"\n\n  \nI'm reasonably impressed",

You start out with Z-base 1megapixel image size then you use UltimateSDupcaler with the turbo model to upscale the final result to 3-4x for faster speed at 8 steps. Because if you try to use z-base to upscale it would take far too long, turbo i the best model to use for upscaling. Then again you'd have to do the upscaling at a very low denoise or you'd lose all your gains from the base prompt adherence. I tend to avoid SeedVR as an upscaler because it makes images far too soft.",

It really pushes the need for LLM expansion. I'll the prompt for this one and the instruction I'm using (which has an emphasis on action shots).   \nChroma refined with Klein 9b prompt: Blistering with cinematic momentum, the scene crashes into view on a violently canted axis, every vertical line a drunken tilt, every plane a disorienting slip into impossible depth. EXPLODE the epic figure of the STONE GIANT first - a mountain of muscle and granite, its hide a roadmap of tattoos, a prison of immense, groaning chains. CROUCHED in a predatory, unstable stance before the monolithic gate, its posture is a seismic diagonal, a colossal weight threatening to topple the entire frame. ITS IMMENSE GRIEVANCE radiates with palpable, volatile heat, a raw emotional tremor threatening to shear the world.\n\n\n\nBeneath the titan's hunched, crushing shadow lies its focus: a minuscule group of diminutive people, their upturned faces painted in desperate hope against the giant's simmering wrath, their fragile forms almost swallowed by the violent receding diagonals of the rain-slicked stone plaza. This skewed perspective is enforced by an aggressive wide-angle lens, its distortion bowing the gate's immense pillars, making the cobblestones beneath the humans erupt towards the foreground in exaggerated scale, their lines converging at a frantic, impossible angle in the deep background where the sky-cleft gate to the cloud town pierces the heavens.\n\n\n\nSearing, low-angle light, a harsh cinematic slash from a setting sun hidden just outside the skewed frame, rakes across the scene. It glints off the wet chains with a cold C8A9F3 (hex: #C8A9F3) lavender-steel sheen, gouges deep, warm shadows into the giant's textured stone flesh, and sets the driving rain ablaze with misty FFDB58 (hex: #FFDB58) golden streaks. The light source is tangible, direction clear: from camera-left, low and raking, casting long, distorted, dancing shadows that further scramble the already tilted plane of the ground.\n\n\n\nThe entire kinetic moment is frozen: sheets of cold rain fall in sharp, diagonal slashes. Atmospheric haze and the giant's heated breath plume out in thick, turbulent clouds—FFFAE6 (hex: #FFFAE6) white-grey vapor that coils and smears with motion blur, following the canted geometry of the composition, softening the extreme background. A single, massive spatter of mud, kicked up by the giant's shifting weight, hangs in the air, a spray of F3DABC (hex: #F3DABC) beige-brown droplets frozen in their chaotic, off-axis trajectory. This is not a static image; it is peak action, a precarious, explosive tension captured a millisecond from calamity, all balance lost to the relentless, skewed dynamism of the Dutch angle.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*CINEMATOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS:\\*\\*\n\nShot on ARRI ALEXA 65 with an ARRI Prime 65 S 18mm T1.8 lens.\n\n\\*\\*Focal Length:\\*\\* 18mm\n\n\\*\\*Aperture:\\*\\* T/5.6\n\n\\*\\*Shutter Speed:\\*\\* 1/1000th\n\n\\*\\*Sensor/Stock:\\*\\* ARRI ALEV III Sensor, capturing in ARRIRAW.\n\n\\*\\*Color Treatment:\\*\\* Emulation of Kodak Vision3 500T 5219, pushed one stop for heightened contrast and grain structure, with a cold tone lift in the shadows.\n\n\\*\\*Key Color Palette:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Giant's Stone Skin: #8A8776 (Warm Grey)\n\n\\- Chain Highlights: #C8A9F3 (Lavender Steel)\n\n\\- Rain Highlights: #FFDB58 (Golden Hour)\n\n\\- Mist & Breath: #FFFAE6 (Warm White)\n\n\\- Mud & Earth: #F3DABC (Beige-Brown)\n\n\\- Shadow Undertones: #2B2D42 (Deep Blue-Black)",

Then I got into comfyui, then I started writing my own nodes, then I learned how to train a LoRA and what the process behind that was.\n\nThen I wrote a classification system that uses face recognition to sort images into groups based on who's in the photo - and then grade them based on resolution and sharpness of the face area - this gives me pools of potential LoRA training data. Then I learned how to use Google's APIs to put a name to a face for those groups of images, and then merge islands of image collections that are actually the same person (but perhaps different ages or styles).\n\nSo, gateway into AI and machine learning.",

I then signed up for the Stable Diffusion beta and managed to get invited. When the model and software were first released, they required 6 GB VRAM and I only had a 4 GB card, so I had to wait for someone to implement a low VRAM fix. I started with the Basu Jindal repo. It was very primitive: just the base SD 1.4 model and a simple command line interface. I then switched to A1111 when it started to take off.\n\nOne reason I switched to A1111, apart from the graphical user interface, was that it supported negative prompts. Without it, SD 1.4 and 1.5 would give you lots of nudity regardless of whether you wanted it or not. Many of the anime models that appeared after the NovelAI leak were even worse.",

With Youtube/Tiktok, I also only watched very few types of content. I virtually stopped watching movies/shows simply because nothing interests me anymore.\n\nWhen AI generation appeared, I imagined a future where I could get unlimited amount of content specifically tailored to my taste. I got into doing it locally partially because I wanted to learn more but also because I figured I had to do it that way to get content that specifically suited me.\n\nNow I understand the future I imagine is unlikely to be fully realized. I can certainly create all the artwork I want easily and, one day, I can probably create Tiktok/Youtube-style videos very easily. But I probably won't live to see the day when GPUs/AI models become powerful enough that I can do Hollywood-level movies/shows easily.",

For whatever fucking reason, comfy recently changed so that some random seeds no longer randomize on hitting run.\n\nSo if I load up the Flux Klein 9b edit workflow for example and hit run twice, it will run once to generate and image, and the second 'run' will simply reuse the exact same parameters and seed, skipping the generation and putting out the same image as if I was on fixed seed.\n\nThe only way I've found to change this behaviour is to use a random number generator and input that into the seed, then it properly randomizes each run. This allows me to hit generate 3 times and actually get 3 different images.\n\nIt has its downsides, but it's far more annoying needing to manually change the seed each run.",

She is statuesque and ethereal, with impossibly long, flowing platinum-gold hair that arcs around her like a fragmented halo, some strands braided into elegant, crown-like loops. Her skin is pale and luminous, with faint hairline cracks like aged marble hinting at both divinity and ruin. She wears a regal, asymmetrical white-and-gold gown fused with ancient ceremonial armor: layered plates engraved with runes, draped cloth that hangs like sacred vestments, and delicate chains and sigils that glow softly.\n\n\n\nThe style blends refined anime aesthetics with Art Nouveau curves and borders, plus dramatic Baroque-inspired lighting: a blinding, holy backlight creating a halo effect, deep shadows across her face and body, and shafts of dust-filled light cutting through the scene. Behind her, the faint silhouette of a colossal golden tree and broken holy architecture dissolves into mist. Her expression is serene, sorrowful, and unfathomably powerful, eyes shining with muted gold light as if holding a shattered world inside them. The overall mood is one of fractured divinity and ancient, golden royalty—majestic, sacred, and slightly tragic, rendered in ultra-detailed, painterly realism fused with anime and Art Nouveau ornamentation.\n\nRes\\_multistep  \nsimple  \nDenoise 0.98  \nSeed: 940289160578048",

I have 12GB VRAM and can comfortably run it with both the model and text encoder quantized in FP8, so I'm sure you'd be able to run it in some gguf quantization, even if it's Q4.\n\nI don't know how easy it will be to train Loras of you and your kid on Z-Image Turbo, though, as Turbo models are difficult to train. Z-Image Base should make it easier to train Loras once released, but I'd expect it to be at least 5x slower than the Turbo version.\n\nYou should also take a look at Flux Klein. I've heard it's even better than Z-Image for lower-end machines. Its main downsides, like being bad for NSFW and kinda-restrictive licenses, are definitely not an issue for your use case.",

Then it only has to also beat Flux2 Klein 4B which definitely has a better VAE, trains fast, and has editing native. (9B has a license that will limit community and commercial support).\n\nThey made a great move by releasing Turbo first.

No more choosing between “follows the prompt” and “doesn’t fall apart.”\n\n**More practical fine-tuning + faster inference**  \n**Why you should care:** better behavior on real hardware.\n\nTrainer updates improve memory usage and make fine-tuning more predictable on constrained GPUs.\n\nInference is also faster for video-to-video by downscaling the reference video before cross-attention, reducing compute cost. (Speedup depend on resolution and clip length.)\n\nWe’ve also shipped new ComfyUI nodes and a unified LoRA to support these changes.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nThis drop isn’t a one-off. The next LTX-2 version is already in progress, focused on:\n\n* Better fine detail and visual fidelity (new VAE)\n* Improved consistency to conditioning inputs\n* Cleaner, more reliable audio\n* Stronger image-to-video behavior\n* Better prompt understanding and color handling\n\n[More on what's coming up here.](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/the-road-ahead-for-ltx-2)\n\n# Try It and Stress It!\n\nIf you’re pushing LTX-2 in real workflows, your feedback directly shapes what we build next.

The quantized weights take up maybe 13-14GB of VRAM. So still a lot, but much less than the existing LTX-2 text encoder nodes, which don't quantize them at all.\n\nSeems to work alright. Only downside is the quantized weights need to be discarded from VRAM after the node is done (rather than simply moved to RAM), as it would otherwise take up too much system RAM. But quantizing the weights only takes a couple seconds.\n\nSo in theory, with this approach, if you can already use the Gemma3 12B model for prompt encoding (which ComfyUI does by passing the prompt embeddings into the forward pass of the model, and then pulling out the weights from the 49 hidden layers, and then combining them and passing them to the embeddings connector model), you can also use it for LLM inference.\n\nAPI-based generation always seems a bit iffy.",

While Gemini 2.0 native image gen had good understanding already, the image quality just wasn't there. \n\nIdk, probably additional post-training to help it output pleasing, natural images rather than just the \"raw\" base model output? And lots of training for edits too? Plus, aesthetic \"taste\" to steer it towards real-looking photos rather than the deep fried cinematic look of other models.\n\nEither way, having a very smart \"LLM\" base model with all of that image understanding \"built-in\" is what has enabled greatly improved prompt understanding and editing etc.",

I did some naive math and if it's closer to 80B I can expect a single image gen to take around 30min on my GPU (45 or more when using GGUF). If it's closer to 13B, it might be usable.\n\nThe big boy is 170GB in size, but appears to be bf16. I would get the best inference time when using fp8, so about 85GB in size. I'm not sure if I even have that kind of space on my SSD (upgrades seem to be too expensive). Maybe if Q2 GGUF (should be around 20ish GB) comes out and ComfyUI supports it, I'll give it a shot for the novelity sake, but inference that takes more than a minute is unusable for me on my local machine.",

Its like asking the Chef for a plain bowl of soup and getting a plain bowl of soup but you expected a fancy bowl of soup.\n\nTry this and report back....\n\nA hyper-realistic, medium-close-up cinematic portrait of a Russian woman in her late 20s with a gentle, nostalgic expression, seated by a frosted window while cradling a vintage, well-loved teddy bear against her chest. Her eyes are soft and slightly reflective, suggesting a quiet moment of comfort, while she wears a thick, cream-colored cable-knit wool sweater with intricate, visible fiber textures. Her hands are wrapped protectively around the bear, which is made of honey-colored mohair featuring slight love-worn patches and classic glass button eyes that catch a glint of light. The scene is illuminated by the soft, diffused \"blue hour\" twilight filtering through the window, beautifully contrasted by the warm, amber glow of a nearby fireplace just out of frame, creating a delicate rim light along her hair and the sweater’s wool. Fine dust motes dance in the warm air, and the background is a soft-focus bokeh of a cozy living room with blurred bookshelves and a dim lamp. Shot on 35mm film with a Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic, the image utilizes a shallow depth of field at f/1.8 to ensure the focus remains sharp on her eyes and the tactile textures of the bear. The composition features a high dynamic range to capture the transition from deep shadows to soft highlights, rendering every detail from the individual fuzz on the mohair to the crystalline frost on the windowpane in ultra-detailed 8k resolution. The color grading is a professional cinematic balance of cool teals and warm oranges, ensuring photorealistic skin textures, natural pores, and anatomically perfect hands for a soulful, high-end masterpiece.",

I'm getting some pretty great stuff but every time I think I've got the best settings with corrective upscale, the next seed is awful again. On a positive note, the variety and \"depth\" with the base model is WAY better than turbo. It's far more responsive to action scene skewed perspective stuff than turbo was.",

Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

Z-Image tries very hard to keep the realistic look in general, and images usually look very good from a distance, but the details are very messed up, even trying to upscale them.\n\nI'm already training a big lora (Rank 128, close to 2k images), and the results so far are promising, the model learns quite good.

Tools are already in development that aim towards this (like Artcraft, for example).\n\nBut back to the topic at hand, yes - I'd want to use a prompt to describe a variation of what I want to see. It's enormously frustrating to describe something precisely and have the model not follow it, only to then increment the seed and have the model then follow it. \n\nThat's not a sustainable system for targeted image generation in any professional pipeline - that system only works if you're happy with random output.",

But the LoRA wouldn't just control the style, it would control the \"route\". Distillations are trained for a specific number of steps and sigmas, they \"fold\" the model to neaten up edges so that they converge within a specific timeframe with a specific adherence (so that CFG is not required). Using them at anything except 1.0 weight and the intended number of steps still kinda works but it's not ideal. A percentage of the steps are wasted and CFG has to be adjusted proportionately, and it limits the quality you can get.\n\nIdeally you'd want to train a LoRA that just learns the style of Turbo. I've experimented with doing that for Qwen, by generating a bunch of promptless images from ZiT then training them captionless on Qwen. It seemed to work pretty well but the promptless images are strangely biased towards a few things (like plain T-shirts and people just standing in the middle of the frame), and the saturation tended to be lower than prompted outputs (although ZiT outputs are less saturated than Qwen's anyway), and that caused the Qwen LoRA to produce desaturated and kinda boring images.\n\nI imagine there's a more rigorous way to train one, like using the teacher-student process used to train the distillations in the first place, but without the CFG distillation, but I don't know enough to do that myself.",

With cloud models what they most likely do is send all your requests to a service to enhance your prompt.\n\nSo Midjourney could (idk for sure of course) be telling an LLM \"add to this prompt random characteristics that the user didn't explicitly ask for\". For example if you said \"elephant wearing a bowtie\", it would include that, but then add random tidbits like \"cartoon artstyle\", based on what people upvote, what you upvote, your recent requests, etc.\n\nTechnically this is doable even in ZIT with custom nodes. I'm not talking about the really basic prompt enhancer nodes, ones, if you wanted something on Midjourney's level you'd probably need to give the LLM more guidance, perhaps even use a memory (database) to remember enhancements already done in recent gens and give them less odds of reappearing too soon.",

What images you upvoted in the MJ Gallery would be attributed to your prompts incrementally. The more you upvoted the more influence on your prompts. There was the option to enable/disable this feature. Not sure now.    \n  \nIn line with that FooocusUI did years ago. Something similar with enabled \"styles\".

There's a reason it replaced Pony and a reason Noob and Chroma did not replace it. \n\nIn order to make it worth not just moving away from Illustrious itself but giving up all the things trained on it, Z-Image will need to be so good that we're willing to do that AND willing to accept the massive speed hit. \n\nFor comparison, on a 3090 I can generate 12 images at 1024x at 30 steps in 1:38. In that same time, same steps, same size, I can generate a single Z-image image. So in order to compete, it has to be so good that it's worth the 12x slower generation time and abandoning all the stuff we already have trained for Illustrious. \n\nAnd this isn't a hypothetical. This was the same problem that PonyV7 and Chroma have. Moving away from what you have and the adoption of new stuff means it has to be worth giving up what you already have. If it's not THAT good, it's a novelty and nothing more.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would love for something to be THAT good. Illustrious is a wonderful model but it's basically been pushed as far as it can go. So I do hope we get something that will be a huge step forward for it.

If I say that the triangle should be on top of the cube, they will understand it.\n\n  \nBut RL significantly degrades the understanding of many concepts. You can see this in the example above. The model with RL simply won't generate \"impossible perspective.\" It generates a normal road. The model without RL actually tries to generate images with strange perspective violations, which I think is very cool. Another example is the prompt \"noise\" in Disney example, and so on.\n\nAnd so we have those giant smart text encoders, but their work is often broken by RL guiderails. That's why SD1.5 is still following prompts better in some cases, like the examples above",

Stable Diffusion 1/5 was a true unbound model. Nothing even comes close to its ability to produce truly unique and creative images. You could generate the wildest things with it, blending together totally different concepts. Not even the latest models like Flux.2 and Z-Image Base come close. The closest thing to its diversity of output is Chroma with its exceptionally wide range of training data used and also the fact that it's un-distilled, with no RL.\n\nLast but not least, SD1.5 still has the best tile controlnet, IMHO. Probably because the model was not distilled and RL'ed to hell like the new ones.",

Not many people remember this, but SDXL actually consisted of two 6GB models: the model itself and a \"refiner.\" It was assumed that all images needed to be additionally processed with a refiner after the main generation to achieve proper quality.\n\nThis was inconvenient, and the community quickly forgot about it - finetunes worked well without a refiner. SDXL certainly has excellent prompt adherence compared to 1.5, but the base version remained in a kind of low-quality limbo due to the mess with refiner",

To leverage the scalability advantages of offlne preference learning, we conduct relative large-scale RL with DPO and reserve GRPO for small fie-grained RL refiement.

However, in the first few months, when Stable 1.4 just came out, they simply allowed you to upload SD images, and it was a convenient gallery of generations from random people.\n\nI scrolled through everything there, literally all the generations. Generative models were just emerging back then, and there were no \"guidelines\" for prompting or anything. Everyone prompted in their own way and style. It was really interesting. Many tried to generate absurd, impossible things with super weird prompts. I thought it was pretty cool, and I saved about 500 of the strangest prompts with generations from there.\n\nSince then, whenever a new model comes out, I test it by running it against those old prompts from other people. Most of them are pretty similar to each other. Z-Image surprised me by starting to display those same weird things, the way SD1.5 did.\n\nSo yea, give credit where credit is due, the prompts aren't mine. The real authors are unknown and they created these prompts quite a few years ago. These are the very first prompts for txt2img people created actually!",

I’ll post the one with the LoRA first, and then the one without the LoRA.\n\nAlso, I agree with what another user said, lowering the LoRA weight a bit seems to give better audio quality. I tested everything at weight 1.0, so the audio is a little degraded.\n\n1. [with](https://streamable.com/zgoylb) \\- [without](https://streamable.com/p4x172)\n2.

I noticed the biggest difference in the hair: with plain LTX2, even a simple anime character clip where the hair moves tends to distort the linework a lot and it starts looking messy. With this, that issue is more under control. The hair moves in a way that looks more natural and the overall motion feels a bit cleaner too.\n\nIt’s obviously not perfect yet but honestly, this is **really a step forward** compared to standard LTX2. Great work👏🔥",

Tadaa. Fixed. Now the combined random seed from your sampler + the random image + the prompt + the denoise make it so that you've effectively bypassed any model variation issues. \n\nI've been using this even since SD1.5, because I can't stand centered compositions (subject in the dead center), and if you're smart enough in the choice of your random images, you can get results no amount of prompting could deliver.
