It still has some of the worst tool support, if I'm not mistaken, even to this day. Flux also had lots of issues, in general, with its outputs/limitations.

I find that blending their styles with a more realistic painter, or even mixing a painter with a sculptor, can achieve the modern retro-Art deco immitation look I like. Honestly, some fringe cases of Art Nouveau artists can be made to look Deco by negative prompting away the curves and florals. \n\nSorry that turned rambly lol.",

And before you ask, no, I don't feed the latent image directly into the **KSampler**, though you are free to try that to see what you get. Sometimes I even do a three step process with the first image being lower than 200 pixels, or I skip the resize to 800x600 altogether, or use the 600x800 as the final resolution. (More than enough for video generation.) Many options.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a **Load Image** node to use any image as base, then use a **Resize** node with *crop* to feed the **VAE Encode**. You can reduce the image first before increasing it's size again to eliminate as many details from the original as possible.\n\nI use **DPM++ 2M SDE GPU** as *sampler* and **Beta** as *scheduler* for the final step, between 15 to 20 *steps*, and a *CFG* of 1.5 or 2.

You could just use Mocha to mask him and then apply an edge gausian blur of like 0.1px in some scenes to soften him, fix the hairline manually it's just like 3 frames, and add some directional blur to some spots (mostly the feet) and match the original shot pretty much 1:1.\n\n\nThe annoying part is you would have to color grade pretty hard to get rid of that weird contrasty look LTX gives every i2v video making it pretty much useless for extending real footage that it didn't originally create.",

The Anima (preview) is so undertrained that it's quality is closer to SD 1.5 in that regards. SDXL (Illustrious) has come a long way to this point, and I think Anima would took much more finetunes to get it right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9u9iq2my6ig1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c94b558f337ffa62da455a5dee016447c33460d3\n\n*(left) Anima preview; (right) Illustrious finetunes: UnholyDesireMix v7*\n\nBoth is using similar prompt without additional refining/LoRA at 512x512 resolution, only using inherent artist tag prompt:\n\n    @mika_pikazo. masterpiece, best quality. 1girl, score_8, score_9. murasaki shion from hololive, she is wearing white summer dress, looking at viewer with annoyed face, she is holding a greatsword with both hands, the sword design reminds of magic knight rayearth swords. white background. chromatic aberration. modern anime style, late 2020. multiple splash of paint decoration in background with colors: cyan, shocking pink, and yellow. Giant stylish text written \"ASUNA\" with smaller text written \"pactio\".\n\nwith negatives:\n\n    worst quality, low quality, score_1, score_2, score_3, score_4, score_5, score_6, blurry, jpeg artifacts, sepia, badly drawn finger\n\nI'm trying to jumble up as many unrelated things in one composition to see how it goes **(characters) (clothings) (items from other IP) (color sampling) (multiple text formats)**. With Illustrious removed the score tags and replaced \"@\" with \"by\" for the artists tag. What most people didn't seems to know is that Illustrious model also capable of natural language prompt to some degree.\n\nI love what Anima brings to the table as 2B model, more model variations for us to use is always welcome but I think the quality needs further refine. Also no, it's not '*Illustrious killer*' as many people prophesize it to be, at least not yet with this quality. If there is one thing that I would say stood up against SDXL right now is how it could renders written text better, but the longer your prompt the less likely it succeed in doing so.",

It goes beyond just typing two artists at random and seeing what comes out. I spend hours on image search engines to find artists that might mesh well, using controlnets to guide composition, etc. \n\nModern models are hit or miss. I am a proponent of the Flux2 family after being a staunch Flux1 dev hater because they have *some* artist knowledge. A good foundational artist knowledge is crucial to this use, as no amount of manual of LLM-generated style descriptors can capture a look. The Chinese teams behind Qwen and Z image lack of concern for copyright would have been promising but they don't seem interested in artist tagging, at least in English. \n\nWhile the edit models are somewhat promising for style transfer, they don't hold a candle to SDXL's IPadapter and the tools developed by /u/Matt3o back when he was active in this space [he has since left the Comfy community, sadly). What we need is someone to get really invested in better controlnets and IPadapter stand ins. QRcode controlnets were a HUGE boone in SD1.5 and SDXL eras, something which people have forgotten with the newer unified controlnets. \n\nThose are my rambling thoughts. \n\ntl;dr people interested in remixing artist styles and making visually cool stuff still exist. We need to post more. Share workflows, experiments, and ideas on reddit. We can keep this going, maybe even revitalize the interest among newcomers.",

              "text": "I wonder if theres a way through coding to emulate high variation without losing final \"specifcity\" of an image. \n\nI was originally replying to your comment in a much simpler way but it got me thinking and I ended up reasoning about it much more than I planned. \n\n**Don't feel like you are obligated to read it**, but im gonna post it anyways just so i can reference later and in case anyone else wants to try this\n\n---\n\n# Idea\n\n## Background\nI'm basing this of my experience with tensorboard where even though a model has hundreds of dimensions, it will surface the top 3 dimensions in terms of spread across latent space according to the initial word list you fed it. \n\n\nI'm probably explaining all of this poorly but basically its giving you the most useful 3d view of something with WAY more than 3 dimensions. If you google a tensorboard projection map or better yet try one yourself my idea might make more sense.\n\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Make a \"variation\" word list containing common modifiers. Generate embeddings for these with a given model's text encoder\n \n\n2. Take the image gen prompt and chunk it according to semantic boundaries that make the most sense for the model type (i.e.  by sentence boundary for LLM text encoder models or by new line for CLIP or T5). \n \n\n3. Generate embeddings of each prompt chunk. You may decide to cluster here to limit number chunks to keep the final results more generalized thus coherent.\n \n\n4. Combine the variation embedding list with your prompt chunk list. Use a weighting factor (k) to represent the prompt chunks at an optimal ratio vs word list (as determined by testing)\n \n\n5. Calculate the top n dimensions of highest variability for this combined list (this is where the weight ratio we apply to prompt chunks matters). The value for n would be a knob for you to choose but \"3\" seems like a good starting point and also what you need for that super cool tensorboard projection map.\n \n\n6. For each of your (n) dimensions sample the top (y) nearest neighbors from variation embeddings to each prompt chunk (c) embedding (closeness can be calculated a few different ways, but i'll assume cosine distance for now)\n \n\n7. Now you have a list of variation embeddings that are semantically related to your prompt. The quantity of variation embeddings will be equal to the product of (n)(y)(c) \n\n>    (n: number of most expressive dimensions sampled)\n> x (y: number of nearest neighbors in each dimension for a given prompt chunk)\n> x (c: number of prompt chunks)\n> = (total number or \"semantically coherent\" variation embeddings)\n\n\n8. During diffusion you inject one of the (y) per (n) per (c) into the process. You would probably want to do so according to a schedule:\n\n> early steps for structural variation\n\n> later steps for fine detail variation. \n\nYou never inject more than one variation embedding for a given dimension for a given prompt chunk, you don't want to cause a regression to the mean which would happen if you nearest neighbors were of approx. equal but opposite vectors from the prompt chunks\n\n### Refinements\n\n- You could make targeted \"variation\" word lists that focus on describing variations for a specific topic. Perhaps a \"human morphology\" list, an \"art style\" list (if your text encoder understands them), or even a specialized \"Domain specific\" list containing niche descriptive words most salient in a specific domain like \"Star Wars\" or something\n\n\n- Remember that we are going to weight the relative strength of the word list vs prompt chunks list (k factor). This is a powerful coarse knob that controls for \"relatedness\" to the original prompt. This will be the first knob I go to if my idea is yielding too strong or too weak of an effect\n\n\n- Instead of choosing (y) nearest neighbors for a given dimension, perhaps grab the closest nearest neighbor, then grab the 2nd closest neighbors BUT only from the opposite direction in relation to the specific prompt chunk embedding. \n\n> Think of it as a line with our prompt chunks embedding as point on the line. We are choosing the next closest point, then the next closest point on the other side of the line relative to chunk embedding.",

Why push for development in more creative art styles when we already know AI can already achieve good results?\n\nI think once consistently good anatomy for people is achieved it'll come back around again. All of this is community driven by the needs of the community, and currently for those that want creative art styles are generally satisfied with 1.5 for now.

For any modern model, you have to apply loras for every style you’re trying to achieve, which is untenable if you like to blend together lots of artists.

For my particular workflow I've been stuck with Illustrious for almost a year. I'm still discovering things and I'm not particularly innovative.\n\nIf we were to freeze everything right now and spend the next decade using just what we have right now, I guarantee you that decade would be filled with people finding novel and useful ways to use the current tools. But the trend accelerated and everyone model hops too quickly to learn the finer details of what can be done. \n\nHonestly, it gives me great hope, although it causes issues in the short-term, because it makes it near impossible to put the genie back in in the bottle. If anyone tries to legislate this stuff out of existence, it really can't happen. \n\nDouble edged sword. But I think we'll continue to see rapid growth for the immediate. But for image gen to get it's photoshop adoption cycle it needs actual artists to use it, to find ways to use it with more fine-grained control, and to spend longer in general pushing the boundaries of the tools. That stuff moves on a human scale, not a technology time scale. So it will take a lot longer.",

          "text": "Along your point : picking the model's intricacies was great fun and finding something, some combination \"that was ours\" was a great great feeling. \n\nOf course it all came down  to a wide range of visual and artists styles that were \"easily\" recoverable from the model. And you'll agree that it's easier to say \"in the style of Monet and (Mucha:1.1)\" that saying \"impressionist  painting using medium to large touches in slow progressing gradients with low to medium thickness and medium to high paint mixing, cross referenced with (detailed and intricate.... Yadyayada:1.1)\". For the first and simple reason that tokens are expensive, and overflowing the maximum gave you basic random omissions (which has its perks but increases the slot machine effect).\n\nNow that the SD styles era is past (except maybe with ZIB and SDXL revivals), if one wants to \"pick the model\" for creativity, it has to use the basic blocks available, such as the long and detailed descriptions of what one expects from the model : tool, influence, touch, color, hues, gradients, forms, eras, etc, which is very fine if you know your art history, and leaves all who don't in the mud. A lot of people here have learned HEAPS of visual language by trying, looking at prompts, studying the images etc, and those are the ones who came to better control their outputs, even back in the SD era.\n\nBut with modern models (and maybe encoders too idk about that) , I have this feeling that the open source releases are geared towards our of the box utility. I think (and may be wrong) rhat it's why ZImage released the photo-focused Turbo first - they had to make a great impression that works right outside the box. If they'd let Base out first (on top of maybe be unfinished back then) literally every post in this sub would have been \"Flux does it better\" and it would have taken years to get off. \n\nOne of the reasons, I think, is because most open source users aren't power users or commercial users with intent. They're just happy to explore, but there's little \"need\" from them to go beyond what the défaut 1girl prompt would provide. And so, in part, this killed some of the open source model's \"creativity\". Again I don't like to employ that word here, because to me as a former graphics designer, the creativity is never in the tool, no matter how potent. \n\nPeople used the infamous \"high seed variation\" SDXL for years generating huge batches of the same prompt and trashing the output until the image they wanted stood out - if that's what everyone calls creativity, I gotta swap planets. But when they have an idea even partial and try stuff and mix and match and refine and go back and most importantly end up saying \"I won't go further this is final\" they made a decision, they brought it there, and this they created.\n\nI'd argue that SD1.5 and SDXL are extremely useful today for generating basic elements that are refined and reworked with the precision and prompt adherence or modern models ! Finding pieces and bits that could be used in CREATIVE ways, assembled and refined to look like something else, and finally tell a story that would take 20x the prompt context to explain with the perfect words (hoping that the model, your own expression in English/Chinese, the quantization of your TEs and your models etc etc etc would let all the nuances through) - that's the future  of creativity in AI gens. Not T2I alone, not I2I alone, but a mixture of everything that you, the user, keeps on making happening - not because the \"model is capable\" with lazy prompts.",

          "text": "There has always been a significant part of the AI community that was obsessed with realism. They tried to make realistic SD 1.5 fine tunes and posted countless threads with titles like \"does this look realistic?\" (and still do). Whenever someone released a new fine tune, one of the first questions was always \"how good is it at realism?\".\n\nWhen Pony v6 was released, some of them got really angry by the fact that it didn't do realism. They explained that realism and one day being able to use it for virtual reality was the ultimate goal of generative AI and something everyone should be striving towards.\n\nPersonally, I have zero interest in realism. I find realism boring. From the very start, I've wanted to create something that looks like the comics that I grew up with. That has been quite hard to find. Everything is focused on either realism or anime. I've often ended up using furry models to generate human characters since they tend to have a more Western cartoon and comic book style. I finally found the Arthemy Illustrious models which are fairly close to what I've been looking for.\n\n>Pony was the peak\n\nI feel this too in a way. For me, it was the biggest leap in usability, when I could suddenly generate all the character portraits I had tried to make since the SD 1.4 days. Illustrious is better, but it feels more like a gradual improvement. Z-Image-Turbo is the first model in years that made me feel truly excited since it makes it easy to create complex scenes with multiple characters. My goal is to create images that tell a story.",

          "text": "Had this conversation recently with my colleagues at the AI agency (tv ads, shows, movies) I work for.\n\nSd1.5 and it’s strangeness, speed and knowledge of artists names and styles is what brought me into AI in the first place. \n\nThe change happened pretty slowly, now I rarely use AI for personal visual pleasure and more only for work; it became boring. The other day I build a workflow to generate artistic images with sd1.5 and then passes the results to Flux Klein to improve it without dropping the visual quality: I found myself again hooked for 4 hours straight in a continuous dopamine rush. \n\nSd1.5 knows almost any artists, architect and designer you can name; my huge pleasure is mixing names of artists in various promoted weights and seeing what the heck comes out, plus you had embedding which were like loras but easy, intuitive, fast and didn’t break the images. \n\nThe reason why artists have been scraped out of models is frankly respectable. There are huge copyright and intellectual property issues which had to be addressed. In a more ‘correct’ world a Rembrandt Lora should be trained and sold or given for free by the Rijksmuseum, maybe in collaboration with other museums and each should be able to decide if giving it for free or for a price. \n\nThat said you can train Loras for everything still today and it works, but it’s not the same thing: we mostly use flow distilled models today so the results are often limited and too influenced by realism; the sd1.5 results were amazing because the model gave completely varied result and the generation was influenced by the enormous amount of art inside the dataset; so words like “golden ratio, modernist, abstract” gave amazing results while Klein or Zimage will just prefer to generate triangles and spirals. \n\nSd1.5->Klein is still my way to go for personal pleasant time generating; the only thing that could change that at the moment is a complete finetune of the 9b Klein model. This would cost millions of $, thousands of hours of work and it would be highly illegal, that’s why I don’t see that happening soon. \n\nIt could happen as some guerrilla-like hidden project where lots of people put together the enormous dataset (and captions, I think that’s the hardest part to do well) and then collect a big sum of money to train with pro gpus in cloud. \n\nAnother solution which would also be legal would be train a paid model (maybe 30$ per month fee?) which gives the artists money each time their particular work is used in generations. This would be legal, socioeconomically fair, decentralized, but I don’t see this happening either for a variety of reasons. \n\nCreativity in AI in the end is always handled by your own human talent, so with Sd1.5 creativity did not die, it just requires way more human effort to get there, (other than training Lora’s you can use an artwork or even your sketch to mildly denoise an image with any model) which probably is a good thing for artists, designers, architects; I’m not 100% sure though, it’s something that should be debated by someone with way more culture than the one I possess.",

Or there's a huge market for realistic girls.\n\nYes, there is absolute a huge market for realistic 1girls.  Just look at the top models on Civitai.\n\nBut no, A.I. is not overtrained in art.  In fact, most artists have not been trained into LoRAs.  I've trained hundreds of them, and there are thousands more to go if I want to continue 😅: [https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models](https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models)\n\nNow back to SD1.5 \"creativity\" vs the supposed \"lack of creativity\" in newer models.\n\nA.I. models are mainly used in two ways.  One is for \"brainstorming\", where one tries out simple ideas and let the A.I. \"fill in the blanks\".  This is where SD1.5/SDXL's higher level of hallucinatory \"creativity\" may be useful.\n\nThe other is to use A.I. as a tool with a high level of control, where the A.I. responds precisely to a detailed prompt as one refines one's idea as to what the image should look like. \n\nIn general, most people who are \"serious\" about using A.I. as a creative tool will pick control over hallucination, in the same way that one would want an assistant that will follow precise instruction to carry out a task rather than one that just goes off and do thing according to his own whims.\n\nWith current SOTA models, users who have the creativity and the imagination, can create most thing (except those involving complex interactions between two characters) that they can envision ([a bad workman blames his tools](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bad+workman+always+blames+tools)) 😅\n\nMaybe the ideal A.I. model is one that can do both, and to some extent, Chroma and ZiBase are heading in that direction, but many users are not happy with the fact that a lot more trial and error involving more negative prompt and other incantation such as \"aesthetic 11\" are involved due to the more \"creative\" nature of these less \"tuned\" models.\n\nFinally, if one wants modern models to hallucinate like SD1.5 in the good old days, there are random prompt generators, wildcards, and even noise injection nodes.",

Good for impatient people and video models (altho I think no video model uses it, yet). Also obviously makes generation a lot faster and more accurate (to some extent, its only as accurate as training data).\n\nThere are \"between\" things, like DMD2, which is almost like flow, but not really. While its good, it has sort of its \"idea how things should look\" which tend to override any model tied to it.

Which means many of us who would love to share our creativity with the world are reticent to do so because anything we put into the public is essentially public domain and anyone can take it and use it for whatever they want. At least that's why I don't share my work publicly. Maybe someday U.S. copyright law will change so ai generated images can be copyrighted to the creator (us). But until that changes there's almost not way to build anything in public because it could just get taken.",

I do understand to keep current day artists out of the training data. That doesnt mean we should discard styles and artists who are long gone from the training data.\n\n  \nI do also feel the same with the older T2V models, because those models had little understanding the concepts of real world.

With the newer hardware a lot of people will now have due to newer models, you can probably do quite large full sd1.5 fine-tunes :3\n\nOne of the reasons why Sd1.5 sucked so bad at anatomy was its low output size more than anything else. You can train it to be a larger resolution capable model by training progressively on larger resolution datasets. I did a toy version of this back in the day to 1600px and it's pretty bad at txt2img due to undertraining but in img2img and unsampling it is far more coherent than the base and SDXL etc. Hands are a non-issue and I use it for style transfer",

Instead they fuck around with changing the UI continually and breaking things.\n\nFor real, how is there still not a way to naively export the queue. Who the hell thought 'lets just keep this all in an in-memory list that nothing else can access. Apparently saving the queue to a flat file as json or even just plain text and removing a line when a job completes... is just too fucking complicated for them to design.  \nOr... how the hell is there no way to pause a queue in case you need to do something else with your GPU. These are basic UX things that they refuse to implement and they ignore ever PR that comes in for them.",

A generation on my 5060 Ti 16GB / 3000 Mt/s RAM with your default settings got me the atlas in 7min 20s.\n\nHere's one test I did:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o3597anw9ig1.jpeg?width=1946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bfa9622e84250bdf1ae063b611c836937b01808\n\n\\- The image demonstrates some problems. In the generated atlas, the letter E's top line is not connected to the rest of the letter, so it got ignored by the ttf converter. Quotation marks are also pretty pretty commonly used, so it'd be nice they'd be included in atlas (or just more glyphs in general). I also think the lowercase letters don't look as \"unique\" as my \"a\" was, but I think that could be solved with adjusting the LORA's strength.\n\n\\- I believe I’ve also found a bug in the ttf converter: if the atlas filename is a single word with a capital letter, the resulting ttf font name is forced to lowercase. However, if the filename contains multiple parts, the original capitalization is preserved. Example: `Name.png` \\-> `name.ttf`, but `Name_01.png` \\-> `Name_01.ttf`.\n\n\\- I removed \"Generate letters and symbols\" from the prompt and didn't see it affecting the output. I did limited testing, but the more simple a base prompt is, the better UX it is for user.\n\nOverall, I'm quite impressed. Nice work!",

In the current script, 'E' is treated as a single-part letter. If the top bar is disconnected, the script discards it as noise. Try running it with --min-component-area 1 and increase --keep-components to 5. I will update the script to include more letters in the \"multi-part\" list.  **Edit: I updated the script in GitHub Repo.**\n2. **TTF Filename Bug:** Great catch! I'll look into the sanitize\\_name function and how the FontBuilder handles case sensitivity.\n3. **Prompt:** I haven't tried making the prompt shorter, but if it works, that's great!\n4. **More Glyphs:** Definitely planned for V3!\n\nThanks again, this helps a lot to make the tool better!",

Built my first PC not long ago knowing nothing at all and only using GPT.  \n\nHere are my thoughts though, which my thought process might not be how the reality of things work.  I was thinking of the possibility of creating just a Lora that works this way. With a large enough dataset, it could be fairly accurate, especially if you're taking each movement to 2 degrees of motion, which there are also a lot of movements of joints. You could combine some, for example, there is no reason to use both shoulder abduction and adduction, only use one from 180 degrees, to 0 degrees, and then to -180 degrees, which realistically you wouldn't need to go that far unless you want to include contortions. However, you're still including 100% of all movements into the dataset, just calling it negative abd instead of adduction.  Just in the shoulder and scapula alone there are several.  Then forearms, elbows, hands, fingers, trunk, pelvis, hips etc and i think would take a lot of time to create a precise dataset of everything to the closest 2 or even 5 degrees. I feel like a Lora could be very large. What would that look like in controlnet?  Is that something that would require a massive amount of vram?  It sounds really interesting.",

You can’t generate crystal clear sharp with it. For Klein first things I noticed is (base 18gb 9b model) that I was looking for a long time; subscatter effects on skins, like veins under skin but you feels the skin transparency over it. Skin imperfections in body ( face is terrible in Klein feels like pony - weird eyes and teeth, with classic flux signature- double chin, overly pored cheeks.) \nBut final thoughts don’t t2i with Klein. Or use it for just start with low steps etc, pass it to other models finalize it than come back to Klein and edit stuff with adding realism details, do a one final pass for face restoration",

Often when I do photoshoots now, I'll also take photos on my phone, or even take poorly composed images with my camera and mess with the highlights and shadows and sharpening on my camera photos to make them look more shitty and 'real'... sigh...    This is the game of online daiting right now - a sick version of product marketing. \n\nThat's why I prefer the Flux Klein look to the ZIT look for my purposes - I can get imperfect and more candid feeling shots.

Also includes the setting ACESTEP\\_MATMUL\\_PRECISION=high (Tensor core performance optimization)\n\n[start\\_gradio\\_ui.bat](https://pastebin.com/cwz0QZuT)\n\nAlso another thing: Setting num\\_workers from 4 to 0 massively speeds up training in my case (also fixed a crash) (1000 epoch 256 rank lora with batch size 4 training on the 4B model 1h training instead of 4h). Now it actually maxes out my gpu, before that it got throttled massively by the multiple workers. Probably some windows issue. Here is a edited data\\_module.py that sets the workers to 0:\n\n[data\\_module.py](https://pastebin.com/iv26yH5F)\n\nReasoning:\n\n>On Windows, PyTorch’s DataLoader uses the `spawn` start method, which re-imports the main module inside each worker process. In the ACE-Step portable/Gradio setup, those workers end up importing parts of the UI/pipeline stack and can crash unexpectedly, which then aborts training with `DataLoader worker exited unexpectedly`. Setting `num_workers=0` disables multiprocessing workers, avoids the re-import path entirely, and makes training stable. For small datasets (e.g., \\~17 samples), it can also be faster because it removes Windows IPC/spawn overhead.\n\nEdit: Oh, just realized I've downloaded the original windows package [https://files.acemusic.ai/acemusic/win/ACE-Step-1.5.7z](https://files.acemusic.ai/acemusic/win/ACE-Step-1.5.7z) as outlined in the readme and not that forked windows version from this post here. So yeah those fixes apply to that version and not the windows version from OP. Maybe these issues I had might be fixed already in that version.",

You then can add a lora keyword. AKA MichaelJackson_Style or something and it would associate that word to what you are training.\n\nI need to see if I can do some training tonight. I have big collection of music, but without the LLM support in the portable version, it's going to be a manual process from the looks of it.",

Looking into if there is a way to just output in a format you can load into ace studio directly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0eqbp1b2sxhg1.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=43520e28f54167ba7d9a04c53ea7295bed86581b",
