          "text": "Small detail(s). If you're aiming for the dated stylistic authenticity, you should avoid using the Papyrus typeface for the title card. I have some pretty negative opinions about that typeface overall, but the big issue here is that it was developed in 1982, and the style of this video is decidedly earlier than that. The color, texture, and set pieces approximate 1960s futurism. The vehicle body styles are obviously not real, but look like the styles you might see around 1974-1976. And I could buy that as a window of time a real film like this could have been created. But, if you were to swap in older 1960s car models, that would be even more in the pocket.\n\nAnyway, a better typeface choice (though it may be a bit on-the-nose) would be [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile). Other good options might be: [Recta \\(bold\\)](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/recta-font-canada-type), Helvetica, or (if you want some more whimsy) [Craw Modern](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/craw-modern-font-grouptype). These would have been very on-brand for a retro-futuristic film from the 1960s.",

There is no SLI, no NVLink, no Crossfire support, SD will always run on **one GPU per job**.\n\nSo in practice, they will only be able to use **one 5090 at a time** for each generation. Yes, they *can* choose which card to run on by adding `--cuda-device 1` to their launch arguments, but that still means only **one** card is doing the actual work. And from what I can tell by their server rack, this is probably what they are doing. I just hope they do not plan to host THAT for stuff like AI videos, because those are still quite slow on RTX 5090 series, and this is going to suck if only 12 people can generate at the same time.\n\nAt that point, an RTX 6000 Ada would have been a much better choice. More VRAM per card and much better stability for heavy workloads. But my guess is their setup is probably not for the public but themselves and probably relatives.",

          "text": "Cool build, but let’s drop the fantasy: this is NOT “unified VRAM” and it’s NOT “1.5TB+ VRAM.” It’s 12 GPUs with 32GB each = 384GB total, distributed, and each job still sees 32GB per GPU. Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

          "text": "Cool build, but let’s drop the fantasy: this is NOT “unified VRAM” and it’s NOT “1.5TB+ VRAM.” It’s 12 GPUs with 32GB each = 384GB total, distributed, and each job still sees 32GB per GPU. Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

Most film and television is made in long continuous sections edited down and spliced together in post, that is, scenes are held on actors for long periods until they're finished, then the camera is moved to another angle and the actors do the scene again, and so on. It's just the language of the format, and it gives creators the most options when editing stuff together. It is the art form, in a way. \n\nIt's also a matter of style; some directors like quick cuts, like Michael Bay and most superhero films, others like long takes with one or several continuous shots. If AI is ever going to be taken seriously as a replacement for traditional filmmaking, it has to break the 10 second per shot limit. I'm sure it will.",

From the moment we released, this community jumped in and started creating configuration tweaks, sharing workflows, and posting optimizations here, on, Discord, Civitai, and elsewhere. We've honestly lost track of how many custom LoRAs have been shared. And we're only two weeks in.\n\nWe committed to continuously improving the model based on what we learn, and today we pushed an update to GitHub to address some issues that surfaced right after launch.\n\n**What's new today:**\n\n**Latent normalization node for ComfyUI workflows** \\- This will dramatically improve audio/video quality by fixing overbaking and audio clipping issues.\n\n**Updated VAE for distilled checkpoints** \\- We accidentally shipped an older VAE with the distilled checkpoints. That's fixed now, and results should look much crisper and more realistic.\n\n**Training optimization** \\- We’ve added a low-VRAM training configuration with memory optimizations across the entire training pipeline that significantly reduce hardware requirements for LoRA training. \n\nThis is just the beginning. As our co-founder and CEO mentioned in last week's AMA, LTX-2.5 is already in active development. We're building a new latent space with better properties for preserving spatial and temporal details, plus a lot more we'll share soon. Stay tuned.\n\n",

It's a running video so it's more complex to fix than simply better architecture and better datasets obviously. But this is an obvious flaw that I noticed\n\n2. Anytime the word \"asian\" come up, I noticed some generation burns subtitles into the generation. The correlation is there as the more \"asian\" word is mentioned the more likely the generation has burned subtitles in it. I assume this is because you train on asian movies with burned subtitles as well, but you should clean this up on the dataset.\n\n3. Better support for external audio. While it works, there is some conflict between the audio latent and the prompt. I notice the audio words usually tied to a character emotion and thus effect the character action eventhough the prompt says differently. Perhaps a strength dial would be great here between audio and prompt.",

                  "text": "This implementation looks very strange. Presumably the idea is to suspend sampling at some particular step, scale down the audio latent and then resume. The way it is implemented is definitely _not_ doing that. It is effectively doing a Euler step to 0 from whatever the current sigma is, then renoising with the same noise, same seed as the beginning. The only way this could be resuming sampling is if the model had predicted the initial noise exactly at each step which would never happen. This is likely to produce some very weird effects, especially if you do it multiple times in a generation. What you're trying to do would work much more reliably as something like a model patch.\n\nIf you really want to do it in a sampler, since the sampler returns both a noisy latent and the clean latent, you actually could extract the noise, scale the latent, and then using the existing noise to resume sampling. You would need to make an instance of ComfyUI's noise generator object to pass in that returns that specific noise. See: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/blob/0c6b36c6ac1c34515cdf28f777a63074cd6d563d/comfy_extras/nodes_custom_sampler.py#L697\n\nThe general idea would be something like:\n\n    noisy_latent, clean_latent = SamplerCustomAdvance(...)\n    clean_samples_scaled = your_scaling_stuff(clean_latent[\"samples\"])\n    noise_pred = noisy_latent[\"samples\"] - clean_samples_scaled\n    # You probably have to scale it back to unit strength.\n    noise_pred = noise_pred * (1 / current_sigma)\n    # ^^ Use this for NOISE when you resume sampling.\n\nI recommend doing it with a model patch instead but resuming with the existing noise would be a lot less likely to cause strange results.\n\nJust dividing the audio latent by 4 at specific steps also seems strange and is going to be very, very dependent on the exact schedule used and the exact number of steps and probably break or cause undesirable results otherwise. This will also degrade history samplers like SA solver, res_2m, etc because interrupting sampling like the current approach forces them to throw away all the history. ComfyUI model patches can see the current sigmas so this would probably work more reliably if you based audio latent strength scaling on the current sigma, or something like sampling percent (can be calculated from sigma with the model_sampling object).",

Please work on the hand Lora, focus animations Lora, and human anatomy Lora to refine the next update, as it's necessary and urgent.\n\nIf anyone saw the subtitles, I only saw them in the full model and tested them all without exception. For some reason, they never appear in the destilled version, so it might be an issue with this it Lora: ltx-2-19b-distilled-lora-384.safetensors. It would be good if you looked into that.\n\nCould be good if you reduced the number of cartoons like SpongeBob and others, and instead focused on adding more data from movies or scenes where the human anatomy looks correct. I know how complicated this's for the AI, but if you don't, the model won't advance significantly in its next version.\n\nP.S.: Words can always be misinterpreted, so please be understanding and tolerant of those who don't think like you or say something incorrect.

Sure it's wow for like 5 minutes but as you drive around most of the colour has gone because real life has seeped into it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_toA8lErAHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toA8lErAHg)\n\nBut at the same time I've often wondered how Alyx, Eli, Dr Kleiner, Barney and all the rest would look in real life. Klein allows that... or at least a level pretty close to it, and then after that curiosity is satisfied I can jump back into my unmodded copy of Direct3D 9 Half Life 2 from 2004 lol.",

I don't feel as excited. In fact, it made me remember of Ananta, and I'm even more stoked for that game.\n\nToo many games are obsessed with making things feel \"realistic\" that they forgot the \"fantasy\" in these games. Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes.

I'm not really interested in perfect photographic realism at all and more focused on artistic styles and creativity and from that perspective Klein 9b is blowing everything else away for me.  Excellent style representation and it does a brilliant job at blending multiple styles together as well, though I will still be happy when some good LORA's have been released for more manual control of that.  The prompt adherence is excellent and it makes pleasing and artistically minded compositional decisions.  It's also very nice to have the base models available already, I usually prefer what the distilled is putting out by default, but if I'm not happy with it or just want a lot more variation then I can always switch the base model for a huge amount of creative variation from the model.  The base of course supports CFG with negative guidance as another lever I can pull, which is something we never had from Flux Dev.  On top of all this the performance is amazing which is allowing me to iterate and experiment so much faster than on the older Flux models, it feels more like I'm using SDXL but with much more sophisticated prompt capabilities and better handling for higher and oddball resolutions (I like to do 32:9 and SDXL did not handle that nearly as well as Flux).  \n\nI agree ZIT gives more realistic skin detail and is better in terms of hands and fingers and text.  But right now it's limited without a base model and you can really only use one LORA at a time.  And I never one shot my images anyway.  I use a variety of workflows, photoshop edits and mix models together for different parts of the process.  I can do a refinement pass with ZIT if I wanted to do something photorealistic to layer on the skin tone and I can edit the image in a bunch of ways to fix the hands and any other anatomy issues.  And for that matter I CAN STILL use ZIT too!  I don't know why there seems to be a zero sum attitude about these models.  Different models are good for different things.  Nano Banana Pro is an amazing edit model but for anything remotely artistic is the dullest most lifeless model out there.  And while ZIT is great for photorealism and skin, there's very little variation in what it produces and is not nearly as good as Flux for artistic styles (IMHO).  Use the model that's best for what you want to do, but there's no reason to trash a model for not being exactly what you need for your usage.\n\nAnyway, I for one am so happy that BFL released all these models and look forward to seeing what creative opportunities it will provide for my projects.",

The Z-image turbo model is a terrible model to fine tune on yet it has over 20 fine tuned variations now. And the only reason it doesn't have a lot more is because everyone is waiting on the base model to go crazy with it. While Flux is so hard to fine tune that the only fine tuned community model I know exists is Chroma. Flux has lost its good will with the AI bro community for a while now and these communities are ravenous. \n\nIMO Klein is dead in the water too, 4b is so small that its practically SDXL, it hallucinates heavily because of its size, and the 9b model is dead in the water too, nobody can train on it because of its license and size.",

          "text": "I know the video isn’t perfect, but my goal was to push the video length as far as I could on my modest hardware. Limiting the video to 40 seconds and pushing higher resolutions, the results are far more impressive. So how does it work? If you’ve ever used the 2x Spatial Upscaler to double your video resolution in a second pass, you’re halfway there. That same upscaler can actually be applied to the empty latent video output in the first pass to greatly reduce computational overhead, but we’re going to talk about something else.  \n  \nIn the same LTX-2 repo as the Spatial Upscaler, I noticed there was a 2x Temporal Upscaler, so I tried swapping it out with the Spatial Upscaler in my 2-step workflow. The result was a video twice the length of my original, but with the sound cutting out halfway through. The process was just as fast as the Spatial Upscaler, so I knew I was onto something. I tried doubling the number of audio frames in the first pass, and holy crap, I got a 40-second video, with sound throughout, and it only took 80 seconds to generate, so I did some research.  \n  \nBy applying a 2x temporal upscale to the empty latent, you’re essentially tricking the AI. Instead of making it imagine every frame from scratch, the model only has to calculate half of the frames, while the upscaler handles the filler frames in between. The AI is doing less work because the mathematical distance between frames is wider. This principle is the same for the Spatial Upscaler, but with the video resolution.  \n  \nIn my workflow, you can see options to chain both upscalers together in either the first or second passes, and I’ve experienced success with many combinations. I’ve even daisy chained multiple instances of the same upscaler together, for stupid fast generations with mostly coherent videos. The only thing that really suffers at extreme video lengths, is the AI-generated audio, since the temporal upscaler only works on the video frames. Anyway, this has been a lot of fun to tinker with, especially since I don’t have to wait ages for results. I can’t wait to see what other users come up with.  \n  \nLink to my workflow: [https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup](https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup)  \n  \nLink to the LTX-2 Temporal Upscaler: [https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors)",

This is because after your input frames are converted into latents, the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\" node doubles the amount of latents. These doubled latents are then fed into the sampler for inference, which is no different from directly increasing the number of latents.\n\nSince the official documentation doesn't explain it, I believe the actual usage is like this: take the result output by the sampler inference, feed it into the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\", and then perform an action similar to RIFE VFI frame interpolation. Consequently, you will get smoother footage, and naturally, the FPS count will double.",

It can do arbitrary length videos if you use the ContextOptions node from Wan Video Wrapper, just use only a LOW model (no HIGH) and set denoise to 0.7 or lower, and use a relevant pic as a reference image.\n\nIt's basically a free quality pass on any video and if you use a good reference image it'll easily clean up the plastic skin issue (among other things). Just make sure you only do it once when there's dialogue, repeated refinements might ruin the lip syncing.\n\nEdit: here's a workflow for it [https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep](https://pastebin.com/AfyAEpep)",

I was using my own workflow and for the sake of speed of testing - the distilled model. At 1920x1080x24x900 I let it run for like 20 minutes and it wasn't able to complete a single step (although I didn't get an OOM in that timeframe either).\n\nI dropped to 600 frames to see how that went, and it did improve inference time from 682.47s/it without to 266.77 with. *But here's the thing...* When I drop to 481 (20 second video) I can get 36.05s/it without needing it. \n\nSo in other words, I think that inference speed is a larger bottleneck when dealing with very high frame counts than the VRAM requirement (at least on a 5090), making it far more efficient to simply just generate shorter clips to extend via LTX's native video extension capabilities rather than a longer clip in one shot. \n\nBut, if you must generate in a single run and have the extra time to spare I do think this can work. \n\nWith all of that said, I'm curious what others find to see if maybe I'm missing something.",

Ahora, para acceder a los pesos, la ruta se ha convertido en algo como: diffusion\\_model.double\\_blocks.0.img\\_mod.ff.\\_ffn\\_ref.net.0.weight (Debido a que guardaste el original dentro de self.\\_ffn\\_ref).\n3. **El Conflicto:** Cuando el sistema de parches de ComfyUI (ModelPatcher) intenta aplicar el LoRA, busca la ruta original. Como has sustituido el objeto original por tu wrapper, la ruta ya no existe o no coincide, y lanza el error de \"KeyError\" o dice que las claves no coinciden.\n\n# La Solución: \"Monkey Patching\" del método forward\n\nEn lugar de reemplazar el **objeto** (el módulo entero), debes reemplazar solo su **comportamiento** (el método forward). De esta forma, la estructura del modelo y los nombres de las capas permanecen intactos, y los LoRAs pueden encontrar las capas para modificarlas.\n\nAquí tienes el código corregido. He modificado la clase para que inyecte la lógica de chunking directamente en el módulo original sin cambiar su identidad.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

          "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been working on this image-to-video project since LTX-2's release, 10 days and countless hours that I've decided to wrap up here before it completely consumed me. I want to share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the final result.\n\n**The Starting Point:** This project began with a single warrior queen concept image I generated last year (the one where she's sleeping in the video). I built a draft story around her and created storyboards using Nano Banana.\n\n**Full Disclosure:** I'm not a video editor or filmmaker, I saw this as an opportunity to learn while exploring the capabilities and limitations of open-source video models. I started with WAN 2.2, then transitioned to LTX-2 as my primary tool.\n\n**Hardware & Software:**\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)\n* **Platform:** ComfyUI with various community workflows\n* **Post-Production:** Basic video editing software for simple transitions and vignette effects in 1-2 places (kept it minimal)\n* **Upscaling:** I had originally planned to test video upscaling myself but honestly lost the appetite by that point. A friend with a Topaz Video AI subscription kindly upscaled the final edit for me (I don't have a subscription myself)\n\n**The Production Process:**\n\n* Generated **250+ video clips** to get what you see here\n* Experimented extensively with community workflows and custom parameter tweaks\n* Used First Frame-Last Frame (FFLF) workflows for some sequences\n* Created custom music using Suno (spent hours getting the tone right)\n* Generated voiceovers, narrations, and audio effects (ultimately decided not to use them)\n* Only used official LTX-2 camera LoRAs\n\n**The Challenges:** Getting consistent, high-quality results was... difficult. To achieve even something \"decent\" without ugly distortions, random shifts, or quality degradation often required 10-20 generation attempts per shot. The LTX-2 audio quality was particularly disappointing, roughly 95% unusable, so I didn't even attempt to incorporate it as sound effects.\n\n\\---Somehow I can't post the rest of my review, so adding as a reply to this message---",

              "text": "**Technical Notes:**\n\n* Only 2 **clips uses WAN 2.2** (the dragon extending its wings and roaring, woman looking through spear)\n* Everything else is LTX-2\n* Only official camera LoRAs used\n* Minimal post-processing (just basic transitions/vignettes)\n* Final upscale via Topaz Video AI\n\n**Why I'm Stopping Here:** The breaking point came when I reached the dragon vs warrior queen fighting scenes. I immediately realized this technology just isn't ready for action sequences, the complex movements, rapid interactions, and dynamic camera work that action demands consistently produced unusable results. Maybe I'm giving up too quickly, but the time investment versus output quality ratio became unsustainable.\n\n**What I Learned:**\n\n* Even with high-end hardware, these models require significant patience and iteration\n* Prompt engineering for video is vastly different from images\n* FFLF workflows can help with character consistency but introduce their own challenges\n* Action scenes are currently beyond reliable generation\n* Audio generation needs major improvements\n* Quality consistency remains the biggest hurdle for production work\n* ComfyUI workflows from the community are powerful but require deep experimentation\n\nI'm sharing this project as both a creative piece and a realistic look at what working with these early-stage tools actually involves. I hope it helps others set realistic expectations and maybe avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered.\n\nCheers!",

They could probably produce solid concept videos (even if not production-ready) straight out of the box, because they'd know how to describe what they want.\n\nI had absolutely no idea how challenging it is to prompt a sequence with the correct technical language. For example, if I wanted to show a dragon in flight with realistic wing mechanics—describing how the wings should flap, at what rhythm, how the body shifts with each stroke, camera tracking the motion, I simply didn't had the vocabulary or knowledge to articulate that effectively...",

I've produced a few 1-2 full scene videos with layered dialogue, sound effects, etc. It takes a TON of time and energy so I appreciate your effort, and you have a good directorial eye for what it's worth. I like the closeup on her eyes as the dragon was approaching.\n2. For the LTX clips, were you using the distilled or dev model?\n3. What are your overall thoughts on LTX vs WAN at this point? I've had similar success ratios to what you mentioned: For every \\~12 LTX gens I get one good one, and for every \\~4 WAN gens I get a good one (where \"good\" = consistent, high-quality, and follows the prompt). The speed of LTX is completely negated by the lack of prompt adherence, and the audio element is essentially a gimmick at this point. I've completely returned to WAN already.",

For LTX I don't know how to disable audio generation to save up on generation time, I didn't needed it and I wish there is a way to \"don't generate audio and speed up my generation\" option.\n\nWith WAN 2.2 14B my biggest problem was random slow-motion generations and generation time was slower for me even with 4step acceleration loras.\n\nIf I would start this type of project again  I deifnetly go over WAN and force myself to learn as much as I can",

Z-Image has its strength and use cases, but I prefer Klein at the moment for its prompt adherence. Its understanding is on another level. For example, just playing around, I took a selfie in my bathroom mirror and then used Klein to remove myself. The result looked perfect. I then used that as a reference image for the environment. I can now use another reference image of anyone I want and place them there.\n\nHere’s the most interesting part. In the prompt, I can tell it that the image should be through my own eyes and that I’m the person in the reference image. From that point, I can describe myself in first person language and its understands perfectly. I can say “my hair is blonde”, “I am leaning forward with hands on the countertop”, “I’m wearing a blue t-shirt”, etc. the interactions between the reference images is great too. \n\nAnyway, for prompts and generations like that, Klein is currently my favorite. Skin textures and tones are also much more realistic. Maybe it’s due to using reference images, but I haven’t noticed a plastic look at all. Once people start learning all of the unique things it can do, I have a feeling it will become much more popular.",

Here is the original comment for reference:\n\n    I think this can be safely ignored - OP likely just tried many different seeds until they arrived at this image, perhaps for shock factor or some other such nonsense... Because: If such a massive error was truly representative of the model, it would have never managed to do the much more difficult case of image 14 correctly.\n    Also, consider that Z-Image did not just get one hand wrong in image 14, but 3 simultaneously... this implies that the model more generally struggles with hands.",

For example, the origami paper looks nicer for Z-Image, but then I did a Bing Image search, and as it turns out, the relatively weak paper texture generated by Flux is actually closer to what real origami paper looks like... Or, for the \"16-bit\" picture: There is actually a significant difference between 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit colors, if you take the corresponding color modes on earlier computers as what those terms are even supposed to mean. And, Flux looks like it is around \\~12-bit-ish I would say, whereas Z-Image is closer to maybe 6-bits... Then again, this is such a small detail that it might as well be coincidence.\n\n\\> Z image will render whatever you want when it's trained. In terms of NSFW.\n\nShouldn't this also be the case for Flux 2 Klein?\n\nI guess we will find out soon enough... while it's not impossible that BFL somehow \"poisoned\" the model to make the learning of genitals more difficult (or at least I read such rumors, I didn't look into it), I am not sure how much that will really change.",

The lighting is harsh and directional, coming from a single source outside the frame. The contrast is extreme (chiaroscuro), with bright highlights on the subject's skin and deep, pitch-black shadows that obscure the rest of the scene.    The image has the texture of an oil painting created alla prima. The background and shadows are thin and translucent, revealing a subtle canvas grain and a dark warm undertone. The highlights on her face are rendered with thick, creamy impasto brushstrokes that follow the curvature of the form. The paint appears wet and oily, with visible bristle marks in the brightest areas.  On the far left, an ancient, sunken city is overgrown with vibrant, alien coral reefs and spiraling kelp towers in shades of seafoam green and soft pink. The center is a negative space of pale, aquatic mist and floating scintillating bioluminescent spores. Occupying this space floats a sinuous mythological sea serpent-dragon, entirely aquatic. Its body is a graceful ribbon that is curled into a simple spiral. It is covered in shimmering opalescent scales that shift in color like polished abalone shell, reflecting milky whites, pale pastel pinks, soft lavenders, and mint greens depending on the light. Instead of wings, its form is adorned with elaborate, flowing fins and trailing, leaf-like appendages made of pearly membrane  that ripple in the water like silk ribbons. A graceful crest runs along its back, and its noble, stylized head is adorned with soft, decorative tendrils. To the right, the blue eyed face of a colossal, graceful Siren floats weightlessly, consuming the entire right and middle portion of the image; her waist is partially adorned with pink and silver transluscent silk that flows like water.  She wears a pleading look of desperation.  her skin texture is highly realistic with visible pores, slight flushing, and natural variegation. The complexion is luminous but imperfect. her form is sparsely covered with interlocking floral shapes and soft multi-colored petals. her nose is large and prominent and straight with a natural, slightly rounded bridge.   Her breasts are only covered by a few flowers.  One arm is extended out toward the center, hand gracefully extended and cupped under the snout of the sea dragon.  Her outstretched palm is glowing with yellow energy. Her other arm is extended gracefully back behind her.  Her hair flows into the water as long flowing ribbons of liquid gold. The siren and dragon are staring into each other's eyes.",

I still have some hope for the 4B model though. it’s small and could become an easy SDXL replacement, even if it won’t match Z-Image quality.\n\nHonestly, I’m more impressed by editing capabilities than pure image generation. Having strong gen + edit in a single model is more valuable overall. Curious to see how Z-Image Edit turns out.",
