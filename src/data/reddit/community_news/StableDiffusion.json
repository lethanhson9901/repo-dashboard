The west is all about capitalism, the east is all about relevance.\nThe west (government) is not investing/directing directly, the east IS.

It still has some of the worst tool support, if I'm not mistaken, even to this day. Flux also had lots of issues, in general, with its outputs/limitations.

I find that blending their styles with a more realistic painter, or even mixing a painter with a sculptor, can achieve the modern retro-Art deco immitation look I like. Honestly, some fringe cases of Art Nouveau artists can be made to look Deco by negative prompting away the curves and florals. \n\nSorry that turned rambly lol.",

And before you ask, no, I don't feed the latent image directly into the **KSampler**, though you are free to try that to see what you get. Sometimes I even do a three step process with the first image being lower than 200 pixels, or I skip the resize to 800x600 altogether, or use the 600x800 as the final resolution. (More than enough for video generation.) Many options.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a **Load Image** node to use any image as base, then use a **Resize** node with *crop* to feed the **VAE Encode**. You can reduce the image first before increasing it's size again to eliminate as many details from the original as possible.\n\nI use **DPM++ 2M SDE GPU** as *sampler* and **Beta** as *scheduler* for the final step, between 15 to 20 *steps*, and a *CFG* of 1.5 or 2.

But basically, I used the same prompts as OP, and then added some flavor text like \"casual photograph\" o \"careless shot\" or similar. Using a two steps or three steps workflow, with the first image being very low resolution (192x104 for 16:9 and 192x144 for 4:3) you can get very odd results, very colorful backgrounds, and you can be able to remove all depth blurriness.\n\nYour second generation can be something like 600x800 for example and then you make a final one that clean the results. To make images for video generation I usually stop bellow 1K, but making a third pass can fix problems, like things that doesn't make sense. However, I still get beds outside of a house, for example, as the initial image can be a bit chaotic.\n\nTo reduce chaos and variety, you can increase the denoising during the first stage. I usually use 0.5, but 0.55 or 0.6 can reduce the excessive variety a bit. The most you increase the denoising, the closer to your prompt the image is going to be, reducing variety. Some people think Turbo doesn't have much of that, but it's quite the opposite actually.",

If the image already has the desired resolution or is higher resolution, then the result won't contain upscale artifacts, because it's not so good at that.\n\nIt can also clean up degraded image edits that have been through too many edits and make them look pristine, if you don't care too much about original detail, as well as fix out-of-place lighting and color balancing issues, such as from an earlier failed object combination attempt, because it's also fairly good at relighting.\n\nOf the various models that can do reimagining and difficult image fixing, it's close to SOTA, especially for its size and speed.",

Next up is the aforementioned R9700 which is essentially just a 9070 XT with double the vram. That said, it’s the cheapest and most accessible way to get to 32GB. It’s no slouch but it’s not anything close to the power of a 5090. But with Nvidia becoming less attainable by the day and AMD *finally* helping to make ROCm useable on windows, the r9700 is among the best value props at the moment (depending on how you define “value” in 2026). I’ve been working through optimizing for Comfy and have had very reasonable performance. Wan 2.2 can be a bit of a slog but LTX-2 is pretty stellar and all the recent image models (z-image turbo and base/flux Klein 9B/qwen 2512) have been rock solid.",

(see my post history for experiments with modern models) I think we need to post more experiments and techniques here on reddit, NOT on discord, to keep the interest alive. \n\nI see it like the heyday of hip hop - taking something made by someone else and mashing it up to make something totally new. It goes beyond just typing two artists at random and seeing what comes out. I spend hours on image search engines to find artists that might mesh well, using controlnets to guide composition, etc. \n\nModern models are hit or miss. I am a proponent of the Flux2 family after being a staunch Flux1 dev hater because they have *some* artist knowledge. A good foundational artist knowledge is crucial to this use, as no amount of manual of LLM-generated style descriptors can capture a look. The Chinese teams behind Qwen and Z image lack of concern for copyright would have been promising but they don't seem interested in artist tagging, at least in English. \n\nWhile the edit models are somewhat promising for style transfer, they don't hold a candle to SDXL's IPadapter and the tools developed by /u/Matt3o back when he was active in this space [he has since left the Comfy community, sadly). What we need is someone to get really invested in better controlnets and IPadapter stand ins. QRcode controlnets were a HUGE boone in SD1.5 and SDXL eras, something which people have forgotten with the newer unified controlnets. \n\nThose are my rambling thoughts. \n\ntl;dr people interested in remixing artist styles and making visually cool stuff still exist. We need to post more. Share workflows, experiments, and ideas on reddit. We can keep this going, maybe even revitalize the interest among newcomers.",

              "text": "I wonder if theres a way through coding to emulate high variation without losing final \"specifcity\" of an image. \n\nI was originally replying to your comment in a much simpler way but it got me thinking and I ended up reasoning about it much more than I planned. \n\n**Don't feel like you are obligated to read it**, but im gonna post it anyways just so i can reference later and in case anyone else wants to try this\n\n---\n\n# Idea\n\n## Background\nI'm basing this of my experience with tensorboard where even though a model has hundreds of dimensions, it will surface the top 3 dimensions in terms of spread across latent space according to the initial word list you fed it. \n\n\nI'm probably explaining all of this poorly but basically its giving you the most useful 3d view of something with WAY more than 3 dimensions. If you google a tensorboard projection map or better yet try one yourself my idea might make more sense.\n\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Make a \"variation\" word list containing common modifiers. Generate embeddings for these with a given model's text encoder\n \n\n2. Take the image gen prompt and chunk it according to semantic boundaries that make the most sense for the model type (i.e.  by sentence boundary for LLM text encoder models or by new line for CLIP or T5). \n \n\n3. Generate embeddings of each prompt chunk. You may decide to cluster here to limit number chunks to keep the final results more generalized thus coherent.\n \n\n4. Combine the variation embedding list with your prompt chunk list. Use a weighting factor (k) to represent the prompt chunks at an optimal ratio vs word list (as determined by testing)\n \n\n5. Calculate the top n dimensions of highest variability for this combined list (this is where the weight ratio we apply to prompt chunks matters). The value for n would be a knob for you to choose but \"3\" seems like a good starting point and also what you need for that super cool tensorboard projection map.\n \n\n6. For each of your (n) dimensions sample the top (y) nearest neighbors from variation embeddings to each prompt chunk (c) embedding (closeness can be calculated a few different ways, but i'll assume cosine distance for now)\n \n\n7. Now you have a list of variation embeddings that are semantically related to your prompt. The quantity of variation embeddings will be equal to the product of (n)(y)(c) \n\n>    (n: number of most expressive dimensions sampled)\n> x (y: number of nearest neighbors in each dimension for a given prompt chunk)\n> x (c: number of prompt chunks)\n> = (total number or \"semantically coherent\" variation embeddings)\n\n\n8. During diffusion you inject one of the (y) per (n) per (c) into the process. You would probably want to do so according to a schedule:\n\n> early steps for structural variation\n\n> later steps for fine detail variation. \n\nYou never inject more than one variation embedding for a given dimension for a given prompt chunk, you don't want to cause a regression to the mean which would happen if you nearest neighbors were of approx. equal but opposite vectors from the prompt chunks\n\n### Refinements\n\n- You could make targeted \"variation\" word lists that focus on describing variations for a specific topic. Perhaps a \"human morphology\" list, an \"art style\" list (if your text encoder understands them), or even a specialized \"Domain specific\" list containing niche descriptive words most salient in a specific domain like \"Star Wars\" or something\n\n\n- Remember that we are going to weight the relative strength of the word list vs prompt chunks list (k factor). This is a powerful coarse knob that controls for \"relatedness\" to the original prompt. This will be the first knob I go to if my idea is yielding too strong or too weak of an effect\n\n\n- Instead of choosing (y) nearest neighbors for a given dimension, perhaps grab the closest nearest neighbor, then grab the 2nd closest neighbors BUT only from the opposite direction in relation to the specific prompt chunk embedding. \n\n> Think of it as a line with our prompt chunks embedding as point on the line. We are choosing the next closest point, then the next closest point on the other side of the line relative to chunk embedding.",

Why push for development in more creative art styles when we already know AI can already achieve good results?\n\nI think once consistently good anatomy for people is achieved it'll come back around again. All of this is community driven by the needs of the community, and currently for those that want creative art styles are generally satisfied with 1.5 for now. But the community that needs good anatomy aren't satisfied and are driving most of the changes at the moment. Once that is done, who knows what will be on the cards for new developments?",

And you'll agree that it's easier to say \"in the style of Monet and (Mucha:1.1)\" that saying \"impressionist  painting using medium to large touches in slow progressing gradients with low to medium thickness and medium to high paint mixing, cross referenced with (detailed and intricate.... Yadyayada:1.1)\". For the first and simple reason that tokens are expensive, and overflowing the maximum gave you basic random omissions (which has its perks but increases the slot machine effect).\n\nNow that the SD styles era is past (except maybe with ZIB and SDXL revivals), if one wants to \"pick the model\" for creativity, it has to use the basic blocks available, such as the long and detailed descriptions of what one expects from the model : tool, influence, touch, color, hues, gradients, forms, eras, etc, which is very fine if you know your art history, and leaves all who don't in the mud. A lot of people here have learned HEAPS of visual language by trying, looking at prompts, studying the images etc, and those are the ones who came to better control their outputs, even back in the SD era.\n\nBut with modern models (and maybe encoders too idk about that) , I have this feeling that the open source releases are geared towards our of the box utility. I think (and may be wrong) rhat it's why ZImage released the photo-focused Turbo first - they had to make a great impression that works right outside the box. If they'd let Base out first (on top of maybe be unfinished back then) literally every post in this sub would have been \"Flux does it better\" and it would have taken years to get off. \n\nOne of the reasons, I think, is because most open source users aren't power users or commercial users with intent. They're just happy to explore, but there's little \"need\" from them to go beyond what the défaut 1girl prompt would provide. And so, in part, this killed some of the open source model's \"creativity\". Again I don't like to employ that word here, because to me as a former graphics designer, the creativity is never in the tool, no matter how potent. \n\nPeople used the infamous \"high seed variation\" SDXL for years generating huge batches of the same prompt and trashing the output until the image they wanted stood out - if that's what everyone calls creativity, I gotta swap planets. But when they have an idea even partial and try stuff and mix and match and refine and go back and most importantly end up saying \"I won't go further this is final\" they made a decision, they brought it there, and this they created.\n\nI'd argue that SD1.5 and SDXL are extremely useful today for generating basic elements that are refined and reworked with the precision and prompt adherence or modern models ! Finding pieces and bits that could be used in CREATIVE ways, assembled and refined to look like something else, and finally tell a story that would take 20x the prompt context to explain with the perfect words (hoping that the model, your own expression in English/Chinese, the quantization of your TEs and your models etc etc etc would let all the nuances through) - that's the future  of creativity in AI gens. Not T2I alone, not I2I alone, but a mixture of everything that you, the user, keeps on making happening - not because the \"model is capable\" with lazy prompts.",

They tried to make realistic SD 1.5 fine tunes and posted countless threads with titles like \"does this look realistic?\" (and still do). Whenever someone released a new fine tune, one of the first questions was always \"how good is it at realism?\".\n\nWhen Pony v6 was released, some of them got really angry by the fact that it didn't do realism. They explained that realism and one day being able to use it for virtual reality was the ultimate goal of generative AI and something everyone should be striving towards.\n\nPersonally, I have zero interest in realism. I find realism boring. From the very start, I've wanted to create something that looks like the comics that I grew up with. That has been quite hard to find. Everything is focused on either realism or anime. I've often ended up using furry models to generate human characters since they tend to have a more Western cartoon and comic book style. I finally found the Arthemy Illustrious models which are fairly close to what I've been looking for.\n\n>Pony was the peak\n\nI feel this too in a way. For me, it was the biggest leap in usability, when I could suddenly generate all the character portraits I had tried to make since the SD 1.4 days. Illustrious is better, but it feels more like a gradual improvement. Z-Image-Turbo is the first model in years that made me feel truly excited since it makes it easy to create complex scenes with multiple characters. My goal is to create images that tell a story.",

          "text": "Had this conversation recently with my colleagues at the AI agency (tv ads, shows, movies) I work for.\n\nSd1.5 and it’s strangeness, speed and knowledge of artists names and styles is what brought me into AI in the first place. \n\nThe change happened pretty slowly, now I rarely use AI for personal visual pleasure and more only for work; it became boring. The other day I build a workflow to generate artistic images with sd1.5 and then passes the results to Flux Klein to improve it without dropping the visual quality: I found myself again hooked for 4 hours straight in a continuous dopamine rush. \n\nSd1.5 knows almost any artists, architect and designer you can name; my huge pleasure is mixing names of artists in various promoted weights and seeing what the heck comes out, plus you had embedding which were like loras but easy, intuitive, fast and didn’t break the images. \n\nThe reason why artists have been scraped out of models is frankly respectable. There are huge copyright and intellectual property issues which had to be addressed. In a more ‘correct’ world a Rembrandt Lora should be trained and sold or given for free by the Rijksmuseum, maybe in collaboration with other museums and each should be able to decide if giving it for free or for a price. \n\nThat said you can train Loras for everything still today and it works, but it’s not the same thing: we mostly use flow distilled models today so the results are often limited and too influenced by realism; the sd1.5 results were amazing because the model gave completely varied result and the generation was influenced by the enormous amount of art inside the dataset; so words like “golden ratio, modernist, abstract” gave amazing results while Klein or Zimage will just prefer to generate triangles and spirals. \n\nSd1.5->Klein is still my way to go for personal pleasant time generating; the only thing that could change that at the moment is a complete finetune of the 9b Klein model. This would cost millions of $, thousands of hours of work and it would be highly illegal, that’s why I don’t see that happening soon. \n\nIt could happen as some guerrilla-like hidden project where lots of people put together the enormous dataset (and captions, I think that’s the hardest part to do well) and then collect a big sum of money to train with pro gpus in cloud. \n\nAnother solution which would also be legal would be train a paid model (maybe 30$ per month fee?) which gives the artists money each time their particular work is used in generations. This would be legal, socioeconomically fair, decentralized, but I don’t see this happening either for a variety of reasons. \n\nCreativity in AI in the end is always handled by your own human talent, so with Sd1.5 creativity did not die, it just requires way more human effort to get there, (other than training Lora’s you can use an artwork or even your sketch to mildly denoise an image with any model) which probably is a good thing for artists, designers, architects; I’m not 100% sure though, it’s something that should be debated by someone with way more culture than the one I possess.",

Or there's a huge market for realistic girls.\n\nYes, there is absolute a huge market for realistic 1girls.  Just look at the top models on Civitai.\n\nBut no, A.I. is not overtrained in art.  In fact, most artists have not been trained into LoRAs.  I've trained hundreds of them, and there are thousands more to go if I want to continue 😅: [https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models](https://civitai.com/user/NobodyButMeow/models)\n\nNow back to SD1.5 \"creativity\" vs the supposed \"lack of creativity\" in newer models.\n\nA.I. models are mainly used in two ways.  One is for \"brainstorming\", where one tries out simple ideas and let the A.I. \"fill in the blanks\".  This is where SD1.5/SDXL's higher level of hallucinatory \"creativity\" may be useful.\n\nThe other is to use A.I. as a tool with a high level of control, where the A.I. responds precisely to a detailed prompt as one refines one's idea as to what the image should look like. \n\nIn general, most people who are \"serious\" about using A.I. as a creative tool will pick control over hallucination, in the same way that one would want an assistant that will follow precise instruction to carry out a task rather than one that just goes off and do thing according to his own whims.\n\nWith current SOTA models, users who have the creativity and the imagination, can create most thing (except those involving complex interactions between two characters) that they can envision ([a bad workman blames his tools](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bad+workman+always+blames+tools)) 😅\n\nMaybe the ideal A.I. model is one that can do both, and to some extent, Chroma and ZiBase are heading in that direction, but many users are not happy with the fact that a lot more trial and error involving more negative prompt and other incantation such as \"aesthetic 11\" are involved due to the more \"creative\" nature of these less \"tuned\" models.\n\nFinally, if one wants modern models to hallucinate like SD1.5 in the good old days, there are random prompt generators, wildcards, and even noise injection nodes.",

Good for impatient people and video models (altho I think no video model uses it, yet). Also obviously makes generation a lot faster and more accurate (to some extent, its only as accurate as training data).\n\nThere are \"between\" things, like DMD2, which is almost like flow, but not really. While its good, it has sort of its \"idea how things should look\" which tend to override any model tied to it. Plus it obviously limits variability a quite a bit and can, if not merged right, cause model to become pretty dumb.

With the newer hardware a lot of people will now have due to newer models, you can probably do quite large full sd1.5 fine-tunes :3\n\nOne of the reasons why Sd1.5 sucked so bad at anatomy was its low output size more than anything else. You can train it to be a larger resolution capable model by training progressively on larger resolution datasets. I did a toy version of this back in the day to 1600px and it's pretty bad at txt2img due to undertraining but in img2img and unsampling it is far more coherent than the base and SDXL etc. Hands are a non-issue and I use it for style transfer",

Instead they fuck around with changing the UI continually and breaking things.\n\nFor real, how is there still not a way to naively export the queue. Who the hell thought 'lets just keep this all in an in-memory list that nothing else can access. Apparently saving the queue to a flat file as json or even just plain text and removing a line when a job completes... is just too fucking complicated for them to design.  \nOr... how the hell is there no way to pause a queue in case you need to do something else with your GPU. These are basic UX things that they refuse to implement and they ignore ever PR that comes in for them.",

Keep in mind that any character LoRA can and will alter the core style of the model.\n\nDepending on the checkpoint model and/or LoRA, you will have to increase or decrease the prompt weight a lot. Keeping the same prompt weight for different character LoRA hoping to get the exact same style every single time is impossible, *(unless you made the LoRA yourself and know how to tweak the style of the dataset).* In my case, I did not use any LoRA since Jessie is already part of the dataset, but some people prefer to use LoRAs to capture the anime screenshot/screencap style and art style. If you want that film grain effect, you can use **(retro artstyle:1.5)** for instance. **Detail Daemon** extension can help enhance the effect, too.\n\nI ran the first picture through **WD Tagger** since I was too lazy to write the whole thing from scratch for her clothes, and pose, etc... So, I apologize for the mess, because I usually do not prompt like that. I only added/tweaked what the vision model did not catch. So, you get the idea.\n\n    jessie \\(pokemon\\), 1girl, solo, red hair, very long hair, blue eyes, half-closed eyes, looking at viewer, smile, hair over one eye, hair over shoulder, shiny clothes, shirt, skirt, long sleeves, gloves, navel, closed mouth, jewelry, jacket, upper body, cowboy shot, earrings, black gloves, pants, puffy sleeves, hand up, elbow gloves, midriff, black skirt, stomach, black jacket, crop top, black shirt, eyelashes, lips, makeup, leaning forward, alternate hairstyle, juliet sleeves, lipstick, hand on own face, cropped jacket, hair down, hand on own cheek, red lips, alternate hair length, cropped shirt, hair slicked back, team rocket, team rocket uniform, (anime coloring:3), 1990s \\(style\\)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08ntafm576jg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=268ae38f098740f3040471a201c730d69c277547",

Klein is 3x as fast as Qwen and new parts of an image (f.e. if it has to create something without a reference) looks a lot better but usually requires generating several images for it to adhere to your prompt and get what you want while Qwen usually does it first try while also providing better consistency of character.\n \nCurrently for in-image edit (f.e. changing just parts of an image) I prefer Qwen because it follows the prompt, changes very little else about the image and I don't have to worry about any degradation in perceived quality.\n\nFor full image edit, f.e. same character but new scene and everything, it's a toss-up. With consistency Lora Klein gets a pretty good consistency result and I like what it creates better, but sometimes what Qwen creates or if I have references, is good enough/fits well and Qwen still stays on top.\n\nWorth noting that I do use a different VAE to solve the halftone pattern Qwen Edit kinda adds on skin texture.",

          "text": "Okay, so I tested it on photo restoration versus the original Qwen Image Edit, the 2509 and 2511 versions. The initial image was a blurry, low-resolution black and white facial photo of a person I know that was cut into oval. The prompt was \"restore photo and improve clarity, remove border\". I fixed the seed and generation parameters. SwarmUI, 50 steps.\n\nQwen Image Edit (original): the oval border correctly removed (image outpainted); the resulting photo was still black and white; the result was unusable (exaggerated contrast, oversharpened with no fine details)\n\nEdit 2509: the oval border still there; black and white; good contrast; it actually attempted to restore the photo and add clarity, but it was still rough (way better than the OG model though).\n\nEdit 2511: near perfect restore, image still black and white, but other than that it did a great job: fine details are there, perfect contrast, perfect outpaint job to remove the border.\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect restore; produced a color image with faded look (which was what I expected after looking through their technical report); great level of fine details and great outpaint job. Easily the best result.\n\nI won't post the images here (that's a real person and they won't be happy about it), but this model looks very promising. If anything, it looks like a high-quality finetune of Qwen Edit 2511 and not of the 2509 version - despite the similarity numbers posted here.\n\nTo make it a fair comparison, I added \"...and colorize\" to the prompt. Then we have the following (again, same seed comparison; I skipped the original Edit):\n\nEdit 2509: much stronger result this time; slight change of perspective (zoomed out); fine details still lacking (the face looks way too smooth for an elderly person), but looks on a different level to the original result; oval border removed (this is still the same seed)\n\nEdit 2511: a color photo this time, border removed; hallucinated a colorful background (out of focus park view)\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect result; higher contrast and saturation compared to the first attempt (it's still the same seed); colors no longer have that faded look. Still the best result out of the three.\n\nNow, I can see the similarity numbers, but I'll rather believe my eyes: this model is clearly superior to both the 2509 and 2511 Qwen Edit models.\n\nEDIT: after checking all the images and making a few extra gens with different seeds, I can say that the 2509 and 2511 get better likeness to the real person. The source was really blurry and low-res, the restoration job is technically better, but the 2511 gets a bit closer to how that person looks in real life. YMMV.",

Here, the model behaves much closer to the 2509 Edit; generated images (same seed) are very close; FireRed-Image-Edit-1.0 still has an edge in details and realism over the 2509 Edit. So it likely is a 2509 Edit finetuned specifically for edits and image restoration; T2I is less affected by the tuning.

It's like if you want to make something already in Turbo (Preview)'s realism spectrum it works well, but as soon as you need to steer the model to some rarely used weights, it's not great.\n\nZ-Image training is broken.

Built my first PC not long ago knowing nothing at all and only using GPT.  \n\nHere are my thoughts though, which my thought process might not be how the reality of things work.  I was thinking of the possibility of creating just a Lora that works this way. With a large enough dataset, it could be fairly accurate, especially if you're taking each movement to 2 degrees of motion, which there are also a lot of movements of joints. You could combine some, for example, there is no reason to use both shoulder abduction and adduction, only use one from 180 degrees, to 0 degrees, and then to -180 degrees, which realistically you wouldn't need to go that far unless you want to include contortions. However, you're still including 100% of all movements into the dataset, just calling it negative abd instead of adduction.  Just in the shoulder and scapula alone there are several.  Then forearms, elbows, hands, fingers, trunk, pelvis, hips etc and i think would take a lot of time to create a precise dataset of everything to the closest 2 or even 5 degrees. I feel like a Lora could be very large. What would that look like in controlnet?  Is that something that would require a massive amount of vram?  It sounds really interesting.",

These guys probably put a lot of money into this fine tune, why they probably didnt bother to mention that it was a qwen fine tune. The stock aesthetics of base QWEN are often way too soft and hazy for my taste. If this fine-tune fixes the clarity and style, it’s a win—I haven’t tested it yet, but I’m curious to see if they pulled it off. There are literally only a handful of fine tuned QWEN models out there because its such a big model and expensive to fine tune; if these guys fixed QWENs flaws then im excited to try it again because QWEN is an absolute beast of a model that is only limited by the previous mentioned flaws and how compute intensive it is that its out of reach for most users, but not me as i own a 4090. QWEN stomps Klein 9b and Z-image and everything else txt2img open source in prompt adherence except for maybe that huge Flux2 model, it just needed a good fine tune to tighten up some flaws.",
