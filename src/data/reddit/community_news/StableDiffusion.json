Even if the model was never shown a woman lying like some people were spouting back then, it clearly knows what a humanoid looks like when lying down so it should have been able to generalize. \n\nThe saddest part is SD3.5 Medium is actually a [really interesting model for art](https://postimg.cc/gallery/grmwg4F), and from memory it was trained completely different than SD3 and 3.5 Large but for whatever reason Stability believed the SD3 brand wasn't complete poison by that point. If Medium was called SD4 and it might have had a chance.\n\nNot gonna lie though, as much as I love playing around with ZiT and Klein and appreciate the adherence the new training style brings, I miss models trained on raw alt-text. There was something special about prompting your hometown and getting photos that looked like they could have been taken from there.",

It's possible they could have trained an entirely new model between the API release and open release and botched it, but that seems wasteful even for Stability.\n\nI did a lot of testing trying to figure out what the issue was and it felt like they specifically targeted certain concepts, or combinations of concepts.

You can train back whatever you want and the model won't fight you on it.

Some influencers have gone even further and started dissolving lip fillers in favor of their original appearance. Of course, there are still plenty of people stuck in the past.\n\nThe same goes for color grading, heavy “creative” color work has fallen out of fashion, with images kept much closer to RAW.\n\nAnd all of this is because people started, and are still continuing, to produce huge amounts of overly polished images in Midjourney and similar tools",

But the real issue is that for myself, on a 3090, it's much slower than it's alternatives and swallows all of my VRAM. I can't imagine that most other people, whose cards are slower, would find it useable. \n\nBut the other thing is that Qwen's way of making models is inherently counter-productive to adoption. The fact that Qwen has multiple numbered versions and nothing made for one is compatible with any other is not a selling point. If you were going to train loras or fine tunes, you wouldn't go 'let me train it for every new version' you'd go 'let me wait to see which version is the adopted one and then I'll do it' which means that inevitably no one trains anything for it.",

Nvidia's confidence in key players is a major indicator of where this is headed. Trillions a year is being spent on AI and its not making money because its a race for data in modeling by human guinea pig users to get to AGI.\n\nI think if we can get to a dirty AGI that is capable on quantum compute to solve the transformer multiplier issue and go addition only, we might actually see some efficiency gains. But right now? We are just burning cash and electricity.\n\nI am disappointed that users are suffering with the high pricing and discontinued high VRAM models due to the chip pricing around current world issues. This is without talking about power requirements for the growing modular AI factories popping up everywhere.\n\nThe consumer side is getting squeezed. You want a decent GPU for local models? Good luck affording it. You want to use cloud APIs? Hope you got a corporate budget because the pricing is insane for regular people trying to experiment and build. Meanwhile the big labs are hoovering up H100s like there is no tomorrow and venture capital is just throwing money at anything with AI in the pitch deck.\n\nWe are in this weird spot where the technology is advancing faster than anyone can regulate it or even understand the implications. Nobody is asking the hard questions about sustainability, both financially and environmentally. These data centers are pulling power like small cities and the returns are mostly theoretical at this point.\n\nThe whole thing feels like a gold rush where everyone is selling pickaxes and nobody is finding gold yet. Except in this case the pickaxes cost millions and use enough power to run a small country.\n\nI mean no one is talking carbon footprint anymore and global warming ... Ai has blown all that away lol\n\nNote: Nice GEN btw 👌",

Then I got into comfyui, then I started writing my own nodes, then I learned how to train a LoRA and what the process behind that was.\n\nThen I wrote a classification system that uses face recognition to sort images into groups based on who's in the photo - and then grade them based on resolution and sharpness of the face area - this gives me pools of potential LoRA training data. Then I learned how to use Google's APIs to put a name to a face for those groups of images, and then merge islands of image collections that are actually the same person (but perhaps different ages or styles).\n\nSo, gateway into AI and machine learning.",

I then signed up for the Stable Diffusion beta and managed to get invited. When the model and software were first released, they required 6 GB VRAM and I only had a 4 GB card, so I had to wait for someone to implement a low VRAM fix. I started with the Basu Jindal repo. It was very primitive: just the base SD 1.4 model and a simple command line interface. I then switched to A1111 when it started to take off.\n\nOne reason I switched to A1111, apart from the graphical user interface, was that it supported negative prompts. Without it, SD 1.4 and 1.5 would give you lots of nudity regardless of whether you wanted it or not. Many of the anime models that appeared after the NovelAI leak were even worse.",

Saw potential for generating game assets, bought better GPU, tried to come up with (manual) workflows in A1111. ComfyUI came around then. Tried to recreate the workflows in ComfyUI with some success. Stopped using AI (because life). Got back to it at least twice, bought an even better GPU. New models appear to do everything out of the box and my old workflows I worked on are no longer needed.\n\nHaven't used finetunes since SDXL.

After that, I began to realize that AI could also be used to create reference images or even to create objects (without the limitations of Firefly) to cut out in Photoshop and use for compositing.

With basic controls for temperature, max tokens, top-P, etc. \n\nI'd kinda like something like this UI to just run in the background and endlessly generate songs while I work. But I don't want to have to go in and manually type lyrics every time. If you do add an endless mode, to prevent disk wear, maybe have it cache the last N songs in memory (up to like 1024 MB or something, make it configrable), and then have a little button next to the songs on the song list to save it to disk. Allowing you to only save the songs you want. And then just prune any songs pushed out of the cache (FILO) that weren't manually saved pruned from the song list. \n\nAnd then for seamless/gapless playback have it generate 1 (or some other value, also configrable) songs ahead so there's no gaps. And then add song crossfading as an option if you don't have it already. \n\nI can add this feature and submit a PR if it's not something you want to work on. I've done a bit of work with openai and vLLM API interfaces in the past. Though my JS skills aren't super polished. I'm mostly a python, C/C++, and assembly kind of guy (I like reverse engineering).",

Even now I produce music in FL studio, remix it with Suno to add a little more extra to it and to give me a vocalist.\n\nBut for fun, I do prompt some music for the challenge in it.\n\nFor me equally, if there is going to be local gen worthy of cancelling Suno over, it's gotta have that vocalist ability (I know there are some standalone AI vocalist things, but I rather have a one in done shot). I am DYING to be able to train an AI music model as I have some fun things to toss at it. \n\n>I wish a lot of generative AI would focus more on being an asset (like a piece of background music for a video game, or a TV show, or whatever), rather than a standalone piece.\n\nLike these?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltqFda08D6Y\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UWnrVxn9Dk4\n\nLTX2 for video. Suno (Latest v5 model even) for the audio. Instrumental Dark ambient music prompted using some music theory to shape the prompt. Many of my dark ambient tracks to me are more background music for videos, now thanks to comfyUI, I can now put some visualizations around that and am working on some things.\n\nBut I think for any local model to even compete at a non-vocal level it needs to be able to solo instrument ability. People will try to argue that no AI model can do that (even most suno users argue it's not possible), but I can do that all day long in Suno and even enjoy the fight to be able to prompt it. I even publish these following tracks for proof they were generated via prompt only in suno.\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/bIheMysrBnWtm2rE\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/3p35kBh6qpigv9YY\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/84zIw834kpLvWB4C\n\nEven uncanny instrument pairings with only a piano and theremin https://suno.com/s/IToFQB6qL5BvZA57 \n\nWhen the local models can do that, those models can be more idea for video and game use as not everything will require a full band performance.",

          "text": "u/ExcellentTrust4433 Hi, I see in your examples that you're only generating 2-minutes songs. Is this a limitation of the model?. I'm currently using ace-stepsv1\\_3.5b for some projects. But, even though it's supposed to have a 285-second limit, it starts to fail and loses consistency after 2 minutes. Do you know if there have been any improvements in this area?.\n\nAnd how does it compare to HeartMula?. Honestly, if you can't create songs of 3 minutes or more, I'd be extremely disappointed. Ace-Steps's one of my favorite open-source sound tools and I was eagerly awaiting this update.\n\nI'm interested in your answer, because this's important for creating semi-professional audio locally. 😎",

It's also supporting multiple languages too and has a lot of features like audio reference and stuff like that so the model is really powerful.  HeartMula it's better on the the lyrics like i it never did any mistake related to the pronunciation because they have an auto correct feature in the model.\n\nBut in my opinion this Ace-step model it's the best open source model so far.",

Much like the BBC, big media didn't really see the value in even retaining their IP's original recordings, let alone the value in the intellectual property themselves.\n\n...so, it might be the case that enough training data doesn't exceed 2 minutes that it begins to panic a bit.",

Sure, there are richer, more interactive textbooks (more like were; that was a brief blip in history where people had hope in tablets, and started designing textbooks with deep, interactive infographics... it was a vision for the future that never panned out). But what even is critical thinking in this context? Room fell silent and the mood was ICY. Thankfully for Apple, there's an 'assume positive intent' rule in place and I asked a legitimate question, but man did the managers stare daggers into me. Nobody had an answer.\n\nOnly a few short years later, it turned out iPads were frying kids' brains, and companies stopped trying to make useful, creative, and informative apps, and rushed to cash in on addictive, exploitative user interface design. That was one of the most sickening forks in the road of human history that I had the misfortune of bearing firsthand witness to.\n\nBut yeah... This video brought back some memories.",

Then it only has to also beat Flux2 Klein 4B which definitely has a better VAE, trains fast, and has editing native. (9B has a license that will limit community and commercial support).\n\nThey made a great move by releasing Turbo first. If Klien had come out first, and Turbo a couple weeks ago, it wouldn't be as much hype for Z-Image right now. \n\nI would not bet on Z-Image vs Klein right now. They're both full of potential.

There are better models for style transfer now than these common DiT models like Flux klein, Qwen Edit etc. \n\nthen you take all these new extracted frames and feed them into LTX2 sampler and voila.

Qwen was never known for that beyond a small subset, whereas Klein can do far more so this would be even more successful.  Edit: Ok I got it working. For some reason the filename on their lora is 2509, but it barely works with that, giving bad results. Throwing it on qwen edit 2511 and the 2511 4 step lightning lora works great and transfers styles extremely well about 85-90% of the time. It seems some of the ones I tried were a bit tough for it.",

No more choosing between “follows the prompt” and “doesn’t fall apart.”\n\n**More practical fine-tuning + faster inference**  \n**Why you should care:** better behavior on real hardware.\n\nTrainer updates improve memory usage and make fine-tuning more predictable on constrained GPUs.\n\nInference is also faster for video-to-video by downscaling the reference video before cross-attention, reducing compute cost. (Speedup depend on resolution and clip length.)\n\nWe’ve also shipped new ComfyUI nodes and a unified LoRA to support these changes.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nThis drop isn’t a one-off. The next LTX-2 version is already in progress, focused on:\n\n* Better fine detail and visual fidelity (new VAE)\n* Improved consistency to conditioning inputs\n* Cleaner, more reliable audio\n* Stronger image-to-video behavior\n* Better prompt understanding and color handling\n\n[More on what's coming up here.](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/the-road-ahead-for-ltx-2)\n\n# Try It and Stress It!\n\nIf you’re pushing LTX-2 in real workflows, your feedback directly shapes what we build next.

I'd like to throw a chip in for improving the quality of fast-moving action sequences. Technically, why does LTX-2 visual quality deteriorate in such scenes?\n\n2. Also, I've noticed that LTX-2 memory is REALLY short... there are times when the view angle turns or gets momentarily occluded and then something completely different appears. What's going on?\n\nDo you have any suggestions or advice for 1. and 2.?\n\nAgain - a super congratulations is in order to the team on their successful work on this model.",

The quantized weights take up maybe 13-14GB of VRAM. So still a lot, but much less than the existing LTX-2 text encoder nodes, which don't quantize them at all.\n\nSeems to work alright. Only downside is the quantized weights need to be discarded from VRAM after the node is done (rather than simply moved to RAM), as it would otherwise take up too much system RAM. But quantizing the weights only takes a couple seconds.\n\nSo in theory, with this approach, if you can already use the Gemma3 12B model for prompt encoding (which ComfyUI does by passing the prompt embeddings into the forward pass of the model, and then pulling out the weights from the 49 hidden layers, and then combining them and passing them to the embeddings connector model), you can also use it for LLM inference.\n\nAPI-based generation always seems a bit iffy.",

Any checkpoint trained now will have compatibility issues with Loras trained on later previews and might inherit issues that will be solved in later previews. Any good practices researched/discovered now might get outdated in the next versions.\n\nSo yeah, we'll need to wait for the official release, or at least for very late previews.

          "text": "One interesting thing about this model is the architecture it is based on. Nvidia Cosmos Predict 2 was originally an architecture for robotic applications with many optimizations for spatial awareness etc. and they seem to have adapted it for image generation purposes. This could explain the excellent prompt adherence and the significant reduction of prompt bleeding. I would love to read a paper about this u/tdrussell1.  \n  \nIn my tests it performs exceptionally well when explaining the subjects generally in a short introduction sentence and then just dropping the usual booru tags.\n\nHere is Gemini's breakdown of the architecture but I am not sure if this is not partly or completely made up:\n\n>The collaboration between ComfyOrg and Circlestone Labs effectively \"strips out\" the robotics-specific components of Cosmos to build a streamlined, highly efficient text-to-image engine.\n\n>The Anima Architecture Breakdown\n\n>While the core \"Predict-2\" logic handles the physics of light and form, the Anima implementation swaps out several components to optimize for character consistency and prompt adherence:\n\n>Backbone: Cosmos Predict-2 2B (Diffusion Transformer)\n\n>Anima uses the 2-billion parameter version of NVIDIA's DiT. This is the \"sweet spot\" for speed, allowing for near-instant generation on consumer GPUs while maintaining the structural \"common sense\" (object permanence, lighting) that NVIDIA trained into the model.\n\n>Text Encoder: Qwen3-0.6B\n\n>Instead of using the standard T5 or CLIP encoders seen in models like SDXL or Flux, Anima uses a 0.6B parameter Qwen3 model.\n\n>Why this matters: LLM-based encoders (like Qwen) understand complex natural language instructions much better than traditional CLIP models. It can handle long, descriptive \"prose\" prompts without \"losing\" the middle of the sentence.\n\n>Latent Encoding: Qwen VAE\n\n>Anima utilizes a specialized Qwen VAE (Variational Autoencoder). This is a departure from the standard Cosmos video tokenizer.\n\n>By using a VAE tuned for the Qwen ecosystem, the model achieves better reconstruction of fine details (like eyes and hair strands) which are notoriously difficult for the high-compression tokenizers used in video-centric world models.",

While the prompt adherence may be better in some cases, and the manga output's are cool, most people likely are wanting anime screencap quality outputs which this model appears to lack the ability to do well from any example I've seen posted in these Anima threads. It mostly features a lot older styles, fan work styles, etc.\n\nIt's going to need a refiner step, and even then I have my doubts it will be popular.\n\nEDIT: Found this linked one. That said, I might be wrong and it could just be an issue of everyone posting the worst (\\*#$@( examples you can think of instead of quality examples people actually want and will use like this guy actually did: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1qthxyi/comment/o33d2uc/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1qthxyi/comment/o33d2uc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI mean no offense OP, but, not a single modern example is a bit weird. Your post makes it legitimately look like a fanart (deviant art / pixiv / etc.) model rather than an anime model, but you're not even the only one to do this leading to quite a bit of confusion about the new model's capabilities. Alas, the creator didn't post shit, either, except the single worst example screenshot ever looks like its form a flash game back when dial-up was SOTA.",

For example, Civit has a commercial license to run Flux, and they also allow using any of the Flux loras (i.e. commercial use of people's loras). The LTX-2 license has language allowing this also.\n\nThe CircleStone license is basically the Flux license, with several things simplified and removed, and some things clarified. This is one of the things that is clarified. The intention is not to be overly restrictive (except for commercial use), and make it clear that any platform that gets a commercial license can also run all the loras. Again, this is already how it works with many existing models.\n\nThe reason for not using a true open source license, but rather a non-commercial open-weights license, is because I'm just one person and training this thing is extremely expensive. If I can't monetize it, it's the last large finetune I'll ever do. I would like to train an Anima 2 one day, or an Anima Video, but it just isn't viable without having some way to make money. I felt like an open-weights strategy where people can use the model freely but I can make some money off big inference platforms, is the best play.",

I completely understand why a non-commercial license makes sense given the cost of training, and the quality of Anima really shows the work you’ve put into it.\n\nUnless I’m misunderstanding something, my remaining concern is still specific to section 3(c.).\nAs far as I understand it, the FLUX and LTX-2 licenses don’t include an automatic grant of rights over user-created LoRAs back to the licensor. In those ecosystems, commercial use of community LoRAs is usually handled through platform Terms of Service, rather than through the base model license itself, at least to my knowledge. Please correct me here if I’m wrong.\n\nBy contrast, 3(c.) appears to give any commercial licensee the right to use all Derivatives regardless of where they’re published, with an explicit waiver of creator compensation. Since LoRAs and fine-tunes are defined as Derivatives, this removes the creator’s ability to decide whether, how, or by whom their Derivatives are commercially used, even though they themselves are not allowed to use them commercially.\n\nI understand the motivation of avoiding per-LoRA negotiations for licensed platforms, but as written this could make people hesitant to invest serious compute into fine-tuning.\n\nThanks again for engaging openly on this. Looking forward to seeing where Anima goes!",

It wasn’t explicitly trained for it, but I’m glad to hear it’s flexible.

It seems to ignore the tag count.  Try it. pretty cool.

          "text": "Hey there! Original poster here.\n\nOkay, so in good faith, I thank you for taking on this challenge. :) Now, onto the results.\n\nFirst, the GOOD.\n\nYou definitely got better results than I did. I looked at your workflow and that's quite a bit of extra that needs to be done to get \"marginally\" improved results. But they **are** improved, so I'll give you that. And I'll give credit where credit is do.\n\nNow, onto the BAD.\n\nThe original claim that I made to you in our discussion was that LTX-2 cannot handle complex animation. While this is definitely improved, it **failed the test.**\n\nHere's the original prompt that I gave you:\n\n>Charred buildings in the background. Flames flicker. Smoke rises into the night. In the center, a large grey Transformer holds a glowing purple cube. Behind him, three triangle-shaped jets soar off screen. He starts talking, then walks forward, still holding the glowing purple cube.\n\nI even said prompt whatever you like because I'm interested in the end results.\n\nSo how did it fail?\n\nBecause you **cheated**. And I think I know *why* you cheated. ;)\n\nFirst of all, the sides of the image are cut off. At first glance, I thought you did this because LTX-2 has issues w/aspect ratio. One of Wan's strengths over ltx is that it can work with a much larger range of aspect ratio. Then, I noticed something...\n\nThe **smoke**. When Megatron walks forward, the smoke behind him isn't moving. Nor is the smoke to the left of the image that you cut off.\n\nSo, I think you deliberately contaminated the experiment by cutting off the sides of the image in order to pass the test. But the test is failed because you did not achieve the results expected from the prompt. The prompt specifically says \"smoke rises into the night\".\n\nTherefore, it's a **fail**.\n\nI can admit it looks better, and there's definitely more motion. It's WAY better than my results.  But it still fails to capture the instructions. And resizing the image isn't the solution.\n\nNow, let's move onto my theory of why LTX-2 struggles with animation.\n\nMy theory is that LTX-2 is heavily trained on western children's animation, or more specifically what animators call **2D flash animation**. It's a more \"modern\", cheaper method that is used quite a lot in western children's cartoons found on Cartoon Network. This clip you posted looks even worse than that, more like 2D skeletal animation/ paper doll animation. The characters' movement looks more like warping than actual animation. Or, they have a more...liquid/fluid style of movement.\n\nWan on the other hand looks more like **traditional** 2D animation - of the likes found in action cartoons from the 80s - 00s. My theory is that Wan, which originated in Asia, was most likely trained on Anime or Asian-influenced animation. Many western action cartoons from the 80s to today were actually animated by Japan or Korea house animation. This is why Wan can do it better.\n\nAnd why LTX-2 animations look really bad...if you're into traditional 2d animation.\n\nI plan on doing another post on this soon, so I'll go into more detail at that time w/examples because this comment has already gotten pretty long.\n\nThat said, thanks a bunch for tackling the challenge. This was fun! I'll mention your thread in my new post and address your claims there. This is a fun battle, because everyone wins in the end. :D\n\nThanks for the workflow!\n\nGWX",

You are moving the goalposts so you can claim \"it's a fail\", even though I, as you admit, \"got WAY better results\".\n\nThis is also without using any of the animation-oriented LTX2 LORAs.\n\nBut, whatever. I have zero interest getting into a tit for tat, nit picking and moving goalposts so each can claim a \"fail\" or \"pass\". My original point stands: LTX2 is difficult to use correctly, and you can get WAY better results when using it better (and frankly, I personally find it a far more capable model than WAN for many reasons listed).",

But does it animate like traditional **western** animation? For example, 90s Disney, Dreamworks, Ralph Bakshi, Hanna Barbera, that style? I haven't seen any indication of it. I don't know if that's in its training data - it's not a highly popular animation style to eastern audiences, at least not more than anime.\n\nIf that's what you're talking about, I agree that I've not seen any evidence of it doing that particular style.  So it **can** do traditional eastern style animation, but the jury's still out on if can do traditional western animation.\n\nRE: the rotoscope/cgi look - which I abhor - it definitely leans to that too much. I don't think it's necessarily due to the human training, but possibly its animation training data. A lot of recent anime use that technique, especially more recent chinese animation.\n\nThat said, it can be avoided, but it's challenging to do out of the box. I've done a lot of testing and even though I can get around it mostly, the cost is high step count, which = time. It's time consuming.\n\nBTW, I hate that look. Traditional animator here, so my initial interest in Wan was trying to figure out how to add it to my pipeline.",

Low frame rates look worse talking though, because fast lip movements are harder to generate at low frame rates.\n\nSecond: This might not be the best place for troubleshooting, perhaps head over to the LTX-Merges discussion area where you can paste your workflow configuration. If I recall correctly, the workflow is already configured for the \"first to last frame\" configuration.\n\nThird: I put my recommendation in this post, \"lcm\", and I only have 1 stage. I just personally prefer 1 stage and I didn't feel the need to run a second, because I was getting good results with just 1 (and it greatly simplified the workflow, making it easier to debug quality issues). Your mileage may vary here and I'm not against 2 stages if you feel it works best.",

Where did the fixed sigma values come from? If I want to increase the steps, for example to 20 steps, how should I adjust the numbers? Is it a particular curve that is being used to derive the values? What about the normalization values? It seems, video is just to add more 1s, but what about the audio that goes, 1,1,0.25, over and over? should I just repeat those until I get to 20? Edit>> google ai says that the manual steps is an S-Curve. should I just extrapolate the same s-curve in 20 steps? But what of the normalization?\n2. You mention some of the lora's you used, but when I use those lora's I don't get the same results. There are so many different safetensors, and distributions, which ones exactly did you use? I would love to be able to experiment by adding and subtracting different loras. I found the ic i2v adapter lora, which makes a difference, but I would also like to generate without distillation, because the lighting seems to change when I use a distillation workflow.\n3. Why did you choose to do 24 fps and use rife to get to 48 fps, instead of directly generating in 48fps?\n4. so you said you don't like the latent upscalers from LTX, because of artifacts? Have you heard if anyone is working on improving them? I'mg guessing you haven't, or else you would have included them in your workflow. once I master this base layer, I can explore the upscalers on my own, so that I can see exactly what you are talking about.\n\nThank you again for your contributions, and advice. I was having ok generations before coming here, but exploring what you have done, will definitely help me make things even better.",

I have a special merging script that does a better job merging stuff together. I have shared this script on my Huggingface if you want to try it yourself. The easy answer is just to use my merge and workflow.\n\n3. Because interpolating to 48fps is faster than generating twice as many frames. Quality would be far better generating 48fps directly, though.\n\n4. Eh, I built this workflow from scratch and I was trying to avoid 2 stages. The upscalers are likely better for the 2-stage approach where the artifacts are mostly resolved in the 2nd stage.\n\nAlso, thank you and you are welcome!",

Many people would just try and not use it again until months later because that's stuff is frustrating. \n\n\nSo yeah, at least to some extent a botched release. \nGreat model that will definitely improve but yeah, a shame that wasn't done a bit better. \nAlso, I don't quite understand the sfw only strategy for this model because obviously models like Wan succeeded a lot because horny nerds were doing work. Here it's not the case and training that stuff is now very difficult since the model doesn't know what genitalia are apparently. Not that I've tried training but browsing through Civitai I can see what the Loras produce and it's pretty bad lol. So yeah, the potential for faster development was also there but thr company prefered to be on the safe side I guess and only train sfw stuff. \n\n\nAnd the releases just seem a bit weird to Mr. \"here you have this\". Where? No link, no nothing. Just go figure it out by yourself. Which of course people will but it's not the most enjoyable experience. \nIf you release something make sure to provide guidance, links, workflows etc. \n\n\nI hope LTX-2 kicks Wan in thr ass in the future for turning a bit on the open source community :) Although they did give us a great model for which I'm grateful as well so I'm not how to feel about that betrayal. ",
