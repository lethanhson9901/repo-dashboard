However, the solution is the lack of a LoRa for hands, object and person focus, feet, faces, and human anatomy. I say this because I saw the first LoRas in Civitai and I'm surprised by how much they improve in several of the aspects I mentioned.\n\nAlso, the best clip I've seen with complex scenes is the one uploaded by the user with an RTX 6000 Pro: [reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1q9cy02/ltx2\\_i2v\\_quality\\_is\\_much\\_better\\_at\\_higher/](http://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1q9cy02/ltx2_i2v_quality_is_much_better_at_higher/), but it was created at extremely high resolutions that can't be reproduced on consumer hardware. Even so, it's not perfect, but it looks much better than this example in this clip.\n\nI know everyone loves nsfw LoRas because they create adult content, but I wish they could also create generic LoRas. I would create them, but it's impossible without the necessary datasets and the right hardware. I hope the community can help. It's not their obligation, But it would allow many of us to use this model Professionally! 🤗\n\nAnd I hope that Ltx-2 will make improvements with an upscaler since it's the king of OEMs...",

The distortion's minimal, with a quality similar to Wan2.2 including background sharpness.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem with LTX-2's with distant shots: it doesn't focus well and distorts people, objects, and especially hands at the resolutions used by those of us with more modest hardware. I say this because the A6000 costs more than a SUV.\n\nThe most stable shots with LTX-2're close-ups, where the subjects're more visible and the distance to the background isn't as large.\n\nI know many people don't like comparisons, but I often work with distant shots, and there's not much that can be done about it. Besides, it's unavoidable because they're currently the two best video generators, and many of us, like myself, don't need audio in some projects!😉",

It looks complicated and can be pretty intimidating at first, but if you give it a chance, after a few weeks it’ll start to make sense without much trouble.\n\nThere are tons of tutorials there, although a lot has changed since then. ComfyUI looks different now, the models used in those tutorials are already outdated, and some of them aren’t really used anymore because we have much better models today.\n\nThat said, it’s still worth watching because it explains very clearly what does what and how the tool works overall.\n\nGood luck!",

For loops I mean characters don't go away or if the do they come back later and the background doesn't change (little to no camera movement).\n\nSo far, my experiments gave me scenes where the character executes similar actions twice, which is not desirable I imagine. For example, the cat girl jumps into the water, swims, gets up of the water, looks at the screen, maybe talks, then jumps into the water again, swimming and getting out in a different place, hiding into the vegetation. It's a complete sequence, but where the character executes similar actions twice. In one occasion the character, instead of jumping to a different place in the water, returns to the water before swimming in a different direction. These sequences were 18 seconds long.\n\nI haven't done many attempts and I'm mostly using the prompt you provided. I need to keep investigating if I can make a sequence where there is constant movement forward without repetition. For what I noticed, your video is a short sequence that happens slowly, where I'm getting fast sequences when more stuff happens. I need a way to reduce the speed of the character movements in order to repeat your results. Based on that, this workflow seems useful to make short videos where little happens, but still see no evidence that it can help to make long videos (more than 30 seconds lets say) with multiple diverse actions. Highly useful, but not for making continuous videos I'm afraid, based on what I can see.",

For example, give it the last 8 frames of clip1 and the first 8 frames of clip2 and it can generate transition frames that make the motion look smooth and natural instead of the abrubt and jerky motion you sometimes get when stitching clips together.\n\nVACE is actually much more powerful than I've described, but this is a common use case for it.\n\n[Wan VACE Clip Joiner](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pnygiw/release_wan_vace_clip_joiner_v20_major_update/) (disclaimer: my workflow)",

It helps a lot with things that are extremely challenging today, such as strong consistency (characters, environments, etc), temporal coherence, and controlled extensions. It works like an in-painting system with motion-control preprocessors, using masks to achieve very specific results.\n\nIn this example image, I use it to modify the character’s hand. Combining SAM3, VACE, and several other tools, like SVI, is what truly makes open source stand out against closed-source solutions, though it does require time and patience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5nm5o63kuag1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442b5e501fbf987f29490af03e1cf051d5d92a2",

Even the closed source models are really unreliable in generation\n\n\nWhenever you see someone's video that \"looks finished\" they probably had to gen that thing 20 times to get what they wanted, and that's just one chunk of the video, most have many chunks. If you are paying for an online service that's a lot of wasted \"credits\" just burning on nothing\n\n\nI want to like doing video and want to think it's going to allow people to make stories but it just not good enough, not easy enough to use, too unpredictable, and too slow right now.

In the case of avatar, what you see on screen is the result of hundreds of hours of artist work time, discussion and dailies which have resulted in a collaborative creative effort which is refined and refined and refined and then tested and then refined again. \n\nAI predicts, selects and outputs. Meaning is not part of the creative process, it is retroactively inferred by the viewer or prompter but was not part of the decision process. What AI generates is inherently incestuous, it’s why you see so many things on this sub like this OP - it’s someone else’s idea, rebundled.\n\nAI gestures towards meaning without being responsible for it. That’s why I’d like to see people use it more intentionally, creating things that can be critiqued on their own merit and not as knock offs. Is that possible with training? I don’t see how. You can’t teach AI classicism and then use it to discover Impressionism. That takes creativity rooted in experience, something AI doesn’t have.",

This week, we did a full open-source release of LTX-2, including weights, code, a trainer, benchmarks, LoRAs, and documentation.\n\nOpen releases of multimodal models are rare, and when they do happen, they’re often hard to run or hard to reproduce. We built LTX-2 to be something you can actually use: it runs locally on consumer GPUs and powers real products at Lightricks.\n\n**I’m here to answer questions about:**\n\n* Why we decided to open-source LTX-2\n* What it took ship an open, production-ready AI model\n* Tradeoffs around quality, efficiency, and control\n* Where we think open multimodal models are going next\n* Roadmap and plans\n\nAsk me anything!   \nI’ll answer as many questions as I can, with some help from the LTX-2 team.  \n  \n*Verification:*\n\n[Lightricks CEO Zeev Farbman](https://preview.redd.it/3oo06hz2x4cg1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c3764327c90a1af88b7e056084ed2ac8f87c60b)\n\n\n\n>The volume of questions was beyond all expectations! Closing this down so we have a chance to catch up on the remaining ones.\n>\n>Thanks everyone for all your great questions and feedback. More to come soon!",

Not just \"generate video from prompt\" - actual rendering with inputs like depth, normals, motion vectors, outputting to compositing pipelines, VFX workflows, animation tools, game engines.  \n  \nThat's dozens of different applications and integration points. Static APIs can't cover it. And much of this needs to run on edge - real-time previews on your machine, not waiting for cloud roundtrips.  \nSo open weights is the only way this actually works. We monetize through licensing and rev-share when people build successful products on top (we draw the line at $10M revenue). You build something great, we share in the upside. If you're experimenting or under that threshold - it's free.  \n  \nPlus, academia and the research community can experiment freely. Thousands of researchers finding novel applications, pushing boundaries, discovering things we'd never think of. We can't hire all the smart people, but we can give them tools to build on.",

This is on brand new comfy install and following recommendations.\n\nSo far the biggest issue apart from varying quality is i2v regularly seems to refuse to do much with the image. Despite good prompting it does stupid stuff like have motionless character and face moves only after a bit or it literally hard cuts immediately and pretty much ignores the input image which completely defeats the point of i2v!?\n\nI have faith the community will squeeze a lot out of this and its early days but im waiting for initial excitement to fade so we can see the actual reality of it. I'm having some doubt it will live up to expectations but hopeful if your team/community can overcome some of the frustrating issues, especially as its the only half decent audio model we've seen.\n\nIf a prompt is ran there should always be some decent motion and progression, it must make use fully of the input image each gen at least otherwise it becomes less desirable to run despite the speed. Wan pretty consistently outputs something decent where ltx2 currently is failing here. I want it to be great but something really needs to be done about this?",

The number of people prepared to do local video gen is tiny compared to the size of the potential commercial market, so no need to cut those guys off by locking down your models.\n\nHaving said that, I’d personally be ok paying for early access to the newest models. I know some here will hate me for saying that but we need to make sure companies like yours will be profitable so why not offer a mid way house where you guys can make money from early access but it’ll become available for all at some point too. After all, you are offering a great product that deserves to make money.",

And, to everyone’s benefit, it consequently supports small creators and the open-source community, which is ultimately the essential component: the one that tests every possible scenario and implements new tools for the entire ecosystem.\n\nI truly hope this business model remains sustainable and continues to be upheld by Lightricks.

I'm asking this just out of curiosity.\n​\nThe Qwen team recently released a model, Qwen-Image-Edit-Layered. Although it seemed like an early iteration with limited local performance, the concept of decomposing generation into layers for targeted edits is a clever approach for precise control.\n​\nI understand that LTX-2 isn't primarily targeted as an editing model, but do you think it would be possible for video models to adopt a similar layered format in generation?\n\n​Since LTX-2 already generates synced audio and video, would it be possible to add additional video streams that target specified regions of the frame (spatial layers)?\n​\nOn that note, do you think it will be possible to support an Alpha Channel in LTX? If the model supported transparency, generation could potentially be split into layers manually via a clever workflow and recombined at the output stage.\n\n​Thank you again for your contribution.",

Open is the only architecture that makes sense at the moment.  \n  \nThe other lesson: research community moves faster than any internal team.

I found that LTXV didn't have as many LoRAs and even official implementations for things like VACE, LTXV didn't have docs or examples like WAN does.\n\nI've also seen comments saying that LTX has hidden features like video inpainting, video outpainting, temporal outpainting, etc. but had to be coded manually since there is a lack of nodes for it.\n\nI hope LTX2 will get more attention, the results seem amazing.

We wanted real-time previews, consumer hardware deployment, endless iteration. Had to build it ourselves.  \n  \nOn differentiation - any tech advantage erodes over time. Model architecture, data, efficiency gains will get replicated. What compounds is ecosystem. Game engines are the inspiration again - Unity and Unreal aren't winning because of pure tech superiority, you can probably get a talented team that will write better core renderer, but that's not the game there anymore. They win because of community, tooling, integrations, content libraries.  \n  \nThat might be the sustainable moat. Over 2-3 years, the ecosystem will matter. That said, it's still early days of Gen-AI as a rendering engine, time will tell where the value will land.",

Mainly I'd like to block out scenes and animate them in 3D software so I can \"render them out\" like you say here with a video model, but I haven't been able to achieve acceptable results yet with what's out there. SCAIL and Wan Animate both have not produced a good enough result for me even with finetuning when it comes to controlling the output motion (it's great for fun, but not for any actual shot production yet, even with high quality input data like motion vectors, OpenPose renderings, depth renderings, etc).",

I'm also convinced we're heading down a path of inverse rendering and a neural rendering engine, baking more intrinsics (from depth and normals, to full light transport) into the manifold. Equivariance priors in the manifold are also extremely interesting, and seem very effective!\n\nIn pixel space, have you considered using the OKLAB colour space so the colour difference formula in your loss function more closely matches human perception? I haven't seen anyone try this yet. It would be a small perceptual gain and nudge the latent space to closer align with human perception, allocate greater resolution in luminosity than hue or chroma. A far better approach than the terrible 4:2:0 (and less bad 4:2:2) sub sampling in the vast majority of the training data, which is rarely considered or mitigated properly.",

Infinite seamless video, yes, \"INFINITE\", was a pain in the ass to achieve nevertheless as it required some weird concatenation with another library, but it was seamless, however standard generation was still better and higher quality, and by infinite I mean with the same resources.\n2. Long video.\n3. Video inpainting, video outpainting, temporal outpainting, temporal inpainting, spaciotemporal outpanting and inpainting, you get the idea.\n4. High control, you could use frames to control movement; you did this by using LTX with Qwen image edit to make keyframes.\n5. Speed control, as in to control the speed of movement it was nevertheless very finicky.\n6. Canny, pose and depth control; Canny was so good, you could achieve full control.\n\nA lot of the features were deep inside the code, it was because you had to work in latent space; you had to load latents and save latents and latent this and latent that, quickly I had gigabytes worth of latents.\n\nThe only thing that WAN did better was that it was superior on its movement consistency, less morphing less weird effects, but LTX gave you control.\n\nIf LTX2 is also like LTX then, LTX has the flexibility, but the reality is that it is hidden, because they dont want to compete with themselves.",

I was using Veo and Wan for the latter mostly. And still they are not 100% AI generated most use photos as input, static image overlay etc. None of them are \"actual videos with a story\" even if they are as long as 2 or 3 minutes, so you will get nothing like this from me, sorry.\n\nBTW Veo is hit or miss... frequently it's a miss (so it burns tokens quickly) but when it hits oh, it hits! Wan is so-so for my purposes and I couldn't generate at least 10s videos properly (I didn't tried SVI yet). Audio+Video is a killer feature for me (for LEGO videos it doesn't matter if the audio is perfect).In LTX-2 it's good enough when it comes to dialogue, however model struggles with music or singing. Wan 2.2 has non of this goodness anyway.\n\nWith current speed and quality I can add LTX-2 to my toolset replacing around 50% of Veo generations and 100% of Wan (at last!) I think.\n\nA few non-cherry picked/first-try t2v examples I just generated for this comment (720p 20-35s, 1920p 20s - although generating it took like 10 minutes and it's probably better to stick with 720p and upscale it): [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBtfBBQxSjT9X8GKf6Rvzs76hz\\_hC6Xa?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBtfBBQxSjT9X8GKf6Rvzs76hz_hC6Xa?usp=sharing)\n\n**35s seems to be a limit for fp8 model on my hardware.** I tried a few 40s clips and it OOMed at me.\n\nI2V is slower than T2V but well, that is expected... And **Detailer LoRA bumps quality (alot)** but it's so slow.\n\nPS: Also I don't quite get people who state that Wan 2.2 is more flexible than LTX-2 - first of all LTX-2 was just released model and fine-tunes of Wan 2.2 and alot of LoRAs already exist. It will change quickly I suppose as LTX-2 came with LoRA training tools. Second - those who state it - did you guys actually tried to prompt it as per the official guide? It makes a lot of difference. So yeah, just like Flux replaced SDXL in a matter of weeks - same will go for Wan vs LTX-2 I guess...",

Would you do the same for anime character? Generate multi angles for a given character and then train a Lora for it if you were to re-use it across scenes?\nThat's first question, second is voice :) I guess whatever voice ltx generated you could either clone the voice and use it from a different tool for prompts or maybe train a voice Lora in ltx-2,  I think it's possible. \n\n\nHow did you go about doing it here for these 2 topics? ",

But.... when it comes to prompting and getting each to give me what I want from a text prompt (starting with an image), they're both woefully difficult.  Sometimes you get something you like but rarely do you get what you specifically asked for.  When I started using AI for video and images a few years ago, it was just as difficult to get a character to do something seemingly simple like walking through a door entering a room as it is today so while the quality of the video and the processing/rendering speed have really improved, I'm not so sure the output and control of the output has improved at nearly the same rate.",

While its T2V performance is decent, T2V is mostly usable for experimentation or casual play and is very hard to turn into real productivity. In practice, the truly useful part should be I2V, but what we actually see is that its I2V output is basically limited to talking avatars, with extremely constrained motion. From a productivity standpoint, this is essentially meaningless. The model requires a large amount of fine-tuning to achieve acceptable and reliable outputs. In the V2V domain, the gap between its ControlNet and Wan Animate is still very obvious. I believe that such heavy censorship is very unfriendly to the open-source community. Similar to what happened with Flux, increasing the difficulty for the community to this extent will ultimately be detrimental to the development of the model’s ecosystem.",

          "text": "Wow, great work, I'm glad the workflow I made is working out for you, but Kijai definitely deserves the credit for creating the initial i2v workflow on the distilled model (8 steps LCM simple) that accepts an uploaded sound file. \n\nI've done a LOT of testing with that workflow over the past few days and for \"real\" persons I can say it's NOT a good workflow. If you start with a realistic person photo, the face typically distorts into plasticky/waxy skin and start to all look alike unless the anatomy of the face was really distinctive. The body will distort quite a bit as well and any skin details in the image either get distorted or completely lost.\n\nThat being said, this workflow is fantastic for Animated 3D CGI looking images like the one you used. \n\nFor realistic image i2v using a submitted audio file, I've actually switched to the latest Wan2GP using Pinokio. The latest version of Wan2GP does fantastic, it has some really improved memory handling and I can do 720p videos 20seconds long with lip sync on a 4090 and 64gb system RAM. \n\nOn both Wan2GP and the ComfyUI workflow referenced in this post, it's super important to use the static camera lora if you want to get videos working on Portrait images. I'll update my original wokflow to include a download link to that lora and where to plug it in.",

I CANNOT get stuff like that with LTX because it has been trained to strive for realism and not hallucinatory. And sometimes my crazy prompts will actually work with LTX but the comparison to WAN is night and day. One looks like a complete fever dream of visuals you have never seen before the other looks like a vague appropriation of that prompt using humans and scenes you have seen 100 times. So to try and flex on WAN like this is just eye rolling to me considering WAN is still the better model I would use for more creative and new unseen visuals and I will wait however long it takes for that to happen. Watch the video again and ask yourself honestly... Is ANYTHING in that video something you have not seen before in some kind of capacity? Yes.

Open source project can live forever with small amount of money, but non-commercial licensed projects are short-term\n\nAlso you say like commercial usage is something evil. But commercial usage doesn't damage community at all, because who wants to run it locally - they can. But it gives ability for people with no GPU to run models for cheap. Also it's an issue of who controls the code and the model. As an open source developer myself, I don't receive money for it, but I will never contribute for a project that is not open. Not because I want to sell it, but because I want to know that my contribution is free (freedom). Nobody will work knowing that they are helping another company to essentially improve their closed source project. A lot of open source projects live because of small contributors. AI is not an exception",

The person you are replying to bang angry on keyboard, sat back and waited for the karma for being the smart one in the room.\n\nThis is misinformation in it's purest form.  (missing info)",

He has a regular, fit build, athletic and healthy but not overly muscular, with natural proportions. He is wearing a yellow long-sleeve superhero suit made of high-tech tactical material, form-fitting yet flexible, with a subtle reflective sheen. The suit is divided into segmented panels with slightly raised ridges and subtle armor-like padding along the shoulders, chest, and torso, giving structure without bulk. Micro-texture patterns cover the fabric, and mesh ventilation panels run under the arms and along the sides for functionality and detail. The sleeves extend fully to the wrists beneath the gloves, with slight contouring along the arms and forearms to suggest natural muscle tone and movement. The top of the outfit features a flat white band-style collar with a short functional zipper at the front.\n\nThe belt portion of the suit is black, seamlessly integrated into the overall outfit, with a round yellow buckle that matches the suit’s fabric. The crotch area of the suit is reinforced with subtle paneling and slightly thicker material, designed to smooth the silhouette naturally without showing any anatomical bulge. He wears red gloves that extend up his forearms, worn over the sleeves, made from reinforced flexible material with visible seams, subtle texturing, and tactical paneling to match the suit. His red boots are made from the same material as the gloves, with paneling, reinforced areas, and subtle wear, designed to complement the suit’s high-tech aesthetic.\n\nThe cape is white, modernized to match the tactical aesthetic of the suit: made of slightly stiffer, high-tech fabric with subtle paneling and tonal texturing, cut to fall naturally from the shoulders but maintaining shape without billowing excessively. It integrates seamlessly with the shoulder design of the suit, giving a functional, cohesive appearance.\n\nHe is walking down an abandoned part of the city, holding two brown paper grocery bags, one in each hand. The environment is desolate and run-down, featuring cracked pavement, broken windows, graffiti, scattered debris, and empty, deteriorating buildings. His expression is famously blank and emotionless, and he is not looking at the camera instead, he gazes off into the distance, seemingly without a thought in the world. His posture is relaxed and casual, walking naturally through the abandoned street. Lighting is soft but slightly directional, emphasizing the textures of the suit, cape, and environment, highlighting micro-texture, paneling, and armor lines, while maintaining photorealistic realism and a slightly moody, deserted atmosphere.",

I have 96GB RAM. Using fp8 distilled LTX model. But the full version also runs well (3x longer though) and seems better for more complex prompts.\n\nCaveat - I removed upscaler because not worth wasting time on upscaling until I have picked the best generated video out of a bunch. So, the sharpness will not be the best. But you can add upscaler back if you prefer.\n\nAlso not using their Gemma text encoder model - it's huge and mega slow, often ends up swapping to disk. I use Gemma quants from Unsloth.\n\nWan2.2 still wins in situations with more complex prompts. For example, I just cannot make LTX generate a horror scene with man biting another person in the neck. They end up kissing or eating spaghetti or something else creepy.",

Yep, 100% intentional to avoid what I described above.\n\nThere's a limited use case for this workflow especially since I'm using the static camera loras to help trigger videos. You just pointed out the other limitation - which is that it works best for single dialogue and music with one strong vocal track. \n\nI would still try your other singers and see if it works by descriptive prompting and even putting in the lyrics in the prompt. I just haven't experimented enough with it yet.",

For 20s, it's between 6-8 minutes on my system and I think that's a great sweet spot. Plus, with a static camera lora, the video just becomes uninteresting focused on one shot for that long. I feel this workflow is limited to being just one tool for a nice close up or portrait of a lip sync shot for either music or dialogue.   \n  \nA lot of people use iterations per second as a performance measurement but for me I think a more useful statistic to mention would be: How many seconds does it take to produce 1s of video at resolution X and overall video length Y - hopefully that makes sense. \n\nI'm fine with producing videos in short chunks from 5s to 20s and then stitching them together later and even going back and adding higher quality dialogue/music in the post process. This is just an opinion, but  I don't think a video model really needs to be able to do videos longer than 20s. With wan 5-8seconds was definitely too short, but LTX-2 does really well between 10s-20s on most hardware and I think that's fantastic especially since it includes audio or the ability to have lip synced external audio.",

Someone took a Wan SVI workflow and adopted the methods of feeding in the last 4 frames from the previous video into the next video so the \"motion\" is preserved. Honestly though, a 90 second video of a relatively still person framed is a little artistically \"boring\" so that's why I cut to different singers when I splice together. Or use Nano Banana or Qwen Edit to generate different angles/views or different costumes/clothing of the singer and then cut to those.\n\nAt that point, you really need a video editor to splice it all together or get very lucky/precise with FFMPEG. This is only 1 tool for LTX-2, I'm sure newer ones or better ones will come along. I'm just glad there's a way to get a decent quality by messing with the distill lora strength in the upscaler which is really the point of this video - to show quality improvement from literally 1 little setting in the workflow.",

So ideally it should come with benefits. But it doesn't because there is nothing gained except 'cleaning up'... but a well laid out workflow with a user familiar with comfyui will find it easier to get used to nodes, than all the get/set which is obfuscating the process employed.\n\nI agree it can look messy, but it's just part and parcel of node based workflows. But it's hugely readable.\nYou can click any node on the board and see where it links to, and where links come in from.\nYou can then go straight to them in moments. You can click the wire and drop in new nodes.\n\n\nWith any tool you want to remove stuff you don't need. But we NEED the wires. They give us a lot of useful information in a visual way very simply.\nGet/set hides the information, hides the link, hides where else it's used.\n\n\nPerhaps if ComfyUI had tools to manage get/set so you could click a set, and the gets that are linked flashed or something to get your attention easily (like wires), then fine.\nBut they don't.\n\n\nLay it out well with the node links visible. Show your working and play to the strengths of the node based workflow.\nHiding it plays to it's weaknesses and without replacing those revealed weaknesses with nothing better you're just creating worse work.\n\nAt no point do you hide the wires, unless you want to make your life hell when you come back to a project a year or two later!\n\n\nI suppose I should be grateful things are spread out a bit and the get/set aren't hidden under the larger nodes haha. Those are dreadful.\n\n\nHonestly, good work. And carry on doing what you do if that's what you like to do. Just sayin' :D",

A Q6 GGUF  is smarter. It may have only 6 bits for most weights, but it uses block level scaling to use those bits effectively, and some entire (smaller but important) tensors may use fp8, fp16 or even fp32 precision. Because of these things the average bit depth for a Q6 GGUF is about 6.5 bits per weight.",

GGUF is closer to fp16 side by side. The only benefit of fp8 is that it is faster on cards with FP8 tensor cores.\n\nBetter explanation:  \nFP8 is just FP8 but Q6 uses fp16 or even fp32 precision for quality critical tensors. It's a much smarter way of quanting. And fp8 scaled is basically just a way to try and \"translate\" some of said tensors for sake of speed (using fp8 cores) but it still is a loss in quality due to the translation as precision is lost. That is why GGUFs are slower. They DONT downcast those into fp8.",

LTX-render 1280x720 took 140seconds.\nWAN2.2 video is ONE SHOT. It got the prompt right *immediately*. And it's not slow mo. Took 100 seconds. And all I would need to do is detail upscale it. Because LTX-2 actually renders at 1/2 res and then upscales, I set WAN to render at 640x536. At the res, with speed up loras its just as fast at LTX-2. Sure, ok then I'd have to upscale it . Big deal since it GETS THE PROMPT RIGHT.(I already interpolated to 32fps in WAN)\nThe biggest flaw of LTX is the entirely bad prompt following. Yes I've written books. It doesn't help. It simply doesn't understand many things.\n\nYou might say \"well in WAN 2.2 she's not really lifting it right\" .

I work for movie/ads industry.\nCongrats on the awesome work!\n\nWe have actually never needed this yet for movies or ads, because the whole creation process includes several expertises, while usually we start working only with reference images or collages or storyboards; your technique looks like the best controlnet yet without being a controlnet, amazing work. \n\nIt’s suited for cases “transform this into X” kind of workflows, we have not yet met a director or production company interested in this process, plus now we handle everything with edit models, but this would have been gold to have 1 year ago, we used lots of controlnets back then. \n\nLately we have seen a shift in big international clients, a sad one: if a few months ago we were given total freedom because the clients knew they were ignorant, now most marketing people have created a “logo” (lars mueller brockmann is revolting in his coffin) on ChatGPT and they think are not ignorant anymore, the clients are now used to lots of super cheap slaves from overseas which produce tons of indecent outputs; then they come to us because they got cheap work for cheap pay, but they still ant tons of outputs, therefore instead of 4-5 well thought and curated and post processed images we are forced to give 100-200 variations per day or they make our life hell. \n\nOne thing which would be super useful is if your method can work with a certain tunable freedom, kinda like denoise or vace strength or controlnet strength. In that case could it be used for upscaling? \n\nProper upscaling is still something highly needed, tiled creative upscaling often ends up in artifacts and repetead elements if you are using the prompt that described the whole image, or weird artifacts and misinterpretations if using a single general “8K, high-quality, expensive production, HDR..” prompt, or too low modifications if done in low denoise. Manually prompting tiles is unfeasible. Right now there is no really good tiled controlnet neither for flux nor wan, zimage or qwen, it’s the best tool for tiled creative upscales and the SDXL one is still the best, could your method improve tiled upscaling? For example using TTP nodes? \n\nThe tool we use the most is absolutely Wan Vace 2.1. Fun Vace 2.2 is not able to interpolate so it is absolutely useless, sadly. If your method could be included in the possible salads we give as control videos (bits missing, bits with depth maps, bits with pose) that would be amazing. \n\nThe tools in the industry we would like to have the most at the moment and do not exist yet are \n\n1) Fp4 Wan 2.2 \n2) FP4 LTX2 Vace official (not a trash FUN version)\nand \n3) Some way to make a creative highly denoised tiled upscale which operates by rendering tiles (so it’s quick and low vram) but “knowing” the whole image and considering the prompt conditioning accordingly.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for asking how a tool would be useful for actual work, we need more great brains asking what the professionals actually need, most of tools are cool but good only for fun-indie projects intellectually based on a model instead of a production workflow, thanks for creating the space to do it.",

Flux 2 dev (even with turbo) still beats it on all the little text bits in this prompt, but this still looks awesome aside from that. prompt: A highly advanced gynoid assassin unit designated \"YUKI-7\" stands in the rain-slicked back alleys of Osaka's Shinsekai district at 2AM, her pristine white ceramic helmet gleaming under flickering neon signs advertising pachinko parlors and izakayas, the kanji \"零\" (zero) etched in crimson across her faceplate as raindrops streak down its seamless surface. Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

An optional upscale with SeedVR2 (default settings) adds about 5 seconds but in my opinion it makes the image even more \"AI-ish\".\n\n* skin still looks unrealistically smooth/plastic/AI look/blurry, Z-image-turbo gives comparable if not better results with 9 steps\n* even when requesting a woman I would sometimes get a man\n* 04 steps lora does not seem to work with GGUF\n* 40 steps takes 64 seconds\n* 24 steps takes 38 seconds, changes to facial structure, result is fairly comparable, in the example below the text is even better than at 40 steps\n* 12 steps takes 20 seconds, result is fairly comparable, small text starts being glyph\n* 08 steps takes 13 seconds, result is barely passable, small text becomes unreadable\n* 04 steps (without lora) takes 7 seconds, result is unusable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o1z15c42jag1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e953b0a6e4432b97b0e6a4c6bfd910a72925ada4\n\n  \nPositive prompt :  \nwoman, sharp professional shot, shoulder high close up, european woman, walking in the street, holding a cardboard sign with the text \"Gooner 2512\" in a stylized font, the sign masks her breasts, detailed skin, blue eyes, the woman is wearing a blue and yellow leather jacket and a green shirt. She has the word \"Nvidia\" tatooed on her neck.\n\nNegative prompt :  \nmale, blurry, bad, low quality, fur, 3D render, uncanny, gritty, noisy texture, harsh shadows, horror, angry expression, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, extra fingers, asymmetrical eyes, cross-eyed, text glitches, misspelled text, watermark, logo",

For example, prompting a woman with long brown hair and green eyes could and should result in an almost infinite amount of face variations and hairstyles and small variance in length like on most other models. Instead ZIT will keep doing the same thing over and over. You must be delusional if you expect everyone to start spending extra time changing the prompt after every gen like \"semi-green eyes with long hair but that is actually behind her shoulder\" then switch it to \"long hair that is actually reaching the level of her hip\" or some other nonsense thing lmao. And even then there is a limit of expressing it with words and you will get like 3-4 variations out of it at best, and usually despite changing half the prompt and descriptions, ZIT will still give you 80-100% similar face/person. Luckily the seed variance ZIT node improves this, but don't pretend this is a good or normal thing.",

I also swapped out the tiled vae decode for the one the LTX devs included in their custom node - the LTXV Spatio Temporal Tiled VAE Decode node. It seems to prevent shimmer better for me.\n\nBut this is an EXCELLENT workflow. Great notes in it too.

If you're getting the slow motion, add more description to the prompt like a better description of the person who is going to lip sync and words like talking quickly for faster speech or singing with emotion/passion. You just can't leave the prompt blank. The word static camera needs to be in the prompt as well. I just realized I haven't exactly made any references to what the prompt should be to get better results, but the static camera lora is pretty vital for triggering motion (or any camera lora) and what you do or don't put in the prompt has a big effect. Sometimes it helps to even put the first few words of what the character is going to sing/say. That may jump start things on the results you are getting with slow/no motion. On i2v, the model has to guess what is happening - based on the image if there is not enough info in the prompt to help it.",

Memory use goes up as we increase resolution, framerate, length, or steps. Fortunately for users, ComfyUI and NVIDIA have collaborated to **optimize a weight streaming feature**, allowing users to offload parts of the workflow to system memory if your GPU runs out of VRAM, but this will come at a cost in performance.\n\nMy interpretation is that anyone with sufficient RAM can run the full model (BF16) at full quality, but with slower generation times. The question is whether this would lead to unreasonably long generation times or not. Some people around here claim that LTX 2 runs relatively fast even when using **only** RAM, this would mean a lot of people could run the full model at home.\n\nIt would also be kind of revolutionary if this is true.",

Klein 9b base: \"It's a full-capacity foundation model. Undistilled, preserving complete training signal for maximum flexibility. Ideal for fine-tuning, LoRA training, research, and custom pipelines where control matters more than speed. Higher output diversity than the distilled models.\" Edit: I'm seeing comfy support for Klein being pulled in as of a couple minutes ago, so I assume we'll have full comfy workflows/repackaged sometime today. Edit 2: The 9b distilled is looking good with dpmpp\\_2s\\_ancestral/beta 6 steps, upscale image by 1.5x and 0.5 denoised again with the same settings. I'm spoiled by qwen 2512 and flux 2 dev full size, which would have gotten that sword correct, although this isn't all that wrong that it's making a wood sushi serving tray out of the end of the sword. with those bigger models though it was putting the sushi right on the blade.",

So 2.6 seconds for 4 steps? Not bad! ZIT takes around 3.5 seconds on my machine, but you often need more than 4 steps, so it ends up being like 5-8 seconds.\n\nLooks like serious competition.\n\nEDIT - Actually, [I just found a benchmark comparison](https://www.trooper.ai/benchmarks-compare-RTX-Pro-6000-Blackwell-with-RTX-3090?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that suggests the 2x figure could be way off. This comparison suggests the Blackwell is 550% faster at image gen, which, if holds true for this model, means Klein is not even close to the speed of ZIT. So... ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯",

You also need to use supplementary wording for reinforcement of the concepts. The biggest mistake is using very short prompts and expecting results. And don't forget to use the negative prompt!",

You're using the Base model which is un-distilled, therefore you don't need the FluxGuidance node. This node may cause undesirable results with un-distilled Flux models.\n2. 20 steps seems low considering you're using an un-distilled model. Try something like 40 at least. I would even aim at 50. If that's too much wait time for you, consider using [the distilled version of FLUX.2-Klein 9B](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B). You'll lose the negative prompting though, and also the image quality might not be as good as base with \\~50 steps.\n3. Uni PC is not a sampler I've seen commonly used with these new rectified flow models. Can you try Euler and see if you get better results with it?\n4. Consider using \"denoised\\_output\" instead of \"output\" in the Ksampler when VAE decoding the final image.",

      "text": "BEFORE MAKING THIS THREAD, I was Googling around to see if anyone else had found this out. I thought for sure someone had stumbled on this. And they probably have. I probably just didn't see it or whatever, but I DID do my due diligence and search before making this thread.\n\nAt any rate, yesterday, while doing an ITV generation in LTX-2, I meant to copy/paste an image from a folder but accidentally copy/pasted a GIF I'd generated with WAN 2.2. To my surprise, despite GIF files being hidden when you click to load via the file browser, you can just straight-up copy and paste the GIF you made into the LTX-2 template workflow and use that as the ITV input, and it will actually go frame by frame and add sound to the GIF.\n\n**But THAT is not the reason this is useful by itself.** Because if you do that, it won't change the actual video. It'll **just add sound.**\n\nHowever, let's say you use a 2 or 3-second GIF. Something just to establish a basic motion. Let's say a certain \"position\" that the model doesn't understand. It can add time to that following along with what came before.\n\nThus, a 2-second clip of a 1girl moving up and down (I'll be vague about why) can easily become a 10-second with dialogue and the correct motion because it has the first two seconds or less (or more) as reference.\n\nIdeally, the shorter the GIF (33 frames works well) the better. The least amount you need to have the motion and details you want captured. Then of course there is some luck, but I have consistently gotten decent results in the 1 hour I've played around with this. But I have NOT put effort into making the video quality itself better. That I would imagine can be easily done via the ways people usually do it. I threw this example together to prove it CAN work.\n\nThe video output likely suffers from poor quality only because I am using much lower res than recommended.\n\n***Exact steps I used:***\n\nWan 2.2 with a LORA for ... something that rhymes with \"cowbirl monisiton\"\n\nI created a gif using 33 frames, 16fps.\n\nCopy/pasted GIF using control C and control V into the LTX-2 ITV workflow. Enter prompt, generate.\n\nUsed the following prompt: A woman is moving and bouncing up very fast while moaning and expressing great pleasure. She continues to make the same motion over and over before speaking. The woman screams, \"\\[WORDS THAT I CANNOT SAY ON THIS SUB MOST LIKELY. BUT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT IN THE COMMENTS\\]\"\n\nI have an example I'll link in the comments on Streamable. Mods, if this is unacceptable, please feel free to delete, and I will not take it personally.\n\n*Current Goal:* Figuring out how to make a workflow that will generate a 2-second GIF and feed it automatically into the image input in LTX-2 video.\n\n***EDIT:*** if nothing else, this method also appears to **guarantee** non-static outputs. I don't believe it is capable of doing the \"static\" non-moving image thing when using this method, as it has motion to begin with and therefore cannot switch to static.\n\n***EDIT2:*** It turns out it doesn't need to be a GIF. There's a node in comfy that has an output of \"image\" type instead of video. Since MP4s are higher quality, you can save the video as a 1-2 second MP4 and then convert it that way. The node is from **VIDEO HELPER SUITE** and looks like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7bt3j4hugjcg1.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=74aa0585c18609c9ed41f5dae9f413b5acabb740\n\n",

She is positioned center-right, looking directly at the camera with a playful expression. Her head is tilted left, her right hand resting on her head, fingers pushing into her hair. She has light green eyes with bold, black winged eyeliner, shaped dark brown eyebrows, and light freckles across her nose and cheeks. She wears a strapless, form-fitting top in a dark brown color. Visible tattoos include a large black and grey sunflower on her right forearm; a circular design in an ornate, baroque-style frame below her right elbow; a small, partially visible dark tattoo on her left shoulder; and a sun with a face rising above clouds on her lower left arm. She is outdoors under a covered porch/awning attached to a building with light beige vertical siding and a paneled metal roof. In the background is a white-framed window, a chain-link fence, and a grassy area. String lights with black, wireframe, geometric diamond shades hang from the awning, and a traditional brass wall lantern is mounted on the wall. The ground has dry grass, a white gutter downspout with a black shovel leaning at its base. The upper left corner shows a blue sky with wispy clouds. The photo is taken in bright, natural daylight. The shallow depth of field, sharp focus, and high-angle perspective suggest a smartphone selfie.  \n\nSeed: 411478554767843  \nCFG: 4  \nSampler / Scheduler: DPM++ 2S Ancestral Linear Quadratic  \n50 steps for both @ native 1140x1472, using the BF16 versions of both models.",

Is this an safety mode, is it a git clone issue? Some syntax?

But something about that \"first\" step is just not cooperating.\n\nEdit 2: It still is misbehaving even without loras, but in the form of flashing colors. With no loras, the image isn't distorted but it keep flashing between different color tints with every frame, like every frame is either the correct color, has a blue cast, or has an orange cast.

I quess there should be a way to save the current state after each 5s part and start from the saved state and not repeat the whole generation from the start, but I don't know how.

That's interesting to know, as from my own training runs, fp32 doesn't make a difference in SDXL, as it only increases memory use and compute time. However, SD 1.5 does benefit from fp32. I got better LoRAs when using fp32 precision to train them.\n\nI also want to add that training without captions increases the risk of overfitting. Using a single \"trigger word\" in the very beginning of the caption followed by a simple description of the character or person alongside the background works best to prevent overfitting in the case of training a person. I just verified this myself in a new training run of a previous SDXL LoRA I did some time ago.",

When i do img2img i take an image, convert to latent space, feed into a sampler and adjust the denoise value. Half of your post ist describing a lora creation workflow.\n\nYou clearly put work in there. It is just that i have no idea, what actually you are trying to present here.

Use LTX-2\\_I2V\\_Distilled\\_wLora.json from LTX own GitHub - it's fast! 1088p 5s video generated in under 200s on 3090, unbelievable!\n\n  \n\\-----------------------\n\nGot image-to-video semi-working on a 3090. The lessons learned - they are using insane text encoder, non quantized, 20GB, it takes more time to encode the prompt than to generate the video, especially when ComfyUI offloads the encoder model to system RAM.\n\nThe default ComfyUI LTX-2 distill image-to-video template has the node LTX Audio Text Encoder Loader - that will not work if you don't have 32 GB RAM. It will either fail with OOM, or, if you use --reserve-vram, it will fail complaining that tensors are on different devices. I suspect that if you set this value higher, it offloads enough of Gemma to system RAM to avoid accidental overshooting, but then it seems to use the CPU instead of GPU for the text encoding phase.\n\nSo, use the node from the LTX own workflow in their GitHub repository. However, that workflow has additional dependencies on third-party nodes. Those can be installed. Also, inside the Input group, disable the Enhancer node - seems that it causes even more OOM issues.\n\nAnyway, use LTX Gemma 3 Model Loader instead of TX Audio Text Encoder Loader.\n\nI downloaded a smaller Unsloth quantized Gemma model, but not sure, that might actually cause the slowdown because it requested to install also compressed-tensors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdsf5pehlrbg1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=310dc601d1d930a2b75c29618d98e8b3af3b8b36\n\nNow the text encoder eats all of my 96GB system RAM and seems to process the prompt on the CPU, which is sloooow.\n\nMake sure to disable Preview (set to none) in Comfy settings, otherwise it will fail with mat and mat2 shapes error.\n\nThen finally it worked, yay!\n\nBut it does not free the memory, so you cannot launch it repeatedly unless you restart ComfyUI (the unloading buttons in the toolbar does not seem to always do the job).",

Tried both Kijai's workflow and [LTX's](https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo/blob/master/example_workflows/LTX-2_I2V_Distilled_wLora.json), but of course both failed since they use that same node. ComfyUI and all nodes are up-to-date, too. Might be because I'm using CUDA 12.6; they \"recommend\" CUDA 12.7+.\n\nEdit: Nope, updated to CUDA 13.1 (and updated torch to 2.9.1+cuda130 and had to manually reinstall several other packages) and it still throws that cudaErrorInvalidValue error.\n\nEdit again: Turns out I just needed `--disable-pinned-memory` on the command line to get it to work.

          "text": "# [NEW RELEASE] Subject Plus v1 — Moody Photographic Realism LoRA (Z-Image)\n\nJust released **Subject Plus v1**, a Z-Image LoRA trained for **moody, aesthetically consistent photographic realism**.\n\nThis version intentionally shifts away from neutral, stock-photo realism and toward a more **cinematic, photographer-driven look**. It is **intentionally slightly overfit** to lock in this aesthetic across scenes, rather than maximize flexibility.\n\nBecause of this, it performs best **below full strength**.\n\n## Works well for\n- Studio & environmental portraits  \n- Editorial / lifestyle images  \n- Product shots with atmosphere  \n- Landscapes & architecture  \n\n## Technical notes\n- DSLR-style sharpness without harsh micro-contrast  \n- Natural lighting behavior with preserved shadow detail  \n- Strong subject separation and depth cues  \n\n## Important usage note\n- **LoRA strength:** ~**0.7 recommended**  \n- The model is intentionally overfit to stabilize the look  \n- Pushing it toward **1.0 may introduce artifacts or reduce realism**\n\n## Prompt guidance\n- 500–1300 characters recommended  \n- Weak prompts and poor base workflows will be more visible  \n\n🔗 **CivitAI link:**  \nhttps://civitai.com/models/2234406?modelVersionId=2551211",
