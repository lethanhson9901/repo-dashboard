I have some pretty negative opinions about that typeface overall, but the big issue here is that it was developed in 1982, and the style of this video is decidedly earlier than that. The color, texture, and set pieces approximate 1960s futurism. The vehicle body styles are obviously not real, but look like the styles you might see around 1974-1976. And I could buy that as a window of time a real film like this could have been created. But, if you were to swap in older 1960s car models, that would be even more in the pocket.\n\nAnyway, a better typeface choice (though it may be a bit on-the-nose) would be [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile). Other good options might be: [Recta \\(bold\\)](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/recta-font-canada-type), Helvetica, or (if you want some more whimsy) [Craw Modern](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/craw-modern-font-grouptype). These would have been very on-brand for a retro-futuristic film from the 1960s.",

I don't feel as excited. In fact, it made me remember of Ananta, and I'm even more stoked for that game.\n\nToo many games are obsessed with making things feel \"realistic\" that they forgot the \"fantasy\" in these games. Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

There is no SLI, no NVLink, no Crossfire support, SD will always run on **one GPU per job**.\n\nSo in practice, they will only be able to use **one 5090 at a time** for each generation. Yes, they *can* choose which card to run on by adding `--cuda-device 1` to their launch arguments, but that still means only **one** card is doing the actual work. And from what I can tell by their server rack, this is probably what they are doing. I just hope they do not plan to host THAT for stuff like AI videos, because those are still quite slow on RTX 5090 series, and this is going to suck if only 12 people can generate at the same time.\n\nAt that point, an RTX 6000 Ada would have been a much better choice. More VRAM per card and much better stability for heavy workloads. But my guess is their setup is probably not for the public but themselves and probably relatives.",

Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes. I say this because a lot of people use them without reading the terms of service. That was awesome, man!. 😎",

I kept the prompt very consistent throughout and only adjusted things like perspective, lighting, background, expression, or pose. ZIT is extremely consistent as long as the core prompt stays the same, so a LoRA wasn’t necessary.\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right about the copyright concerns. I really wish we could achieve comparable music generation quality locally. I’m very much looking forward to HeartMuLa, but to be honest, the quality still isn’t on the same level as Suno’s v5 model yet. [GitHub - HeartMuLa/heartlib](https://github.com/HeartMuLa/heartlib)",

Once it clicked though… wow. The expressiveness is honestly kind of scary-good.\n\nThe sync doesn’t just hit mouth shapes — it feels alive. You can see subtle breathing, micro head motion, and facial tension following the isolated vocal stem. It reacts to phrasing and pauses in a way that feels much closer to a real performance than anything I’ve tried before. Definitely in the same territory you described in your post.\n\nSo far I haven’t done much beyond lip-sync with LTX-2 yet, but that alone is already blowing my mind. I’m in the middle of finishing a music video for my YouTube channel, and watching the character breathe and sing in time with the recorded vocal is unreal.\n\nMy timings / setup so far\nI’m rendering ~10–20 second chunks at a time (similar to your approach)\nEach chunk takes roughly 1–3 minutes at 1280×736, depending on audio offset and cache state\n\nStitching everything together in post\n\nHardware (for reference)\nThreadripper (24-core)\n256GB RAM\nRTX 5090 (32GB VRAM)\nGen 5 NVMe disks\n\nAudio side\nI’m doing a hybrid pipeline:\nComfyUI for generating / separating vocal & drum stems and experimenting with ideas\nSuno sometimes for quick melodic or structural inspiration\nEverything then goes into a DAW with VSTs for proper arrangement and sound design\nFinal master via Soren AI\n\nHonestly, I haven’t done much else with LTX-2 yet outside lip-sync, but based on this alone I can’t wait to push further. Huge thanks again for sharing the workflow — this is next-level stuff.",

Hidream just doesn't fit on the price/performance curve anymore.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

I understand that there is no way to do this in one go, but how large should chunks be? A chapter? A paragraph? If there is ComfyUI support for this, are there nodes that allow me to auto split epubs into chunks or should I have to do that outside? Has anyone ever tried this? OpenAI API can do this very nicely but it gets really expensive for whole books.",

The reason z-image base is so converted is it's really the Goldilocks model, just the right size, just the right license, just the right quality and it's not distilled and the starting point model already is fairly uncensored with good coverage of concepts. The expectation is it should be easy and fairly cheap to train. Really the last model to hit the Goldilocks zone was SDXL.\n\nBy comparison a lot of BFL models have that horrible non-commercial license which you gets inherited by any loras or fine tunes you do as they are considered directives and their license allow them to revoke your license to use and distribute your fine tune if it allows generation of filtered content which includes IP infringing content. It's just bad so not many people want to put in the effort/expense of doing any large scale training on it. BFL's best models like klien 9b have that license (the 4B is Apache though), typically they open up the lower quality distilled version (flux schnell) but the distilled ones are extremely difficult to train.... \n\nThen you have the Owen models which were nice but too big to cheaply/easily train.. So SDXL has kinda been the darling until now it was the last model that landed in that goldilocks zone and the z-image models are looking like they could be a viable replacement for it.",

I'm wanting to train one for realism but all images based in Japan. I don't know where to start on the dataset though, because most advice I see with respect to LoRAs are \"30 to 50 images should be enough, and do 2k steps\" but that is for character LoRAs. I'm assuming it's quite different for this type of style LoRA where you're not trying to mimic an art style either? \n\n\nI've been starting to train all day every day for the last week, but so far I'm not able to get it to really converge as well as I'd like over a certain style of person. ",

Then i just kept adding more images and deleting some, this v5 version is at around 320 images, and it genuinely feels like it is becoming better everytime i add more images. I dm'ed a guy who made a amateur photo lora for z-image-turbo and he told me he was doing a new version for his lora with 12k images, im not sure if he was trolling or not be he seemed like he was genuine. Also i think captioning is a big part of it. I get gemini to caption my images (i've made an app inside Google AI studio), very descriptive and long captions. \n\nLet me know if i answered some of your questions.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the reply. How do you decide what rank to train, what learning rate to use and how many steps to train as the number of images scale? I was using a couple hundred images but without captions (well, a default caption), and I definitely made an improvement by just going down to 50 but captioning them with ChatGPT. Though learned some things like I had some lower res images that I upscaled, but that wound up training in artifacts etc, so don't do that. My recent training I tried bumping the rank up to 256 and training for 100 steps per image, but seems to have converged at around 2k steps and not much visual improvement afterwards.\n\nIt sounds like I might be able to do better by going back to using more images but caption them all, and caption them with longer captions, plus train at the right resolutions. I know data set quality is paramount to getting good results, but how to specifically combine it all is proving tricky to get past my current plateau.\n\nContent-wise for realism... when you are curating a data set, is it made up of subsets for specific aspects you're trying to train? Like lighting, or image artifacts present in certain cameras, skin details etc?\n\n\nEdit: holy smokes the latest iteration with 50 captioned images attempting to teach 4 different variations in the dataset trained at rank 256 for 4000 steps on Z-image De-Destilled actually produced some pretty stunning results. The high rank definitely led it to start memorising some of the training data, but also the skin details show up so much better. Excited to see how much further I can improve it with a larger dataset and better training techniques.",

          "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been working on this image-to-video project since LTX-2's release, 10 days and countless hours that I've decided to wrap up here before it completely consumed me. I want to share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the final result.\n\n**The Starting Point:** This project began with a single warrior queen concept image I generated last year (the one where she's sleeping in the video). I built a draft story around her and created storyboards using Nano Banana.\n\n**Full Disclosure:** I'm not a video editor or filmmaker, I saw this as an opportunity to learn while exploring the capabilities and limitations of open-source video models. I started with WAN 2.2, then transitioned to LTX-2 as my primary tool.\n\n**Hardware & Software:**\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)\n* **Platform:** ComfyUI with various community workflows\n* **Post-Production:** Basic video editing software for simple transitions and vignette effects in 1-2 places (kept it minimal)\n* **Upscaling:** I had originally planned to test video upscaling myself but honestly lost the appetite by that point. A friend with a Topaz Video AI subscription kindly upscaled the final edit for me (I don't have a subscription myself)\n\n**The Production Process:**\n\n* Generated **250+ video clips** to get what you see here\n* Experimented extensively with community workflows and custom parameter tweaks\n* Used First Frame-Last Frame (FFLF) workflows for some sequences\n* Created custom music using Suno (spent hours getting the tone right)\n* Generated voiceovers, narrations, and audio effects (ultimately decided not to use them)\n* Only used official LTX-2 camera LoRAs\n\n**The Challenges:** Getting consistent, high-quality results was... difficult. To achieve even something \"decent\" without ugly distortions, random shifts, or quality degradation often required 10-20 generation attempts per shot. The LTX-2 audio quality was particularly disappointing, roughly 95% unusable, so I didn't even attempt to incorporate it as sound effects.\n\n\\---Somehow I can't post the rest of my review, so adding as a reply to this message---",

              "text": "**Technical Notes:**\n\n* Only 2 **clips uses WAN 2.2** (the dragon extending its wings and roaring, woman looking through spear)\n* Everything else is LTX-2\n* Only official camera LoRAs used\n* Minimal post-processing (just basic transitions/vignettes)\n* Final upscale via Topaz Video AI\n\n**Why I'm Stopping Here:** The breaking point came when I reached the dragon vs warrior queen fighting scenes. I immediately realized this technology just isn't ready for action sequences, the complex movements, rapid interactions, and dynamic camera work that action demands consistently produced unusable results. Maybe I'm giving up too quickly, but the time investment versus output quality ratio became unsustainable.\n\n**What I Learned:**\n\n* Even with high-end hardware, these models require significant patience and iteration\n* Prompt engineering for video is vastly different from images\n* FFLF workflows can help with character consistency but introduce their own challenges\n* Action scenes are currently beyond reliable generation\n* Audio generation needs major improvements\n* Quality consistency remains the biggest hurdle for production work\n* ComfyUI workflows from the community are powerful but require deep experimentation\n\nI'm sharing this project as both a creative piece and a realistic look at what working with these early-stage tools actually involves. I hope it helps others set realistic expectations and maybe avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered.\n\nCheers!",

I like the closeup on her eyes as the dragon was approaching.\n2. For the LTX clips, were you using the distilled or dev model?\n3. What are your overall thoughts on LTX vs WAN at this point? I've had similar success ratios to what you mentioned: For every \\~12 LTX gens I get one good one, and for every \\~4 WAN gens I get a good one (where \"good\" = consistent, high-quality, and follows the prompt). The speed of LTX is completely negated by the lack of prompt adherence, and the audio element is essentially a gimmick at this point. I've completely returned to WAN already.",

Though I can see the attraction of the model I think the overall quality is far less than WAN. As is also visible in some of your shots things tend to break and everything is always moving when it shouldn't be moving. As for the slowmotion effect in WAN, yes that can be anoying.

      "text": "**The Problem:** If you are using Flux 2 Klein (especially for restoring/upscaling old photos), you've probably noticed that as soon as you describe the subject (e.g., \"beautiful woman,\" \"soft skin\") or even the atmosphere (\"golden hour,\" \"studio lighting\"), the model completely rewrites the person's face. It hallucinates a new identity based on the vibe.\n\n**The Fix:** I found that **Direct, Technical, Post-Processing Prompts** work best. You need to tell the model *what action to take on the file*, not what to imagine in the scene. Treat the prompt like a Photoshop command list.\n\nIf you stick to these \"File-Level\" prompts, the model acts like a filter rather than a generator, keeping the original facial features intact while fixing the quality.\n\n**The \"Safe\" Prompt List:**\n\n**1. The Basics (Best for general cleanup)**\n\n* `remove blur and noise`\n* `fix exposure and color profile`\n* `clean digital file`\n* `source quality`\n\n**2. The \"Darkroom\" Verbs (Best for realism/sharpness)**\n\n* `histogram equalization` (Works way better than \"fix lighting\")\n* `unsharp mask`\n* `micro-contrast` (Better than \"sharp\" because it doesn't add fake wrinkles/lashes)\n* `shadow recovery`\n* `gamma correction`\n\n**3. The \"Lab\" Calibration (Best for color)**\n\n* `white balance correction`\n* `color graded`\n* `chromatic aberration removal`\n* `sRGB standard`\n* `reference monitor calibration`\n\n**4. The \"Lens\" Fixes**\n\n* `lens distortion correction`\n* `anti-aliasing`\n* `reduce jpeg artifacts`\n\n**My \"Master\" Combo for Restoration:**\n\n>`clean digital file, remove blur and noise, histogram equalization, unsharp mask, color grade, white balance correction, micro-contrast, lens distortion correction.`\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop asking Flux.2 Klein to imagine \"soft lighting.\" Ask it for \"gamma correction\" instead. The face stays the same, the quality goes up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxv1zb19igeg1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aeba649a3a14636eefab47518e4b843217ec59c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q99s8c19igeg1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c8764e94c1b2c3006174f6d72ac1593866be1c2",

As a IRL photographer and editor for a living, I'm glad to see that it recognizes these commands so well!  \n  \nThat said, I have managed to avoid face changes literally by telling it not to change the faces in my prompt... I've found that Klein is good at following directions even when being told what NOT to do/include (Like Negative prompting, but without needing to put it in a negative prompt node). That said, I've personally created two prompt/text boxes and strung them together. In the second text string I've just been putting instructions telling it what I DON'T want it to do, and the first string, what I want it to do. Been working for me so far!",

Basically anything that is mentioned will be changed, and sometimes related concepts too.  \n\nThe other thing for me is to pre-process images so that each side is divisible by 16 and to not use the \"ImageScaleToTotalPixels\" node to further change the size. I find the model works fine at both very low resolutions (like early-internet meme pictures) and up to about 2k pixels on the long side without rescaling. Ensuring your input is the right size up front greatly reduces the amount of shifting / squashing / stretching.  \n\nHere's a [simple example using Grumpy Cat](https://imgsli.com/NDQzOTY4). Same resolution as the original, light cherrypicking (ran 4, picked the best), mostly picked based on which image got the eye color more correct based on other images.  \n\nThis model will definitely swing for the fences if you let it in terms of the changes it makes, but in doing so it can look shockingly good and clear a lot of the time, even at low resolutions.  The \"restoration\" prompt was just this:  \n\n> Denoise and recolor the image with natural and realistic colors. Keep the subject’s pose and framing unchanged.  \n\nI've tried a few other prompts, but the seed-to-seed variance is so high that it was hard to tell if any changes were actually making things better, so I left it. The distilled model is fast enough that I can just run 4 seeds and then pick the best.  \n\nThis prompt will definitely go overboard with how many different colors it uses sometimes, but it's mostly fine. And if there is something that I really want to keep a certain color, it often works to just add a sentence like \"The [object] is [color].\"",

Faithfully preserve 100% of the original photograph's composition, subject details, and historical authenticity. The (subject) must remain completely unchanged in its (model, stance, and existing condition), including any period-correct damage, rust, or missing parts.\n\nTechnique: Meticulously research and apply historically accurate color palettes. Use AI-powered algorithms to intelligently reconstruct and upscale only the degraded image data, carefully filling in microscopic textural details for the car's paint, chrome, glass, and interior materials based on the surrounding context. Correct lens blur and motion blur computationally without inventing new features.\n\nQuality Target: The final output must resemble a pristine, high-resolution scan of the original, untouched negative. Achieve unparalleled chromatic richness, dynamic range, and tonal depth. Render with the crisp, intricate detail of a modern Phase One IQ4 150MP medium format digital capture. No anachronisms.\n\nStyle: Hyper-realistic, documentary, archival quality. Neutral, realistic color grading with zero oversaturation.",

The Apply Whisper node will download the model selected automatically.\n\n**The Qwen3-TTS Comfy UI custom nodes** can be found here:  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS)\n\n**Whisper Nodes:**  \n[https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper](https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper)\n\n**For speeding up generations** using the **same audio as input**, you can enable the node \"Qwen3-TTS Prompt Maker\" **after the first generation**. (when changing the audio input, disable it again the first time).\n\nIf you have flash-atttention installed it will use it too, if not , it will fallback to torch attention, no need to change anything, leave attention as \"auto\".\n\nFor voice cloning the **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base** has to be selected on the loader. It will auto download too the necessary files.\n\n\\-If you don't want to save the audio, just replace the save audio node with a preview audio node.\n\n**My Voice Cloning Workflow:** [https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43](https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43) (edited to simplify it)\n\n**DarioFT's Custom Voice workflow (for regular generation - not voice clone):**  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example\\_workflows/custom\\_voice.json](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example_workflows/custom_voice.json)\n\nThanks to [DarioFT](https://github.com/DarioFT) for the custom nodes that make this possible.\n\nTest it and let me know your impressions.  \nRegards.",

          "text": "I really don't like this kind of posts. Sure, yes, technically this is style transfer and not \\*zero-shot\\* style transfer. However I don't think any reasonable person thinks of it that way and the difference really needs to be emphasized. All the AI slop style references you're using, are styles that the model can already generate with just a prompt, it already knows them, it might even do them better without a reference. It can not actually transfer the style of an arbitrary image it has been trained on zero times. At best, it can roughly transfer the color scheme... Sometimes... Even in your own example it fails to correctly transfer the anime style, butchering the face among other things like the insane overexposure. In effect it works like a wacky edge detect filter, and it being so bad is to be expected of normie models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/goiz8zybd4fg1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc04bfbfc686c3d49e9f9b6eed7869a6058a495\n\nAll with the prompt \"Change image 1 to match the style of image 2\". Not that there's some issue with that prompt, prompting isn't saving this model's ability to transfer styles from images.\n\nUsing the 9B distilled with 4 steps. As a bonus, I left in the watermark of what's presumably some site for SD 1.5 loras in the cubism reference. I'd say \"that's how bad this model is at style transfer\", but this isn't exclusive to this model.",

For others, each newer model doesn't usually improve things that much, or improve it at all. SDXL IPadapter is still in the top 1-2 spots for a lot of styles, and Flux1 depth and USO transfer are both pretty good as well, far better than much of flux2, Qwen edit, and Flux Kontext. \n\nI plan on doing a mega-experiment on this over the weekend. We are approaching an asymptote of diminishing returns on realism, and people are going to stop discussing realism soon because we'll \"peak\". I hope then we can get back into the more interesting stuff - using these tools for interesting aesthetics (or... art!)",

Training a lora for a regular model won't help you transfer style to an existing image. In my view, a *working* edit model capable of style transfer would be the best way.\n\n>But this was a test to see how well it can take the style of 1 image and transfer it to another\n\nAnd it is a bad test when it only tests a very limited set of sloppy AI generated styles that the model can likely only replicate because it can replicate them with just prompts.\n\n>Lots of people are going to try and use it that way\n\nAnd people are going to be using it with, say, some image they found on pixiv/twitter/deviantart or saw in an anime, some image from a museum/gallery/wikipedia article, or an image they made themselves, my 3 examples. Not everyone will specifically get some sloppy AI art dumped out by some normie model and use that as a style reference, especially if they can just copy the prompt they used...?",

On the other hand, Qwen Image handles similar tests somewhat worse. For example, if you use a blue-pink car or the palette knife painting style as a reference, Qwen produces an even poorer result.",

It’s quite unstable and usually mixes the two photos. I’ve noticed that it’s much better to already place the photo there and make a prompt mentioning the artist’s name: 'change this photo to an art or drawing made by Gustave Doré, Walt Disney, Marvel Studios, etc.' It always works.",
