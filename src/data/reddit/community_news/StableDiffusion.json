The west is all about capitalism, the east is all about relevance.\nThe west (government) is not investing/directing directly, the east IS.

It still has some of the worst tool support, if I'm not mistaken, even to this day. Flux also had lots of issues, in general, with its outputs/limitations.

And before you ask, no, I don't feed the latent image directly into the **KSampler**, though you are free to try that to see what you get. Sometimes I even do a three step process with the first image being lower than 200 pixels, or I skip the resize to 800x600 altogether, or use the 600x800 as the final resolution. (More than enough for video generation.) Many options.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a **Load Image** node to use any image as base, then use a **Resize** node with *crop* to feed the **VAE Encode**. You can reduce the image first before increasing it's size again to eliminate as many details from the original as possible.\n\nI use **DPM++ 2M SDE GPU** as *sampler* and **Beta** as *scheduler* for the final step, between 15 to 20 *steps*, and a *CFG* of 1.5 or 2.

But basically, I used the same prompts as OP, and then added some flavor text like \"casual photograph\" o \"careless shot\" or similar. Using a two steps or three steps workflow, with the first image being very low resolution (192x104 for 16:9 and 192x144 for 4:3) you can get very odd results, very colorful backgrounds, and you can be able to remove all depth blurriness.\n\nYour second generation can be something like 600x800 for example and then you make a final one that clean the results. To make images for video generation I usually stop bellow 1K, but making a third pass can fix problems, like things that doesn't make sense. However, I still get beds outside of a house, for example, as the initial image can be a bit chaotic.\n\nTo reduce chaos and variety, you can increase the denoising during the first stage. I usually use 0.5, but 0.55 or 0.6 can reduce the excessive variety a bit. The most you increase the denoising, the closer to your prompt the image is going to be, reducing variety. Some people think Turbo doesn't have much of that, but it's quite the opposite actually.",

If the image already has the desired resolution or is higher resolution, then the result won't contain upscale artifacts, because it's not so good at that.\n\nIt can also clean up degraded image edits that have been through too many edits and make them look pristine, if you don't care too much about original detail, as well as fix out-of-place lighting and color balancing issues, such as from an earlier failed object combination attempt, because it's also fairly good at relighting.\n\nOf the various models that can do reimagining and difficult image fixing, it's close to SOTA, especially for its size and speed.",

Next up is the aforementioned R9700 which is essentially just a 9070 XT with double the vram. That said, it’s the cheapest and most accessible way to get to 32GB. It’s no slouch but it’s not anything close to the power of a 5090. But with Nvidia becoming less attainable by the day and AMD *finally* helping to make ROCm useable on windows, the r9700 is among the best value props at the moment (depending on how you define “value” in 2026). I’ve been working through optimizing for Comfy and have had very reasonable performance. Wan 2.2 can be a bit of a slog but LTX-2 is pretty stellar and all the recent image models (z-image turbo and base/flux Klein 9B/qwen 2512) have been rock solid.",

I mean, is this FP8 exploited to the max? Do people really think that nothing more can be extracted from FP16 or other instructions? There are those who still infer with Pascal, even with the CPU.

Q1 2027 would be my bet at earliest or Q4 2027 if the VRAM shortage is still ongoing. ",

Instead they fuck around with changing the UI continually and breaking things.\n\nFor real, how is there still not a way to naively export the queue. Who the hell thought 'lets just keep this all in an in-memory list that nothing else can access. Apparently saving the queue to a flat file as json or even just plain text and removing a line when a job completes... is just too fucking complicated for them to design.  \nOr... how the hell is there no way to pause a queue in case you need to do something else with your GPU. These are basic UX things that they refuse to implement and they ignore ever PR that comes in for them.",

I've been able to create video shots of my project in minutes which I spent weeks to create on LTX-2 and tossed a wall due to model capabilities. Even with using RTX6000 it was very time-consuming to get what you want. I know OSS will win again and it's just a matter of time with model restrictions, but I think I'm going to play around it a bit more.",

Keep in mind that any character LoRA can and will alter the core style of the model.\n\nDepending on the checkpoint model and/or LoRA, you will have to increase or decrease the prompt weight a lot. Keeping the same prompt weight for different character LoRA hoping to get the exact same style every single time is impossible, *(unless you made the LoRA yourself and know how to tweak the style of the dataset).* In my case, I did not use any LoRA since Jessie is already part of the dataset, but some people prefer to use LoRAs to capture the anime screenshot/screencap style and art style. If you want that film grain effect, you can use **(retro artstyle:1.5)** for instance. **Detail Daemon** extension can help enhance the effect, too.\n\nI ran the first picture through **WD Tagger** since I was too lazy to write the whole thing from scratch for her clothes, and pose, etc... So, I apologize for the mess, because I usually do not prompt like that. I only added/tweaked what the vision model did not catch. So, you get the idea.\n\n    jessie \\(pokemon\\), 1girl, solo, red hair, very long hair, blue eyes, half-closed eyes, looking at viewer, smile, hair over one eye, hair over shoulder, shiny clothes, shirt, skirt, long sleeves, gloves, navel, closed mouth, jewelry, jacket, upper body, cowboy shot, earrings, black gloves, pants, puffy sleeves, hand up, elbow gloves, midriff, black skirt, stomach, black jacket, crop top, black shirt, eyelashes, lips, makeup, leaning forward, alternate hairstyle, juliet sleeves, lipstick, hand on own face, cropped jacket, hair down, hand on own cheek, red lips, alternate hair length, cropped shirt, hair slicked back, team rocket, team rocket uniform, (anime coloring:3), 1990s \\(style\\)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08ntafm576jg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=268ae38f098740f3040471a201c730d69c277547",

With consistency Lora Klein gets a pretty good consistency result and I like what it creates better, but sometimes what Qwen creates or if I have references, is good enough/fits well and Qwen still stays on top.\n\nWorth noting that I do use a different VAE to solve the halftone pattern Qwen Edit kinda adds on skin texture.",

          "text": "Okay, so I tested it on photo restoration versus the original Qwen Image Edit, the 2509 and 2511 versions. The initial image was a blurry, low-resolution black and white facial photo of a person I know that was cut into oval. The prompt was \"restore photo and improve clarity, remove border\". I fixed the seed and generation parameters. SwarmUI, 50 steps.\n\nQwen Image Edit (original): the oval border correctly removed (image outpainted); the resulting photo was still black and white; the result was unusable (exaggerated contrast, oversharpened with no fine details)\n\nEdit 2509: the oval border still there; black and white; good contrast; it actually attempted to restore the photo and add clarity, but it was still rough (way better than the OG model though).\n\nEdit 2511: near perfect restore, image still black and white, but other than that it did a great job: fine details are there, perfect contrast, perfect outpaint job to remove the border.\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect restore; produced a color image with faded look (which was what I expected after looking through their technical report); great level of fine details and great outpaint job. Easily the best result.\n\nI won't post the images here (that's a real person and they won't be happy about it), but this model looks very promising. If anything, it looks like a high-quality finetune of Qwen Edit 2511 and not of the 2509 version - despite the similarity numbers posted here.\n\nTo make it a fair comparison, I added \"...and colorize\" to the prompt. Then we have the following (again, same seed comparison; I skipped the original Edit):\n\nEdit 2509: much stronger result this time; slight change of perspective (zoomed out); fine details still lacking (the face looks way too smooth for an elderly person), but looks on a different level to the original result; oval border removed (this is still the same seed)\n\nEdit 2511: a color photo this time, border removed; hallucinated a colorful background (out of focus park view)\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect result; higher contrast and saturation compared to the first attempt (it's still the same seed); colors no longer have that faded look. Still the best result out of the three.\n\nNow, I can see the similarity numbers, but I'll rather believe my eyes: this model is clearly superior to both the 2509 and 2511 Qwen Edit models.\n\nEDIT: after checking all the images and making a few extra gens with different seeds, I can say that the 2509 and 2511 get better likeness to the real person. The source was really blurry and low-res, the restoration job is technically better, but the 2511 gets a bit closer to how that person looks in real life. YMMV.",

Glad to see its working with out throwing errors (in console) like the earlier version I had!\n\nSeems like the lora's desaturate and use a cooler lighting at the cost of some loss of fine detail in skin while improving hair, my subjective opinion.  \n\nBelow is same prompt for the 3 edits with fk9b (not base), I like more realistic subsurface scattering of light on skin. This was only a quick test, fk9b is very settings sensitive and this could be dialed in further i'm sure.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m1ay0tb9rjg1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f624fb12cc6f48f39675877b3f7a281f4112c3\n\n",

Built my first PC not long ago knowing nothing at all and only using GPT.  \n\nHere are my thoughts though, which my thought process might not be how the reality of things work.  I was thinking of the possibility of creating just a Lora that works this way. With a large enough dataset, it could be fairly accurate, especially if you're taking each movement to 2 degrees of motion, which there are also a lot of movements of joints. You could combine some, for example, there is no reason to use both shoulder abduction and adduction, only use one from 180 degrees, to 0 degrees, and then to -180 degrees, which realistically you wouldn't need to go that far unless you want to include contortions. However, you're still including 100% of all movements into the dataset, just calling it negative abd instead of adduction.  Just in the shoulder and scapula alone there are several.  Then forearms, elbows, hands, fingers, trunk, pelvis, hips etc and i think would take a lot of time to create a precise dataset of everything to the closest 2 or even 5 degrees. I feel like a Lora could be very large. What would that look like in controlnet?  Is that something that would require a massive amount of vram?  It sounds really interesting.",

These guys probably put a lot of money into this fine tune, why they probably didnt bother to mention that it was a qwen fine tune. The stock aesthetics of base QWEN are often way too soft and hazy for my taste. If this fine-tune fixes the clarity and style, it’s a win—I haven’t tested it yet, but I’m curious to see if they pulled it off. There are literally only a handful of fine tuned QWEN models out there because its such a big model and expensive to fine tune; if these guys fixed QWENs flaws then im excited to try it again because QWEN is an absolute beast of a model that is only limited by the previous mentioned flaws and how compute intensive it is that its out of reach for most users, but not me as i own a 4090. QWEN stomps Klein 9b and Z-image and everything else txt2img open source in prompt adherence except for maybe that huge Flux2 model, it just needed a good fine tune to tighten up some flaws.",
