I have some pretty negative opinions about that typeface overall, but the big issue here is that it was developed in 1982, and the style of this video is decidedly earlier than that. The color, texture, and set pieces approximate 1960s futurism. The vehicle body styles are obviously not real, but look like the styles you might see around 1974-1976. And I could buy that as a window of time a real film like this could have been created. But, if you were to swap in older 1960s car models, that would be even more in the pocket.\n\nAnyway, a better typeface choice (though it may be a bit on-the-nose) would be [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile). Other good options might be: [Recta \\(bold\\)](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/recta-font-canada-type), Helvetica, or (if you want some more whimsy) [Craw Modern](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/craw-modern-font-grouptype). These would have been very on-brand for a retro-futuristic film from the 1960s.",

Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

It really pushes the need for LLM expansion. I'll the prompt for this one and the instruction I'm using (which has an emphasis on action shots).   \nChroma refined with Klein 9b prompt: Blistering with cinematic momentum, the scene crashes into view on a violently canted axis, every vertical line a drunken tilt, every plane a disorienting slip into impossible depth. EXPLODE the epic figure of the STONE GIANT first - a mountain of muscle and granite, its hide a roadmap of tattoos, a prison of immense, groaning chains. CROUCHED in a predatory, unstable stance before the monolithic gate, its posture is a seismic diagonal, a colossal weight threatening to topple the entire frame. ITS IMMENSE GRIEVANCE radiates with palpable, volatile heat, a raw emotional tremor threatening to shear the world.\n\n\n\nBeneath the titan's hunched, crushing shadow lies its focus: a minuscule group of diminutive people, their upturned faces painted in desperate hope against the giant's simmering wrath, their fragile forms almost swallowed by the violent receding diagonals of the rain-slicked stone plaza. This skewed perspective is enforced by an aggressive wide-angle lens, its distortion bowing the gate's immense pillars, making the cobblestones beneath the humans erupt towards the foreground in exaggerated scale, their lines converging at a frantic, impossible angle in the deep background where the sky-cleft gate to the cloud town pierces the heavens.\n\n\n\nSearing, low-angle light, a harsh cinematic slash from a setting sun hidden just outside the skewed frame, rakes across the scene. It glints off the wet chains with a cold C8A9F3 (hex: #C8A9F3) lavender-steel sheen, gouges deep, warm shadows into the giant's textured stone flesh, and sets the driving rain ablaze with misty FFDB58 (hex: #FFDB58) golden streaks. The light source is tangible, direction clear: from camera-left, low and raking, casting long, distorted, dancing shadows that further scramble the already tilted plane of the ground.\n\n\n\nThe entire kinetic moment is frozen: sheets of cold rain fall in sharp, diagonal slashes. Atmospheric haze and the giant's heated breath plume out in thick, turbulent clouds—FFFAE6 (hex: #FFFAE6) white-grey vapor that coils and smears with motion blur, following the canted geometry of the composition, softening the extreme background. A single, massive spatter of mud, kicked up by the giant's shifting weight, hangs in the air, a spray of F3DABC (hex: #F3DABC) beige-brown droplets frozen in their chaotic, off-axis trajectory. This is not a static image; it is peak action, a precarious, explosive tension captured a millisecond from calamity, all balance lost to the relentless, skewed dynamism of the Dutch angle.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*CINEMATOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS:\\*\\*\n\nShot on ARRI ALEXA 65 with an ARRI Prime 65 S 18mm T1.8 lens.\n\n\\*\\*Focal Length:\\*\\* 18mm\n\n\\*\\*Aperture:\\*\\* T/5.6\n\n\\*\\*Shutter Speed:\\*\\* 1/1000th\n\n\\*\\*Sensor/Stock:\\*\\* ARRI ALEV III Sensor, capturing in ARRIRAW.\n\n\\*\\*Color Treatment:\\*\\* Emulation of Kodak Vision3 500T 5219, pushed one stop for heightened contrast and grain structure, with a cold tone lift in the shadows.\n\n\\*\\*Key Color Palette:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Giant's Stone Skin: #8A8776 (Warm Grey)\n\n\\- Chain Highlights: #C8A9F3 (Lavender Steel)\n\n\\- Rain Highlights: #FFDB58 (Golden Hour)\n\n\\- Mist & Breath: #FFFAE6 (Warm White)\n\n\\- Mud & Earth: #F3DABC (Beige-Brown)\n\n\\- Shadow Undertones: #2B2D42 (Deep Blue-Black)",

Even though it accidentally amputated a few fingers, it looks pretty good overall. Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes. I say this because a lot of people use them without reading the terms of service. That was awesome, man!. 😎",

I kept the prompt very consistent throughout and only adjusted things like perspective, lighting, background, expression, or pose. ZIT is extremely consistent as long as the core prompt stays the same, so a LoRA wasn’t necessary.\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right about the copyright concerns. I really wish we could achieve comparable music generation quality locally. I’m very much looking forward to HeartMuLa, but to be honest, the quality still isn’t on the same level as Suno’s v5 model yet. [GitHub - HeartMuLa/heartlib](https://github.com/HeartMuLa/heartlib)",

Once it clicked though… wow. The expressiveness is honestly kind of scary-good.\n\nThe sync doesn’t just hit mouth shapes — it feels alive. You can see subtle breathing, micro head motion, and facial tension following the isolated vocal stem. It reacts to phrasing and pauses in a way that feels much closer to a real performance than anything I’ve tried before. Definitely in the same territory you described in your post.\n\nSo far I haven’t done much beyond lip-sync with LTX-2 yet, but that alone is already blowing my mind. I’m in the middle of finishing a music video for my YouTube channel, and watching the character breathe and sing in time with the recorded vocal is unreal.\n\nMy timings / setup so far\nI’m rendering ~10–20 second chunks at a time (similar to your approach)\nEach chunk takes roughly 1–3 minutes at 1280×736, depending on audio offset and cache state\n\nStitching everything together in post\n\nHardware (for reference)\nThreadripper (24-core)\n256GB RAM\nRTX 5090 (32GB VRAM)\nGen 5 NVMe disks\n\nAudio side\nI’m doing a hybrid pipeline:\nComfyUI for generating / separating vocal & drum stems and experimenting with ideas\nSuno sometimes for quick melodic or structural inspiration\nEverything then goes into a DAW with VSTs for proper arrangement and sound design\nFinal master via Soren AI\n\nHonestly, I haven’t done much else with LTX-2 yet outside lip-sync, but based on this alone I can’t wait to push further. Huge thanks again for sharing the workflow — this is next-level stuff.",

(Flux has always kind of had a dark cloud around it due to their refusal to add clarifying terms to the license so people can feel confident using the generated images commercially, so it's not really open source despite being free.)\n\nQwen Image has since taken Hidream's place as the big high quality model that not everybody can run. Hidream just doesn't fit on the price/performance curve anymore.",

For whatever fucking reason, comfy recently changed so that some random seeds no longer randomize on hitting run.\n\nSo if I load up the Flux Klein 9b edit workflow for example and hit run twice, it will run once to generate and image, and the second 'run' will simply reuse the exact same parameters and seed, skipping the generation and putting out the same image as if I was on fixed seed.\n\nThe only way I've found to change this behaviour is to use a random number generator and input that into the seed, then it properly randomizes each run. This allows me to hit generate 3 times and actually get 3 different images.\n\nIt has its downsides, but it's far more annoying needing to manually change the seed each run.",

For almost everyone this is done at the start by custom nodes and complex workflows that do it for us, cause it's a steep learning curve. \n\nCustom workfows will give a newbie better results but often they're 'random' better. (as an example LLMs can generate amazing results, but an LLM might not have the same vision as the user). By the time we figure out how to get our images to look what we want by controlling custom nodes, we dont tend to need them any more, so go back to default workflows because of their simplicity.\n\nWoodworking (my other hobby) works like that too.

(I now realize base was never mentioned).\n\nEdit:\nnevermind, you didn't even explain it. In the readme they do use the lighting emoji, but the paint emoji isn't part of the zimage branding.\n\nI mean it could be a zimage inpaint model or something, which I guess would still be zimage.. but I took the post to be talking about zimage base.",

I have 12GB VRAM and can comfortably run it with both the model and text encoder quantized in FP8, so I'm sure you'd be able to run it in some gguf quantization, even if it's Q4.\n\nI don't know how easy it will be to train Loras of you and your kid on Z-Image Turbo, though, as Turbo models are difficult to train. Z-Image Base should make it easier to train Loras once released, but I'd expect it to be at least 5x slower than the Turbo version.\n\nYou should also take a look at Flux Klein. I've heard it's even better than Z-Image for lower-end machines. Its main downsides, like being bad for NSFW and kinda-restrictive licenses, are definitely not an issue for your use case.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

Like it would work, but struggle on certain words, and there was a word which it used to be able to say under the old workflow and I know because I have many test videos, and when I ran it through the new one then all of a sudden it couldn't pronounce this word anymore. I'm on a slow connection and didn't have the new model that had been switched to and so just substituted it for something else I did have. Seems to have caused an issue. Good to know.",

The reason z-image base is so converted is it's really the Goldilocks model, just the right size, just the right license, just the right quality and it's not distilled and the starting point model already is fairly uncensored with good coverage of concepts. The expectation is it should be easy and fairly cheap to train. Really the last model to hit the Goldilocks zone was SDXL.\n\nBy comparison a lot of BFL models have that horrible non-commercial license which you gets inherited by any loras or fine tunes you do as they are considered directives and their license allow them to revoke your license to use and distribute your fine tune if it allows generation of filtered content which includes IP infringing content. It's just bad so not many people want to put in the effort/expense of doing any large scale training on it. BFL's best models like klien 9b have that license (the 4B is Apache though), typically they open up the lower quality distilled version (flux schnell) but the distilled ones are extremely difficult to train.... \n\nThen you have the Owen models which were nice but too big to cheaply/easily train.. So SDXL has kinda been the darling until now it was the last model that landed in that goldilocks zone and the z-image models are looking like they could be a viable replacement for it.",

While Gemini 2.0 native image gen had good understanding already, the image quality just wasn't there. \n\nIdk, probably additional post-training to help it output pleasing, natural images rather than just the \"raw\" base model output? And lots of training for edits too? Plus, aesthetic \"taste\" to steer it towards real-looking photos rather than the deep fried cinematic look of other models.\n\nEither way, having a very smart \"LLM\" base model with all of that image understanding \"built-in\" is what has enabled greatly improved prompt understanding and editing etc.",

I did some naive math and if it's closer to 80B I can expect a single image gen to take around 30min on my GPU (45 or more when using GGUF). If it's closer to 13B, it might be usable.\n\nThe big boy is 170GB in size, but appears to be bf16. I would get the best inference time when using fp8, so about 85GB in size. I'm not sure if I even have that kind of space on my SSD (upgrades seem to be too expensive). Maybe if Q2 GGUF (should be around 20ish GB) comes out and ComfyUI supports it, I'll give it a shot for the novelity sake, but inference that takes more than a minute is unusable for me on my local machine.",

I dm'ed a guy who made a amateur photo lora for z-image-turbo and he told me he was doing a new version for his lora with 12k images, im not sure if he was trolling or not be he seemed like he was genuine. Also i think captioning is a big part of it.

I was using a couple hundred images but without captions (well, a default caption), and I definitely made an improvement by just going down to 50 but captioning them with ChatGPT. Though learned some things like I had some lower res images that I upscaled, but that wound up training in artifacts etc, so don't do that. My recent training I tried bumping the rank up to 256 and training for 100 steps per image, but seems to have converged at around 2k steps and not much visual improvement afterwards.\n\nIt sounds like I might be able to do better by going back to using more images but caption them all, and caption them with longer captions, plus train at the right resolutions. I know data set quality is paramount to getting good results, but how to specifically combine it all is proving tricky to get past my current plateau.\n\nContent-wise for realism... when you are curating a data set, is it made up of subsets for specific aspects you're trying to train? Like lighting, or image artifacts present in certain cameras, skin details etc?\n\n\nEdit: holy smokes the latest iteration with 50 captioned images attempting to teach 4 different variations in the dataset trained at rank 256 for 4000 steps on Z-image De-Destilled actually produced some pretty stunning results. The high rank definitely led it to start memorising some of the training data, but also the skin details show up so much better. Excited to see how much further I can improve it with a larger dataset and better training techniques.",

I understand that there is no way to do this in one go, but how large should chunks be? A chapter? A paragraph? If there is ComfyUI support for this, are there nodes that allow me to auto split epubs into chunks or should I have to do that outside? Has anyone ever tried this? OpenAI API can do this very nicely but it gets really expensive for whole books.",

          "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been working on this image-to-video project since LTX-2's release, 10 days and countless hours that I've decided to wrap up here before it completely consumed me. I want to share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the final result.\n\n**The Starting Point:** This project began with a single warrior queen concept image I generated last year (the one where she's sleeping in the video). I built a draft story around her and created storyboards using Nano Banana.\n\n**Full Disclosure:** I'm not a video editor or filmmaker, I saw this as an opportunity to learn while exploring the capabilities and limitations of open-source video models. I started with WAN 2.2, then transitioned to LTX-2 as my primary tool.\n\n**Hardware & Software:**\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)\n* **Platform:** ComfyUI with various community workflows\n* **Post-Production:** Basic video editing software for simple transitions and vignette effects in 1-2 places (kept it minimal)\n* **Upscaling:** I had originally planned to test video upscaling myself but honestly lost the appetite by that point. A friend with a Topaz Video AI subscription kindly upscaled the final edit for me (I don't have a subscription myself)\n\n**The Production Process:**\n\n* Generated **250+ video clips** to get what you see here\n* Experimented extensively with community workflows and custom parameter tweaks\n* Used First Frame-Last Frame (FFLF) workflows for some sequences\n* Created custom music using Suno (spent hours getting the tone right)\n* Generated voiceovers, narrations, and audio effects (ultimately decided not to use them)\n* Only used official LTX-2 camera LoRAs\n\n**The Challenges:** Getting consistent, high-quality results was... difficult. To achieve even something \"decent\" without ugly distortions, random shifts, or quality degradation often required 10-20 generation attempts per shot. The LTX-2 audio quality was particularly disappointing, roughly 95% unusable, so I didn't even attempt to incorporate it as sound effects.\n\n\\---Somehow I can't post the rest of my review, so adding as a reply to this message---",

              "text": "**Technical Notes:**\n\n* Only 2 **clips uses WAN 2.2** (the dragon extending its wings and roaring, woman looking through spear)\n* Everything else is LTX-2\n* Only official camera LoRAs used\n* Minimal post-processing (just basic transitions/vignettes)\n* Final upscale via Topaz Video AI\n\n**Why I'm Stopping Here:** The breaking point came when I reached the dragon vs warrior queen fighting scenes. I immediately realized this technology just isn't ready for action sequences, the complex movements, rapid interactions, and dynamic camera work that action demands consistently produced unusable results. Maybe I'm giving up too quickly, but the time investment versus output quality ratio became unsustainable.\n\n**What I Learned:**\n\n* Even with high-end hardware, these models require significant patience and iteration\n* Prompt engineering for video is vastly different from images\n* FFLF workflows can help with character consistency but introduce their own challenges\n* Action scenes are currently beyond reliable generation\n* Audio generation needs major improvements\n* Quality consistency remains the biggest hurdle for production work\n* ComfyUI workflows from the community are powerful but require deep experimentation\n\nI'm sharing this project as both a creative piece and a realistic look at what working with these early-stage tools actually involves. I hope it helps others set realistic expectations and maybe avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered.\n\nCheers!",

I like the closeup on her eyes as the dragon was approaching.\n2. For the LTX clips, were you using the distilled or dev model?\n3. What are your overall thoughts on LTX vs WAN at this point? I've had similar success ratios to what you mentioned: For every \\~12 LTX gens I get one good one, and for every \\~4 WAN gens I get a good one (where \"good\" = consistent, high-quality, and follows the prompt). The speed of LTX is completely negated by the lack of prompt adherence, and the audio element is essentially a gimmick at this point. I've completely returned to WAN already.",

The Apply Whisper node will download the model selected automatically.\n\n**The Qwen3-TTS Comfy UI custom nodes** can be found here:  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS)\n\n**Whisper Nodes:**  \n[https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper](https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper)\n\n**For speeding up generations** using the **same audio as input**, you can enable the node \"Qwen3-TTS Prompt Maker\" **after the first generation**. (when changing the audio input, disable it again the first time).\n\nIf you have flash-atttention installed it will use it too, if not , it will fallback to torch attention, no need to change anything, leave attention as \"auto\".\n\nFor voice cloning the **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base** has to be selected on the loader. It will auto download too the necessary files.\n\n\\-If you don't want to save the audio, just replace the save audio node with a preview audio node.\n\n**My Voice Cloning Workflow:** [https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43](https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43) (edited to simplify it)\n\n**DarioFT's Custom Voice workflow (for regular generation - not voice clone):**  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example\\_workflows/custom\\_voice.json](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example_workflows/custom_voice.json)\n\nThanks to [DarioFT](https://github.com/DarioFT) for the custom nodes that make this possible.\n\nTest it and let me know your impressions.  \nRegards.",

However I don't think any reasonable person thinks of it that way and the difference really needs to be emphasized. All the AI slop style references you're using, are styles that the model can already generate with just a prompt, it already knows them, it might even do them better without a reference. It can not actually transfer the style of an arbitrary image it has been trained on zero times. At best, it can roughly transfer the color scheme... Sometimes... Even in your own example it fails to correctly transfer the anime style, butchering the face among other things like the insane overexposure. In effect it works like a wacky edge detect filter, and it being so bad is to be expected of normie models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/goiz8zybd4fg1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc04bfbfc686c3d49e9f9b6eed7869a6058a495\n\nAll with the prompt \"Change image 1 to match the style of image 2\". Not that there's some issue with that prompt, prompting isn't saving this model's ability to transfer styles from images.\n\nUsing the 9B distilled with 4 steps. As a bonus, I left in the watermark of what's presumably some site for SD 1.5 loras in the cubism reference. I'd say \"that's how bad this model is at style transfer\", but this isn't exclusive to this model.",

For others, each newer model doesn't usually improve things that much, or improve it at all. SDXL IPadapter is still in the top 1-2 spots for a lot of styles, and Flux1 depth and USO transfer are both pretty good as well, far better than much of flux2, Qwen edit, and Flux Kontext. \n\nI plan on doing a mega-experiment on this over the weekend. We are approaching an asymptote of diminishing returns on realism, and people are going to stop discussing realism soon because we'll \"peak\". I hope then we can get back into the more interesting stuff - using these tools for interesting aesthetics (or... art!)",

Training a lora for a regular model won't help you transfer style to an existing image. In my view, a *working* edit model capable of style transfer would be the best way.\n\n>But this was a test to see how well it can take the style of 1 image and transfer it to another\n\nAnd it is a bad test when it only tests a very limited set of sloppy AI generated styles that the model can likely only replicate because it can replicate them with just prompts.\n\n>Lots of people are going to try and use it that way\n\nAnd people are going to be using it with, say, some image they found on pixiv/twitter/deviantart or saw in an anime, some image from a museum/gallery/wikipedia article, or an image they made themselves, my 3 examples. Not everyone will specifically get some sloppy AI art dumped out by some normie model and use that as a style reference, especially if they can just copy the prompt they used...?",
