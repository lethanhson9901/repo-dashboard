The issue is how people stitch the result together. In most of what I see out there, the cuts are very obvious. Look at cinema—hiding the cut is an art form, and I think that's the key here. Even if consumer GPUs could generate 10, 20, or 30 seconds, you would still need stitch cuts.\nRegarding the workflow itself, I was thinking about something similar. I don't have as much animation experience as you, so my version is a bit rough and clunky, but still: In any 3D environment (Maya, Blender, Unreal, doesn't matter), create a character base for LoRA from different angles with rough outlines. Then ControlNet—using whatever model you like. Cherry-pick the best results. Faceswap to achieve consistency. For motion—again, use any 3D package. Need SFW? Blender, Unreal, Cascneur. Need NSFW? Daz, VaM... there are heaps of free assets and scenes. Ow and actually if you have full body vr tracking and/or something like ultralip, learning/do animation can be qute fun.\nThanks for sharing, it actually turned out really great!\n\nUpd: almost forgot, recently thinking about Omniverse Audio2Face and mesh to metahuman for facial animation. Dont have time for this atm, absolutely want to explore when i find free time.",

Not claim that without AI it would be more expensive or take more man hours. No, claim that without AI it would not have been possible to make it.\n\nI hope that is okay, and I hope that means that people will give up quantity and start aiming for quality.\n\nHigher quality at the same cost, maybe higher quality at a slightly lower cost.\n\nI don't know but we will find out. All these models are so new and they are being developed at such high speeds, it's normal that the tool makers and the workflow makers are just waiting till it slows down a bit.\n\nAny time spend in building tools right now or a workflow might be wasted when the next model comes out that does things slightly differently but better and then you have to rebuild again.\n\n\nThis explains why there aren't to many good AI tools for production yet. But in the next 5 years that will change. However in the next 5 years we will also find out the true resource cost of the better models, because right now all compute is subsidized. You might be using OpenAI sora for free, but it might very well cost them a 100 dollars in elecricity for 15 seconds of video. They know, we don't. \n\nBut with the opensource tools you do know. Hopefully within 5 years the opensource models will fully catch up with the big tech companies. \n\nRight now it's just slop time. However we might already once in a while see quality but we don't realize it was AI because the people that used it as one of their tools in their toolset wisely kept their mouth shut about their AI usage.\n\nJust like with CGI, you only notice when it's bad.",

And then converted to look lifelike.\n\nMaybe its because 3D is in your post, but its like my brain picks up the japanese RPG character / this is samus kinda vibe from the original model since its such a common design in games.

Working with and testing new models on an almost daily/weekly basis I can tell you that if you first hand that if you think you'll have any level of control, and by that I mean consistency (which includes adding random artifacts, fingers, backgrounds, changing color schemes ad infinitum) as one had in previous animation you're in for a big helping of frustration - and might grind the enamel off of your teeth in the process. Don't be fooled by demos - they're all cooked to look great and get people excited about a breakthrough (maybe THIS time it's the real deal!?) The reality is that you can't get output even close to what they're showing in their demos - that's because these models only work on very narrow sets of circumstances",

This iteration process takes 50 to 100 tries, requiring a lot of 'burning time,' patience, and cloud GPU budget.\nInitially, these were just video game textures for concept art, but I’ve been slowly curating and naming them as I define my own style. For this piece, I used an 'anime_hyper realistic' texture; these are 5k resolution and roughly 25mb each, which is why the library is so massive.

For example, give it the last 8 frames of clip1 and the first 8 frames of clip2 and it can generate transition frames that make the motion look smooth and natural instead of the abrubt and jerky motion you sometimes get when stitching clips together.\n\nVACE is actually much more powerful than I've described, but this is a common use case for it.\n\n[Wan VACE Clip Joiner](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pnygiw/release_wan_vace_clip_joiner_v20_major_update/) (disclaimer: my workflow)",

It helps a lot with things that are extremely challenging today, such as strong consistency (characters, environments, etc), temporal coherence, and controlled extensions. It works like an in-painting system with motion-control preprocessors, using masks to achieve very specific results.\n\nIn this example image, I use it to modify the character’s hand. Combining SAM3, VACE, and several other tools, like SVI, is what truly makes open source stand out against closed-source solutions, though it does require time and patience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5nm5o63kuag1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442b5e501fbf987f29490af03e1cf051d5d92a2",

Even the closed source models are really unreliable in generation\n\n\nWhenever you see someone's video that \"looks finished\" they probably had to gen that thing 20 times to get what they wanted, and that's just one chunk of the video, most have many chunks. If you are paying for an online service that's a lot of wasted \"credits\" just burning on nothing\n\n\nI want to like doing video and want to think it's going to allow people to make stories but it just not good enough, not easy enough to use, too unpredictable, and too slow right now.

Meaning is not part of the creative process, it is retroactively inferred by the viewer or prompter but was not part of the decision process. What AI generates is inherently incestuous, it’s why you see so many things on this sub like this OP - it’s someone else’s idea, rebundled.\n\nAI gestures towards meaning without being responsible for it. That’s why I’d like to see people use it more intentionally, creating things that can be critiqued on their own merit and not as knock offs. Is that possible with training? I don’t see how. You can’t teach AI classicism and then use it to discover Impressionism. That takes creativity rooted in experience, something AI doesn’t have.",

What’s their development cycle? How much resources you have to throw at it to create a new model that does a purpose-built thing, and my goal was to try to integrate it into a VFX workflow.\" \n\n>He continued by saying the shift to AI is a necessary one.\n\n>\"And it’s not just hypothetical. We have to. If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I’ve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see — ‘Dune,’ ‘Dune: Part Two’ or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films — we’ve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half.\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-cameron-says-fundamental-issue-putting-guardrails-ai-humans-cant-agree-morals](https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-cameron-says-fundamental-issue-putting-guardrails-ai-humans-cant-agree-morals)",

I had the same thought and created some custom ComfyUI nodes hoping to extract the latent representation of a \"frame\" so I could pass it directly into the WanImageToVideo node.\n\nHowever, this isn't really feasible due to the Wan 2.1 VAE (which is also used by Wan 2.2 14B variants).  In this VAE, each \"slice\" of the latent representation of a video is 4 frames, so you can't simply grab a latent representation of the last frame.\n\nThat on its own isn't necessarily a blocker though, why not just pass in the last 4 frames to FirstLastFrame?  Well, because it is a 3D VAE, each subsequent 4-frame slice relies on the preceding frame data to be accurately decoded.  Without all of the preceding latent data, you get an image that lacks definition and looks similar to the famously bad painting restoration done to [Elías García Martínez’s *Ecce Homo*](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/08/8KKbDZ6QKee8HsKlvcQQeA-1024x682.jpeg).",

Definitely isn't perfect when the character (for example) ends up with the face not being visible the whole time, then even having character Lora doesn't fully prevent face/hair change. Same with clothes and sometimes it even changes body shape, depends on how the angle changes from chunk to chunk, etc.\nSo while this isn't perfect, since it can't be since the chunks aren't really aware of all the previous geberations, it's still a huge help and with some re-generations it works great :) \nWhat I would like to see added:\n- wish there was a global switch for Loras so that I can plug in all Loras in one place for all available chunks \n- toggle to turn off chunks would be great but it's not a huge issue to do that manually, also adding chunks via some slider would be fantastic, with one place to out prompts\n- some kind of power Lora loader would be nice to not have to chain the Loras together manually\n- option for blockswap to reduce vram\n- option to use sageattention\n\n\n\n\nAll the wishes are not crucial, it's just something that would be nice to have in the original workflow for me personally :) \n\n\nThanks again for sharing and congrats on the workflow! ",

              "text": "Base and helper complement each other. You should be using both. If we want to be factual, the 'helper' model is a Qwen Image Edit 2509 LoRA of the same idea, just with different training data. I made the original model literally a day before 2511 (RIP to me), and since 2511 supports 2509 models (because 2511 is essentially just a souped up 2509), I gave it a go. \n\nIt did okay, better than using base 2509. But then I refined the dataset by adding more angles and poses, and removing the ones that I found to be superfluous. That is the 'true' 2511 model, the base one. But when it came to actually using it, I felt that it was better than the earlier one I made in some scenarios, but worse in others. It was strange. So when I tried both just on a whim, it made the results a lot more robust. Obviously, with both at a strength of one it is just too much for 2511. But lowering both down to 0.7 worked great, at least in my testing, outperforming the single one I just made by quite a bit. However, feel free to experiment to see if you can get a better result. I always appreciate the experimentation :D",

To be fair, ComfyUI has poor memory management, too, and will sometimes just fail until you close it and restart, but nowhere near as bad as Wan2GP. May have finally improved since I last tried like 4 months ago? Doubt it though.\n\nIt likes to try to force you to download large bulks of files you don't need, particularly huge lora packs and stuff.\n\nTends to be unstable and have very unstable performance profiles. When people ask the dev about why the high end performance oriented profiles tend to crash and stuff the dev tells them to use the GPU poor profiles, essentially, because that is also what they use themselves and haven't bothered to fix the others.\n\nDev tends to argue with people and get defensive when issues are reported about it, but then tries to help a day or two later out of guilt.\n\nOverall, kind of a mixed bag. Also several months later so may have improved in some areas.",

He has a regular, fit build, athletic and healthy but not overly muscular, with natural proportions. He is wearing a yellow long-sleeve superhero suit made of high-tech tactical material, form-fitting yet flexible, with a subtle reflective sheen. The suit is divided into segmented panels with slightly raised ridges and subtle armor-like padding along the shoulders, chest, and torso, giving structure without bulk. Micro-texture patterns cover the fabric, and mesh ventilation panels run under the arms and along the sides for functionality and detail. The sleeves extend fully to the wrists beneath the gloves, with slight contouring along the arms and forearms to suggest natural muscle tone and movement. The top of the outfit features a flat white band-style collar with a short functional zipper at the front.\n\nThe belt portion of the suit is black, seamlessly integrated into the overall outfit, with a round yellow buckle that matches the suit’s fabric. The crotch area of the suit is reinforced with subtle paneling and slightly thicker material, designed to smooth the silhouette naturally without showing any anatomical bulge. He wears red gloves that extend up his forearms, worn over the sleeves, made from reinforced flexible material with visible seams, subtle texturing, and tactical paneling to match the suit. His red boots are made from the same material as the gloves, with paneling, reinforced areas, and subtle wear, designed to complement the suit’s high-tech aesthetic.\n\nThe cape is white, modernized to match the tactical aesthetic of the suit: made of slightly stiffer, high-tech fabric with subtle paneling and tonal texturing, cut to fall naturally from the shoulders but maintaining shape without billowing excessively. It integrates seamlessly with the shoulder design of the suit, giving a functional, cohesive appearance.\n\nHe is walking down an abandoned part of the city, holding two brown paper grocery bags, one in each hand. The environment is desolate and run-down, featuring cracked pavement, broken windows, graffiti, scattered debris, and empty, deteriorating buildings. His expression is famously blank and emotionless, and he is not looking at the camera instead, he gazes off into the distance, seemingly without a thought in the world. His posture is relaxed and casual, walking naturally through the abandoned street. Lighting is soft but slightly directional, emphasizing the textures of the suit, cape, and environment, highlighting micro-texture, paneling, and armor lines, while maintaining photorealistic realism and a slightly moody, deserted atmosphere.",

But I think the common usage of undervolting for gaming has sort of carried its way to being common in AI gen too.\n\nIt's just a lot more comfortable to run these cards at lower voltage because of how close to the sun they fly with their manufacturer power suggestions (melting cables, etc...)",

              "text": "Thank you so much — I really appreciate that.\n\nSomething’s I found being used from the early SD days where prompting felt very mechanical: lens, aperture, weights, keywords, commas everywhere. That mindset still carries into how I shoot in real life too — I’ll instinctively think in terms of focal length, light direction, color temperature, composition rules, etc. Flux especially rewards that kind of structured, descriptive prompting.\n\nWhat surprised me with Z-Image Turbo is that while it does like longer prompts, it doesn’t necessarily want them to be technical in the traditional photography sense. I actually started getting better results when I stopped over-specifying and instead described the feeling of the shot — almost like writing a 2016 Tumblr caption that implies the technical decisions rather than spelling them out.\n\nSo instead of listing every camera and lighting parameter, I’d describe the scene, posture, light, and mood in a more narrative way — and oddly enough, that seemed to land more consistently. Tools like JoyCaption / TagGUI plus small mood boards have helped a lot with that, especially since I’m very much a certified yapper.\n\nAs for limitations so far: very specific POVs are still tricky. If I try to lock in something like a precise first-person or top-down angle (e.g. looking down at someone’s knees in snow, cigarette ember glowing, shot as if from an iPhone held above the head), it often interprets the idea but misses the exact perspective. Small articulation details like toes, fingers holding cigarettes, etc. can also struggle — though that’s not unique to this model, and I’m only a few hours in.\n\nOn the professional side, yes — I already use AI in workflows, mostly for in-painting, cleanup, and augmenting existing imagery. That feels like a natural evolution of what we’ve been doing in Photoshop for years rather than a full replacement. I haven’t run an entire campaign end-to-end through AI yet, but it’s getting surprisingly close.\n\nOverall though, for how fast it is and how strong the compositions come out, this has been one of the smoothest first impressions I’ve had with a model in a long time.",

I'm hoping a lot of the issues I've had will be solved by the full model, especially little details like that, which people now focus on like hawks and need to be perfect\n\nIn terms of the work how do you feel about implementing AI? Just in terms of pure enjoyment for the work is it more or less enjoyable with AI? In terms of time saved has it made a big difference there?",

That includes the exact workflow I’m using and the LoRAs I tend to reach for, so I’d definitely start there and keep it mostly as-is at first.\n\nIn terms of professional use, yes, I do use AI in real projects, but not as a full replacement. So far it’s been layered into existing photoshoots. Think in-painting, cleanup, subtle atmosphere shifts, or exploring alternate angles or moods that build off a real shoot with real talent, lighting, and a full team. The initial shoot and human direction are still the anchor.\n\nI haven’t run a fully end-to-end AI campaign yet. It’s getting closer, which is exciting and a little strange at the same time, but for now I see it as a powerful extension rather than a total swap.\n\nIf you’re aiming for more boudoir specifically, a big tip would be to spend time on mood boards first. I’ve had really good results using TagGUI with JoyCaption. Feed it a lot of reference images from Tumblr or Pinterest that capture the feeling you want, then reverse-engineer those captions into prompts. That tends to work better than trying to be overly technical right away. I’ll send you the prompts that I’m using and TagGUI where I tend to get these results when I get back to my computer!\n\nWith the workflow and model mentioned above, plus a few carefully chosen LoRAs, you should be able to get very close to what you’re looking for. Take it slow, iterate, and let the mood lead.",

In my case, my background is in fashion and product photography, so the way I approach these images is less about “sexy” and more about how it feels to wear something, how fabric sits on a body, how light interacts with skin, and the emotional tone that clothing can carry.\n\nThat’s very different from generating an image to look at someone, versus generating an image to understand style, fit, mood, or identity — which is how I’ve always approached this kind of work. It’s closer to editorial or retail imagery you’d see in everyday fashion spaces than fantasy.\n\nFor this post specifically, I chose these examples because they’re technically difficult for models to render convincingly, not because of subject matter. Human form + fabric + lighting tends to expose strengths and weaknesses faster than safer categories. It’s still what I’d shoot though besides for that edge case.\n\nTotally fair if that aesthetic isn’t everyone’s thing — but for me it comes from a product and storytelling lens rather than novelty or provocation.\n\nHope that sorta’ helps 😅",

His face is sharply in focus, skin textured with age, pores, wrinkles, sun-worn realism. His hands rest on the machine buttons, veins visible, fingers still, deliberate.\n\n>Shallow depth of field. The man’s eyes and hands are crisp, everything else gently falling away into soft blur.\n\n>Two identical slot machines stand behind him like silent witnesses. On the nearest screen, glowing blue, clean readable text says: “You are not alone.” The light from the screen softly spills across his face and forearms, cool against warm skin.\n\n>The second machine mirrors it, slightly out of focus, the same screen size and layout, reinforcing repetition and time.\n\n>Lighting feels natural and observational, like a real photograph taken in available light. Warm ambient tones from the room contrast with the cold blue of the screens. No dramatic spotlights. No stylized neon.\n\n>His expression is calm, reflective, quietly content. Not sad. Not smiling. A man who has lived long enough to understand loss and still sit with it.\n\n>The mood is restrained, human, and honest. Documentary realism with cinematic intimacy.\n\n>Shot on a full-frame camera, 50mm prime lens, wide aperture (around f/1.6). Soft background compression, natural perspective.\n\n>Feels like a still frame from a film about time, habit, and endurance. Not nostalgic. Not ironic. Just present.\n\n>Hyper-realistic photography. No exaggeration. No surreal distortion. Everything feels physically possible.\n\nEDIT: The blockquotes and markdown is being silly, excuse the formatting!",

But the feeling wasn’t.\n\nAt a certain point, anything viewed through a screen is already a step removed this perspectuve. That’s where the question shifts. Less “is this technically correct” and more “what does this do to me”. Does it spark curiosity, emotion, inspiration.\n\nThat’s the value I’m talking about here. Not whether something checks every real-world box, but whether a moment, even a digital one, can make someone who isn’t a mechanic, or a racer, or even a fashion person, stop and feel something — weird rant  but that's what made sense for me.\n\nI do appreciate this POV — it all sounds right in my strict stotic pragmatic thoughts.

              "text": "Must've been my image workflow attached or links..  Here's the response:  \n  \nI’d honestly recommend starting by grabbing the workflow I listed above and not changing much at first — I’ve tried *so many* variations, and this one feels like a near all-in-one setup that dials things in very intuitively. Coming from a product design / engineering background, I actually ended up buying the creator a few coffees because it saved me so much trial and error.\n\nFrom a settings standpoint, my understanding (and experience so far) is that **Z-Image Turbo really wants to stay simple**:\n\n* **Sampler:** Euler\n* **Scheduler:** Simple\n* **CFG:** 1\n* **Denoise:** 1\n\nI’ve tested pushing these higher and lower, but for pure text-to-image with ZIT, this feels very much like a one-to-one setup — I don’t think it benefits from being over-tuned. That said, I could absolutely be wrong long-term, but this has been the most consistent so far.\n\nThe *one* thing I do recommend experimenting with is **steps**. I ran the same seed repeatedly across a wide range — 5, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, even 125–200 — and **50 steps consistently felt like the Goldilocks zone**. Fewer steps introduced randomness, more steps didn’t meaningfully improve detail and sometimes added artifacts.\n\nAesthetically, I personally avoid heavy noise or overly monochromatic looks during generation. If I want texture, I’ll either add a *very* light film grain LoRA (around \\~0.15), or just handle it post-gen in Photoshop or Affinity (which is free now). You can always add grain later — it’s much harder to remove if it’s baked in.\n\nFor LoRAs with ZIT, I’ve had good results using — search on Civitai\n\n* **Aesthetic Amateur Photo**\n* **NiceGirls UltraReal**\n\nThere’s a third I often use for lingerie-leaning work, but I won’t link it here for obvious reasons.\n\nFor film grain specifically: **GrainScape UltraReal** works well if you want heavy grain (probably more than most people need). The one I personally use most is **Cinematic Kodak Motion Picture “Film Still”** — I’ve used it extensively with Flux, and the ZIT version is in early access but already promising.\n\nOverall, this exact setup is what I’m running day-to-day right now, and it’s been extremely consistent.",

Some phases definitely get leaner — fewer reshoots, smaller crews, less back-and-forth — but fashion and product photography still really depend on human direction, taste, and real bodies.\n\nEspecially in this space, it matters how something actually sits on a person at a certain height, weight, posture, and movement. That tangible reference doesn’t go away. AI becomes incredibly useful after that point — for variants, mood exploration, or extending ideas — but it’s not replacing the human creative backbone.\n\nSo yeah, things get more efficient 🙂 but in practice it’s more of a tool that supports the team rather than replaces it.",

Flux 2 dev (even with turbo) still beats it on all the little text bits in this prompt, but this still looks awesome aside from that. prompt: A highly advanced gynoid assassin unit designated \"YUKI-7\" stands in the rain-slicked back alleys of Osaka's Shinsekai district at 2AM, her pristine white ceramic helmet gleaming under flickering neon signs advertising pachinko parlors and izakayas, the kanji \"零\" (zero) etched in crimson across her faceplate as raindrops streak down its seamless surface. Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

An optional upscale with SeedVR2 (default settings) adds about 5 seconds but in my opinion it makes the image even more \"AI-ish\".\n\n* skin still looks unrealistically smooth/plastic/AI look/blurry, Z-image-turbo gives comparable if not better results with 9 steps\n* even when requesting a woman I would sometimes get a man\n* 04 steps lora does not seem to work with GGUF\n* 40 steps takes 64 seconds\n* 24 steps takes 38 seconds, changes to facial structure, result is fairly comparable, in the example below the text is even better than at 40 steps\n* 12 steps takes 20 seconds, result is fairly comparable, small text starts being glyph\n* 08 steps takes 13 seconds, result is barely passable, small text becomes unreadable\n* 04 steps (without lora) takes 7 seconds, result is unusable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9o1z15c42jag1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e953b0a6e4432b97b0e6a4c6bfd910a72925ada4\n\n  \nPositive prompt :  \nwoman, sharp professional shot, shoulder high close up, european woman, walking in the street, holding a cardboard sign with the text \"Gooner 2512\" in a stylized font, the sign masks her breasts, detailed skin, blue eyes, the woman is wearing a blue and yellow leather jacket and a green shirt. She has the word \"Nvidia\" tatooed on her neck.\n\nNegative prompt :  \nmale, blurry, bad, low quality, fur, 3D render, uncanny, gritty, noisy texture, harsh shadows, horror, angry expression, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, extra fingers, asymmetrical eyes, cross-eyed, text glitches, misspelled text, watermark, logo",

This model's used to create (t2i), although the first version natively supported images. Don't confuse it with Qwen Image Edit 2509 or 2511 (i2i). The first version came out about five months ago and was quite good in terms of realism for creating 1girl datasets; I saw in their examples that they polished it. I like that they're working on it, and there're already several GGUFs on Huggingface. This model's great, but I'll pass on it since we have zit and sd xl for realism. Don't get me wrong, I use 2509 as my main model daily; I hope the Chinese don't make a mistake and continue to offer us useful products because, after all, we're their guinea pigs. We, the users, save companies millions of dollars by improving and refining their open-source models and providing them with constant feedback. They're provided with free LoRa and upgrades to retrain their AI models, which're then only available via web APIs. And as someone said, we get the scraps! 🫶",

Many expect models like WAN2.5 to be open source, but the reality's we're lucky if we can run multitalk and similar tools in a decent amount of time. Well, that partly explains how WAN2.5 and WAN2.6 were trained. I love AI and working with it daily, but the reality's that local AI isn't for the poor. I have 16 GB of VRAM, and it was hard to get my graphics card and setup, and even then, I work under precarious conditions. I won't deny that we're sticking with models, but they're getting bigger and bigger, and it's not just for capacity or small improvements, but because their purpose's that sooner or later you end up using APIs, since quantized models're pretty bad. That's why I use Q8, FP8, FP16, or BF16 to avoid sacrificing quality, as I don't like distorted generations. I'm not attacking local AI, much less this model, but I keep seeing new users who think the world of AI's all about happiness and unicorns, when we've been manipulated since before we even set up our systems, not to mention the RAM monopoly and inflated graphics card prices.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/OoIjNgD.png) is that same workflow using custom nodes.\n\nIf I want to add hires fix, I can just add a few more nodes like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/Vl0WGeh.png). + '[Adetailer](https://i.imgur.com/LbpqJWy.png)'.\n\nAdding things like controlnet, ipadapter, etc., are also all just a few nodes. \n\nIt can of course get more complicated, but nodes generally just flow in sequence so once you get a feel for how it works, it's pretty easy to be like 'Oh, these nodes are for X and these nodes are for y'. Plus if you build your own workflow then you can organize things in whatever way helps to remember where and what things are.\n\nComfy looks scary, but as long as you're not the kind of person who endlessly worries about breaking things when ctrl z exists then you might actually like it.",

Unless you're Kjai or have financial backing, that's the harsh truth. One quick question my friend: I only glanced at the README file. How many minutes can it run before it goes haywire? Most open-source TTS systems crash after a certain number of minutes or tokens and lose their minds. Needless to say, thank you so much my anonymous hero!🤟",

Instead ZIT will keep doing the same thing over and over. You must be delusional if you expect everyone to start spending extra time changing the prompt after every gen like \"semi-green eyes with long hair but that is actually behind her shoulder\" then switch it to \"long hair that is actually reaching the level of her hip\" or some other nonsense thing lmao. And even then there is a limit of expressing it with words and you will get like 3-4 variations out of it at best, and usually despite changing half the prompt and descriptions, ZIT will still give you 80-100% similar face/person. Luckily the seed variance ZIT node improves this, but don't pretend this is a good or normal thing.",

The big advantage of a physical model (drawing mannequin) is that you can pose it faster than posing a virtual model.  \n\nBut the big problem is that the best ones I could fine either are quite limited in the types of poses they can adopt or don't look enough like a normal human body to be converted into virtual.  And even for more simple poses, the pipeline isn't faster than virtual:  pose physical model, light it properly, photograph it, pipe to image editor, make changes.  Changes are required because while the physical comes in male and female versions (some even have swappable heads), you need to change other body ratios, colors, hair, clothes, etc.  So it's similar or more effort to using a virtual model.  \n\nThat said, if anyone is doing this, I'd love to hear your experience!",

You have to model, rig, texture, and animate—with animation being the hardest part of that workflow.\n\nguys like me and other 3D artists today are trying to use AI to \"skin\" their models to speed up the final render output. Studios generally don't admit it, but many use a mix of AI and traditional methods for first drafts or concepting, then switch to traditional methods to deliver the final product.\n\nPersonally, I can model, texture, and rig, but doing keyframe animation alone is an incredibly cumbersome task. To skip that, I (and others like me) rely a bit on AI. Since AI video generation is costly but slightly affordable too with cheap methods like mine, I’ve been experimenting with this mixed workflow for about 3 months. I'm trying to find out if \"conceptual\" work is enough with AI, because \"production-ready\" models usually require rigorous checks and traditional pipelines to maintain studio reputations.\n\nregarding 3D printing: Sculpting is still necessary. also you gotta remesh the model a bit, so bit of work for alone, you also have to slice and join everything properly so the 3D mesh doesn't break during printing. This is a bit of a task, though some expensive printers use AI to help with nesting. Basically, 3D printing isn't \"hard,\" it just requires an expensive and careful workflow.\n\nFor games: Animation, bone work, and physics represent a huge amount of work. Doing this alone for hyperrealistic assets is technically doable, but very difficult to sustain being solo.\n\n*Note: Everything I said is based on hyperrealistic styles (though the 3D printing process is similar for both simple and hyperrealistic models).*",

From what they did show it seems like all they did was use Daz to make poses. People have been doing that for years at this point, so it's nothing new and being a 3D animator is irrelevant if that's is all they are doing because it's not animation. They didn't even have a single unrelated 3D animated video on any of their profiles.\n\nNone of what the OP was claiming to do was actually shown. It was just a collection of 1girl clips and the movement was so basic it could easily have been done with just prompting.\n\nIt's not out of order to want to see the actual original 3D animation the OP is claiming to have used to generate the video.If people are claiming to do something then they should show it otherwise it's just misleading clickbait.",

Is this an safety mode, is it a git clone issue? Some syntax?

But something about that \"first\" step is just not cooperating.\n\nEdit 2: It still is misbehaving even without loras, but in the form of flashing colors. With no loras, the image isn't distorted but it keep flashing between different color tints with every frame, like every frame is either the correct color, has a blue cast, or has an orange cast.

I quess there should be a way to save the current state after each 5s part and start from the saved state and not repeat the whole generation from the start, but I don't know how.

She is positioned center-right, looking directly at the camera with a playful expression. Her head is tilted left, her right hand resting on her head, fingers pushing into her hair. She has light green eyes with bold, black winged eyeliner, shaped dark brown eyebrows, and light freckles across her nose and cheeks. She wears a strapless, form-fitting top in a dark brown color. Visible tattoos include a large black and grey sunflower on her right forearm; a circular design in an ornate, baroque-style frame below her right elbow; a small, partially visible dark tattoo on her left shoulder; and a sun with a face rising above clouds on her lower left arm. She is outdoors under a covered porch/awning attached to a building with light beige vertical siding and a paneled metal roof. In the background is a white-framed window, a chain-link fence, and a grassy area. String lights with black, wireframe, geometric diamond shades hang from the awning, and a traditional brass wall lantern is mounted on the wall. The ground has dry grass, a white gutter downspout with a black shovel leaning at its base. The upper left corner shows a blue sky with wispy clouds. The photo is taken in bright, natural daylight. The shallow depth of field, sharp focus, and high-angle perspective suggest a smartphone selfie.  \n\nSeed: 411478554767843  \nCFG: 4  \nSampler / Scheduler: DPM++ 2S Ancestral Linear Quadratic  \n50 steps for both @ native 1140x1472, using the BF16 versions of both models.",

It is **intentionally slightly overfit** to lock in this aesthetic across scenes, rather than maximize flexibility.\n\nBecause of this, it performs best **below full strength**.\n\n## Works well for\n- Studio & environmental portraits  \n- Editorial / lifestyle images  \n- Product shots with atmosphere  \n- Landscapes & architecture  \n\n## Technical notes\n- DSLR-style sharpness without harsh micro-contrast  \n- Natural lighting behavior with preserved shadow detail  \n- Strong subject separation and depth cues  \n\n## Important usage note\n- **LoRA strength:** ~**0.7 recommended**  \n- The model is intentionally overfit to stabilize the look  \n- Pushing it toward **1.0 may introduce artifacts or reduce realism**\n\n## Prompt guidance\n- 500–1300 characters recommended  \n- Weak prompts and poor base workflows will be more visible  \n\n🔗 **CivitAI link:**  \nhttps://civitai.com/models/2234406?modelVersionId=2551211",

Most will be similar, but there's more variety.\n\nWith ZIT, this isn't possible. If you generate 20 images, it will generate almost the same image 20 times. No variations in pose, objects, clothing, etc. Therefore you cannot use ZIT to explore. You gotta use custom nodes to create prompt variety, or use img2img from another model's gens, etc.",

If something in your image doesnt end up the way you like just describe it naturally and it ought to turn out really well. \n\nI noticed for text especially its important to be detailed. If i prompt something simple like \"The word 'x' is visible on the image\" itll misspell the word, generate it several times over on the same image. If however i prompt it like \"To the top left, angled at 45 degrees in handwritten cursive the text 'x' can be seen\" itll generate it correctly. It starts running into issues once I have more than three our four locations displaying text that is a few words long at least, but anything below works great.",

I've been promoting the solution for months (completely unrelated to SVI but still applies the same).\n\nDon't use Lightning speedup lora in HIGH sampler. Set HIGH sampler cfg to 3.0, 2-3 steps.\nLOW sampler is 4-5 steps, cfg 1.0, w/ Lightning lora.\n\nAnd you're done. HIGH noise sampler is what gives all the major motion in a gen. Using Lightning kills that motion, so just don't. cfg above 1.0 increases prompt adherence and motion as well, so the two combined pretty easily fix the issue entirely. And the LOW sampler with 4+ steps easily denoises and polishes the motion into a clean result at regular speed.",

In my opinion, it's one of the best low-steps LoRas (please uses more steps) I've seen, and it gives a boost to this Flux2 Dev model, which many thought was dead. Apologies for not posting examples; I always test things with private projects and I don't have permission to publish them. My only issue's that, in the same amount of time, I can create two images with Qwen Image Edit 2509 or 2511 versus one image with Flux2 Dev under the same conditions, and Qwen Image Edit 2509 maintains better character consistency. 2511 isn't suitable for this. 2511's a disaster at maintaining realistic characters; they ruined it with so much LoRa, but it's better for other uses. Although Flux2 Dev's better for text, posters, anime, and advertising—and perhaps that's what you need!✌️",

If you want realistic skin textures, you'll have to refine them afterward with another model; there're many options, so use whichever one you prefer. Even though Qwen Image Edit and Flux2 Dev're large models doesn't mean they can do everything. People don't understand that to achieve that kind of adherency responsiveness and multi-image editing, you have to overtrain something, and in both cases lose skin quality's sacrificed. That's where smaller models shine as refiners. Z Image Turbo's good for many tasks, but in my case, it's a model I don't even use, since for my projects with Qwen, SD XL, some Flux models, WAN 2.2, TTS, some music generators, etc... I use a wide variety of tools, that's more than enough for me. The key's for each user to take advantage of the strengths of each model and use what works best for their needs or projects!👌",

It should get the fundamentals right like composition, proportion, and anatomy, and leave the rest open so the community can train it into a bunch of different models with their own unique feel. That’s why SD 1.5 and SDXL are still the goats. Their base models are awful looking, but you can fine tune them into whatever you want.",

Models that converge to sharp minima have high curvature and generalize poorly, making them difficult to adapt to new tasks (overfitting). In contrast, convergence to a flat minimum means the model is more robust to perturbations in the weights. This makes it a better generalist, facilitating the fine-tuning necessary for new tasks.",

When we train our LoRas using the base model, will the training be as efficient / quick as it currently is using AI-Toolkit's current parameters & the Turbo model?\n2. When we train our LoRas using the base model, they will no longer cause problems when used with Turbo models? I.e. we can use multiple LoRas with Turbo models as long as they were trained on base?\n3. When people finetune the base model, they are likely to then convert it to a Turbo model and this is expected to work well? I.e. most Z-Image finetunes being released as Turbo models?\n\nBecause for me, and probably a lot of people, using the base model for generation will not be realistic, I expect it will be more resource intensive (file size & VRAM usage) and slower (30+ steps not 8).\n\nSo the way I see it, ideally the Z-Image space - for generating - will primarily be using Turbo models, even after the release of the base model.\n\nDo I have these things right?",

All models are 6B models (as per their [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2511.22699)) and Turbo was just finetuned and then distilled. If anything, training with a non-distilled model should be better for both LoRA quality and quicker learning of concepts. There also wouldn't be a need to merge the adapter with it.\n2. That people hope for and most likely that would be the case, unless there is some issue with the model. The problem could be that LoRAs aren't fully compatible with that Turbo model, though they are technically still can be similar enough.\n3. Or you just would use LoRA that would make any model to generate with a few steps, like people did it for other models. I really don't see the point in creating other Turbo models, they would only take up space.\n\n> I expect it will be more resource intensive (file size & VRAM usage)\n\nThat's unlikely, as I said above - they all are 6B models. But\n\n>and slower (30+ steps not 8).\n\nis true. It also would generally need you to use CFG, which already slows the model down by around 2x (in case of other models). That's why LoRAs that would make it basically a Turbo model again (no CFG and 8 steps) would be a commonplace.",

Automatic1111 works well inside it.

That’s a bad sign. Also make sure the .bat file does not contain --listen or --enable-insecure-extensions (unless you explicitly set those yourself and know exactly why you need them).\n\n•\tCheck your automatic1111/extensions folder for unknown extensions, especially things like ChingChongBot or sd-colab-command-browser. There have been reported malware cases involving these in the past:\nhttps://github.com/Iyashinouta/sd-colab-commands-browser/issues/1\n\n•\tCheck your user directory under:\nC:/Users/YourName/.configs\nIf you find a folder named something like “stolen_data…”, that’s also a very bad sign.\n\nIn general, it’s a good idea to keep antivirus software up to date, configure your firewall properly, ideally use Docker, and check your setup regularly.\n\nThis is especially important with tools involving Python. The same applies to ComfyUI custom workflows. As mentioned many times before, it’s best not to install nodes and extensions blindly. Always check whether you can build what you need using the available default nodes first.\n\nStay safe, everyone.",

So far, I never heard that this had ever actually happened.\n\nThe biggest problem with the \"install process\" thing is, that everything can download anything from anywhere and without a proper logging, it could be easily overlooked \\_what\\_ was really downloaded.\n\nStart a pip install - requirements.txt and the packets get downloaded and installed. This alone is dangerous, as it's not known from where this will be actually downloaded, if that's a trusted source.\n\nThen a packet loads more and now you are really lost from where this comes and what it is. It's easy to miss that in a fast scrolling console. And I bet 99% of the use never look through all this text mess after an install and search for something suspicious.\n\nBut again, it happens really, really seldom, no need for fear, just being a bit cautious and watch the system regularly.",

I am also looking for better options and still testing things :) hopefully Z-image edit is very good so we can skip all these and just prompt for it with one model",

              "text": "Not rude at all! The big difference is that this workflow uses DisTorch 2.0, which is fundamentally smarter than the native --low-vram flag or driver-level swapping.\n\nNative memory management is basically blind. It doesn't know the difference between a static model weight and the active image you're trying to generate. When you hit the VRAM limit, the driver starts panic-swapping data to system RAM, and it often guesses wrong. It might accidentally swap out your active latents (the actual 'canvas' you are painting on) or the compute buffer. As soon as that happens, your GPU stalls because it has to fetch data across the slow bus for every single math operation. That’s why the gears get gummed up and performance drops precipitously. The work that the generation is trying to do is stolen out from under it and it has to then go back, refetch it, etc. Hitting shared memory = just give up.\n\nDisTorch 2.0 is 'application aware.' It lets me proactively split the model, treating system RAM as a dedicated warehouse for storing the model weights rather than a spillover bucket. Crucially, it pins the latents and compute logic to the VRAM, ensuring the GPU always has the active work in its fastest memory. It then streams the heavy model weights in JIT. It loads a block, computes it, and discards it.\n\nThis keeps the bandwidth clear. We reserve precious VRAM entirely for the actual math, preventing the 'thrashing' we get with native swapping. It speaks for itself even, as there's no way I'd be able to run a batch of 12 images simultaneously without this specific memory discipline.\n\nIt's so, so much better than relying on the --low-vram flag it's not even funny.",

              "text": "I got Gemini to write a stupidly long prompt for it. No idea if it's useful for them to be so long but the results work out :P Here's the prompt:\n\n    This composition features a central, ethereal figure standing against a celestial backdrop, blending elements of high fantasy and cosmic science fiction. The subject is positioned in a dominant, frontal posture, with their presence framed by a large planetary body and swirling atmospheric clouds. The artistic style utilizes vibrant, saturated colors paired with deep blacks to create a sense of infinite depth and divine importance. The central figure possesses a void-like face, rendered in a solid, matte black that lacks any discernible features such as eyes, a nose, or a mouth. This total absence of facial detail suggests an inscrutable or god-like nature, serving as a focal point that draws the viewer's gaze into the unknown. The neck and upper chest are similarly composed of this dark, reflective material, which is adorned with a delicate gold medallion resting at the base of the throat. The figure’s hair is a short, bob-cut style that glows with a luminescent quality. The top layers appear as a stark, pearlescent white, while the ends transition into a gradient of vivid pink, soft magenta, and electric cyan. This hair frames the darkened face and is accented by glowing celestial earrings. These accessories take the form of small, radiant stars and golden orbs that dangle elegantly, casting a subtle light upon the figure’s shoulders. The primary garment is an ornate, floor-length gown or robe of ivory white, featuring intricate gold embroidery throughout the fabric. The sleeves are exceptionally wide and draped, reminiscent of traditional ceremonial attire. Gold straps or harnesses run vertically down the torso, secured by a wide belt at the waist that is embellished with geometric gold buckles and hanging metallic pendants. The fabric of the gown is textured with fine, crackling lines that suggest either age or a magical energy coursing through the threads. Immediately behind the figure’s head is a massive celestial sphere, presumably a planet, which serves as a halo. This planet is textured with swirls of blue and white, indicating oceans and cloud systems, and is surrounded by a shimmering, translucent ring of light. The ring glows with a brilliant blue energy, containing chaotic sparks and crystalline shards that appear to be in constant motion around the planetary body. The surrounding space is populated by several smaller planets and moons, scattered strategically to provide a sense of scale. These smaller orbs exhibit various shades of pink and lavender, with some showing distinct ring systems of their own. The deep black of the void is punctuated by numerous four-pointed stars that twinkle with a sharp, white brilliance, creating a dense starfield that extends into the far reaches of the background. The lower portion of the frame is filled with voluminous, pastel-colored clouds that rise upward like nebulae. These clouds are rendered in a soft palette of cotton-candy pink, pale blue, and warm gold, contrasting sharply with the dark vacuum of space above. The clouds appear to interact with the figure’s gown, as if the subject is manifesting from the atmosphere itself or standing upon a foundation of condensed stardust. The lighting in the image is highly dramatic, originating from multiple celestial sources. A primary glow emanates from the ringed planet, backlighting the figure and creating a sharp rim light along the edges of the hair and robes. Secondary light sources come from the glowing clouds below and the various planets scattered throughout the scene, resulting in a complex play of highlights and shadows across the folds of the white fabric. Gold accents throughout the image, from the jewelry to the embroidery and the mechanical belt components, provide a consistent motif of opulence and divinity. These metallic elements reflect the surrounding cosmic lights, giving them a shimmering, tactile quality. The precision of the gold linework contrasts with the soft, painterly textures of the clouds and the amorphous nature of the figure's void-like face. The overall atmosphere is one of serene, cosmic power. The composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing the figure as a bridge between the terrestrial and the divine. The combination of traditional robes and futuristic, celestial themes creates a timeless aesthetic, portraying the subject as a guardian or a personification of the universe itself. Every element, from the smallest star to the largest planetary body, contributes to a narrative of vast, unexplored mystery.",

There is not much computation for text encoding over there. \nAlso don't forget that you can quantize both.\n\nAlso there is no confusion. Offloading is when you have to offload part of weights of single network to other device. Nothing else. Swapping models in vram and loading one to ram and other to vram is not offloading. And I don't see much point in loading llm in vram if it is not used as an llm. I'd better have quality than save couple seconds",
