My read on it is they know exactly what they're doing, it's just you need more stage acting skills than film acting skills for this kind of performance transfer to work well. At least for now.\n\nStage actors need to play for the benefit of the people in the back of the crowd, so all their movements and expressions are exaggerated to make it obvious what's happening. Pro wrestlers are especially good at this, you can make out John Cena's expression from the back seat of an arena.\n\nFilm actors are more subtle, with smaller natural movements and micro-expressions that would be completely lost on a person further away than a couple feet, but that's fine because everyone watching is only as far away as the camera.\n\nOnce you compress your video of the film actors doing their film acting to the right input resolution, then use the VAE to compress it further, is there enough information left in their movements for the model to really latch onto?\n\nCompare the facial expressions when the goblin is touching the car at 00:43. Despite the overacted facial expression from the actor, it's a little more subtle than her other expressions so doesn't translate to the character at all. If the model can't translate that exaggerated expression, it doesn't stand a chance reproducing a real expression of awe and wonder.",

The adult humans don’t have a “childish misunderstanding of what acting is,” they are intentionally acting as children since they are stand-ins for the generated child characters they are being replaced with. This is on purpose, they were hired to do this.\n\nThe idea that these actors were accidentally acting like children because they didn’t know how to act as adults is funny though",

A better approach is to take the last frame of a clip, feed it as the start frame of the next generation, and then stitch the clips together. This can be done indefinitely. The tradeoff is that preserving motion vectors across successive clip generations is hard - it's easy with proprietary systems, but I haven't been able to crack that yet with opensource models.",

I'm considered GPU poor lol.\n\nBut I do love Pinokio cause it's easy to find and install many different AI's (another good one I like it FramePack Studio.} You can run the localhost network, connect to your PC through your phone browser and use it like a website. When you run the AI's, they'll get assigned a port number on your IP.\n\nThen if you want to go further you can install Tailscale on both your PC and phone, and run Pinokio on both local and VPN, connecting to it from anywhere using your PC's VPN IP address and port number.

On the counter sits a white ceramic fruit bowl placed slightly off-center to the right. Inside the bowl are clearly visible incorrectly colored fruits: a blue banana, a bright purple orange, a red lime, a glossy black apple, and a translucent green strawberry with its seeds visible inside the fruit.\n\nNext to and slightly closer to the camera than the bowl is a clear glass of water. The fruit bowl and fruit are accurately reflected and refracted through the curved surface of the glass with realistic distortion, and the glass casts a soft shadow to the left. Tiny water droplets are visible on the counter near the glass.\n\nBehind the bowl is a rectangular mirror tile backsplash. The mirror reflection shows the back of the fruit bowl and the window light source, but does not show the camera. Faint fingerprints are visible on the mirror surface.\n\nOn the counter to the left of the bowl are exactly three asymmetrically arranged objects: a small metal spoon bent slightly upward with a small scratch on its surface, a folded yellow sticky note with visible paper texture and the handwritten text “7:42 PM”, and a single black chess knight piece. The spoon points toward the bowl, and the chess knight points away from the bowl.\n\nOn the right side of the bowl there is only one object: a half-peeled orange whose fruit inside is normal orange color, but whose outer peel is shaped into sharp geometric cube-like edges.\n\nLighting is strong directional daylight from the right with soft fill shadows, realistic ray-traced reflections, sharp but natural shadows, and no studio lighting look. The materials are physically accurate: glass, metal, ceramic, paper, and fruit surfaces rendered realistically. Camera uses a 50mm lens with shallow depth of field, focus on the fruit bowl and the front rim of the glass, with slightly softer background reflections. Hyperrealistic photograph style, high dynamic range, natural color grading, extreme material and optical accuracy.\"\n\n  \nI'm reasonably impressed",

You start out with Z-base 1megapixel image size then you use UltimateSDupcaler with the turbo model to upscale the final result to 3-4x for faster speed at 8 steps. Because if you try to use z-base to upscale it would take far too long, turbo i the best model to use for upscaling. Then again you'd have to do the upscaling at a very low denoise or you'd lose all your gains from the base prompt adherence. I tend to avoid SeedVR as an upscaler because it makes images far too soft.",

It really pushes the need for LLM expansion. I'll the prompt for this one and the instruction I'm using (which has an emphasis on action shots).   \nChroma refined with Klein 9b prompt: Blistering with cinematic momentum, the scene crashes into view on a violently canted axis, every vertical line a drunken tilt, every plane a disorienting slip into impossible depth. EXPLODE the epic figure of the STONE GIANT first - a mountain of muscle and granite, its hide a roadmap of tattoos, a prison of immense, groaning chains. CROUCHED in a predatory, unstable stance before the monolithic gate, its posture is a seismic diagonal, a colossal weight threatening to topple the entire frame. ITS IMMENSE GRIEVANCE radiates with palpable, volatile heat, a raw emotional tremor threatening to shear the world.\n\n\n\nBeneath the titan's hunched, crushing shadow lies its focus: a minuscule group of diminutive people, their upturned faces painted in desperate hope against the giant's simmering wrath, their fragile forms almost swallowed by the violent receding diagonals of the rain-slicked stone plaza. This skewed perspective is enforced by an aggressive wide-angle lens, its distortion bowing the gate's immense pillars, making the cobblestones beneath the humans erupt towards the foreground in exaggerated scale, their lines converging at a frantic, impossible angle in the deep background where the sky-cleft gate to the cloud town pierces the heavens.\n\n\n\nSearing, low-angle light, a harsh cinematic slash from a setting sun hidden just outside the skewed frame, rakes across the scene. It glints off the wet chains with a cold C8A9F3 (hex: #C8A9F3) lavender-steel sheen, gouges deep, warm shadows into the giant's textured stone flesh, and sets the driving rain ablaze with misty FFDB58 (hex: #FFDB58) golden streaks. The light source is tangible, direction clear: from camera-left, low and raking, casting long, distorted, dancing shadows that further scramble the already tilted plane of the ground.\n\n\n\nThe entire kinetic moment is frozen: sheets of cold rain fall in sharp, diagonal slashes. Atmospheric haze and the giant's heated breath plume out in thick, turbulent clouds—FFFAE6 (hex: #FFFAE6) white-grey vapor that coils and smears with motion blur, following the canted geometry of the composition, softening the extreme background. A single, massive spatter of mud, kicked up by the giant's shifting weight, hangs in the air, a spray of F3DABC (hex: #F3DABC) beige-brown droplets frozen in their chaotic, off-axis trajectory. This is not a static image; it is peak action, a precarious, explosive tension captured a millisecond from calamity, all balance lost to the relentless, skewed dynamism of the Dutch angle.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*CINEMATOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS:\\*\\*\n\nShot on ARRI ALEXA 65 with an ARRI Prime 65 S 18mm T1.8 lens.\n\n\\*\\*Focal Length:\\*\\* 18mm\n\n\\*\\*Aperture:\\*\\* T/5.6\n\n\\*\\*Shutter Speed:\\*\\* 1/1000th\n\n\\*\\*Sensor/Stock:\\*\\* ARRI ALEV III Sensor, capturing in ARRIRAW.\n\n\\*\\*Color Treatment:\\*\\* Emulation of Kodak Vision3 500T 5219, pushed one stop for heightened contrast and grain structure, with a cold tone lift in the shadows.\n\n\\*\\*Key Color Palette:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Giant's Stone Skin: #8A8776 (Warm Grey)\n\n\\- Chain Highlights: #C8A9F3 (Lavender Steel)\n\n\\- Rain Highlights: #FFDB58 (Golden Hour)\n\n\\- Mist & Breath: #FFFAE6 (Warm White)\n\n\\- Mud & Earth: #F3DABC (Beige-Brown)\n\n\\- Shadow Undertones: #2B2D42 (Deep Blue-Black)",

For whatever fucking reason, comfy recently changed so that some random seeds no longer randomize on hitting run.\n\nSo if I load up the Flux Klein 9b edit workflow for example and hit run twice, it will run once to generate and image, and the second 'run' will simply reuse the exact same parameters and seed, skipping the generation and putting out the same image as if I was on fixed seed.\n\nThe only way I've found to change this behaviour is to use a random number generator and input that into the seed, then it properly randomizes each run. This allows me to hit generate 3 times and actually get 3 different images.\n\nIt has its downsides, but it's far more annoying needing to manually change the seed each run.",

(as an example LLMs can generate amazing results, but an LLM might not have the same vision as the user). By the time we figure out how to get our images to look what we want by controlling custom nodes, we dont tend to need them any more, so go back to default workflows because of their simplicity.\n\nWoodworking (my other hobby) works like that too.

The lighting is natural and soft, ensuring that the colors do not bleed into each other and the textures remain realistic for each specific fruit type.",

The vertical layout features a high-contrast collage of photographic stills. At the very top, the names \"JACK STARLING\", \"CASSIDY NOVA\", and \"SILAS VANE\" are printed in a clean white condensed sans-serif font. Directly below them, the title \"GALACTIC FRONTIER\" is displayed in a massive, bold, chrome-beveled 3D typeface with realistic metallic blue reflections. The center photograph shows a rugged man with a weathered face in a dusty leather duster over matte-black armor, holding a glowing blue energy revolver, standing beside a woman with voluminous 80s blonde hair in a silver flight suit. The background consists of a red-sand desert planet under a dark sky with magenta and blue nebulae. At the bottom, a billing block of small, horizontally compressed white text is restricted to exactly two lines: \"PRODUCED BY ARTHUR STERLING DIRECTED BY ROLAND VANCE STARRING JACK STARLING CASSIDY NOVA SILAS VANE\" on the first line, and \"SCREENPLAY BY LEO DRAKE MUSIC BY MAX SYNTH IN COLOR COMING TO THEATERS JUNE 1984\" on the second line. The lighting is cinematic with warm, saturated tones and high-contrast shadows, captured with the characteristic film grain of 1980s 35mm motion picture photography. The image contains no other recognizable text.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em6gxcdgoyfg1.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=add6ae4acf4821638c9907ab95cdff1777bac3a1",

She is statuesque and ethereal, with impossibly long, flowing platinum-gold hair that arcs around her like a fragmented halo, some strands braided into elegant, crown-like loops. Her skin is pale and luminous, with faint hairline cracks like aged marble hinting at both divinity and ruin. She wears a regal, asymmetrical white-and-gold gown fused with ancient ceremonial armor: layered plates engraved with runes, draped cloth that hangs like sacred vestments, and delicate chains and sigils that glow softly.\n\n\n\nThe style blends refined anime aesthetics with Art Nouveau curves and borders, plus dramatic Baroque-inspired lighting: a blinding, holy backlight creating a halo effect, deep shadows across her face and body, and shafts of dust-filled light cutting through the scene. Behind her, the faint silhouette of a colossal golden tree and broken holy architecture dissolves into mist. Her expression is serene, sorrowful, and unfathomably powerful, eyes shining with muted gold light as if holding a shattered world inside them. The overall mood is one of fractured divinity and ancient, golden royalty—majestic, sacred, and slightly tragic, rendered in ultra-detailed, painterly realism fused with anime and Art Nouveau ornamentation.\n\nRes\\_multistep  \nsimple  \nDenoise 0.98  \nSeed: 940289160578048",

Very excited to see what the community does with this epic release. Only have 8 gig of vram here but personally I'm waiting to see what the edit version is capable of. I know there are fine tunes to make turbo an edit model but I want to see it from the box.\n\nCall me wrong but im addicted to making super realistic pics of me and my daughter in wrong pictures to send to my mother. Me and Epstein at a random party, my daughter sitting in a car where the window is broken and shes hot wiring it. You know the sort of thing. My mother knows its all fake from the get go because im a troll but damn, AI had taken everything to the next level for mean bastards like me :)",

I have 12GB VRAM and can comfortably run it with both the model and text encoder quantized in FP8, so I'm sure you'd be able to run it in some gguf quantization, even if it's Q4.\n\nI don't know how easy it will be to train Loras of you and your kid on Z-Image Turbo, though, as Turbo models are difficult to train. Z-Image Base should make it easier to train Loras once released, but I'd expect it to be at least 5x slower than the Turbo version.\n\nYou should also take a look at Flux Klein. I've heard it's even better than Z-Image for lower-end machines. Its main downsides, like being bad for NSFW and kinda-restrictive licenses, are definitely not an issue for your use case.",

Does your GGUF models or some technique in your workflows reduce this issue?",

It does help a lot. \n\nGood news, everyone! The LTX team has said they plan on releasing a 2.1, that will be a small update with better audio and visuals plus other updates.

The woman on the right has very long straight hair parted in the middle, she is very pale with freckles, a pink t-shirt with pokemon on it and she is smiling, she has a dark blue eyepatch. \"\n\nNotice the woman on the right's hair is actually straight and her skin is more pale as prompted, helping make the women actually look more different. Also suprised how it got the mole location right and the freckles on the right people.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7z0l60gs0gg1.jpeg?width=1916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a23c6cb80a0d43a92d873d9d9c3ea5b875abc125",

Two very different young beautiful caucasian women sit next to each other next to a piano, the woman on the left has dark contoured glossy lipstick, white glasses, short bobcut hair and and is wearing an elegant shiny dress and she looks serious, she has a beauty spot on her left cheek. The woman on the right has very long straight hair parted in the middle, she is very pale with freckles, a pink t-shirt with pokemon on it and she is smiling, she has a dark blue eyepatch. The scene is bathed in bright natural daylight streaming through large windows revealing blurred green foliage outside, the room is dark, creating soft diffused illumination without harsh shadows,  the composition centers her within the frame from a close-up perspective capturing their face, lighting appears evenly distributed across subject's skin, highlighting textures. Shallow depth-of-field blurs background trees softly enhancing focus on their face; atmosphere conveys intimate domestic tranquility infused with gentle sensuality via the face form.\"\n\nNotice how less generic the faces are while following the prompt better.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2c71gi2v0gg1.jpeg?width=1910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ceccca6a6237508ca2e84ca5c8a815bb1c9f1c1",

While Gemini 2.0 native image gen had good understanding already, the image quality just wasn't there. \n\nIdk, probably additional post-training to help it output pleasing, natural images rather than just the \"raw\" base model output? And lots of training for edits too? Plus, aesthetic \"taste\" to steer it towards real-looking photos rather than the deep fried cinematic look of other models.\n\nEither way, having a very smart \"LLM\" base model with all of that image understanding \"built-in\" is what has enabled greatly improved prompt understanding and editing etc.",

If it's closer to 13B, it might be usable.\n\nThe big boy is 170GB in size, but appears to be bf16. I would get the best inference time when using fp8, so about 85GB in size. I'm not sure if I even have that kind of space on my SSD (upgrades seem to be too expensive). Maybe if Q2 GGUF (should be around 20ish GB) comes out and ComfyUI supports it, I'll give it a shot for the novelity sake, but inference that takes more than a minute is unusable for me on my local machine.",

The reason z-image base is so converted is it's really the Goldilocks model, just the right size, just the right license, just the right quality and it's not distilled and the starting point model already is fairly uncensored with good coverage of concepts. The expectation is it should be easy and fairly cheap to train. Really the last model to hit the Goldilocks zone was SDXL.\n\nBy comparison a lot of BFL models have that horrible non-commercial license which you gets inherited by any loras or fine tunes you do as they are considered directives and their license allow them to revoke your license to use and distribute your fine tune if it allows generation of filtered content which includes IP infringing content. It's just bad so not many people want to put in the effort/expense of doing any large scale training on it. BFL's best models like klien 9b have that license (the 4B is Apache though), typically they open up the lower quality distilled version (flux schnell) but the distilled ones are extremely difficult to train.... \n\nThen you have the Owen models which were nice but too big to cheaply/easily train.. So SDXL has kinda been the darling until now it was the last model that landed in that goldilocks zone and the z-image models are looking like they could be a viable replacement for it.",

Its like asking the Chef for a plain bowl of soup and getting a plain bowl of soup but you expected a fancy bowl of soup.\n\nTry this and report back....\n\nA hyper-realistic, medium-close-up cinematic portrait of a Russian woman in her late 20s with a gentle, nostalgic expression, seated by a frosted window while cradling a vintage, well-loved teddy bear against her chest. Her eyes are soft and slightly reflective, suggesting a quiet moment of comfort, while she wears a thick, cream-colored cable-knit wool sweater with intricate, visible fiber textures. Her hands are wrapped protectively around the bear, which is made of honey-colored mohair featuring slight love-worn patches and classic glass button eyes that catch a glint of light. The scene is illuminated by the soft, diffused \"blue hour\" twilight filtering through the window, beautifully contrasted by the warm, amber glow of a nearby fireplace just out of frame, creating a delicate rim light along her hair and the sweater’s wool. Fine dust motes dance in the warm air, and the background is a soft-focus bokeh of a cozy living room with blurred bookshelves and a dim lamp. Shot on 35mm film with a Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic, the image utilizes a shallow depth of field at f/1.8 to ensure the focus remains sharp on her eyes and the tactile textures of the bear. The composition features a high dynamic range to capture the transition from deep shadows to soft highlights, rendering every detail from the individual fuzz on the mohair to the crystalline frost on the windowpane in ultra-detailed 8k resolution. The color grading is a professional cinematic balance of cool teals and warm oranges, ensuring photorealistic skin textures, natural pores, and anatomically perfect hands for a soulful, high-end masterpiece.",

EDIT: ok, I think I just realized that we need a negative, just like wan 2.2 and chroma. I added the following and the image quality went way up with much more reliable fingers (at least for the moment): \"3d rendered, animation, illustration, low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, disfigure, blurry, smudged,  watermark, signature, 色调艳丽，过曝，静态，细节模糊不清，字幕，风格，作品，画作，画面，静止，整体发灰，最差质量，低质量，JPEG压缩残留，丑陋的，残缺的，多余的手指，画得不好的手部，画得不好的脸部，畸形的，毁容的，形态畸形的肢体，手指融合，静止不动的画面，杂乱的背景，三条腿，背景人很多，倒着走\" - I'm sure we'll figure out the right settings but people were complaining about body horror with klein, but I'm getting far worse with this. I'm getting some pretty great stuff but every time I think I've got the best settings with corrective upscale, the next seed is awful again. On a positive note, the variety and \"depth\" with the base model is WAY better than turbo. It's far more responsive to action scene skewed perspective stuff than turbo was.",

Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

You need ever-increasing prompt lengths to describe more complex situations. This is exacerbated with video, where you also need to describe motion and timing. \n\nThe future will hopefully have smarter tools that allow for precise image generation without having to describe everything in a prompt. Tools are already in development that aim towards this (like Artcraft, for example).\n\nBut back to the topic at hand, yes - I'd want to use a prompt to describe a variation of what I want to see. It's enormously frustrating to describe something precisely and have the model not follow it, only to then increment the seed and have the model then follow it. \n\nThat's not a sustainable system for targeted image generation in any professional pipeline - that system only works if you're happy with random output.",

Tadaa. Fixed. Now the combined random seed from your sampler + the random image + the prompt + the denoise make it so that you've effectively bypassed any model variation issues. \n\nI've been using this even since SD1.5, because I can't stand centered compositions (subject in the dead center), and if you're smart enough in the choice of your random images, you can get results no amount of prompting could deliver.

I noticed the biggest difference in the hair: with plain LTX2, even a simple anime character clip where the hair moves tends to distort the linework a lot and it starts looking messy. With this, that issue is more under control. The hair moves in a way that looks more natural and the overall motion feels a bit cleaner too.\n\nIt’s obviously not perfect yet but honestly, this is **really a step forward** compared to standard LTX2. Great work👏🔥",

The central subject is a colossal celestial gold entity shaped as a leviathan whale, a massive flying construct of oxidized gold, deep jewel-toned enamel, and embedded glowing gems that drifts with a slow, tectonic velocity through the monumental canopy. This celestial leviathan emits a soft, world-illuminating glow that interacts empathically with the environment, catching glints on its heavy filigreed plates while casting warm gleams onto the deep fissures of the colossal mossy bark. The atmosphere is thick with a serene, bioluminescent haze and massive shafts of filtered sunlight that sculpt the landscape into a state of awestruck quiet and mythic sophistication. The palette is a rich tapestry of deep primeval emeralds, aged architectural gold, and sapphire blues, rendered with the high-fidelity polish of a masterpiece production. Every texture holds a sense of heavy, ancient weight, prioritizing calm vertical geometry and a soft, massive breath of light that aligns with the slow atmospheric shimmer of this divine ecosystem.\n\nNEGATIVE:  \nchaotic magic, frantic action, sense of threat, small scale, urban environment, industrial, low resolution, gritty, analog grain, messy, bright neon, cartoonish, aggressive movement, dark, underexposed, cluttered, sharp digital noise",

The composition is a claustrophobic, low-fidelity nightmare of sensory-overload, rendered with the noisy, gritty artifacts of a corrupted 4th-generation VHS duplication, prioritizing the raw, entropic beauty of high-frequency signal noise and industrial rot.",
