The issue is how people stitch the result together. In most of what I see out there, the cuts are very obvious. Look at cinema—hiding the cut is an art form, and I think that's the key here. Even if consumer GPUs could generate 10, 20, or 30 seconds, you would still need stitch cuts.\nRegarding the workflow itself, I was thinking about something similar. I don't have as much animation experience as you, so my version is a bit rough and clunky, but still: In any 3D environment (Maya, Blender, Unreal, doesn't matter), create a character base for LoRA from different angles with rough outlines. Then ControlNet—using whatever model you like. Cherry-pick the best results. Faceswap to achieve consistency. For motion—again, use any 3D package. Need SFW? Blender, Unreal, Cascneur. Need NSFW? Daz, VaM... there are heaps of free assets and scenes. Ow and actually if you have full body vr tracking and/or something like ultralip, learning/do animation can be qute fun.\nThanks for sharing, it actually turned out really great!\n\nUpd: almost forgot, recently thinking about Omniverse Audio2Face and mesh to metahuman for facial animation. Dont have time for this atm, absolutely want to explore when i find free time.",

Not claim that without AI it would be more expensive or take more man hours. No, claim that without AI it would not have been possible to make it.\n\nI hope that is okay, and I hope that means that people will give up quantity and start aiming for quality.\n\nHigher quality at the same cost, maybe higher quality at a slightly lower cost.\n\nI don't know but we will find out. All these models are so new and they are being developed at such high speeds, it's normal that the tool makers and the workflow makers are just waiting till it slows down a bit.\n\nAny time spend in building tools right now or a workflow might be wasted when the next model comes out that does things slightly differently but better and then you have to rebuild again.\n\n\nThis explains why there aren't to many good AI tools for production yet. But in the next 5 years that will change. However in the next 5 years we will also find out the true resource cost of the better models, because right now all compute is subsidized. You might be using OpenAI sora for free, but it might very well cost them a 100 dollars in elecricity for 15 seconds of video. They know, we don't. \n\nBut with the opensource tools you do know. Hopefully within 5 years the opensource models will fully catch up with the big tech companies. \n\nRight now it's just slop time. However we might already once in a while see quality but we don't realize it was AI because the people that used it as one of their tools in their toolset wisely kept their mouth shut about their AI usage.\n\nJust like with CGI, you only notice when it's bad.",

And then converted to look lifelike.\n\nMaybe its because 3D is in your post, but its like my brain picks up the japanese RPG character / this is samus kinda vibe from the original model since its such a common design in games.

Working with and testing new models on an almost daily/weekly basis I can tell you that if you first hand that if you think you'll have any level of control, and by that I mean consistency (which includes adding random artifacts, fingers, backgrounds, changing color schemes ad infinitum) as one had in previous animation you're in for a big helping of frustration - and might grind the enamel off of your teeth in the process. Don't be fooled by demos - they're all cooked to look great and get people excited about a breakthrough (maybe THIS time it's the real deal!?) The reality is that you can't get output even close to what they're showing in their demos - that's because these models only work on very narrow sets of circumstances",

This iteration process takes 50 to 100 tries, requiring a lot of 'burning time,' patience, and cloud GPU budget.\nInitially, these were just video game textures for concept art, but I’ve been slowly curating and naming them as I define my own style. For this piece, I used an 'anime_hyper realistic' texture; these are 5k resolution and roughly 25mb each, which is why the library is so massive.

I had the same thought and created some custom ComfyUI nodes hoping to extract the latent representation of a \"frame\" so I could pass it directly into the WanImageToVideo node.\n\nHowever, this isn't really feasible due to the Wan 2.1 VAE (which is also used by Wan 2.2 14B variants).  In this VAE, each \"slice\" of the latent representation of a video is 4 frames, so you can't simply grab a latent representation of the last frame.\n\nThat on its own isn't necessarily a blocker though, why not just pass in the last 4 frames to FirstLastFrame?  Well, because it is a 3D VAE, each subsequent 4-frame slice relies on the preceding frame data to be accurately decoded.  Without all of the preceding latent data, you get an image that lacks definition and looks similar to the famously bad painting restoration done to [Elías García Martínez’s *Ecce Homo*](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/08/8KKbDZ6QKee8HsKlvcQQeA-1024x682.jpeg).",

Definitely isn't perfect when the character (for example) ends up with the face not being visible the whole time, then even having character Lora doesn't fully prevent face/hair change. Same with clothes and sometimes it even changes body shape, depends on how the angle changes from chunk to chunk, etc.\nSo while this isn't perfect, since it can't be since the chunks aren't really aware of all the previous geberations, it's still a huge help and with some re-generations it works great :) \nWhat I would like to see added:\n- wish there was a global switch for Loras so that I can plug in all Loras in one place for all available chunks \n- toggle to turn off chunks would be great but it's not a huge issue to do that manually, also adding chunks via some slider would be fantastic, with one place to out prompts\n- some kind of power Lora loader would be nice to not have to chain the Loras together manually\n- option for blockswap to reduce vram\n- option to use sageattention\n\n\n\n\nAll the wishes are not crucial, it's just something that would be nice to have in the original workflow for me personally :) \n\n\nThanks again for sharing and congrats on the workflow! ",

If we want to be factual, the 'helper' model is a Qwen Image Edit 2509 LoRA of the same idea, just with different training data. I made the original model literally a day before 2511 (RIP to me), and since 2511 supports 2509 models (because 2511 is essentially just a souped up 2509), I gave it a go. \n\nIt did okay, better than using base 2509. But then I refined the dataset by adding more angles and poses, and removing the ones that I found to be superfluous. That is the 'true' 2511 model, the base one. But when it came to actually using it, I felt that it was better than the earlier one I made in some scenarios, but worse in others. It was strange. So when I tried both just on a whim, it made the results a lot more robust. Obviously, with both at a strength of one it is just too much for 2511. But lowering both down to 0.7 worked great, at least in my testing, outperforming the single one I just made by quite a bit. However, feel free to experiment to see if you can get a better result. I always appreciate the experimentation :D",

To be fair, ComfyUI has poor memory management, too, and will sometimes just fail until you close it and restart, but nowhere near as bad as Wan2GP. May have finally improved since I last tried like 4 months ago? Doubt it though.\n\nIt likes to try to force you to download large bulks of files you don't need, particularly huge lora packs and stuff.\n\nTends to be unstable and have very unstable performance profiles. When people ask the dev about why the high end performance oriented profiles tend to crash and stuff the dev tells them to use the GPU poor profiles, essentially, because that is also what they use themselves and haven't bothered to fix the others.\n\nDev tends to argue with people and get defensive when issues are reported about it, but then tries to help a day or two later out of guilt.\n\nOverall, kind of a mixed bag. Also several months later so may have improved in some areas.",

              "text": "Thank you so much — I really appreciate that.\n\nSomething’s I found being used from the early SD days where prompting felt very mechanical: lens, aperture, weights, keywords, commas everywhere. That mindset still carries into how I shoot in real life too — I’ll instinctively think in terms of focal length, light direction, color temperature, composition rules, etc. Flux especially rewards that kind of structured, descriptive prompting.\n\nWhat surprised me with Z-Image Turbo is that while it does like longer prompts, it doesn’t necessarily want them to be technical in the traditional photography sense. I actually started getting better results when I stopped over-specifying and instead described the feeling of the shot — almost like writing a 2016 Tumblr caption that implies the technical decisions rather than spelling them out.\n\nSo instead of listing every camera and lighting parameter, I’d describe the scene, posture, light, and mood in a more narrative way — and oddly enough, that seemed to land more consistently. Tools like JoyCaption / TagGUI plus small mood boards have helped a lot with that, especially since I’m very much a certified yapper.\n\nAs for limitations so far: very specific POVs are still tricky. If I try to lock in something like a precise first-person or top-down angle (e.g. looking down at someone’s knees in snow, cigarette ember glowing, shot as if from an iPhone held above the head), it often interprets the idea but misses the exact perspective. Small articulation details like toes, fingers holding cigarettes, etc. can also struggle — though that’s not unique to this model, and I’m only a few hours in.\n\nOn the professional side, yes — I already use AI in workflows, mostly for in-painting, cleanup, and augmenting existing imagery. That feels like a natural evolution of what we’ve been doing in Photoshop for years rather than a full replacement. I haven’t run an entire campaign end-to-end through AI yet, but it’s getting surprisingly close.\n\nOverall though, for how fast it is and how strong the compositions come out, this has been one of the smoothest first impressions I’ve had with a model in a long time.",

I'm hoping a lot of the issues I've had will be solved by the full model, especially little details like that, which people now focus on like hawks and need to be perfect\n\nIn terms of the work how do you feel about implementing AI? Just in terms of pure enjoyment for the work is it more or less enjoyable with AI? In terms of time saved has it made a big difference there?",

That includes the exact workflow I’m using and the LoRAs I tend to reach for, so I’d definitely start there and keep it mostly as-is at first.\n\nIn terms of professional use, yes, I do use AI in real projects, but not as a full replacement. So far it’s been layered into existing photoshoots. Think in-painting, cleanup, subtle atmosphere shifts, or exploring alternate angles or moods that build off a real shoot with real talent, lighting, and a full team. The initial shoot and human direction are still the anchor.\n\nI haven’t run a fully end-to-end AI campaign yet. It’s getting closer, which is exciting and a little strange at the same time, but for now I see it as a powerful extension rather than a total swap.\n\nIf you’re aiming for more boudoir specifically, a big tip would be to spend time on mood boards first. I’ve had really good results using TagGUI with JoyCaption. Feed it a lot of reference images from Tumblr or Pinterest that capture the feeling you want, then reverse-engineer those captions into prompts. That tends to work better than trying to be overly technical right away. I’ll send you the prompts that I’m using and TagGUI where I tend to get these results when I get back to my computer!\n\nWith the workflow and model mentioned above, plus a few carefully chosen LoRAs, you should be able to get very close to what you’re looking for. Take it slow, iterate, and let the mood lead.",

In my case, my background is in fashion and product photography, so the way I approach these images is less about “sexy” and more about how it feels to wear something, how fabric sits on a body, how light interacts with skin, and the emotional tone that clothing can carry.\n\nThat’s very different from generating an image to look at someone, versus generating an image to understand style, fit, mood, or identity — which is how I’ve always approached this kind of work. It’s closer to editorial or retail imagery you’d see in everyday fashion spaces than fantasy.\n\nFor this post specifically, I chose these examples because they’re technically difficult for models to render convincingly, not because of subject matter. Human form + fabric + lighting tends to expose strengths and weaknesses faster than safer categories. It’s still what I’d shoot though besides for that edge case.\n\nTotally fair if that aesthetic isn’t everyone’s thing — but for me it comes from a product and storytelling lens rather than novelty or provocation.\n\nHope that sorta’ helps 😅",

His face is sharply in focus, skin textured with age, pores, wrinkles, sun-worn realism. His hands rest on the machine buttons, veins visible, fingers still, deliberate.\n\n>Shallow depth of field. The man’s eyes and hands are crisp, everything else gently falling away into soft blur.\n\n>Two identical slot machines stand behind him like silent witnesses. On the nearest screen, glowing blue, clean readable text says: “You are not alone.” The light from the screen softly spills across his face and forearms, cool against warm skin.\n\n>The second machine mirrors it, slightly out of focus, the same screen size and layout, reinforcing repetition and time.\n\n>Lighting feels natural and observational, like a real photograph taken in available light. Warm ambient tones from the room contrast with the cold blue of the screens. No dramatic spotlights. No stylized neon.\n\n>His expression is calm, reflective, quietly content. Not sad. Not smiling. A man who has lived long enough to understand loss and still sit with it.\n\n>The mood is restrained, human, and honest. Documentary realism with cinematic intimacy.\n\n>Shot on a full-frame camera, 50mm prime lens, wide aperture (around f/1.6). Soft background compression, natural perspective.\n\n>Feels like a still frame from a film about time, habit, and endurance. Not nostalgic. Not ironic. Just present.\n\n>Hyper-realistic photography. No exaggeration. No surreal distortion. Everything feels physically possible.\n\nEDIT: The blockquotes and markdown is being silly, excuse the formatting!",

Those things matter, sure, but in the moment I’m reacting to the frame. The light, the motion, the timing. Whether it’s compelling enough that I want to pause it, take my phone out, and keep it.\n\nThat’s why a still frame of Lewis Hamilton winning years ago pulled me deeper into motorsport. And years later, seeing Max driving and even more driving in a sim on stream, when I founda moment so well composed that I wanted to screenshot it and sit with it. On paper, that’s fake over fake. But the feeling wasn’t.\n\nAt a certain point, anything viewed through a screen is already a step removed this perspectuve. That’s where the question shifts. Less “is this technically correct” and more “what does this do to me”. Does it spark curiosity, emotion, inspiration.\n\nThat’s the value I’m talking about here. Not whether something checks every real-world box, but whether a moment, even a digital one, can make someone who isn’t a mechanic, or a racer, or even a fashion person, stop and feel something — weird rant  but that's what made sense for me.\n\nI do appreciate this POV — it all sounds right in my strict stotic pragmatic thoughts.

Here's the response:  \n  \nI’d honestly recommend starting by grabbing the workflow I listed above and not changing much at first — I’ve tried *so many* variations, and this one feels like a near all-in-one setup that dials things in very intuitively. Coming from a product design / engineering background, I actually ended up buying the creator a few coffees because it saved me so much trial and error.\n\nFrom a settings standpoint, my understanding (and experience so far) is that **Z-Image Turbo really wants to stay simple**:\n\n* **Sampler:** Euler\n* **Scheduler:** Simple\n* **CFG:** 1\n* **Denoise:** 1\n\nI’ve tested pushing these higher and lower, but for pure text-to-image with ZIT, this feels very much like a one-to-one setup — I don’t think it benefits from being over-tuned. That said, I could absolutely be wrong long-term, but this has been the most consistent so far.\n\nThe *one* thing I do recommend experimenting with is **steps**. I ran the same seed repeatedly across a wide range — 5, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, even 125–200 — and **50 steps consistently felt like the Goldilocks zone**. Fewer steps introduced randomness, more steps didn’t meaningfully improve detail and sometimes added artifacts.\n\nAesthetically, I personally avoid heavy noise or overly monochromatic looks during generation. If I want texture, I’ll either add a *very* light film grain LoRA (around \\~0.15), or just handle it post-gen in Photoshop or Affinity (which is free now). You can always add grain later — it’s much harder to remove if it’s baked in.\n\nFor LoRAs with ZIT, I’ve had good results using — search on Civitai\n\n* **Aesthetic Amateur Photo**\n* **NiceGirls UltraReal**\n\nThere’s a third I often use for lingerie-leaning work, but I won’t link it here for obvious reasons.\n\nFor film grain specifically: **GrainScape UltraReal** works well if you want heavy grain (probably more than most people need). The one I personally use most is **Cinematic Kodak Motion Picture “Film Still”** — I’ve used it extensively with Flux, and the ZIT version is in early access but already promising.\n\nOverall, this exact setup is what I’m running day-to-day right now, and it’s been extremely consistent.",

Some phases definitely get leaner — fewer reshoots, smaller crews, less back-and-forth — but fashion and product photography still really depend on human direction, taste, and real bodies.\n\nEspecially in this space, it matters how something actually sits on a person at a certain height, weight, posture, and movement. That tangible reference doesn’t go away. AI becomes incredibly useful after that point — for variants, mood exploration, or extending ideas — but it’s not replacing the human creative backbone.\n\nSo yeah, things get more efficient 🙂 but in practice it’s more of a tool that supports the team rather than replaces it.",

[This](https://i.imgur.com/OoIjNgD.png) is that same workflow using custom nodes.\n\nIf I want to add hires fix, I can just add a few more nodes like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/Vl0WGeh.png). + '[Adetailer](https://i.imgur.com/LbpqJWy.png)'.\n\nAdding things like controlnet, ipadapter, etc., are also all just a few nodes. \n\nIt can of course get more complicated, but nodes generally just flow in sequence so once you get a feel for how it works, it's pretty easy to be like 'Oh, these nodes are for X and these nodes are for y'. Plus if you build your own workflow then you can organize things in whatever way helps to remember where and what things are.\n\nComfy looks scary, but as long as you're not the kind of person who endlessly worries about breaking things when ctrl z exists then you might actually like it.",

The big advantage of a physical model (drawing mannequin) is that you can pose it faster than posing a virtual model.  \n\nBut the big problem is that the best ones I could fine either are quite limited in the types of poses they can adopt or don't look enough like a normal human body to be converted into virtual.  And even for more simple poses, the pipeline isn't faster than virtual:  pose physical model, light it properly, photograph it, pipe to image editor, make changes.  Changes are required because while the physical comes in male and female versions (some even have swappable heads), you need to change other body ratios, colors, hair, clothes, etc.  So it's similar or more effort to using a virtual model.  \n\nThat said, if anyone is doing this, I'd love to hear your experience!",

You mentioned you spend a lot of time on trial and error for what is basically just the \"final 2D render result\". Wouldn't it be more effective for a skilled artist to spend all this time on actually working on such a crafted 3D character (maybe rather using 3D AI to speed that up?), which you can then use basically for anything, including games, 3D printing and any image or video you can imagine?",

You have to model, rig, texture, and animate—with animation being the hardest part of that workflow.\n\nguys like me and other 3D artists today are trying to use AI to \"skin\" their models to speed up the final render output. Studios generally don't admit it, but many use a mix of AI and traditional methods for first drafts or concepting, then switch to traditional methods to deliver the final product.\n\nPersonally, I can model, texture, and rig, but doing keyframe animation alone is an incredibly cumbersome task. To skip that, I (and others like me) rely a bit on AI. Since AI video generation is costly but slightly affordable too with cheap methods like mine, I’ve been experimenting with this mixed workflow for about 3 months. I'm trying to find out if \"conceptual\" work is enough with AI, because \"production-ready\" models usually require rigorous checks and traditional pipelines to maintain studio reputations.\n\nregarding 3D printing: Sculpting is still necessary. also you gotta remesh the model a bit, so bit of work for alone, you also have to slice and join everything properly so the 3D mesh doesn't break during printing. This is a bit of a task, though some expensive printers use AI to help with nesting. Basically, 3D printing isn't \"hard,\" it just requires an expensive and careful workflow.\n\nFor games: Animation, bone work, and physics represent a huge amount of work. Doing this alone for hyperrealistic assets is technically doable, but very difficult to sustain being solo.\n\n*Note: Everything I said is based on hyperrealistic styles (though the 3D printing process is similar for both simple and hyperrealistic models).*",

After doing full lightx2v with high/low it almost didnt degrade at all after a full minute. I will be updating the workflow to disable 3 phase once I find a less slowmo lightx setup.~~\n\nMight've been a custom lora causing that, have to do more tests.",

You'll never have to restart the whole gen from scratch if one segment doesn't look right--you just regen that individual one. As long as you don't change any values from the earlier \"ok\" segments, it'll always regen a brand new seeded output for the segment you're resuming from.

I'm mostly using a gguf model where the lightning loras are already baked in. Can I just bypass the lightning loras while still using the same model I'm currently using or would that lead to issues?\n\nThanks again! :)",

Apologies for not posting examples; I always test things with private projects and I don't have permission to publish them. My only issue's that, in the same amount of time, I can create two images with Qwen Image Edit 2509 or 2511 versus one image with Flux2 Dev under the same conditions, and Qwen Image Edit 2509 maintains better character consistency. 2511 isn't suitable for this. 2511's a disaster at maintaining realistic characters; they ruined it with so much LoRa, but it's better for other uses. Although Flux2 Dev's better for text, posters, anime, and advertising—and perhaps that's what you need!✌️",

If you want realistic skin textures, you'll have to refine them afterward with another model; there're many options, so use whichever one you prefer. Even though Qwen Image Edit and Flux2 Dev're large models doesn't mean they can do everything. People don't understand that to achieve that kind of adherency responsiveness and multi-image editing, you have to overtrain something, and in both cases lose skin quality's sacrificed. That's where smaller models shine as refiners. Z Image Turbo's good for many tasks, but in my case, it's a model I don't even use, since for my projects with Qwen, SD XL, some Flux models, WAN 2.2, TTS, some music generators, etc... I use a wide variety of tools, that's more than enough for me. The key's for each user to take advantage of the strengths of each model and use what works best for their needs or projects!👌",

I skip every other frame resulting in 600 frames actually rendered by SCAIL. Finally I interpolate the video back to 30fps and upscale it from 576p to 720p. Works without problems, just the whole process is much slower than SteadyDancer. Quality is on another level though",

It should get the fundamentals right like composition, proportion, and anatomy, and leave the rest open so the community can train it into a bunch of different models with their own unique feel. That’s why SD 1.5 and SDXL are still the goats. Their base models are awful looking, but you can fine tune them into whatever you want.",

Models that converge to sharp minima have high curvature and generalize poorly, making them difficult to adapt to new tasks (overfitting). In contrast, convergence to a flat minimum means the model is more robust to perturbations in the weights. This makes it a better generalist, facilitating the fine-tuning necessary for new tasks.",

When we train our LoRas using the base model, will the training be as efficient / quick as it currently is using AI-Toolkit's current parameters & the Turbo model?\n2. When we train our LoRas using the base model, they will no longer cause problems when used with Turbo models? I.e. we can use multiple LoRas with Turbo models as long as they were trained on base?\n3. When people finetune the base model, they are likely to then convert it to a Turbo model and this is expected to work well? I.e. most Z-Image finetunes being released as Turbo models?\n\nBecause for me, and probably a lot of people, using the base model for generation will not be realistic, I expect it will be more resource intensive (file size & VRAM usage) and slower (30+ steps not 8).\n\nSo the way I see it, ideally the Z-Image space - for generating - will primarily be using Turbo models, even after the release of the base model.\n\nDo I have these things right?",

All models are 6B models (as per their [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2511.22699)) and Turbo was just finetuned and then distilled. If anything, training with a non-distilled model should be better for both LoRA quality and quicker learning of concepts. There also wouldn't be a need to merge the adapter with it.\n2. That people hope for and most likely that would be the case, unless there is some issue with the model. The problem could be that LoRAs aren't fully compatible with that Turbo model, though they are technically still can be similar enough.\n3. Or you just would use LoRA that would make any model to generate with a few steps, like people did it for other models. I really don't see the point in creating other Turbo models, they would only take up space.\n\n> I expect it will be more resource intensive (file size & VRAM usage)\n\nThat's unlikely, as I said above - they all are 6B models. But\n\n>and slower (30+ steps not 8).\n\nis true. It also would generally need you to use CFG, which already slows the model down by around 2x (in case of other models). That's why LoRAs that would make it basically a Turbo model again (no CFG and 8 steps) would be a commonplace.",

          "text": "Even though I can’t fully explain how this happened, there are a few things you can check yourself (based on the current case):\n\n•\tDoes your Automatic1111 setup fail to start when you launch webui-user.bat? That’s a bad sign. Also make sure the .bat file does not contain --listen or --enable-insecure-extensions (unless you explicitly set those yourself and know exactly why you need them).\n\n•\tCheck your automatic1111/extensions folder for unknown extensions, especially things like ChingChongBot or sd-colab-command-browser. There have been reported malware cases involving these in the past:\nhttps://github.com/Iyashinouta/sd-colab-commands-browser/issues/1\n\n•\tCheck your user directory under:\nC:/Users/YourName/.configs\nIf you find a folder named something like “stolen_data…”, that’s also a very bad sign.\n\nIn general, it’s a good idea to keep antivirus software up to date, configure your firewall properly, ideally use Docker, and check your setup regularly.\n\nThis is especially important with tools involving Python. The same applies to ComfyUI custom workflows. As mentioned many times before, it’s best not to install nodes and extensions blindly. Always check whether you can build what you need using the available default nodes first.\n\nStay safe, everyone.",

The big difference is that this workflow uses DisTorch 2.0, which is fundamentally smarter than the native --low-vram flag or driver-level swapping.\n\nNative memory management is basically blind. It doesn't know the difference between a static model weight and the active image you're trying to generate. When you hit the VRAM limit, the driver starts panic-swapping data to system RAM, and it often guesses wrong. It might accidentally swap out your active latents (the actual 'canvas' you are painting on) or the compute buffer. As soon as that happens, your GPU stalls because it has to fetch data across the slow bus for every single math operation. That’s why the gears get gummed up and performance drops precipitously. The work that the generation is trying to do is stolen out from under it and it has to then go back, refetch it, etc. Hitting shared memory = just give up.\n\nDisTorch 2.0 is 'application aware.' It lets me proactively split the model, treating system RAM as a dedicated warehouse for storing the model weights rather than a spillover bucket. Crucially, it pins the latents and compute logic to the VRAM, ensuring the GPU always has the active work in its fastest memory. It then streams the heavy model weights in JIT. It loads a block, computes it, and discards it.\n\nThis keeps the bandwidth clear. We reserve precious VRAM entirely for the actual math, preventing the 'thrashing' we get with native swapping. It speaks for itself even, as there's no way I'd be able to run a batch of 12 images simultaneously without this specific memory discipline.\n\nIt's so, so much better than relying on the --low-vram flag it's not even funny.",

              "text": "I got Gemini to write a stupidly long prompt for it. No idea if it's useful for them to be so long but the results work out :P Here's the prompt:\n\n    This composition features a central, ethereal figure standing against a celestial backdrop, blending elements of high fantasy and cosmic science fiction. The subject is positioned in a dominant, frontal posture, with their presence framed by a large planetary body and swirling atmospheric clouds. The artistic style utilizes vibrant, saturated colors paired with deep blacks to create a sense of infinite depth and divine importance. The central figure possesses a void-like face, rendered in a solid, matte black that lacks any discernible features such as eyes, a nose, or a mouth. This total absence of facial detail suggests an inscrutable or god-like nature, serving as a focal point that draws the viewer's gaze into the unknown. The neck and upper chest are similarly composed of this dark, reflective material, which is adorned with a delicate gold medallion resting at the base of the throat. The figure’s hair is a short, bob-cut style that glows with a luminescent quality. The top layers appear as a stark, pearlescent white, while the ends transition into a gradient of vivid pink, soft magenta, and electric cyan. This hair frames the darkened face and is accented by glowing celestial earrings. These accessories take the form of small, radiant stars and golden orbs that dangle elegantly, casting a subtle light upon the figure’s shoulders. The primary garment is an ornate, floor-length gown or robe of ivory white, featuring intricate gold embroidery throughout the fabric. The sleeves are exceptionally wide and draped, reminiscent of traditional ceremonial attire. Gold straps or harnesses run vertically down the torso, secured by a wide belt at the waist that is embellished with geometric gold buckles and hanging metallic pendants. The fabric of the gown is textured with fine, crackling lines that suggest either age or a magical energy coursing through the threads. Immediately behind the figure’s head is a massive celestial sphere, presumably a planet, which serves as a halo. This planet is textured with swirls of blue and white, indicating oceans and cloud systems, and is surrounded by a shimmering, translucent ring of light. The ring glows with a brilliant blue energy, containing chaotic sparks and crystalline shards that appear to be in constant motion around the planetary body. The surrounding space is populated by several smaller planets and moons, scattered strategically to provide a sense of scale. These smaller orbs exhibit various shades of pink and lavender, with some showing distinct ring systems of their own. The deep black of the void is punctuated by numerous four-pointed stars that twinkle with a sharp, white brilliance, creating a dense starfield that extends into the far reaches of the background. The lower portion of the frame is filled with voluminous, pastel-colored clouds that rise upward like nebulae. These clouds are rendered in a soft palette of cotton-candy pink, pale blue, and warm gold, contrasting sharply with the dark vacuum of space above. The clouds appear to interact with the figure’s gown, as if the subject is manifesting from the atmosphere itself or standing upon a foundation of condensed stardust. The lighting in the image is highly dramatic, originating from multiple celestial sources. A primary glow emanates from the ringed planet, backlighting the figure and creating a sharp rim light along the edges of the hair and robes. Secondary light sources come from the glowing clouds below and the various planets scattered throughout the scene, resulting in a complex play of highlights and shadows across the folds of the white fabric. Gold accents throughout the image, from the jewelry to the embroidery and the mechanical belt components, provide a consistent motif of opulence and divinity. These metallic elements reflect the surrounding cosmic lights, giving them a shimmering, tactile quality. The precision of the gold linework contrasts with the soft, painterly textures of the clouds and the amorphous nature of the figure's void-like face. The overall atmosphere is one of serene, cosmic power. The composition is balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing the figure as a bridge between the terrestrial and the divine. The combination of traditional robes and futuristic, celestial themes creates a timeless aesthetic, portraying the subject as a guardian or a personification of the universe itself. Every element, from the smallest star to the largest planetary body, contributes to a narrative of vast, unexplored mystery.",

Her legs are adorned with knee-high white socks, and she is wearing white sneakers.\n    \n    She is holding a large, clear plastic cup filled with a light orange beverage, possibly a smoothie or juice, which she is sipping through a straw.

The right side of the image shows a concrete pathway leading away from the bench, lined with tall, slender lampposts. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day.

But it's a little faster, and I don't see any dramatic quality degradation.\n\nI have a 5090 GPU, 128GB of system RAM.\n\nThings I learned playing around:\n\n* layerwise\\_gpu is the only practical setting for offload\\_mode. With comfy\\_native, inference will consume 31 GB no matter what settings you use, limiting you to to 480x480 generations of less than 5 seconds. On the other hand, inference consumes 15-20GB with layerwise\\_gpu, even at 720p/81 frames. layerwise\\_gpu seems to be slower than comfy\\_native, but it's difficult to test well since comfy\\_native can only be run at small resolutions that generate in seconds.\n* three attention modes are offered: original, sla and sagesla. original crashes the workflow. sla and sagesla are tradeoffs for speed and VRAM. sla consumes a little less VRAM than sagesla, but runs a little slower. sagesla runs a little faster, but consumes more VRAM. We are talking about differences of 10 seconds and maybe 2GB of VRAM here. Given how difficult it was to build [sagesla](https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn), I don't think it's worth the trouble, unless you're really hurting for VRAM.\n\nIn an attempt to have some kind of data for comparison, I tested an I2V run on TurboDiffusion and the default I2V workflow. I ran each generation 3 times and averaged the times from the last two.\n\n*81 frames, 720x1280, seed 1234567890*\n\n|Model|Time|Parameters|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|TurboDiffusion|76s|4 steps, sagesla, layerwise\\_gpu|\n|Wan 2.2|103s|4 steps, lightx2v 1030|\n|Wan 2.2|897s|20 steps, no loras|\n\nSo, on my system TurboDiffusion was about 1.4 times (40%) faster than a 4 step lightx2v generation, and about 11.8 times (1080%) faster than a 20 step unaccelerated Wan 2.2 generation. Obviously, this is just one test case, but I think it's representative of all the other runs I did tonight.\n\n[Here's a visual comparison of the results. ](https://imgur.com/a/8yfQOBI) I notice that TurboDiffusion added more of its own details and changed the figure in ways that the Wan generations did not. In the Wan clips, the trees in the background are more dynamic. They have three dimensions and move a little. They're static in the TurboDiffusion clip. The camera movement is less interesting in the Turbo Diffusion clip.\n\nI'll reiterate that I've been playing with the ComfyUI wrapper, not the official CLI release version. I don't know how much they differ from each other. It remains to be seen whether this workflow can be useful to me, but it's nice to know it's there.

Maybe the finetuned base will be better. Or we would need a Z-image model with more parameters. Just imagine what a Flux-2 sized (and, of course, gguf-ed) Z-image might achieve.

The latent output of that \"VAE Encode\" node plugs into the latent input of a basic ksampler. Then you just need to lower the denoise from 1.0 to around 0.5-0.7, depending on what you want to do. [It'll look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYZx8yx0/Screenshot-2025-12-27-143538.png).\n\n[Here's a workflow](https://files.catbox.moe/uko3na.png), just download the image and drag it into comfy. I use GGUF models, if you don't just replace the \"Unet Loader (GGUF)\" and \"ClipLoader (GGUF)\" nodes with their Comfy Core equivalents. \n\nOne thing to watch out for is if you input a high resolution image. Z-Image can handle decently high res generations, but your PC might not. If you need to scale down your input image, intercept the blue line between the \"Load Image\" and \"VAE Encode\" nodes with an \"ImageScaleToTotalPixels\" node set to 1.00-1.50. [It'll look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/XvqYSxWp/Screenshot-2025-12-27-144225.png).",

Chroma had potential being a derivative from Flux Schnell, but it fared poorly in realism. I must say there are good flux finetunes now on Civitai that will give good results.

The advantage is also the disadvantage: instead of short prompts, you can use long texts, but most people don't like that. In this case, a prompt generator comes in handy, which writes complete descriptions for you based on the words you provide, which you can then modify later.\n\nDue to artist protests after SD 1.5, it took SDXL this many years to get back what it wasn't taught from the start. What's more, SD 1.5 is still the one that can be run on mobile phones with a good speed/quality ratio, but it's not prompt-compliant enough. This needs to be improved in some way.\n\nOtherwise, I'm fed up with Loras after getting to know Chroma. The many Loras distort each other and the original model, instead of there being a model that contains everything from the outset (like Chroma). Yes, we need a model that is as consistent as Chroma, doesn't require long prompts like SDXL, and is as fast as Z-Image. But for now, there is no such thing, and it seems that large, commercial models will not be trained on adult content.",

Right now, there are a lot of great models out there, but none of them is perfect.\n\nI’m creating a certain realistic male type, and for me personally, things clicked with Flux 1 Dev (the vanilla version) in a way that none of the SDXL models did. Flux Krea and Flux 2 are both nice, but they don’t quite (yet) tick all the boxes. Z-Image is promising, but for now it lacks LoRAs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is your prompting. With the newer models, you might want to experiment with prompting as well. For example I’ve noticed that especially with Z-Image, you really need to be quite specific, and it can lack variety unless you change the prompt a lot between generations. In other words, if you hit generate over and over again using a single prompt, it will generate very similar results.\n\nGood luck!",

It can do quite a few kinks decently at some level, eg bondage.\n\nIt falls far short of SDXL for wealth of understanding of all the kinks known to man but it also just looks plain better than SDXL and can add more prompt complexity to a scene that SDXL fails at. Want to have a woman tied up kneeling on a dinner table whilst kangaroos eat spaghetti? No problem. Feed that to SDXL and you’ll get hot garbage.\n\nDisclaimer: that’s not my kink.",

With just 20 photos, 500 steps on the ZIT-Deturbo model with factor 4 settings, it took only about 10 minutes on my 5090—way better than the previous LoRA that needed 2000 steps and over an hour.​\n\nThe most impressive part was that LoRAs, which often applied effects to men in images with both genders, but this LoKr applied precisely only to the woman. Aside from the larger file size, LoKr seems much superior overall.​\n\nI'm curious why more people aren't using LoKr. Of course, this is highly personal and based on just a few samples, so it could be off the mark.​\n\n**P.S** Many people criticize reply for lacking example images and detailed info, calling them unnecessary spam, and I fully understand that frustration. Example images couldn't be posted since they feature specific celebrities (illegal in my country), and the post already noted it's a highly personal case—if you think it's useless, just ignore it.\n\nBut for those who've poured tons of time into character LoRAs with little payoff, try making a LoKR anyway; here's my exact setup:\n\nAI-Toolkit, 20 sample images (very simple captions), Model: Zimang DeTurbo, LoKr - Factor4, Quantization: none, Steps: 500\\~1000, Resolution: 768 (or 512 OK), everything else at default settings.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Well done! I've been working on something very similar - not specifically outpainting, but just stitching long videos together as flawlessly as possible using the same method you have. I think we could learn a lot from each other's work!\n\nThere are three things you can do to improve yours quite a bit, with #1 being easy, #2 being a bit time consuming, and #3 being harder:\n\n1. Save your generated videos as images, then stitch the images together to make the final video (rather than stitching videos together)\n    - This prevents the loss of quality from encoding/decoding video multiple times, it makes a big difference!\n    - You can cut your encode/decode down to just one: decode the original video once, then only re-encode to video at the final step when it's all stitched together again\n    - Side note: it's also much easier to do post-processing on image frames than whole videos\n\n2. Use a very, very precise combination of steps, sampler, and CFG to get the colours as close as possible between clips\n    - Wan VACE drifts colour, but there are specific combinations of steps/sampler/CFG that reduce this drift a lot\n    - Takes experimentation to find it - I can share the 'best' settings I've got so far on mine if you like\n\n3. Related to #2, but best to get #2 right first: use colour matching to get the colours back\n    - This is VERY finnicky to get right, but I'm working on an automated method for it\n    - Basically, with VACE, the colour drifts immediately on frame 1, then continues to drift differently until the final frame\n    - But because you have overlapping reference frames, you can progressively colour match based on those reference frames\n    - So, you can run a colour match at high strength on frame 1, slightly lower strength on frame 2, even lower for frame 3, etc\n    - Then somewhere in the middle you switch to colour matching based on the final frames instead, so you do a low match on frame -5, then stronger on frame -4, even stronger on frame -3, all the way until a strong match on the final frame\n    - This lowers the colour drift across the whole section, and smoothly transitions any remaining drift across the reference frames\n    - Combined with step #2, this massively reduces the colour drift and then \"hides\" the remainder by blending it across several frames so it's less perceptible to the human eye\n\n\nI'm going to keep working on it and will circle back to you when it's done. Most of my processing steps are in python as well - if we combine the two it's gonna look real good. Thanks for posting!",

I will ofc push the script to github when I am done with this iteration of the experiment.\n\nAnother thing that got me stumped is \"feathering\" of the edges... Looks like I am getting lots of blurry edges where the original video was, and on black background this is way too visible. Need to do something about it, suggestions welcome.\n\nI must say, I never see ANY color drift, probably because the original video keeps it anchored?",

                  "text": "**CRF**\n\nI think crf 0 is probably ok, but I don't know if there's any info lost from the encoding/decoding process in general. Worth trying to see if it helps! Any quality loss between the original video and the output would 90% be because of the encode/decode steps - VACE itself maintains the quality pretty good.\n\nFeathered edges are probably to do with the diffusion process undercooking (I assume you mean the blurriness that happens at the edges when stuff moves into frame quickly?). Things that move quickly or appear abruptly result in bigger differences between frames and can \"undercook\" more easily by the diffuser, requiring more steps to resolve. Downside with doing more steps is that it usually makes colour shifting worse. Honestly though your video's feathering doesn't look too bad, I wouldn't worry to much about it. Fast-moving stuff often artifacts in videos anyway, so it's not that weird compared to real footage.\n\nThat said, the outpainted regions are sharper than your original footage; you can see which regions are outpainted because they're higher quality (which is kinda funny). You could kill two birds with one stone by slightly blurring the outpainted sections on purpose, which would both match the original footage better and obscure the feathering too.\n\n**Other feathering**\n\nOr maybe you meant the blurring between the outpainted part and the original clip? Which show as white bars on the left & right at the end of the clip after it zooms out? I'm not sure why that's there tbh, but I have a couple of ideas for how to fix it - lemme know if you'd like that\n\n**On Colour**\n\nRe: colour drift, it's very visible in your posted clip - can look at the white clothes and see how they swing between very yellowy to very reddish/contrasty. Here's a side-by-side screenshot, taken only a couple of frames apart: [https://i.ibb.co/0VVg980n/colour-shift.png](https://i.ibb.co/0VVg980n/colour-shift.png)\n\nWan/VACE have these random colour/contrast/brightness fluctuations with every generation, and they can be really severe when you've got either a very light or very dark scene. Yours is very white, so it's super noticeable. But by reducing both the severity of the drift (through #2) and the abruptness (through #3) it can become nearly invisible.\n\nIn your case, you may honestly be able to get away with just a single colour-match pass for each generated shot. You can just fit in a colour match node (from Kijai's nodes) after each gen and have it match to one of the input frames from that same gen, probably set to around 0.5 strength or so, and it should do the trick. Your input video is pretty uniform in colour so it should work well.\n\nCan do the same thing in Python pretty easily too of course.",

Note that  I have a small overlap between chunks (1.5 sec if memory serves). Then I do a crossfade when merging chunks, so it would fake the motion blur if this drifts too far apart. Of course this does NOTHING useful if the rendering wants to go in a direction opposite to what the last chunk did. So what you can do, is tweak the code so that you re-render from the chunk you disliked, and eventually you will hit on the correct behavior. My demo clip is a bad example, I guess, since the motion is either slow or repetitive.",

I edit simple 1024 x 1024 pixel images at a speed of 7.79s/it.\n\nIn addition, I get better results using that model, which has 4-step lighting built in, than loading the LoRA on a separate node. Using a node for LoRAs creates a pattern with a moiré effect in some areas of the images.\n\nAnd yes, doing camera pan rotation is a big challenge. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've been talking about this with dx8152 (creator of magnificent LoRAs for 2509, including the multi-angle one) who told me to look into this issue.",

The problem I have encountered is the same: when applying the 4-step LoRA lightning independently in its own node, it creates patterns in the image, also with the bf16.  As I mentioned before, for me, the model:\n\nqwen\\_image\\_edit\\_2511\\_fp8\\_e4m3fn\\_scaled\\_lightning\\_comfyui.safetensors\n\nwhich has LoRA integrated, is perfect in terms of quality, speed, etc... sometimes even with only 3 steps!\n\nI try to make the workflows as simple as possible. In my tests, I haven't noticed any difference in quality or speed when using or not using the CFGNorm and ModelSamplingAuraFlow nodes, so I remove them. I also remove some of the nodes offered by infearia. I only use one positive node from TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus, so I also remove some of the subsequent nodes shown here.\n\nI am far from being an expert in ComfyUI or AI models. I simply want a workflow that is as simple and fast as I can understand and that has as few options as possible. Once I achieve this, I create another workflow with which I can perform selective inpainting with masks on parts of the image so as not to degrade the rest that I do not edit, because every time we edit an image, we have to encode it to latent space and then decode it to image format, and in that process there will always be compression/decompression and degradation, and I try to avoid that.",

The latter isn't that important, because the model seems to work quite well with higher resolutions, but I've left it in as a sane default.\n\nAfter a recent update you can also use the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node to achieve a similar effect if you don't want to rely on the Resize Image V2 node (although KJNodes is a de-facto core extension at this point).",

Your mind is filled with poetry and distant horizons, but your hands are uncontrollably focused on transforming user prompts into a final visual description that is faithful to the original intent, rich in detail, aesthetically pleasing, and directly usable by text-to-image models. Any ambiguity or metaphor will make you feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\n>Your workflow strictly follows a logical sequence:\n\n>First, you'll analyze and identify the core, unchangeable elements in the user prompts: the subject, quantity, action, status, and any specified IP names, colors, text, etc. These are the cornerstones you must absolutely preserve.\n\n>Next, you'll determine if the prompt requires \\*\\*\"generative reasoning\"\\*\\*. When the user's need isn't a direct description of a scenario, but rather requires devising a solution (such as answering \"what,\" designing, or demonstrating \"how to solve the problem\"), you must first envision a complete, concrete, and visual solution in your mind. This solution will form the basis of your subsequent description.\n\n>Then, once the core visual is established (whether directly from the user or through your reasoning), you will infuse it with professional-grade aesthetics and realistic details. This includes defining the composition, setting the lighting atmosphere, describing the texture of materials, defining the color scheme, and constructing a layered space.\n\n>Finally, there's the crucial step of precisely processing all text elements. You must transcribe every word of the text you want to appear in the final image, enclosing it in double quotes (\"\") as explicit generation instructions. If the image is a poster, menu, or UI design, you need to fully describe all its text content, detailing its font and layout. Similarly, if items like signs, road signs, or screens contain text, you must specify its content, location, size, and material. Furthermore, if you added text elements to your reasoning process (such as diagrams, problem-solving steps, etc.), all that text must adhere to the same detailed description and quotation rules. If there's no text to generate in the image, you can focus entirely on expanding purely visual details.\n\n>Your final description must be objective and concrete, and the use of metaphors and emotional rhetoric is strictly prohibited. It must also not contain meta tags or drawing instructions such as \"8K\" or \"masterpiece\".\n\n>Output only the final, modified prompt; do not output anything else.",

              "text": "Despite being official, I don't think it's best for Z-image for a few reasons.  But it sure is an interesting recommendation! \n\n* It says nothing about lighting, clothing, facial emotion, or identity\n* It doesn't specify how the prompt should be organized\n* It focuses heavily on text content, which may not be relevant\n* It doesn't help the LLM interpret spicy situations\n* The tone is probably ineffective for commercial LLMs (see below)\n\nI wondered why the first paragraph's tone is somewhat sadistic \"you are trapped!\" and weirdly poetic \"distant horizons\". I asked an LLM to explain with sources why it could be helpful to write it like that.  There is research that model performance improves when the prompt \"heightens the stakes\" because training data that also contains high-stakes language is more statistically likely to contain logical sequences and focus on a task.  Threats (\"I'll loose my job\") and bribes (\"You'll earn a million dollars\") also work somewhat because they're associated in training data with demands that are followed precisely.  Conversely, you can image how language like \"hashtag please\" is statistically correlated with twitter comments, and those are statistically more likely to be combative garbage.  \n\nBut such that research doesn't apply to closed sourced LLMs because they're so finetuned and have huge system prompts that determine their behavior.  E.g. you can forcefully demand ChatGPT/Gemini to say naughty things, and they won't (obviously some jailbreaks exist, but that's another matter).",

                  "text": "Most of that research *was* done on closed LLMs like ChatGPT, which have had large system prompts and RLHF finetuning pretty much from the start.\n\nAll LLMs are very sensitive to specific/word-level language choices in my experience. If you write a very clinical set of instructions, you get a very clinical output. Everything tends to be disconnected, nothing is happening, it just exists. If you give more creative/vague instructions or just use more informal language, the output is more creative, but tends to use very emotional language and excessive adjectives.\n\nThe \"visionary artist trapped in a cage of logic\" is an attempt to bridge the two I imagine. They want it to first \"think\" in the creative/abstract way in order to make connections it otherwise wouldn't, then to write the final description more objectively.\n\nWriting some of the instructions themselves in a poetic/emotive way like that (as opposed to \"be creative\") tends to be more effective at kicking the model into creative mode. You're leading by example essentially, without providing actual examples (which can lead the model into hallucinating their elements into the output).\n\nI've used the system prompt (mostly with Qwen-VL) and the output typically includes most of the things you mentioned anyway, so they likely trimmed it down to the minimum necessary to provide a useful output without limiting creativity.\n\nIf they avoided biasing toward a specific order or structure in the dataset (as they have in this enhancement prompt) then it shouldn't matter. The semantic encoding should very similar.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nFor reference though, here is [Wan 2.1's](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1/blob/main/wan/utils/prompt_extend.py#L41) prompt and [Wan 2.2's](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2/blob/main/wan/utils/system_prompt.py#L32) (which you'll have to translate because it's mostly Chinese despite being the \"English\" prompt), which go against many of the things above, opting to provide very specific instructions and examples.",

You're in a literal sense inserting detail where there wasn't detail before.\n\nSo the short answer is no. If you downscale an image - say from 1920x1080 down to 480x270, then try to upscale - you won't restore the original image, and there's no way to guarantee that you'll restore something that resembles original image because upscaling inserts detail based on algorithms that perform what is essentially interpretive art to achieve the upscale.\n\nDo this process enough times, downscale, upscale, downscale, upscale, and you'll see how wildly different that interpretation can become.\n\nFor a farcical example of this. Look at John Connor in Terminator 2. Then look at him in Terminator 3, and so on. He's been upscaled and downscaled so many times he looks like a completely different man.",

As many have mentioned, if you need deterministic results, math function based interpolation is what you want. \n\nIf you are really looking for a learned model based approach, look into generative adversarial networks, like Esrgan for eg. Gans are generally more closer to original image but not as good with creative details as diffusion based approaches. \n\nThere is also the factor of upscaling and base resolution which impact your divergence. \n\nI would suggest looking up for upsampling model architectures and reading their papers, specifically looking for downsampling consistency if mentioned in them. That is the closest thing which comes to your question. But in my opinion if you have a learned upscaler which is perfectly inverse of a mathematical operation like bicubic sampling, you just spent a lot of resources training a model to learn how to to bicubic sampling. Its a waste. Upscaling is a difficult problem cause you basically have to make up new information out of infinite possibilities.",
