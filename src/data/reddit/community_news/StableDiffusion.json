The adult humans don’t have a “childish misunderstanding of what acting is,” they are intentionally acting as children since they are stand-ins for the generated child characters they are being replaced with. This is on purpose, they were hired to do this.\n\nThe idea that these actors were accidentally acting like children because they didn’t know how to act as adults is funny though",

My read on it is they know exactly what they're doing, it's just you need more stage acting skills than film acting skills for this kind of performance transfer to work well. At least for now.\n\nStage actors need to play for the benefit of the people in the back of the crowd, so all their movements and expressions are exaggerated to make it obvious what's happening. Pro wrestlers are especially good at this, you can make out John Cena's expression from the back seat of an arena.\n\nFilm actors are more subtle, with smaller natural movements and micro-expressions that would be completely lost on a person further away than a couple feet, but that's fine because everyone watching is only as far away as the camera.\n\nOnce you compress your video of the film actors doing their film acting to the right input resolution, then use the VAE to compress it further, is there enough information left in their movements for the model to really latch onto?\n\nCompare the facial expressions when the goblin is touching the car at 00:43. Despite the overacted facial expression from the actor, it's a little more subtle than her other expressions so doesn't translate to the character at all. If the model can't translate that exaggerated expression, it doesn't stand a chance reproducing a real expression of awe and wonder.",

On the counter sits a white ceramic fruit bowl placed slightly off-center to the right. Inside the bowl are clearly visible incorrectly colored fruits: a blue banana, a bright purple orange, a red lime, a glossy black apple, and a translucent green strawberry with its seeds visible inside the fruit.\n\nNext to and slightly closer to the camera than the bowl is a clear glass of water. The fruit bowl and fruit are accurately reflected and refracted through the curved surface of the glass with realistic distortion, and the glass casts a soft shadow to the left. Tiny water droplets are visible on the counter near the glass.\n\nBehind the bowl is a rectangular mirror tile backsplash. The mirror reflection shows the back of the fruit bowl and the window light source, but does not show the camera. Faint fingerprints are visible on the mirror surface.\n\nOn the counter to the left of the bowl are exactly three asymmetrically arranged objects: a small metal spoon bent slightly upward with a small scratch on its surface, a folded yellow sticky note with visible paper texture and the handwritten text “7:42 PM”, and a single black chess knight piece. The spoon points toward the bowl, and the chess knight points away from the bowl.\n\nOn the right side of the bowl there is only one object: a half-peeled orange whose fruit inside is normal orange color, but whose outer peel is shaped into sharp geometric cube-like edges.\n\nLighting is strong directional daylight from the right with soft fill shadows, realistic ray-traced reflections, sharp but natural shadows, and no studio lighting look. The materials are physically accurate: glass, metal, ceramic, paper, and fruit surfaces rendered realistically. Camera uses a 50mm lens with shallow depth of field, focus on the fruit bowl and the front rim of the glass, with slightly softer background reflections. Hyperrealistic photograph style, high dynamic range, natural color grading, extreme material and optical accuracy.\"\n\n  \nI'm reasonably impressed",

You start out with Z-base 1megapixel image size then you use UltimateSDupcaler with the turbo model to upscale the final result to 3-4x for faster speed at 8 steps. Because if you try to use z-base to upscale it would take far too long, turbo i the best model to use for upscaling. Then again you'd have to do the upscaling at a very low denoise or you'd lose all your gains from the base prompt adherence. I tend to avoid SeedVR as an upscaler because it makes images far too soft.",

Then I got into comfyui, then I started writing my own nodes, then I learned how to train a LoRA and what the process behind that was.\n\nThen I wrote a classification system that uses face recognition to sort images into groups based on who's in the photo - and then grade them based on resolution and sharpness of the face area - this gives me pools of potential LoRA training data. Then I learned how to use Google's APIs to put a name to a face for those groups of images, and then merge islands of image collections that are actually the same person (but perhaps different ages or styles).\n\nSo, gateway into AI and machine learning.",

I then signed up for the Stable Diffusion beta and managed to get invited. When the model and software were first released, they required 6 GB VRAM and I only had a 4 GB card, so I had to wait for someone to implement a low VRAM fix. I started with the Basu Jindal repo. It was very primitive: just the base SD 1.4 model and a simple command line interface. I then switched to A1111 when it started to take off.\n\nOne reason I switched to A1111, apart from the graphical user interface, was that it supported negative prompts. Without it, SD 1.4 and 1.5 would give you lots of nudity regardless of whether you wanted it or not. Many of the anime models that appeared after the NovelAI leak were even worse.",

And then flux came out, and I upgraded to the 3090...\n\nFor me, it's a question of immediately seeing the future, I guess? Like you can look at this stuff and you can immediately tell it has applications and use cases and being on top of that so you're not behind in five years seems kind of important. \n\nLike, right now it's like it's 2001 and you don't have to have email, or 2015 and you don't have to have linkedin. Right now, you don't need to know about AI stuff. But in five years? It's going to be weird if you don't know about AI stuff. Like it's 2006 and you don't have an email or today and don't have linkedin. People are going to be like 'ah, one of those people.' Like your stubborn friend who refused to get a smartphone long after it became clear this was the future going forward. \n\nAnd well, the ability to make stuff at will doesn't hurt.",

Both my music and AI rigs have been on ice for a few months so I really haven't messed with anything in a while.

It's mainly because I have interest in a very narrow amount of things and the amount of available human content couldn't satisfy me.\n\nI used to love browsing DeviantArt just to see all the amazing fanart of media I love, but it became harder and harder to find things I liked. With Youtube/Tiktok, I also only watched very few types of content. I virtually stopped watching movies/shows simply because nothing interests me anymore.\n\nWhen AI generation appeared, I imagined a future where I could get unlimited amount of content specifically tailored to my taste. I got into doing it locally partially because I wanted to learn more but also because I figured I had to do it that way to get content that specifically suited me.\n\nNow I understand the future I imagine is unlikely to be fully realized. I can certainly create all the artwork I want easily and, one day, I can probably create Tiktok/Youtube-style videos very easily. But I probably won't live to see the day when GPUs/AI models become powerful enough that I can do Hollywood-level movies/shows easily.",

Later learned of SD and managed to get it working with A1111 (quite a journey actually). Saw potential for generating game assets, bought better GPU, tried to come up with (manual) workflows in A1111. ComfyUI came around then. Tried to recreate the workflows in ComfyUI with some success. Stopped using AI (because life). Got back to it at least twice, bought an even better GPU. New models appear to do everything out of the box and my old workflows I worked on are no longer needed.\n\nHaven't used finetunes since SDXL. For the stuff I generate base models seem fine (even if I need anime style).\n\nImage gen is useful for game dev and game dev is my hobby.",

I initially approached AI for purposes related to upscaling raster graphics, which was miraculous for the purpose compared to what could be done directly in Photoshop, and also for video with Topaz Photo AI and Topaz Video AI. After that, I began to realize that AI could also be used to create reference images or even to create objects (without the limitations of Firefly) to cut out in Photoshop and use for compositing. After that, I truly became passionate about full-fledged generation, both of video and images, but in this case, I consider it a passion in my spare time, unrelated to work.",

For whatever fucking reason, comfy recently changed so that some random seeds no longer randomize on hitting run.\n\nSo if I load up the Flux Klein 9b edit workflow for example and hit run twice, it will run once to generate and image, and the second 'run' will simply reuse the exact same parameters and seed, skipping the generation and putting out the same image as if I was on fixed seed.\n\nThe only way I've found to change this behaviour is to use a random number generator and input that into the seed, then it properly randomizes each run. This allows me to hit generate 3 times and actually get 3 different images.\n\nIt has its downsides, but it's far more annoying needing to manually change the seed each run.",

The workflow is nightmare spaghetti with several inputs, but it works well and reliably for me for a range of prompts.\n\nThe following compares the default Z-Image Turbo workflow with my custom workflow, using identical prompts.

She is statuesque and ethereal, with impossibly long, flowing platinum-gold hair that arcs around her like a fragmented halo, some strands braided into elegant, crown-like loops. Her skin is pale and luminous, with faint hairline cracks like aged marble hinting at both divinity and ruin. She wears a regal, asymmetrical white-and-gold gown fused with ancient ceremonial armor: layered plates engraved with runes, draped cloth that hangs like sacred vestments, and delicate chains and sigils that glow softly.\n\n\n\nThe style blends refined anime aesthetics with Art Nouveau curves and borders, plus dramatic Baroque-inspired lighting: a blinding, holy backlight creating a halo effect, deep shadows across her face and body, and shafts of dust-filled light cutting through the scene. Behind her, the faint silhouette of a colossal golden tree and broken holy architecture dissolves into mist. Her expression is serene, sorrowful, and unfathomably powerful, eyes shining with muted gold light as if holding a shattered world inside them. The overall mood is one of fractured divinity and ancient, golden royalty—majestic, sacred, and slightly tragic, rendered in ultra-detailed, painterly realism fused with anime and Art Nouveau ornamentation.\n\nRes\\_multistep  \nsimple  \nDenoise 0.98  \nSeed: 940289160578048",

So 2601 would be next. Or, now that Klein has appeared as a competitor, they might finally release...\n\nThough, if they don't release Z Image this time either........................",

I know there are fine tunes to make turbo an edit model but I want to see it from the box.\n\nCall me wrong but im addicted to making super realistic pics of me and my daughter in wrong pictures to send to my mother. Me and Epstein at a random party, my daughter sitting in a car where the window is broken and shes hot wiring it. You know the sort of thing.

I have 12GB VRAM and can comfortably run it with both the model and text encoder quantized in FP8, so I'm sure you'd be able to run it in some gguf quantization, even if it's Q4.\n\nI don't know how easy it will be to train Loras of you and your kid on Z-Image Turbo, though, as Turbo models are difficult to train. Z-Image Base should make it easier to train Loras once released, but I'd expect it to be at least 5x slower than the Turbo version.\n\nYou should also take a look at Flux Klein. I've heard it's even better than Z-Image for lower-end machines. Its main downsides, like being bad for NSFW and kinda-restrictive licenses, are definitely not an issue for your use case.",

Some influencers have gone even further and started dissolving lip fillers in favor of their original appearance. Of course, there are still plenty of people stuck in the past.\n\nThe same goes for color grading, heavy “creative” color work has fallen out of fashion, with images kept much closer to RAW.\n\nAnd all of this is because people started, and are still continuing, to produce huge amounts of overly polished images in Midjourney and similar tools",

It's really slow but the images I get are spot on and you can reduce resolution down to 1024x1024 for faster speeds but you're reducing the detail a lot and at that point it's better to just use the others if you want HQ with fast production times.\n\nI would say though if you do have the Vram and are more interested in quality of image than speed then this setup is worth going for, especially if you like to train character lora's because they stack very well with other lora's\n\nGive it a go guys even with lower end hardware and you might be surprised how much quality you can get.",

I can't imagine that most other people, whose cards are slower, would find it useable. \n\nBut the other thing is that Qwen's way of making models is inherently counter-productive to adoption. The fact that Qwen has multiple numbered versions and nothing made for one is compatible with any other is not a selling point. If you were going to train loras or fine tunes, you wouldn't go 'let me train it for every new version' you'd go 'let me wait to see which version is the adopted one and then I'll do it' which means that inevitably no one trains anything for it.",

      "text": "We just shipped a new LTX-2 drop focused on one thing: making video generation easier to iterate on without killing VRAM, consistency, or sync.\n\nIf you’ve been frustrated by LTX because prompt iteration was slow or outputs felt brittle, this update is aimed directly at that.\n\nHere’s the highlights, the [full details are here.](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/ltx-2-better-control-for-real-workflows)\n\n# What’s New\n\n**Faster prompt iteration (Gemma text encoding nodes)**  \n**Why you should care:** no more constant VRAM loading and unloading on consumer GPUs.\n\nNew ComfyUI nodes let you save and reuse text encodings, or run Gemma encoding through our free API when running LTX locally.\n\nThis makes Detailer and iterative flows much faster and less painful.\n\n**Independent control over prompt accuracy, stability, and sync (Multimodal Guider)**  \n**Why you should care:** you can now tune quality without breaking something else.\n\nThe new Multimodal Guider lets you control:\n\n* Prompt adherence\n* Visual stability over time\n* Audio-video synchronization\n\nEach can be tuned independently, per modality. No more choosing between “follows the prompt” and “doesn’t fall apart.”\n\n**More practical fine-tuning + faster inference**  \n**Why you should care:** better behavior on real hardware.\n\nTrainer updates improve memory usage and make fine-tuning more predictable on constrained GPUs.\n\nInference is also faster for video-to-video by downscaling the reference video before cross-attention, reducing compute cost. (Speedup depend on resolution and clip length.)\n\nWe’ve also shipped new ComfyUI nodes and a unified LoRA to support these changes.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nThis drop isn’t a one-off. The next LTX-2 version is already in progress, focused on:\n\n* Better fine detail and visual fidelity (new VAE)\n* Improved consistency to conditioning inputs\n* Cleaner, more reliable audio\n* Stronger image-to-video behavior\n* Better prompt understanding and color handling\n\n[More on what's coming up here.](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/the-road-ahead-for-ltx-2)\n\n# Try It and Stress It!\n\nIf you’re pushing LTX-2 in real workflows, your feedback directly shapes what we build next.

The quantized weights take up maybe 13-14GB of VRAM. So still a lot, but much less than the existing LTX-2 text encoder nodes, which don't quantize them at all.\n\nSeems to work alright. Only downside is the quantized weights need to be discarded from VRAM after the node is done (rather than simply moved to RAM), as it would otherwise take up too much system RAM. But quantizing the weights only takes a couple seconds.\n\nSo in theory, with this approach, if you can already use the Gemma3 12B model for prompt encoding (which ComfyUI does by passing the prompt embeddings into the forward pass of the model, and then pulling out the weights from the 49 hidden layers, and then combining them and passing them to the embeddings connector model), you can also use it for LLM inference.\n\nAPI-based generation always seems a bit iffy.",

The woman on the right has very long straight hair parted in the middle, she is very pale with freckles, a pink t-shirt with pokemon on it and she is smiling, she has a dark blue eyepatch. \"\n\nNotice the woman on the right's hair is actually straight and her skin is more pale as prompted, helping make the women actually look more different.

Two very different young beautiful caucasian women sit next to each other next to a piano, the woman on the left has dark contoured glossy lipstick, white glasses, short bobcut hair and and is wearing an elegant shiny dress and she looks serious, she has a beauty spot on her left cheek. The woman on the right has very long straight hair parted in the middle, she is very pale with freckles, a pink t-shirt with pokemon on it and she is smiling, she has a dark blue eyepatch. The scene is bathed in bright natural daylight streaming through large windows revealing blurred green foliage outside, the room is dark, creating soft diffused illumination without harsh shadows,  the composition centers her within the frame from a close-up perspective capturing their face, lighting appears evenly distributed across subject's skin, highlighting textures. Shallow depth-of-field blurs background trees softly enhancing focus on their face; atmosphere conveys intimate domestic tranquility infused with gentle sensuality via the face form.\"\n\nNotice how less generic the faces are while following the prompt better.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2c71gi2v0gg1.jpeg?width=1910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ceccca6a6237508ca2e84ca5c8a815bb1c9f1c1",

Qwen was never known for that beyond a small subset, whereas Klein can do far more so this would be even more successful.  Edit: Ok I got it working. For some reason the filename on their lora is 2509, but it barely works with that, giving bad results. Throwing it on qwen edit 2511 and the 2511 4 step lightning lora works great and transfers styles extremely well about 85-90% of the time. It seems some of the ones I tried were a bit tough for it.",

While Gemini 2.0 native image gen had good understanding already, the image quality just wasn't there. \n\nIdk, probably additional post-training to help it output pleasing, natural images rather than just the \"raw\" base model output? And lots of training for edits too? Plus, aesthetic \"taste\" to steer it towards real-looking photos rather than the deep fried cinematic look of other models.\n\nEither way, having a very smart \"LLM\" base model with all of that image understanding \"built-in\" is what has enabled greatly improved prompt understanding and editing etc.",

If it's closer to 13B, it might be usable.\n\nThe big boy is 170GB in size, but appears to be bf16. I would get the best inference time when using fp8, so about 85GB in size. I'm not sure if I even have that kind of space on my SSD (upgrades seem to be too expensive). Maybe if Q2 GGUF (should be around 20ish GB) comes out and ComfyUI supports it, I'll give it a shot for the novelity sake, but inference that takes more than a minute is unusable for me on my local machine.",

Its like asking the Chef for a plain bowl of soup and getting a plain bowl of soup but you expected a fancy bowl of soup.\n\nTry this and report back....\n\nA hyper-realistic, medium-close-up cinematic portrait of a Russian woman in her late 20s with a gentle, nostalgic expression, seated by a frosted window while cradling a vintage, well-loved teddy bear against her chest. Her eyes are soft and slightly reflective, suggesting a quiet moment of comfort, while she wears a thick, cream-colored cable-knit wool sweater with intricate, visible fiber textures. Her hands are wrapped protectively around the bear, which is made of honey-colored mohair featuring slight love-worn patches and classic glass button eyes that catch a glint of light. The scene is illuminated by the soft, diffused \"blue hour\" twilight filtering through the window, beautifully contrasted by the warm, amber glow of a nearby fireplace just out of frame, creating a delicate rim light along her hair and the sweater’s wool. Fine dust motes dance in the warm air, and the background is a soft-focus bokeh of a cozy living room with blurred bookshelves and a dim lamp. Shot on 35mm film with a Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic, the image utilizes a shallow depth of field at f/1.8 to ensure the focus remains sharp on her eyes and the tactile textures of the bear. The composition features a high dynamic range to capture the transition from deep shadows to soft highlights, rendering every detail from the individual fuzz on the mohair to the crystalline frost on the windowpane in ultra-detailed 8k resolution. The color grading is a professional cinematic balance of cool teals and warm oranges, ensuring photorealistic skin textures, natural pores, and anatomically perfect hands for a soulful, high-end masterpiece.",

For example, Civit has a commercial license to run Flux, and they also allow using any of the Flux loras (i.e. commercial use of people's loras). The LTX-2 license has language allowing this also.\n\nThe CircleStone license is basically the Flux license, with several things simplified and removed, and some things clarified. This is one of the things that is clarified. The intention is not to be overly restrictive (except for commercial use), and make it clear that any platform that gets a commercial license can also run all the loras. Again, this is already how it works with many existing models.\n\nThe reason for not using a true open source license, but rather a non-commercial open-weights license, is because I'm just one person and training this thing is extremely expensive. If I can't monetize it, it's the last large finetune I'll ever do. I would like to train an Anima 2 one day, or an Anima Video, but it just isn't viable without having some way to make money. I felt like an open-weights strategy where people can use the model freely but I can make some money off big inference platforms, is the best play.",

I completely understand why a non-commercial license makes sense given the cost of training, and the quality of Anima really shows the work you’ve put into it.\n\nUnless I’m misunderstanding something, my remaining concern is still specific to section 3(c.).\nAs far as I understand it, the FLUX and LTX-2 licenses don’t include an automatic grant of rights over user-created LoRAs back to the licensor. In those ecosystems, commercial use of community LoRAs is usually handled through platform Terms of Service, rather than through the base model license itself, at least to my knowledge. Please correct me here if I’m wrong.\n\nBy contrast, 3(c.) appears to give any commercial licensee the right to use all Derivatives regardless of where they’re published, with an explicit waiver of creator compensation. Since LoRAs and fine-tunes are defined as Derivatives, this removes the creator’s ability to decide whether, how, or by whom their Derivatives are commercially used, even though they themselves are not allowed to use them commercially.\n\nI understand the motivation of avoiding per-LoRA negotiations for licensed platforms, but as written this could make people hesitant to invest serious compute into fine-tuning.\n\nThanks again for engaging openly on this. Looking forward to seeing where Anima goes!",

Probably not, but it's a generational improvement over SDXL. \n\n- Negative prompt support\n\n- Day 1 LoRA and finetuning capabilities \n\n- Apache 2.0 license.

I'm getting some pretty great stuff but every time I think I've got the best settings with corrective upscale, the next seed is awful again. On a positive note, the variety and \"depth\" with the base model is WAY better than turbo. It's far more responsive to action scene skewed perspective stuff than turbo was.",

It's like getting a ball of pizza dough rather than a fully cooked pizza.",

Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

Tools are already in development that aim towards this (like Artcraft, for example).\n\nBut back to the topic at hand, yes - I'd want to use a prompt to describe a variation of what I want to see. It's enormously frustrating to describe something precisely and have the model not follow it, only to then increment the seed and have the model then follow it. \n\nThat's not a sustainable system for targeted image generation in any professional pipeline - that system only works if you're happy with random output.",

But the LoRA wouldn't just control the style, it would control the \"route\". Distillations are trained for a specific number of steps and sigmas, they \"fold\" the model to neaten up edges so that they converge within a specific timeframe with a specific adherence (so that CFG is not required). Using them at anything except 1.0 weight and the intended number of steps still kinda works but it's not ideal. A percentage of the steps are wasted and CFG has to be adjusted proportionately, and it limits the quality you can get.\n\nIdeally you'd want to train a LoRA that just learns the style of Turbo. I've experimented with doing that for Qwen, by generating a bunch of promptless images from ZiT then training them captionless on Qwen. It seemed to work pretty well but the promptless images are strangely biased towards a few things (like plain T-shirts and people just standing in the middle of the frame), and the saturation tended to be lower than prompted outputs (although ZiT outputs are less saturated than Qwen's anyway), and that caused the Qwen LoRA to produce desaturated and kinda boring images.\n\nI imagine there's a more rigorous way to train one, like using the teacher-student process used to train the distillations in the first place, but without the CFG distillation, but I don't know enough to do that myself.",

With cloud models what they most likely do is send all your requests to a service to enhance your prompt.\n\nSo Midjourney could (idk for sure of course) be telling an LLM \"add to this prompt random characteristics that the user didn't explicitly ask for\". For example if you said \"elephant wearing a bowtie\", it would include that, but then add random tidbits like \"cartoon artstyle\", based on what people upvote, what you upvote, your recent requests, etc.\n\nTechnically this is doable even in ZIT with custom nodes. I'm not talking about the really basic prompt enhancer nodes, ones, if you wanted something on Midjourney's level you'd probably need to give the LLM more guidance, perhaps even use a memory (database) to remember enhancements already done in recent gens and give them less odds of reappearing too soon.",

There was the option to enable/disable this feature. Not sure now.    \n  \nIn line with that FooocusUI did years ago. Something similar with enabled \"styles\".

GPT-4o appeared very late, in 2024-25.\n\nYou're right in a sense that OpenAI developments from 2022 can be considered a trendsetter for modern RLHF.\n\nBut it was specifically Midjourney that first implemented this principle for images. Back in 2022, you could rate images in their Discord, and the data was used to improve subsequent outputs. This worked very well and Midjourney model was SOTA during SD1.5-SDXL period, although it ultimately led to the corporate RL look in other models.\n\n\"Raw model\" is cool, I agree, and the images look nice, but it's a pretty late addition, I think they added it in V5",

There's a reason it replaced Pony and a reason Noob and Chroma did not replace it. \n\nIn order to make it worth not just moving away from Illustrious itself but giving up all the things trained on it, Z-Image will need to be so good that we're willing to do that AND willing to accept the massive speed hit. \n\nFor comparison, on a 3090 I can generate 12 images at 1024x at 30 steps in 1:38. In that same time, same steps, same size, I can generate a single Z-image image. So in order to compete, it has to be so good that it's worth the 12x slower generation time and abandoning all the stuff we already have trained for Illustrious. \n\nAnd this isn't a hypothetical. This was the same problem that PonyV7 and Chroma have. Moving away from what you have and the adoption of new stuff means it has to be worth giving up what you already have. If it's not THAT good, it's a novelty and nothing more.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would love for something to be THAT good. Illustrious is a wonderful model but it's basically been pushed as far as it can go. So I do hope we get something that will be a huge step forward for it.

The model with RL simply won't generate \"impossible perspective.\" It generates a normal road. The model without RL actually tries to generate images with strange perspective violations, which I think is very cool. Another example is the prompt \"noise\" in Disney example, and so on.\n\nAnd so we have those giant smart text encoders, but their work is often broken by RL guiderails.

Generative models were just emerging back then, and there were no \"guidelines\" for prompting or anything. Everyone prompted in their own way and style. It was really interesting. Many tried to generate absurd, impossible things with super weird prompts. I thought it was pretty cool, and I saved about 500 of the strangest prompts with generations from there.\n\nSince then, whenever a new model comes out, I test it by running it against those old prompts from other people. Most of them are pretty similar to each other. Z-Image surprised me by starting to display those same weird things, the way SD1.5 did.\n\nSo yea, give credit where credit is due, the prompts aren't mine. The real authors are unknown and they created these prompts quite a few years ago. These are the very first prompts for txt2img people created actually!",

          "text": "Hey there! Original poster here.\n\nOkay, so in good faith, I thank you for taking on this challenge. :) Now, onto the results.\n\nFirst, the GOOD.\n\nYou definitely got better results than I did. I looked at your workflow and that's quite a bit of extra that needs to be done to get \"marginally\" improved results. But they **are** improved, so I'll give you that. And I'll give credit where credit is do.\n\nNow, onto the BAD.\n\nThe original claim that I made to you in our discussion was that LTX-2 cannot handle complex animation. While this is definitely improved, it **failed the test.**\n\nHere's the original prompt that I gave you:\n\n>Charred buildings in the background. Flames flicker. Smoke rises into the night. In the center, a large grey Transformer holds a glowing purple cube. Behind him, three triangle-shaped jets soar off screen. He starts talking, then walks forward, still holding the glowing purple cube.\n\nI even said prompt whatever you like because I'm interested in the end results.\n\nSo how did it fail?\n\nBecause you **cheated**. And I think I know *why* you cheated. ;)\n\nFirst of all, the sides of the image are cut off. At first glance, I thought you did this because LTX-2 has issues w/aspect ratio. One of Wan's strengths over ltx is that it can work with a much larger range of aspect ratio. Then, I noticed something...\n\nThe **smoke**. When Megatron walks forward, the smoke behind him isn't moving. Nor is the smoke to the left of the image that you cut off.\n\nSo, I think you deliberately contaminated the experiment by cutting off the sides of the image in order to pass the test. But the test is failed because you did not achieve the results expected from the prompt. The prompt specifically says \"smoke rises into the night\".\n\nTherefore, it's a **fail**.\n\nI can admit it looks better, and there's definitely more motion. It's WAY better than my results.  But it still fails to capture the instructions. And resizing the image isn't the solution.\n\nNow, let's move onto my theory of why LTX-2 struggles with animation.\n\nMy theory is that LTX-2 is heavily trained on western children's animation, or more specifically what animators call **2D flash animation**. It's a more \"modern\", cheaper method that is used quite a lot in western children's cartoons found on Cartoon Network. This clip you posted looks even worse than that, more like 2D skeletal animation/ paper doll animation. The characters' movement looks more like warping than actual animation. Or, they have a more...liquid/fluid style of movement.\n\nWan on the other hand looks more like **traditional** 2D animation - of the likes found in action cartoons from the 80s - 00s. My theory is that Wan, which originated in Asia, was most likely trained on Anime or Asian-influenced animation. Many western action cartoons from the 80s to today were actually animated by Japan or Korea house animation. This is why Wan can do it better.\n\nAnd why LTX-2 animations look really bad...if you're into traditional 2d animation.\n\nI plan on doing another post on this soon, so I'll go into more detail at that time w/examples because this comment has already gotten pretty long.\n\nThat said, thanks a bunch for tackling the challenge. This was fun! I'll mention your thread in my new post and address your claims there. This is a fun battle, because everyone wins in the end. :D\n\nThanks for the workflow!\n\nGWX",

You are moving the goalposts so you can claim \"it's a fail\", even though I, as you admit, \"got WAY better results\".\n\nThis is also without using any of the animation-oriented LTX2 LORAs.\n\nBut, whatever.

But does it animate like traditional **western** animation? For example, 90s Disney, Dreamworks, Ralph Bakshi, Hanna Barbera, that style? I haven't seen any indication of it. I don't know if that's in its training data - it's not a highly popular animation style to eastern audiences, at least not more than anime.\n\nIf that's what you're talking about, I agree that I've not seen any evidence of it doing that particular style.  So it **can** do traditional eastern style animation, but the jury's still out on if can do traditional western animation.\n\nRE: the rotoscope/cgi look - which I abhor - it definitely leans to that too much. I don't think it's necessarily due to the human training, but possibly its animation training data. A lot of recent anime use that technique, especially more recent chinese animation.\n\nThat said, it can be avoided, but it's challenging to do out of the box. I've done a lot of testing and even though I can get around it mostly, the cost is high step count, which = time. It's time consuming.\n\nBTW, I hate that look. Traditional animator here, so my initial interest in Wan was trying to figure out how to add it to my pipeline.",

          "text": "I appreciate this workflow u/phr00t_ , it works really well, but I want to ask a few questions to be able to customize it more specifically to my objectives.\n\n1. Where did the fixed sigma values come from? If I want to increase the steps, for example to 20 steps, how should I adjust the numbers? Is it a particular curve that is being used to derive the values? What about the normalization values? It seems, video is just to add more 1s, but what about the audio that goes, 1,1,0.25, over and over? should I just repeat those until I get to 20? Edit>> google ai says that the manual steps is an S-Curve. should I just extrapolate the same s-curve in 20 steps? But what of the normalization?\n2. You mention some of the lora's you used, but when I use those lora's I don't get the same results. There are so many different safetensors, and distributions, which ones exactly did you use? I would love to be able to experiment by adding and subtracting different loras. I found the ic i2v adapter lora, which makes a difference, but I would also like to generate without distillation, because the lighting seems to change when I use a distillation workflow.\n3. Why did you choose to do 24 fps and use rife to get to 48 fps, instead of directly generating in 48fps?\n4. so you said you don't like the latent upscalers from LTX, because of artifacts? Have you heard if anyone is working on improving them? I'mg guessing you haven't, or else you would have included them in your workflow. once I master this base layer, I can explore the upscalers on my own, so that I can see exactly what you are talking about.\n\nThank you again for your contributions, and advice. I was having ok generations before coming here, but exploring what you have done, will definitely help me make things even better.",

I have a special merging script that does a better job merging stuff together. I have shared this script on my Huggingface if you want to try it yourself. The easy answer is just to use my merge and workflow.\n\n3. Because interpolating to 48fps is faster than generating twice as many frames. Quality would be far better generating 48fps directly, though.\n\n4. Eh, I built this workflow from scratch and I was trying to avoid 2 stages. The upscalers are likely better for the 2-stage approach where the artifacts are mostly resolved in the 2nd stage.\n\nAlso, thank you and you are welcome!",
