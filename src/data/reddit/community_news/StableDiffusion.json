Sure it's wow for like 5 minutes but as you drive around most of the colour has gone because real life has seeped into it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_toA8lErAHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toA8lErAHg)\n\nBut at the same time I've often wondered how Alyx, Eli, Dr Kleiner, Barney and all the rest would look in real life. Klein allows that... or at least a level pretty close to it, and then after that curiosity is satisfied I can jump back into my unmodded copy of Direct3D 9 Half Life 2 from 2004 lol.",

I don't feel as excited. In fact, it made me remember of Ananta, and I'm even more stoked for that game.\n\nToo many games are obsessed with making things feel \"realistic\" that they forgot the \"fantasy\" in these games. Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

On the counter sits a white ceramic fruit bowl placed slightly off-center to the right. Inside the bowl are clearly visible incorrectly colored fruits: a blue banana, a bright purple orange, a red lime, a glossy black apple, and a translucent green strawberry with its seeds visible inside the fruit.\n\nNext to and slightly closer to the camera than the bowl is a clear glass of water. The fruit bowl and fruit are accurately reflected and refracted through the curved surface of the glass with realistic distortion, and the glass casts a soft shadow to the left. Tiny water droplets are visible on the counter near the glass.\n\nBehind the bowl is a rectangular mirror tile backsplash. The mirror reflection shows the back of the fruit bowl and the window light source, but does not show the camera. Faint fingerprints are visible on the mirror surface.\n\nOn the counter to the left of the bowl are exactly three asymmetrically arranged objects: a small metal spoon bent slightly upward with a small scratch on its surface, a folded yellow sticky note with visible paper texture and the handwritten text “7:42 PM”, and a single black chess knight piece. The spoon points toward the bowl, and the chess knight points away from the bowl.\n\nOn the right side of the bowl there is only one object: a half-peeled orange whose fruit inside is normal orange color, but whose outer peel is shaped into sharp geometric cube-like edges.\n\nLighting is strong directional daylight from the right with soft fill shadows, realistic ray-traced reflections, sharp but natural shadows, and no studio lighting look. The materials are physically accurate: glass, metal, ceramic, paper, and fruit surfaces rendered realistically. Camera uses a 50mm lens with shallow depth of field, focus on the fruit bowl and the front rim of the glass, with slightly softer background reflections. Hyperrealistic photograph style, high dynamic range, natural color grading, extreme material and optical accuracy.\"\n\n  \nI'm reasonably impressed",

Because if you try to use z-base to upscale it would take far too long, turbo i the best model to use for upscaling. Then again you'd have to do the upscaling at a very low denoise or you'd lose all your gains from the base prompt adherence.

It really pushes the need for LLM expansion. I'll the prompt for this one and the instruction I'm using (which has an emphasis on action shots).   \nChroma refined with Klein 9b prompt: Blistering with cinematic momentum, the scene crashes into view on a violently canted axis, every vertical line a drunken tilt, every plane a disorienting slip into impossible depth. EXPLODE the epic figure of the STONE GIANT first - a mountain of muscle and granite, its hide a roadmap of tattoos, a prison of immense, groaning chains. CROUCHED in a predatory, unstable stance before the monolithic gate, its posture is a seismic diagonal, a colossal weight threatening to topple the entire frame. ITS IMMENSE GRIEVANCE radiates with palpable, volatile heat, a raw emotional tremor threatening to shear the world.\n\n\n\nBeneath the titan's hunched, crushing shadow lies its focus: a minuscule group of diminutive people, their upturned faces painted in desperate hope against the giant's simmering wrath, their fragile forms almost swallowed by the violent receding diagonals of the rain-slicked stone plaza. This skewed perspective is enforced by an aggressive wide-angle lens, its distortion bowing the gate's immense pillars, making the cobblestones beneath the humans erupt towards the foreground in exaggerated scale, their lines converging at a frantic, impossible angle in the deep background where the sky-cleft gate to the cloud town pierces the heavens.\n\n\n\nSearing, low-angle light, a harsh cinematic slash from a setting sun hidden just outside the skewed frame, rakes across the scene. It glints off the wet chains with a cold C8A9F3 (hex: #C8A9F3) lavender-steel sheen, gouges deep, warm shadows into the giant's textured stone flesh, and sets the driving rain ablaze with misty FFDB58 (hex: #FFDB58) golden streaks. The light source is tangible, direction clear: from camera-left, low and raking, casting long, distorted, dancing shadows that further scramble the already tilted plane of the ground.\n\n\n\nThe entire kinetic moment is frozen: sheets of cold rain fall in sharp, diagonal slashes. Atmospheric haze and the giant's heated breath plume out in thick, turbulent clouds—FFFAE6 (hex: #FFFAE6) white-grey vapor that coils and smears with motion blur, following the canted geometry of the composition, softening the extreme background. A single, massive spatter of mud, kicked up by the giant's shifting weight, hangs in the air, a spray of F3DABC (hex: #F3DABC) beige-brown droplets frozen in their chaotic, off-axis trajectory. This is not a static image; it is peak action, a precarious, explosive tension captured a millisecond from calamity, all balance lost to the relentless, skewed dynamism of the Dutch angle.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*CINEMATOGRAPHIC ANNOTATIONS:\\*\\*\n\nShot on ARRI ALEXA 65 with an ARRI Prime 65 S 18mm T1.8 lens.\n\n\\*\\*Focal Length:\\*\\* 18mm\n\n\\*\\*Aperture:\\*\\* T/5.6\n\n\\*\\*Shutter Speed:\\*\\* 1/1000th\n\n\\*\\*Sensor/Stock:\\*\\* ARRI ALEV III Sensor, capturing in ARRIRAW.\n\n\\*\\*Color Treatment:\\*\\* Emulation of Kodak Vision3 500T 5219, pushed one stop for heightened contrast and grain structure, with a cold tone lift in the shadows.\n\n\\*\\*Key Color Palette:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Giant's Stone Skin: #8A8776 (Warm Grey)\n\n\\- Chain Highlights: #C8A9F3 (Lavender Steel)\n\n\\- Rain Highlights: #FFDB58 (Golden Hour)\n\n\\- Mist & Breath: #FFFAE6 (Warm White)\n\n\\- Mud & Earth: #F3DABC (Beige-Brown)\n\n\\- Shadow Undertones: #2B2D42 (Deep Blue-Black)",

Even though it accidentally amputated a few fingers, it looks pretty good overall. Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes. I say this because a lot of people use them without reading the terms of service. That was awesome, man!. 😎",

              "text": "u/anydezx Thanks for the feedback! There’s actually no need for a LoRA here. I kept the prompt very consistent throughout and only adjusted things like perspective, lighting, background, expression, or pose. ZIT is extremely consistent as long as the core prompt stays the same, so a LoRA wasn’t necessary.\n\nAnd you’re absolutely right about the copyright concerns. I really wish we could achieve comparable music generation quality locally. I’m very much looking forward to HeartMuLa, but to be honest, the quality still isn’t on the same level as Suno’s v5 model yet. [GitHub - HeartMuLa/heartlib](https://github.com/HeartMuLa/heartlib)",

Once it clicked though… wow. The expressiveness is honestly kind of scary-good.\n\nThe sync doesn’t just hit mouth shapes — it feels alive. You can see subtle breathing, micro head motion, and facial tension following the isolated vocal stem. It reacts to phrasing and pauses in a way that feels much closer to a real performance than anything I’ve tried before. Definitely in the same territory you described in your post.\n\nSo far I haven’t done much beyond lip-sync with LTX-2 yet, but that alone is already blowing my mind. I’m in the middle of finishing a music video for my YouTube channel, and watching the character breathe and sing in time with the recorded vocal is unreal.\n\nMy timings / setup so far\nI’m rendering ~10–20 second chunks at a time (similar to your approach)\nEach chunk takes roughly 1–3 minutes at 1280×736, depending on audio offset and cache state\n\nStitching everything together in post\n\nHardware (for reference)\nThreadripper (24-core)\n256GB RAM\nRTX 5090 (32GB VRAM)\nGen 5 NVMe disks\n\nAudio side\nI’m doing a hybrid pipeline:\nComfyUI for generating / separating vocal & drum stems and experimenting with ideas\nSuno sometimes for quick melodic or structural inspiration\nEverything then goes into a DAW with VSTs for proper arrangement and sound design\nFinal master via Soren AI\n\nHonestly, I haven’t done much else with LTX-2 yet outside lip-sync, but based on this alone I can’t wait to push further. Huge thanks again for sharing the workflow — this is next-level stuff.",

Hidream just doesn't fit on the price/performance curve anymore.",

For whatever fucking reason, comfy recently changed so that some random seeds no longer randomize on hitting run.\n\nSo if I load up the Flux Klein 9b edit workflow for example and hit run twice, it will run once to generate and image, and the second 'run' will simply reuse the exact same parameters and seed, skipping the generation and putting out the same image as if I was on fixed seed.\n\nThe only way I've found to change this behaviour is to use a random number generator and input that into the seed, then it properly randomizes each run. This allows me to hit generate 3 times and actually get 3 different images.\n\nIt has its downsides, but it's far more annoying needing to manually change the seed each run.",

By the time we figure out how to get our images to look what we want by controlling custom nodes, we dont tend to need them any more, so go back to default workflows because of their simplicity.\n\nWoodworking (my other hobby) works like that too.

So 2601 would be next. Or, now that Klein has appeared as a competitor, they might finally release...\n\nThough, if they don't release Z Image this time either........................",

I know there are fine tunes to make turbo an edit model but I want to see it from the box.\n\nCall me wrong but im addicted to making super realistic pics of me and my daughter in wrong pictures to send to my mother. Me and Epstein at a random party, my daughter sitting in a car where the window is broken and shes hot wiring it. You know the sort of thing.

I have 12GB VRAM and can comfortably run it with both the model and text encoder quantized in FP8, so I'm sure you'd be able to run it in some gguf quantization, even if it's Q4.\n\nI don't know how easy it will be to train Loras of you and your kid on Z-Image Turbo, though, as Turbo models are difficult to train. Z-Image Base should make it easier to train Loras once released, but I'd expect it to be at least 5x slower than the Turbo version.\n\nYou should also take a look at Flux Klein. I've heard it's even better than Z-Image for lower-end machines. Its main downsides, like being bad for NSFW and kinda-restrictive licenses, are definitely not an issue for your use case.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

She is statuesque and ethereal, with impossibly long, flowing platinum-gold hair that arcs around her like a fragmented halo, some strands braided into elegant, crown-like loops. Her skin is pale and luminous, with faint hairline cracks like aged marble hinting at both divinity and ruin. She wears a regal, asymmetrical white-and-gold gown fused with ancient ceremonial armor: layered plates engraved with runes, draped cloth that hangs like sacred vestments, and delicate chains and sigils that glow softly.\n\n\n\nThe style blends refined anime aesthetics with Art Nouveau curves and borders, plus dramatic Baroque-inspired lighting: a blinding, holy backlight creating a halo effect, deep shadows across her face and body, and shafts of dust-filled light cutting through the scene. Behind her, the faint silhouette of a colossal golden tree and broken holy architecture dissolves into mist. Her expression is serene, sorrowful, and unfathomably powerful, eyes shining with muted gold light as if holding a shattered world inside them. The overall mood is one of fractured divinity and ancient, golden royalty—majestic, sacred, and slightly tragic, rendered in ultra-detailed, painterly realism fused with anime and Art Nouveau ornamentation.\n\nRes\\_multistep  \nsimple  \nDenoise 0.98  \nSeed: 940289160578048",

The reason z-image base is so converted is it's really the Goldilocks model, just the right size, just the right license, just the right quality and it's not distilled and the starting point model already is fairly uncensored with good coverage of concepts. The expectation is it should be easy and fairly cheap to train. Really the last model to hit the Goldilocks zone was SDXL.\n\nBy comparison a lot of BFL models have that horrible non-commercial license which you gets inherited by any loras or fine tunes you do as they are considered directives and their license allow them to revoke your license to use and distribute your fine tune if it allows generation of filtered content which includes IP infringing content. It's just bad so not many people want to put in the effort/expense of doing any large scale training on it. BFL's best models like klien 9b have that license (the 4B is Apache though), typically they open up the lower quality distilled version (flux schnell) but the distilled ones are extremely difficult to train.... \n\nThen you have the Owen models which were nice but too big to cheaply/easily train.. So SDXL has kinda been the darling until now it was the last model that landed in that goldilocks zone and the z-image models are looking like they could be a viable replacement for it.",

It can run text encoder just fine, but crashes on sampler, which I'm still trying to figure out.\n\nComfyUI's weakest spot is memory management, otherwise it has no problem doing compute on whatever device it needs, so theoretically, it should do multi-GPU inference no problem at all.\n\nhttps://github.com/ifilipis/ComfyUI/tree/codex/fix-compatibility-of-disk_weights-with-comfyui-synced",

While Gemini 2.0 native image gen had good understanding already, the image quality just wasn't there. \n\nIdk, probably additional post-training to help it output pleasing, natural images rather than just the \"raw\" base model output? And lots of training for edits too? Plus, aesthetic \"taste\" to steer it towards real-looking photos rather than the deep fried cinematic look of other models.\n\nEither way, having a very smart \"LLM\" base model with all of that image understanding \"built-in\" is what has enabled greatly improved prompt understanding and editing etc.",

If it's closer to 13B, it might be usable.\n\nThe big boy is 170GB in size, but appears to be bf16. I would get the best inference time when using fp8, so about 85GB in size. I'm not sure if I even have that kind of space on my SSD (upgrades seem to be too expensive). Maybe if Q2 GGUF (should be around 20ish GB) comes out and ComfyUI supports it, I'll give it a shot for the novelity sake, but inference that takes more than a minute is unusable for me on my local machine.",

I'm wanting to train one for realism but all images based in Japan. I don't know where to start on the dataset though, because most advice I see with respect to LoRAs are \"30 to 50 images should be enough, and do 2k steps\" but that is for character LoRAs. I'm assuming it's quite different for this type of style LoRA where you're not trying to mimic an art style either? \n\n\nI've been starting to train all day every day for the last week, but so far I'm not able to get it to really converge as well as I'd like over a certain style of person. ",

Then i just kept adding more images and deleting some, this v5 version is at around 320 images, and it genuinely feels like it is becoming better everytime i add more images. I dm'ed a guy who made a amateur photo lora for z-image-turbo and he told me he was doing a new version for his lora with 12k images, im not sure if he was trolling or not be he seemed like he was genuine. Also i think captioning is a big part of it. I get gemini to caption my images (i've made an app inside Google AI studio), very descriptive and long captions. \n\nLet me know if i answered some of your questions.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the reply. How do you decide what rank to train, what learning rate to use and how many steps to train as the number of images scale? I was using a couple hundred images but without captions (well, a default caption), and I definitely made an improvement by just going down to 50 but captioning them with ChatGPT. Though learned some things like I had some lower res images that I upscaled, but that wound up training in artifacts etc, so don't do that. My recent training I tried bumping the rank up to 256 and training for 100 steps per image, but seems to have converged at around 2k steps and not much visual improvement afterwards.\n\nIt sounds like I might be able to do better by going back to using more images but caption them all, and caption them with longer captions, plus train at the right resolutions. I know data set quality is paramount to getting good results, but how to specifically combine it all is proving tricky to get past my current plateau.\n\nContent-wise for realism... when you are curating a data set, is it made up of subsets for specific aspects you're trying to train? Like lighting, or image artifacts present in certain cameras, skin details etc?\n\n\nEdit: holy smokes the latest iteration with 50 captioned images attempting to teach 4 different variations in the dataset trained at rank 256 for 4000 steps on Z-image De-Destilled actually produced some pretty stunning results. The high rank definitely led it to start memorising some of the training data, but also the skin details show up so much better. Excited to see how much further I can improve it with a larger dataset and better training techniques.",

Multiple people have posted in this subreddit about LoRa blocking ( havent looked into it tho), and it seems like it works great for some people. A different way is to keep it at a low strenght, then do face detailer later. Or simply just keep them both low. Or find a img2img workflow. Theres alot of ways to do this   in a way that doesnt look terrible, but yeah Z-image-Turbo is a bit of a shot in the fog mostly, its very sensitive to LoRas.",

Their sample code converts input audio into vectors, though it has 2 modes to be aware of, the basic vector mode and an ICL mode where it takes your input sample and tokenizes it with the text_ref (transcription of the input voice sample), so if you're going to extract that vectorizor, I'd recommend supporting that tokenization process since you get better results (...supposedly, haven't tested it enough to validate that myself)\n\nHow to do it? Well, I work in Cursor myself, but use whatever coding AI you want, that or caveman code it yourself and extract the tokenizer and vectorizors and create a standalone tool.",

Even Without fancy math.\n\n- grab a folder with random black and white images\n- load one of them randomly before the first of your sampler (LoadImageFromBatch)\n- resize it to match your desired latent size (Resize image v2)\n- add blur or noise or whatever makes your sampler happy (ImageAdustements)\n- encode said image to latent (VAEEncode)\n- pass to sampler\n- adjust denoise in sampler (.8 to .95 depending on freedom wished)\n- profit 👍\n\nThis works with every model, and the whole process takes max 2 seconds. Tadaa. Fixed. Now the combined random seed from your sampler + the random image + the prompt + the denoise make it so that you've effectively bypassed any model variation issues. \n\nI've been using this even since SD1.5, because I can't stand centered compositions (subject in the dead center), and if you're smart enough in the choice of your random images, you can get results no amount of prompting could deliver. But I leave that for anyone to experiment.",

I noticed the biggest difference in the hair: with plain LTX2, even a simple anime character clip where the hair moves tends to distort the linework a lot and it starts looking messy. With this, that issue is more under control. The hair moves in a way that looks more natural and the overall motion feels a bit cleaner too.\n\nIt’s obviously not perfect yet but honestly, this is **really a step forward** compared to standard LTX2. Great work👏🔥",

The Apply Whisper node will download the model selected automatically.\n\n**The Qwen3-TTS Comfy UI custom nodes** can be found here:  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS)\n\n**Whisper Nodes:**  \n[https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper](https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Whisper)\n\n**For speeding up generations** using the **same audio as input**, you can enable the node \"Qwen3-TTS Prompt Maker\" **after the first generation**. (when changing the audio input, disable it again the first time).\n\nIf you have flash-atttention installed it will use it too, if not , it will fallback to torch attention, no need to change anything, leave attention as \"auto\".\n\nFor voice cloning the **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base** has to be selected on the loader. It will auto download too the necessary files.\n\n\\-If you don't want to save the audio, just replace the save audio node with a preview audio node.\n\n**My Voice Cloning Workflow:** [https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43](https://pastebin.com/08KjRa43) (edited to simplify it)\n\n**DarioFT's Custom Voice workflow (for regular generation - not voice clone):**  \n[https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example\\_workflows/custom\\_voice.json](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS/blob/main/example_workflows/custom_voice.json)\n\nThanks to [DarioFT](https://github.com/DarioFT) for the custom nodes that make this possible.\n\nTest it and let me know your impressions.  \nRegards.",
