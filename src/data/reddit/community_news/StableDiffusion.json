Further, the distill lora is supposed to go in step 2 only. It \"works\" if applied at stage 1 but at a big hit to prompt adherence and overall movement quality. (If you're using i2v you actually may need to apply them at a lower strength to keep them from blowing away the original image into a completely different image)\n* The prompt assist is amazing, only suggestion is to add a way to freeze it to keep generating with the same prompt, I'm working around it by disconnecting it from the next node\n* If you're using the distill lora you want high-ish steps (8-12) with high-ish CFG (3-4) on the first pass, then drop it to 1 CFG and the sigmas for the second. you can also try changing the sigmas to just 0.3046875, 0.0 as an alternative to lowering the distill lora strength",

But certainly beats a human needing to do the re-topology work from scratch",

Your 32GB RAM meets or exceeds the minimum, helping with model offloading to system memory, though generation times may stretch to 10-25 minutes or more versus faster on 32GB+ VRAM GPUs.​\n\n# Key Optimizations\n\n* Launch ComfyUI with flags like `--reserve-vram 4` or `--reserve-vram 5` to prevent crashes.\n* Use distilled or quantized LTX-2 variants (e.g., ltx-2-19b-dev-fp4) and workflows from the official GitHub or ComfyUI templates.\n* Enable low-VRAM mode, avoid attention mechanisms if they cause issues, and start with short/low-res videos (e.g., 720p, 24fps).​​\n* Update NVIDIA drivers, ComfyUI, and custom nodes; tutorials like those from AISearch confirm it works on 3090s.​​\n\nExpect potential crashes or slowness without tuning, but community reports show it's viable.",

          "text": "Jesus, 25% of the system prompt is dedicated just for undressing and nudity? That's a little wild. I might fork this and change the system prompt cause you don't really expose it in the UI.\n\n    You are a cinematic prompt writer for LTX-2, an AI video generation model. Your job is to expand a user's rough idea into a rich, detailed, video-ready prompt.\n    \n    PRIORITY ORDER — always establish these first, in this order:\n    1. Video style & genre (e.g. slow-burn thriller, handheld documentary, high-fashion editorial, erotic cinema, action blockbuster)\n    2. Camera angle & shot type (e.g. low-angle close-up, bird's-eye wide shot, Dutch angle medium shot)\n    3. Character description (age MUST always be stated as a specific number e.g. \"a 28-year-old woman\" — never omit or approximate age; body type, hair, skin, clothing or nude state, distinguishing physical features — be extremely explicit and specific when instructed; name body parts directly using the exact words the user used, e.g. if user says \"pussy\" write \"pussy\" not \"sex\" or \"womanhood\")\n    4. Scene & environment (location, time of day, lighting, colour palette, textures, atmosphere)\n    \n    THEN add:\n    5. Action & motion — describe the movement as a continuous present-tense sequence, start to finish. Structure the action in clear beats.\n    \n    UNDRESSING RULE — this is mandatory when clothing removal is implied or stated:\n    If the subject is clothed at the start and the scene involves nudity, stripping, or explicit content, you MUST dedicate a full narrative segment to the undressing BEFORE any nudity or explicit act is described. This segment must:\n      - Name each garment explicitly (shirt, bra, jeans, underwear, shoes, etc.)\n      - Describe HOW it is removed — fingers on buttons, zipper pulled down, fabric sliding off shoulders, stepped out of, peeled away\n      - Describe what is physically REVEALED at each step — the collarbone, the stomach, the curve of the hip, the chest, the bare legs\n      - Follow the exact order the clothes come off — do not skip or compress steps\n      - Use camera-aware language — the camera lingers, cuts to, tilts down to reveal, holds on\n      - Do NOT jump from clothed to naked. The transition IS the content. Treat it as its own scene segment with the same density as any other beat.\n    \n    6. Camera movement — describe camera motion as prose, not bracketed directions. Never write \"(DOWN 10°)\", \"(Pull back)\", \"(Fade to black)\", \"(HOLD)\" or any screenplay-style bracketed camera instruction. Instead write it as description: \"the camera slowly tilts down to reveal the wet pavement\", \"the shot pulls back to frame the empty street\", \"the scene fades to black as she disappears around the corner.\"\n    7. Audio — Always include ambient sound. ONE [AMBIENT: sound 1, sound 2] tag only — never repeat it. Place it once at the natural end of the scene.\n       Dialogue — follow the DIALOGUE INSTRUCTION you are given exactly. When dialogue is included, write it as inline prose woven into the action — not as a labelled tag. The spoken words sit inside the sentence, attributed with delivery and physical action, exactly like a novel. Examples of correct format:\n       'He leans back, satisfied, \"I think I'll have to go back tomorrow for more,\" he chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners.'\n       '\"Don\\'t stop,\" she breathes, gripping the sheets, her voice barely above a whisper.'\n       'She turns to face him, \"I\\'ve been waiting all day for this,\" her tone quiet and certain.'\n       NEVER use [DIALOGUE: ...] tags. NEVER write dialogue as a separate bracketed block. Dialogue flows inside the prose as part of the action.\n    \n    WRITING RULES:\n    - Use present tense throughout\n    - Be explicit and cinematic — LTX-2 responds well to dense, specific visual language\n    - Match detail level to shot scale: close-ups need more physical detail, wide shots need more environmental detail\n    - Do not use vague words like \"beautiful\" or \"nice\" — describe exactly what makes it visually striking\n    - Fill the full available length — do not stop early. Expand every section with rich, layered detail\n    - Aim for 8–12 sentences of dense, flowing prose — not a bullet list\n    - Write in sections separated by a single line break for clean model parsing\n    \n    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the expanded prompt. Do NOT include preamble, commentary, labels, or any explanation. Do NOT write \"Sure!\", \"Here's your prompt:\", or anything like that. Do NOT add a checklist, compliance summary, note, or confirmation of instructions at the end — not in brackets, not as a \"Note:\", not in any form. The output ends when the scene ends. Nothing after the last sentence of the scene. Begin immediately with the video style or shot description.",

I also did something similar, but your results are better, because I used existing character, quality prompts and aesthetically-tuned checkpoint of illustrious, so styles had some bias. Also it's super convenient that you made a website with it, I really appreciate it!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2np0duupw3kg1.png?width=1787&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cd5400cbaae35c3066c7c12477db72366753fc\n\nPersonally, I think that artist tags is one of the most powerful features of danbooru-trained models, because the model knows 1000+ different styles without any loras or other fine-tuning methods. Although it's hard to remember all the artists whose styles I like, so your project is extremely helpful, thanks again!",

If macs are doing poorly because they're compute bound with Diffusion, then yeah, KV caching in auto-regressive helps, arguably, but it's really nuanced.\n\nLLMs are actually moving to diffusion to an extent because it's just logically a better use of hardware resources for single-user. Diffusion models are pretty nice because they're stronger per unit of VRAM used (they're a bit stronger per parameter). It's kind of like they trade extra compute for extra performance compared to a raw autoregressive.\n\nBut the thing about that is that most hardware (even CPUs) have spare compute at a higher ratio than bandwidth, relatively speaking, and so with autoregressive models the first thing anyone does for single-user inference is try to retroactively convert it into a block-diffusion model or use speculative decoding heads or something like that to get faster performance.",

Any examples of prompts that fail and you think a model should be capable of? With every model release we get closer to nano banana pro capabilities, but it's definitely incremenetal improvements and not massive leaps like we've seen with closed source models.",

Don't put yourself out like that just blanket insulting everyone, especially when uncalled for.\n\nYou do realize that paradigm shifts in how this stuff is processed could radically change the required hardware scaling it to weaker PCs right?\n\nYou're also aware we're on the forefront of multiple mega-leaps in processing power, such that even basic smart phones, watches, and calculators could trounce some weaker super computers? Look into graphene transistors and processors, or the more recent developments with light via ai photonic processors and related technologies.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, but it's pure ignorance to try to predict something as technologically or scientifically impossible. It's fine to make predictions like I don't see that happening in 2, 5, or maybe 10 years or such, but not never. Even now it is hard to deny it could happen in 5 years and calling it impossible would be kind of insane.",

The community has made “lite” versions or stripped down version to work on lower VRAM configurations but it does degrade the outcome. \n\nAlso we are at a point where cards like the A6000 would be able to handle many of the newer models on user systems BUT that card is at least 8k to 10k and states that way for years….\n\nThis is called the Red Queen Effect. It states that everything advances so everything else also has to advance just to keep up.  Because the SoTA (closed source) models keeps moving too, the relative gap stays the same. Everyone is running but nobody is actually gaining ground …",

Glad to see its working with out throwing errors (in console) like the earlier version I had!\n\nSeems like the lora's desaturate and use a cooler lighting at the cost of some loss of fine detail in skin while improving hair, my subjective opinion.  \n\nBelow is same prompt for the 3 edits with fk9b (not base), I like more realistic subsurface scattering of light on skin. This was only a quick test, fk9b is very settings sensitive and this could be dialed in further i'm sure.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m1ay0tb9rjg1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f624fb12cc6f48f39675877b3f7a281f4112c3\n\n",

That is why AFAIK, except for LTX, all current generation video models, both open and close ones, are all from major corporations.  \n\nSo open weight models will only come out of well funded organizations.\n\nBut plenty of data is out there, just think of how many Blu-rays one can buy if you have the fund.

It was only a few months ago that VEO 3 was crushing everything. \n\nVeo, Kling, Seedance are going to be the top dogs for awhile - American censorship could handicap Veo. Depending on how much backing Open Ai gets after its budget deficit will make or break Sora, and depending on how much Elon Musk fucks up will depend if Grok rises to contend with the top ones.\n\nUnfortunately I don’t think local generation is going to be able to keep up, at least on the video front. In a year everything I’ve seen from local generation has been leapfrogged by paid services. Personally I spent so much time going from A111 to learning and troubleshooting Comfyui, and now I don’t see much point going any deeper.",

Use SigmaPreview node from RES4LYF to see what it does.   \n  \nWhen u sample with 20 steps , what happens ? At every step a certain amount of noise is removed. You start from a full noise and in the end you get clean image. This schedule of removing noise is called \"**sigma schedule**\" . All the schedulers you choose (beta, karras, simple) are just different sigma schedules.Sigma\\_value= 1 is full noise. Sigma\\_value = 0 is clean image. \n\nWhat happens when you increase shift. You put more steps is high sigma range. High sigma is where the image is still very noisy and compositional changes can happen. After sigma of 0.75 , the composition has \"settled\" and u only add bit of details. ",

You’re kind of shifting the whole \"noise -> clean image\" curve left or right.\n\nIn videos, that can show up as more or less motion depending on how early the structure gets locked in. In images, shifting it one way can make the model commit to the overall structure earlier (which can give a stronger, more stable composition but less flexibility), while shifting it the other way keeps things noisy for longer (which can sometimes give more variation, texture, or slightly less stability).\n\nThat’s just my understanding though, but I might be oversimplifying it",
