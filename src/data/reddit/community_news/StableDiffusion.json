Even if the model was never shown a woman lying like some people were spouting back then, it clearly knows what a humanoid looks like when lying down so it should have been able to generalize. \n\nThe saddest part is SD3.5 Medium is actually a [really interesting model for art](https://postimg.cc/gallery/grmwg4F), and from memory it was trained completely different than SD3 and 3.5 Large but for whatever reason Stability believed the SD3 brand wasn't complete poison by that point. If Medium was called SD4 and it might have had a chance.\n\nNot gonna lie though, as much as I love playing around with ZiT and Klein and appreciate the adherence the new training style brings, I miss models trained on raw alt-text.

It's possible they could have trained an entirely new model between the API release and open release and botched it, but that seems wasteful even for Stability.\n\nI did a lot of testing trying to figure out what the issue was and it felt like they specifically targeted certain concepts, or combinations of concepts.

You can train back whatever you want and the model won't fight you on it.

The models people gravitated toward vs. the ones they rejected weren't just about technical quality — they mapped pretty closely to different aesthetic sensibilities. Some people were all about photorealism, others wanted painterly, others wanted weird surreal outputs. The \"best\" model was never universal, it was always personal. Kinda interesting how our AI art preferences end up being a fingerprint of taste.*",

Some influencers have gone even further and started dissolving lip fillers in favor of their original appearance. Of course, there are still plenty of people stuck in the past.\n\nThe same goes for color grading, heavy “creative” color work has fallen out of fashion, with images kept much closer to RAW.\n\nAnd all of this is because people started, and are still continuing, to produce huge amounts of overly polished images in Midjourney and similar tools",

It's really slow but the images I get are spot on and you can reduce resolution down to 1024x1024 for faster speeds but you're reducing the detail a lot and at that point it's better to just use the others if you want HQ with fast production times.\n\nI would say though if you do have the Vram and are more interested in quality of image than speed then this setup is worth going for, especially if you like to train character lora's because they stack very well with other lora's\n\nGive it a go guys even with lower end hardware and you might be surprised how much quality you can get.",

But the real issue is that for myself, on a 3090, it's much slower than it's alternatives and swallows all of my VRAM. I can't imagine that most other people, whose cards are slower, would find it useable. \n\nBut the other thing is that Qwen's way of making models is inherently counter-productive to adoption. The fact that Qwen has multiple numbered versions and nothing made for one is compatible with any other is not a selling point. If you were going to train loras or fine tunes, you wouldn't go 'let me train it for every new version' you'd go 'let me wait to see which version is the adopted one and then I'll do it' which means that inevitably no one trains anything for it.",

Nvidia's confidence in key players is a major indicator of where this is headed. Trillions a year is being spent on AI and its not making money because its a race for data in modeling by human guinea pig users to get to AGI.\n\nI think if we can get to a dirty AGI that is capable on quantum compute to solve the transformer multiplier issue and go addition only, we might actually see some efficiency gains. But right now? We are just burning cash and electricity.\n\nI am disappointed that users are suffering with the high pricing and discontinued high VRAM models due to the chip pricing around current world issues. This is without talking about power requirements for the growing modular AI factories popping up everywhere.\n\nThe consumer side is getting squeezed. You want a decent GPU for local models? Good luck affording it. You want to use cloud APIs? Hope you got a corporate budget because the pricing is insane for regular people trying to experiment and build. Meanwhile the big labs are hoovering up H100s like there is no tomorrow and venture capital is just throwing money at anything with AI in the pitch deck.\n\nWe are in this weird spot where the technology is advancing faster than anyone can regulate it or even understand the implications. Nobody is asking the hard questions about sustainability, both financially and environmentally. These data centers are pulling power like small cities and the returns are mostly theoretical at this point.\n\nThe whole thing feels like a gold rush where everyone is selling pickaxes and nobody is finding gold yet. Except in this case the pickaxes cost millions and use enough power to run a small country.\n\nI mean no one is talking carbon footprint anymore and global warming ... Ai has blown all that away lol\n\nNote: Nice GEN btw 👌",

Then I got into comfyui, then I started writing my own nodes, then I learned how to train a LoRA and what the process behind that was.\n\nThen I wrote a classification system that uses face recognition to sort images into groups based on who's in the photo - and then grade them based on resolution and sharpness of the face area - this gives me pools of potential LoRA training data. Then I learned how to use Google's APIs to put a name to a face for those groups of images, and then merge islands of image collections that are actually the same person (but perhaps different ages or styles).\n\nSo, gateway into AI and machine learning.",

I then signed up for the Stable Diffusion beta and managed to get invited. When the model and software were first released, they required 6 GB VRAM and I only had a 4 GB card, so I had to wait for someone to implement a low VRAM fix. I started with the Basu Jindal repo. It was very primitive: just the base SD 1.4 model and a simple command line interface. I then switched to A1111 when it started to take off.\n\nOne reason I switched to A1111, apart from the graphical user interface, was that it supported negative prompts. Without it, SD 1.4 and 1.5 would give you lots of nudity regardless of whether you wanted it or not. Many of the anime models that appeared after the NovelAI leak were even worse.",

Saw potential for generating game assets, bought better GPU, tried to come up with (manual) workflows in A1111. ComfyUI came around then. Tried to recreate the workflows in ComfyUI with some success. Stopped using AI (because life). Got back to it at least twice, bought an even better GPU. New models appear to do everything out of the box and my old workflows I worked on are no longer needed.\n\nHaven't used finetunes since SDXL.

With basic controls for temperature, max tokens, top-P, etc. \n\nI'd kinda like something like this UI to just run in the background and endlessly generate songs while I work. But I don't want to have to go in and manually type lyrics every time. If you do add an endless mode, to prevent disk wear, maybe have it cache the last N songs in memory (up to like 1024 MB or something, make it configrable), and then have a little button next to the songs on the song list to save it to disk. Allowing you to only save the songs you want. And then just prune any songs pushed out of the cache (FILO) that weren't manually saved pruned from the song list. \n\nAnd then for seamless/gapless playback have it generate 1 (or some other value, also configrable) songs ahead so there's no gaps. And then add song crossfading as an option if you don't have it already. \n\nI can add this feature and submit a PR if it's not something you want to work on. I've done a bit of work with openai and vLLM API interfaces in the past. Though my JS skills aren't super polished. I'm mostly a python, C/C++, and assembly kind of guy (I like reverse engineering).",

For me, one of the bigger things about AI music is the vocals, because if it was just instrumentals, that's nothing special that I could not already do. Even now I produce music in FL studio, remix it with Suno to add a little more extra to it and to give me a vocalist.\n\nBut for fun, I do prompt some music for the challenge in it.\n\nFor me equally, if there is going to be local gen worthy of cancelling Suno over, it's gotta have that vocalist ability (I know there are some standalone AI vocalist things, but I rather have a one in done shot). I am DYING to be able to train an AI music model as I have some fun things to toss at it. \n\n>I wish a lot of generative AI would focus more on being an asset (like a piece of background music for a video game, or a TV show, or whatever), rather than a standalone piece.\n\nLike these?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltqFda08D6Y\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UWnrVxn9Dk4\n\nLTX2 for video. Suno (Latest v5 model even) for the audio. Instrumental Dark ambient music prompted using some music theory to shape the prompt. Many of my dark ambient tracks to me are more background music for videos, now thanks to comfyUI, I can now put some visualizations around that and am working on some things.\n\nBut I think for any local model to even compete at a non-vocal level it needs to be able to solo instrument ability. People will try to argue that no AI model can do that (even most suno users argue it's not possible), but I can do that all day long in Suno and even enjoy the fight to be able to prompt it. I even publish these following tracks for proof they were generated via prompt only in suno.\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/bIheMysrBnWtm2rE\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/3p35kBh6qpigv9YY\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/84zIw834kpLvWB4C\n\nEven uncanny instrument pairings with only a piano and theremin https://suno.com/s/IToFQB6qL5BvZA57 \n\nWhen the local models can do that, those models can be more idea for video and game use as not everything will require a full band performance.",

I'm currently using ace-stepsv1\\_3.5b for some projects. But, even though it's supposed to have a 285-second limit, it starts to fail and loses consistency after 2 minutes. Do you know if there have been any improvements in this area?.\n\nAnd how does it compare to HeartMula?. Honestly, if you can't create songs of 3 minutes or more, I'd be extremely disappointed. Ace-Steps's one of my favorite open-source sound tools and I was eagerly awaiting this update.\n\nI'm interested in your answer, because this's important for creating semi-professional audio locally. 😎",

HeartMula it's better on the the lyrics like i it never did any mistake related to the pronunciation because they have an auto correct feature in the model.\n\nBut in my opinion this Ace-step model it's the best open source model so far.",

Much like the BBC, big media didn't really see the value in even retaining their IP's original recordings, let alone the value in the intellectual property themselves.\n\n...so, it might be the case that enough training data doesn't exceed 2 minutes that it begins to panic a bit.",

In another four years or less, it will far surpass any human quality or study, and I have no doubt about that. The soul, creativity, etc., are concepts as abstract as the creations of AI themselves.

The current version is locked to this specific atlas layout (grid) because that's what was in the dataset.\n3. You're right about SpriteFonts! Since the output is already a consistent grid, it should be pretty easy to slice and use in game engines.\n\nIf you try it with different inputs, let me know how it goes!",

It is actually **pre-loaded** in the CLIP Text Encode node (the green one) in the included ComfyUI workflow, and there’s a Note node right above it explaining exactly that.\n\nHowever, I see your point: not everyone starts with the workflow. I’ll add the prompt directly to the HuggingFace, GitHub and Reddit descriptions to make it clearer for everyone.\n\nAs for the LoRA’s role: you nailed it! That’s why I called it a **contextual LoRA**. FLUX is amazing at understanding style from a reference, but it doesn't know how to organize that style into a structured 8x9 alphabet atlas on its own. The LoRA provides that 'logical bridge' and ensures the grid consistency. Without it, the model just generates a mess of styled characters, as seen in your example.",

Sure, there are richer, more interactive textbooks (more like were; that was a brief blip in history where people had hope in tablets, and started designing textbooks with deep, interactive infographics... it was a vision for the future that never panned out). But what even is critical thinking in this context? Room fell silent and the mood was ICY. Thankfully for Apple, there's an 'assume positive intent' rule in place and I asked a legitimate question, but man did the managers stare daggers into me. Nobody had an answer.\n\nOnly a few short years later, it turned out iPads were frying kids' brains, and companies stopped trying to make useful, creative, and informative apps, and rushed to cash in on addictive, exploitative user interface design. That was one of the most sickening forks in the road of human history that I had the misfortune of bearing firsthand witness to.\n\nBut yeah... This video brought back some memories.",

There are better models for style transfer now than these common DiT models like Flux klein, Qwen Edit etc. \n\nthen you take all these new extracted frames and feed them into LTX2 sampler and voila.

Qwen was never known for that beyond a small subset, whereas Klein can do far more so this would be even more successful.  Edit: Ok I got it working. For some reason the filename on their lora is 2509, but it barely works with that, giving bad results. Throwing it on qwen edit 2511 and the 2511 4 step lightning lora works great and transfers styles extremely well about 85-90% of the time. It seems some of the ones I tried were a bit tough for it.",

When I ask him how he's been, he just mutters to himself \"rating_questionable, score_8_up, source_pony, source_pony, source_pony....\"  \n\nI still remember when he taught me how to install auto1111 - told me how excited he was for v6.  The last time I saw him, I don't think he even recognized me - not really.  When I waved goodbye, I saw a brief flicker of recognition in his eyes.  He pointed to my hand shouting, \"Five fingers!  You have all five fingers!!\"  I said, \"That's right, buddy.\" and I had to turn away.\n\nRest in goon my friend.  Rest in goon.",

          "text": "One interesting thing about this model is the architecture it is based on. Nvidia Cosmos Predict 2 was originally an architecture for robotic applications with many optimizations for spatial awareness etc. and they seem to have adapted it for image generation purposes. This could explain the excellent prompt adherence and the significant reduction of prompt bleeding. I would love to read a paper about this u/tdrussell1.  \n  \nIn my tests it performs exceptionally well when explaining the subjects generally in a short introduction sentence and then just dropping the usual booru tags.\n\nHere is Gemini's breakdown of the architecture but I am not sure if this is not partly or completely made up:\n\n>The collaboration between ComfyOrg and Circlestone Labs effectively \"strips out\" the robotics-specific components of Cosmos to build a streamlined, highly efficient text-to-image engine.\n\n>The Anima Architecture Breakdown\n\n>While the core \"Predict-2\" logic handles the physics of light and form, the Anima implementation swaps out several components to optimize for character consistency and prompt adherence:\n\n>Backbone: Cosmos Predict-2 2B (Diffusion Transformer)\n\n>Anima uses the 2-billion parameter version of NVIDIA's DiT. This is the \"sweet spot\" for speed, allowing for near-instant generation on consumer GPUs while maintaining the structural \"common sense\" (object permanence, lighting) that NVIDIA trained into the model.\n\n>Text Encoder: Qwen3-0.6B\n\n>Instead of using the standard T5 or CLIP encoders seen in models like SDXL or Flux, Anima uses a 0.6B parameter Qwen3 model.\n\n>Why this matters: LLM-based encoders (like Qwen) understand complex natural language instructions much better than traditional CLIP models. It can handle long, descriptive \"prose\" prompts without \"losing\" the middle of the sentence.\n\n>Latent Encoding: Qwen VAE\n\n>Anima utilizes a specialized Qwen VAE (Variational Autoencoder). This is a departure from the standard Cosmos video tokenizer.\n\n>By using a VAE tuned for the Qwen ecosystem, the model achieves better reconstruction of fine details (like eyes and hair strands) which are notoriously difficult for the high-compression tokenizers used in video-centric world models.",

Your post makes it legitimately look like a fanart (deviant art / pixiv / etc.) model rather than an anime model, but you're not even the only one to do this leading to quite a bit of confusion about the new model's capabilities.

For example, Civit has a commercial license to run Flux, and they also allow using any of the Flux loras (i.e. commercial use of people's loras). The LTX-2 license has language allowing this also.\n\nThe CircleStone license is basically the Flux license, with several things simplified and removed, and some things clarified. This is one of the things that is clarified. The intention is not to be overly restrictive (except for commercial use), and make it clear that any platform that gets a commercial license can also run all the loras. Again, this is already how it works with many existing models.\n\nThe reason for not using a true open source license, but rather a non-commercial open-weights license, is because I'm just one person and training this thing is extremely expensive. If I can't monetize it, it's the last large finetune I'll ever do. I would like to train an Anima 2 one day, or an Anima Video, but it just isn't viable without having some way to make money. I felt like an open-weights strategy where people can use the model freely but I can make some money off big inference platforms, is the best play.",

I completely understand why a non-commercial license makes sense given the cost of training, and the quality of Anima really shows the work you’ve put into it.\n\nUnless I’m misunderstanding something, my remaining concern is still specific to section 3(c.).\nAs far as I understand it, the FLUX and LTX-2 licenses don’t include an automatic grant of rights over user-created LoRAs back to the licensor. In those ecosystems, commercial use of community LoRAs is usually handled through platform Terms of Service, rather than through the base model license itself, at least to my knowledge. Please correct me here if I’m wrong.\n\nBy contrast, 3(c.) appears to give any commercial licensee the right to use all Derivatives regardless of where they’re published, with an explicit waiver of creator compensation. Since LoRAs and fine-tunes are defined as Derivatives, this removes the creator’s ability to decide whether, how, or by whom their Derivatives are commercially used, even though they themselves are not allowed to use them commercially.\n\nI understand the motivation of avoiding per-LoRA negotiations for licensed platforms, but as written this could make people hesitant to invest serious compute into fine-tuning.\n\nThanks again for engaging openly on this.

It's the generic AI style you see everywhere that never resembles actual art while the Anima images aren't as refined yet have the lighting and color grading you'd see in an actual piece. The car image being a perfect example, the illustrious one carries no mood or vibe with it while the Anima one does. It conveys intent, something SDXL models lack. \n\nI think Anima has potential, but maybe the base model they chose (cosmos 2b) lacks the necessary depth to fully surpass SDXL. Something like Klein 4b would be a better choice.",

I am looking forward to it and not having to Photoshop hands anymore.\n\nIf they are using the danbooru catalogue, they should drop certain terms like eye colors and hair colors at an increased rate and bake those into the characters. Nipples is also one that should be omitted more often. Also, there should be more disambiguation for characters like OoT Zelda or Misty's hairstyles.",

Nodes enabled:\n\n* High: 1 steps (2,27s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (3,33s/it)\n* Total: 29,07 seconds\n\nDisable the node:\n\n* High: 1 step (2,26s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (2,04s/it)\n* Total: 19,98 seconds\n\nVideo's came out fine, no weird stuff. But it's cache, so I changed the prompt a little: basically same vid no prompt adherence (same time, about 21 sec). Changed the prompt more:\n\n* High: 1 step (2,32s/it)\n* Low: 3 steps (2,09s/it)\n* Total: 29,22 seconds\n\nThis is more like the regular speed. Don't have time right now but I will certainly investigate this further. \n\nAfter not-bypassing and bypassing the nodes, I can change the seed, bump up the amount of steps (with visible improvements) but when I try to make the video longer it fails. Some crazy stuff is going on in the background.",

Comfy exists because of them, and this grant is our way of giving back and continuing to empower the ecosystem.\n\nI know, I know, $1M alone won’t train a state-of-the-art foundation model today. That’s okay. This is just the starting point. Beyond direct funding, we also support grantees with real-world evaluation, production testing, and promotion across the Comfy platform.\n\nGrant recipients retain full control over their model and license (as long as it remains open) and can automatically enroll in our Cloud revenue share program to further sustain the project.\n\nWe can’t wait to see all the amazing open source models that come out of this effort.\n\nApply for the grant at [https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant](https://www.comfy.org/ai-grant)\n\nFYI: you can try out the Anima model here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima](https://huggingface.co/circlestone-labs/Anima)",

While it was said to be for ease of organization, the reality is that this makes it easy to replace anyone from top to bottom. \n\nThese kind of moves, along with throwing around big money, and corps seeing monetary interest in the project, tend to signal a coming buyout by a big investor.

Now we have a new asset list where we need to double click. (why?) And even worse, the new asset list just stops workling after a couple of hundred gens. Sometimes earlier. Never happened with the old asset list. \n\nThe we have this new panel on the right. The job queue. It cumbersome and doesnt really help me. No way to hide it. It shows super small thumbnails and parts of my filename. Dont need this taking away my screenstate... except when i need to cancel queued jobs\n\nWe had cancel and stop buttons. What a great invention that was. Until you took them away. Cancel button is back now (thanks!!!) but stop button still missing. Of course i can click that weird icon in the job-queue that will cancel all other jobs except the current on. But if i am on instant gen (and i am often on instant gen) it keeps going. I have to switch to single run, click run, cancel the other jobs, cancel the current job just to stop it all. It was a single button before all these updates. It takes me 4 clicks now to stop the instant generations. its painful.\n\nI dunno. The UI in comfy is all but comfy. I know this is free software. I did not a pay a cent. But all these options were in there at one point and then the enterprisification of the software has started. \n\nSo please bring back the stop button. That would be real nice.",

We don't have a proper idea of how it does with modern anime screencaps, or even retro anime screencaps, which are what most people would expect from this kind of model.\n\nAt first, I thought it was weird the creator posted that only super low quality flash art example and the first two threads didn't even attempt to use examples people would legitimately care about, but since then this response has continued in every single Anima post I can find it has now become weird. Can it really just not do 90s, 2000s, etc. anime screen-cap outputs? Is it really that biased and trained almost exclusively on Deviant art and such works? I've seen two iffy random user comment examples, and one was extremely bad as if it couldn't understand the prompt.\n\nWell, utterly poor publicity and information aside I don't want to assume it DOA until it has a chance to prove itself but I'm definitely not feeling hopeful about it at this point.

I'm going through a tough time; I'm sick, but I still have to work, and the release of Ace-stepv1.5 has really brightened my day.\n\nI don't use Suno or any paid music software; I prefer to work locally, with all the limitations that entails.\n\nPlease note that some audio normalization and vocoder nodes're missing. I recommend checking out this developer repository: [github.com/jeankassio/JK-AceStep-Nodes](http://github.com/jeankassio/JK-AceStep-Nodes), as there're several settings that can significantly improve this model.\n\nYou could also review the text encoder, as it takes almost 90 seconds to load, and I don't use any of the ComfyUI -flags options. The rest of the setup's extremely fast with 16 GB of VRAM and 96 GB of RAM.\n\nI really enjoy creating songs as a hobby, but anyone with basic musical knowledge can use this model and produce professional-quality work. I can't thank you enough, Ace-step team. I was using the previous version of this model, and this one's so much better for ever. Thanks again!. I hope you continue with this it and that all your projects reach new sky! ❤️",

For this music generation model, it’s also likely that it couldn’t be trained on copyrighted music.\n\nImage generation models and video generation models have both improved significantly over time thanks to extensive community tuning and iterative enhancements, which steadily raised the quality of their outputs.\n\nI’ve also tried generating music with ComfyUI, and I agree that the audio quality often feels lacking, and that it struggles to express a wide and rich variety of musical performance styles. That said, I do think it’s impressive that it can generate a 4-minute piece of music (even if the quality isn’t very high yet), and that the lyrics are implemented fairly well.\n\nAs the community grows and more external fine-tuning efforts are made, won’t the model’s performance inevitably improve?\n\nWe’re seeing a very similar situation right now with open-source image generation models as well.  \nNew models that look capable of replacing heavily fine-tuned SDXL are being released, and they’re currently waiting for further tuning and refinement.",
