The adult humans don’t have a “childish misunderstanding of what acting is,” they are intentionally acting as children since they are stand-ins for the generated child characters they are being replaced with. This is on purpose, they were hired to do this.\n\nThe idea that these actors were accidentally acting like children because they didn’t know how to act as adults is funny though",

My read on it is they know exactly what they're doing, it's just you need more stage acting skills than film acting skills for this kind of performance transfer to work well. At least for now.\n\nStage actors need to play for the benefit of the people in the back of the crowd, so all their movements and expressions are exaggerated to make it obvious what's happening. Pro wrestlers are especially good at this, you can make out John Cena's expression from the back seat of an arena.\n\nFilm actors are more subtle, with smaller natural movements and micro-expressions that would be completely lost on a person further away than a couple feet, but that's fine because everyone watching is only as far away as the camera.\n\nOnce you compress your video of the film actors doing their film acting to the right input resolution, then use the VAE to compress it further, is there enough information left in their movements for the model to really latch onto?\n\nCompare the facial expressions when the goblin is touching the car at 00:43. Despite the overacted facial expression from the actor, it's a little more subtle than her other expressions so doesn't translate to the character at all. If the model can't translate that exaggerated expression, it doesn't stand a chance reproducing a real expression of awe and wonder.",

We're already stuck with American cloud models having a hard time working with historical documents from America if it's obscure enough not to have hardcoded exceptions in the dataset/hidden prompt. Because history is life and life is filled with countless messy horrible things. \n\nI've gotten rejections from LLMs from some of the most boring elements from records of people's lives from 100-200 years ago for so many stupid reasons. From changes in grammar to what kind of jokes are considered proper to the fact that farm life involves a lot of death and disease. Especially back then. \n\nThe hobbiest LLM spaces are filled with Americans who'll yell about censorship of Chinese history in Chinese LLMs. But it's frustrating how little almost any of them care about the same with their own history and LLMs.",

[It could make a bunch of human shaped objects lie on grass completely fine](https://postimg.cc/gallery/YmZ9B3X), but as soon as \"woman\" entered the prompt it shat itself. Even if the model was never shown a woman lying like some people were spouting back then, it clearly knows what a humanoid looks like when lying down so it should have been able to generalize. \n\nThe saddest part is SD3.5 Medium is actually a [really interesting model for art](https://postimg.cc/gallery/grmwg4F), and from memory it was trained completely different than SD3 and 3.5 Large but for whatever reason Stability believed the SD3 brand wasn't complete poison by that point. If Medium was called SD4 and it might have had a chance.\n\nNot gonna lie though, as much as I love playing around with ZiT and Klein and appreciate the adherence the new training style brings, I miss models trained on raw alt-text. There was something special about prompting your hometown and getting photos that looked like they could have been taken from there.",

It's possible they could have trained an entirely new model between the API release and open release and botched it, but that seems wasteful even for Stability.\n\nI did a lot of testing trying to figure out what the issue was and it felt like they specifically targeted certain concepts, or combinations of concepts. Like this prompt:\n\n>a Photo of Ruth Struthers shot from above, it is lying in the grass\n\n>Negative: vishnu, goro from mortal kombat, machamp\n\nProduced a [bad but not broken](https://i.postimg.cc/WVSSr6Wx/PA-city-00211.png) image of a woman lying on the grass. Because I called the person by a proper noun and referred to them as \"it\".

Of course, there are still plenty of people stuck in the past.\n\nThe same goes for color grading, heavy “creative” color work has fallen out of fashion, with images kept much closer to RAW.\n\nAnd all of this is because people started, and are still continuing, to produce huge amounts of overly polished images in Midjourney and similar tools",

It's really slow but the images I get are spot on and you can reduce resolution down to 1024x1024 for faster speeds but you're reducing the detail a lot and at that point it's better to just use the others if you want HQ with fast production times.\n\nI would say though if you do have the Vram and are more interested in quality of image than speed then this setup is worth going for, especially if you like to train character lora's because they stack very well with other lora's\n\nGive it a go guys even with lower end hardware and you might be surprised how much quality you can get.",

But the real issue is that for myself, on a 3090, it's much slower than it's alternatives and swallows all of my VRAM. I can't imagine that most other people, whose cards are slower, would find it useable. \n\nBut the other thing is that Qwen's way of making models is inherently counter-productive to adoption. The fact that Qwen has multiple numbered versions and nothing made for one is compatible with any other is not a selling point. If you were going to train loras or fine tunes, you wouldn't go 'let me train it for every new version' you'd go 'let me wait to see which version is the adopted one and then I'll do it' which means that inevitably no one trains anything for it.",

Nvidia's confidence in key players is a major indicator of where this is headed. Trillions a year is being spent on AI and its not making money because its a race for data in modeling by human guinea pig users to get to AGI.\n\nI think if we can get to a dirty AGI that is capable on quantum compute to solve the transformer multiplier issue and go addition only, we might actually see some efficiency gains. But right now? We are just burning cash and electricity.\n\nI am disappointed that users are suffering with the high pricing and discontinued high VRAM models due to the chip pricing around current world issues. This is without talking about power requirements for the growing modular AI factories popping up everywhere.\n\nThe consumer side is getting squeezed. You want a decent GPU for local models? Good luck affording it. You want to use cloud APIs? Hope you got a corporate budget because the pricing is insane for regular people trying to experiment and build. Meanwhile the big labs are hoovering up H100s like there is no tomorrow and venture capital is just throwing money at anything with AI in the pitch deck.\n\nWe are in this weird spot where the technology is advancing faster than anyone can regulate it or even understand the implications. Nobody is asking the hard questions about sustainability, both financially and environmentally. These data centers are pulling power like small cities and the returns are mostly theoretical at this point.\n\nThe whole thing feels like a gold rush where everyone is selling pickaxes and nobody is finding gold yet. Except in this case the pickaxes cost millions and use enough power to run a small country.\n\nI mean no one is talking carbon footprint anymore and global warming ...

Then I got into comfyui, then I started writing my own nodes, then I learned how to train a LoRA and what the process behind that was.\n\nThen I wrote a classification system that uses face recognition to sort images into groups based on who's in the photo - and then grade them based on resolution and sharpness of the face area - this gives me pools of potential LoRA training data. Then I learned how to use Google's APIs to put a name to a face for those groups of images, and then merge islands of image collections that are actually the same person (but perhaps different ages or styles).\n\nSo, gateway into AI and machine learning.",

I then signed up for the Stable Diffusion beta and managed to get invited. When the model and software were first released, they required 6 GB VRAM and I only had a 4 GB card, so I had to wait for someone to implement a low VRAM fix. I started with the Basu Jindal repo. It was very primitive: just the base SD 1.4 model and a simple command line interface. I then switched to A1111 when it started to take off.\n\nOne reason I switched to A1111, apart from the graphical user interface, was that it supported negative prompts. Without it, SD 1.4 and 1.5 would give you lots of nudity regardless of whether you wanted it or not. Many of the anime models that appeared after the NovelAI leak were even worse.",

Saw potential for generating game assets, bought better GPU, tried to come up with (manual) workflows in A1111. ComfyUI came around then. Tried to recreate the workflows in ComfyUI with some success. Stopped using AI (because life). Got back to it at least twice, bought an even better GPU. New models appear to do everything out of the box and my old workflows I worked on are no longer needed.\n\nHaven't used finetunes since SDXL.

For me, one of the bigger things about AI music is the vocals, because if it was just instrumentals, that's nothing special that I could not already do. Even now I produce music in FL studio, remix it with Suno to add a little more extra to it and to give me a vocalist.\n\nBut for fun, I do prompt some music for the challenge in it.\n\nFor me equally, if there is going to be local gen worthy of cancelling Suno over, it's gotta have that vocalist ability (I know there are some standalone AI vocalist things, but I rather have a one in done shot). I am DYING to be able to train an AI music model as I have some fun things to toss at it. \n\n>I wish a lot of generative AI would focus more on being an asset (like a piece of background music for a video game, or a TV show, or whatever), rather than a standalone piece.\n\nLike these?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltqFda08D6Y\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UWnrVxn9Dk4\n\nLTX2 for video. Suno (Latest v5 model even) for the audio. Instrumental Dark ambient music prompted using some music theory to shape the prompt. Many of my dark ambient tracks to me are more background music for videos, now thanks to comfyUI, I can now put some visualizations around that and am working on some things.\n\nBut I think for any local model to even compete at a non-vocal level it needs to be able to solo instrument ability. People will try to argue that no AI model can do that (even most suno users argue it's not possible), but I can do that all day long in Suno and even enjoy the fight to be able to prompt it. I even publish these following tracks for proof they were generated via prompt only in suno.\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/bIheMysrBnWtm2rE\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/3p35kBh6qpigv9YY\n\nhttps://suno.com/s/84zIw834kpLvWB4C\n\nEven uncanny instrument pairings with only a piano and theremin https://suno.com/s/IToFQB6qL5BvZA57 \n\nWhen the local models can do that, those models can be more idea for video and game use as not everything will require a full band performance.",

I'm currently using ace-stepsv1\\_3.5b for some projects. But, even though it's supposed to have a 285-second limit, it starts to fail and loses consistency after 2 minutes. Do you know if there have been any improvements in this area?.\n\nAnd how does it compare to HeartMula?. Honestly, if you can't create songs of 3 minutes or more, I'd be extremely disappointed. Ace-Steps's one of my favorite open-source sound tools and I was eagerly awaiting this update.\n\nI'm interested in your answer, because this's important for creating semi-professional audio locally. 😎",

HeartMula it's better on the the lyrics like i it never did any mistake related to the pronunciation because they have an auto correct feature in the model.\n\nBut in my opinion this Ace-step model it's the best open source model so far.",

Much like the BBC, big media didn't really see the value in even retaining their IP's original recordings, let alone the value in the intellectual property themselves.\n\n...so, it might be the case that enough training data doesn't exceed 2 minutes that it begins to panic a bit.",

Particularly, the audio editing options and lora training are more exciting to me than just local generation itself. \n\nI've read their page and this seems like a huge deal, a lot of creative functions on top of generations.\n\nNot sure I like the low VRAM. I'd prefer a beefy model designed for more quality, but maybe too much VRAM isn't even necessary? The results in their page sounded nice as it is.",

This model, I've heard the examples/am in their discord etc, is -not- in the same level as Sudo/Udio. It is \"State of the Art\", but eventually a Chinese dev group w different views on training on (c) audio content will come through. Tech/code is not the problem anymore IMHO, it's fear of liability/backlash that has prevent advanced in the AI music realm.",

Qwen was never known for that beyond a small subset, whereas Klein can do far more so this would be even more successful.  Edit: Ok I got it working. For some reason the filename on their lora is 2509, but it barely works with that, giving bad results. Throwing it on qwen edit 2511 and the 2511 4 step lightning lora works great and transfers styles extremely well about 85-90% of the time. It seems some of the ones I tried were a bit tough for it.",

Sure, there are richer, more interactive textbooks (more like were; that was a brief blip in history where people had hope in tablets, and started designing textbooks with deep, interactive infographics... it was a vision for the future that never panned out). But what even is critical thinking in this context? Room fell silent and the mood was ICY. Thankfully for Apple, there's an 'assume positive intent' rule in place and I asked a legitimate question, but man did the managers stare daggers into me. Nobody had an answer.\n\nOnly a few short years later, it turned out iPads were frying kids' brains, and companies stopped trying to make useful, creative, and informative apps, and rushed to cash in on addictive, exploitative user interface design. That was one of the most sickening forks in the road of human history that I had the misfortune of bearing firsthand witness to.\n\nBut yeah... This video brought back some memories.",

So every such frame you'd need to do either image-to-image or a style transfer. There are better models for style transfer now than these common DiT models like Flux klein, Qwen Edit etc. \n\nthen you take all these new extracted frames and feed them into LTX2 sampler and voila. With some good prompting for each scene I think you'd be able to do this. If you automate the entire workflow it's probably doable to do an entire movie.",

No more choosing between “follows the prompt” and “doesn’t fall apart.”\n\n**More practical fine-tuning + faster inference**  \n**Why you should care:** better behavior on real hardware.\n\nTrainer updates improve memory usage and make fine-tuning more predictable on constrained GPUs.\n\nInference is also faster for video-to-video by downscaling the reference video before cross-attention, reducing compute cost. (Speedup depend on resolution and clip length.)\n\nWe’ve also shipped new ComfyUI nodes and a unified LoRA to support these changes.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nThis drop isn’t a one-off. The next LTX-2 version is already in progress, focused on:\n\n* Better fine detail and visual fidelity (new VAE)\n* Improved consistency to conditioning inputs\n* Cleaner, more reliable audio\n* Stronger image-to-video behavior\n* Better prompt understanding and color handling\n\n[More on what's coming up here.](https://ltx.io/model/model-blog/the-road-ahead-for-ltx-2)\n\n# Try It and Stress It!\n\nIf you’re pushing LTX-2 in real workflows, your feedback directly shapes what we build next.

The quantized weights take up maybe 13-14GB of VRAM. So still a lot, but much less than the existing LTX-2 text encoder nodes, which don't quantize them at all.\n\nSeems to work alright. Only downside is the quantized weights need to be discarded from VRAM after the node is done (rather than simply moved to RAM), as it would otherwise take up too much system RAM. But quantizing the weights only takes a couple seconds.\n\nSo in theory, with this approach, if you can already use the Gemma3 12B model for prompt encoding (which ComfyUI does by passing the prompt embeddings into the forward pass of the model, and then pulling out the weights from the 49 hidden layers, and then combining them and passing them to the embeddings connector model), you can also use it for LLM inference.\n\nAPI-based generation always seems a bit iffy.",

Any checkpoint trained now will have compatibility issues with Loras trained on later previews and might inherit issues that will be solved in later previews. Any good practices researched/discovered now might get outdated in the next versions.\n\nSo yeah, we'll need to wait for the official release, or at least for very late previews.

          "text": "One interesting thing about this model is the architecture it is based on. Nvidia Cosmos Predict 2 was originally an architecture for robotic applications with many optimizations for spatial awareness etc. and they seem to have adapted it for image generation purposes. This could explain the excellent prompt adherence and the significant reduction of prompt bleeding. I would love to read a paper about this u/tdrussell1.  \n  \nIn my tests it performs exceptionally well when explaining the subjects generally in a short introduction sentence and then just dropping the usual booru tags.\n\nHere is Gemini's breakdown of the architecture but I am not sure if this is not partly or completely made up:\n\n>The collaboration between ComfyOrg and Circlestone Labs effectively \"strips out\" the robotics-specific components of Cosmos to build a streamlined, highly efficient text-to-image engine.\n\n>The Anima Architecture Breakdown\n\n>While the core \"Predict-2\" logic handles the physics of light and form, the Anima implementation swaps out several components to optimize for character consistency and prompt adherence:\n\n>Backbone: Cosmos Predict-2 2B (Diffusion Transformer)\n\n>Anima uses the 2-billion parameter version of NVIDIA's DiT. This is the \"sweet spot\" for speed, allowing for near-instant generation on consumer GPUs while maintaining the structural \"common sense\" (object permanence, lighting) that NVIDIA trained into the model.\n\n>Text Encoder: Qwen3-0.6B\n\n>Instead of using the standard T5 or CLIP encoders seen in models like SDXL or Flux, Anima uses a 0.6B parameter Qwen3 model.\n\n>Why this matters: LLM-based encoders (like Qwen) understand complex natural language instructions much better than traditional CLIP models. It can handle long, descriptive \"prose\" prompts without \"losing\" the middle of the sentence.\n\n>Latent Encoding: Qwen VAE\n\n>Anima utilizes a specialized Qwen VAE (Variational Autoencoder). This is a departure from the standard Cosmos video tokenizer.\n\n>By using a VAE tuned for the Qwen ecosystem, the model achieves better reconstruction of fine details (like eyes and hair strands) which are notoriously difficult for the high-compression tokenizers used in video-centric world models.",

While the prompt adherence may be better in some cases, and the manga output's are cool, most people likely are wanting anime screencap quality outputs which this model appears to lack the ability to do well from any example I've seen posted in these Anima threads. It mostly features a lot older styles, fan work styles, etc.\n\nIt's going to need a refiner step, and even then I have my doubts it will be popular.\n\nEDIT: Found this linked one. That said, I might be wrong and it could just be an issue of everyone posting the worst (\\*#$@( examples you can think of instead of quality examples people actually want and will use like this guy actually did: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1qthxyi/comment/o33d2uc/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1qthxyi/comment/o33d2uc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI mean no offense OP, but, not a single modern example is a bit weird. Your post makes it legitimately look like a fanart (deviant art / pixiv / etc.) model rather than an anime model, but you're not even the only one to do this leading to quite a bit of confusion about the new model's capabilities. Alas, the creator didn't post shit, either, except the single worst example screenshot ever looks like its form a flash game back when dial-up was SOTA.",

              "text": "Hi I made the Anima model.\n\nThis type of thing is already in other similar licenses (Flux, LTX-2), it's just not explicit. For example, Civit has a commercial license to run Flux, and they also allow using any of the Flux loras (i.e. commercial use of people's loras). The LTX-2 license has language allowing this also.\n\nThe CircleStone license is basically the Flux license, with several things simplified and removed, and some things clarified. This is one of the things that is clarified. The intention is not to be overly restrictive (except for commercial use), and make it clear that any platform that gets a commercial license can also run all the loras. Again, this is already how it works with many existing models.\n\nThe reason for not using a true open source license, but rather a non-commercial open-weights license, is because I'm just one person and training this thing is extremely expensive. If I can't monetize it, it's the last large finetune I'll ever do. I would like to train an Anima 2 one day, or an Anima Video, but it just isn't viable without having some way to make money. I felt like an open-weights strategy where people can use the model freely but I can make some money off big inference platforms, is the best play.",

I completely understand why a non-commercial license makes sense given the cost of training, and the quality of Anima really shows the work you’ve put into it.\n\nUnless I’m misunderstanding something, my remaining concern is still specific to section 3(c.).\nAs far as I understand it, the FLUX and LTX-2 licenses don’t include an automatic grant of rights over user-created LoRAs back to the licensor. In those ecosystems, commercial use of community LoRAs is usually handled through platform Terms of Service, rather than through the base model license itself, at least to my knowledge. Please correct me here if I’m wrong.\n\nBy contrast, 3(c.) appears to give any commercial licensee the right to use all Derivatives regardless of where they’re published, with an explicit waiver of creator compensation. Since LoRAs and fine-tunes are defined as Derivatives, this removes the creator’s ability to decide whether, how, or by whom their Derivatives are commercially used, even though they themselves are not allowed to use them commercially.\n\nI understand the motivation of avoiding per-LoRA negotiations for licensed platforms, but as written this could make people hesitant to invest serious compute into fine-tuning.\n\nThanks again for engaging openly on this. Looking forward to seeing where Anima goes!",

EDIT: ok, I think I just realized that we need a negative, just like wan 2.2 and chroma. I added the following and the image quality went way up with much more reliable fingers (at least for the moment): \"3d rendered, animation, illustration, low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, disfigure, blurry, smudged,  watermark, signature, 色调艳丽，过曝，静态，细节模糊不清，字幕，风格，作品，画作，画面，静止，整体发灰，最差质量，低质量，JPEG压缩残留，丑陋的，残缺的，多余的手指，画得不好的手部，画得不好的脸部，畸形的，毁容的，形态畸形的肢体，手指融合，静止不动的画面，杂乱的背景，三条腿，背景人很多，倒着走\" - I'm sure we'll figure out the right settings but people were complaining about body horror with klein, but I'm getting far worse with this. I'm getting some pretty great stuff but every time I think I've got the best settings with corrective upscale, the next seed is awful again. On a positive note, the variety and \"depth\" with the base model is WAY better than turbo. It's far more responsive to action scene skewed perspective stuff than turbo was.",

Her copper-blonde synthetic hair, matted and wild from combat, whips violently in the wind generated by passing hover-transports above, contrasting against her battle-scarred glossy obsidian tactical armor featuring exposed hydraulic joints, coolant tubes, and the faded Mitsubishi-Raiden Heavy Industries logo barely visible on her reinforced black tactical jacket's shoulder plate. She thrusts her 90cm muramasa-grade katana directly at the camera in aggressive challenge, the polished surgical steel blade impaling an absurdist trophy of premium otoro tuna nigiri, salmon roe gunkan, and dragon rolls stolen from a yakuza-owned omakase restaurant, wasabi and soy sauce dripping down the blade like dark blood. The scene captures her mid-pivot with extreme dutch angle at 25 degrees, motion blur streaking the background where terrified salarymen in rumpled suits scatter and a tipped-over yatai food cart spills takoyaki across wet cobblestones, steam rising from storm drains mixing with her chassis's venting coolant. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses at f/1.4, 1/500 shutter speed freezing rain droplets while maintaining cinematic motion blur on her whipping hair and the panicked crowd behind her. Atmospheric tension built through the sickly green-magenta color palette of overlapping holographic advertisements reflecting off puddles, a massive 50-foot LED billboard displaying J-pop idols towering above her diminutive 5'4\" chrome frame, emphasizing her deadly precision against urban sprawl chaos. Her body language radiates controlled aggression, weight shifted forward on reinforced titanium leg actuators, free hand's fingers splayed with micro-missile ports visible in her palm, optical sensors behind her visor burning amber through the rain. Highly detailed 8K photorealistic rendering capturing every water bead on her armor's nano-coating, the precise spiraling of rice grains on her skewered sushi trophies, and the terrified reflection of a fleeing ramen chef visible in her helmet's curved surface, gritty cinematic photography embodying Ghost in the Shell meets Blade Runner 2049 with John Wick's kinetic brutality.",

This is exacerbated with video, where you also need to describe motion and timing. \n\nThe future will hopefully have smarter tools that allow for precise image generation without having to describe everything in a prompt. Tools are already in development that aim towards this (like Artcraft, for example).\n\nBut back to the topic at hand, yes - I'd want to use a prompt to describe a variation of what I want to see. It's enormously frustrating to describe something precisely and have the model not follow it, only to then increment the seed and have the model then follow it. \n\nThat's not a sustainable system for targeted image generation in any professional pipeline - that system only works if you're happy with random output.",
