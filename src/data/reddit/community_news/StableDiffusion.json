There are open source options of professional software or services (I work in tech sales, SaaS included) and even then, there are very few companies who choose the open source route... Open source is for you and I. There are some exceptions. \n\nThat said, sometimes it's better to outsource things that a company COULD do itself because a company may not be an AI company. If they sell clothes, they generally aren't interested in being THAT vertical tbh. Some very large conglomerates are vertical, but there are plenty who are not tbh. \n\nLike I said, you are rewarded in start ups for being one of the first to get a foot hold more than you are for being technically accurate.\n\nYou could package this as an easy deployable workflow, local or hosted. And if it's easy and have some proven points (do some pilots for free for some to get feedback, data, and work out kinks etc) and sell them to companies. Even if it's not something that will be a billion dollar idea, it's something you could sell and make some money on in the mean time, or sell the business or look to get acquired etc.\n\nOr, his own service, that uses this, on a website that takes say links from shien or amazon or other store sites, and allows this for free, but then the links to the clothes are linked with referral/partner links. etc.  I would say, TryOn.com but that's taken lol\n\nAnd even if 80% of the prospects out there agree with you, the fashion industry is 359 Billion dollars, so I would NOT mind taking some scraps of 360 billion dollars  even if only 1% might be customers, that's still 360 million. Just in the US. lmfao\n\n\nOf course, Now that I mentioned this now here, any further use of this business model will of course need to be licensed from me. hahah ;)\n\n\nEDIT:  Looks like at least one other is already doing it (fyi, there are many business that are still very successful even in fairly flooded markets) https://try-on.io/ (not a promotion, idk anything about that site other than they are doing something similar. (Op's looks better tbh)",

Even Z-Image Base and Chroma, both based on Flux.1 which is an older architecture, beat it in terms of [detail and texture capabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ramrmr/comment/o6mu7kl/). It's a shame since it's a really good edit model.\n\nFlux.2 Dev on the other hand does [amazing detail](https://i.postimg.cc/zqWv3g8z/Comfy-UI-Flux-2-Dev-02.jpg) (example below) - you can practically see the skin pores, tiny hairs, peach fuzz etc., but it's a nightmare to run on casual hardware, unless you use the NVFP4 version which works only on RTX50 cards. Flux.2 Dev uses the same VAE as Klein so it seems that the issue is with the model itself. Probably Klein didn't get enough hi-res training?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhja9rvglxlg1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e52f3b27c857647371218cd6cd5b615247f74469",

It's also the ultimate character creator that lets me find the perfect mix of human, animal, male and female traits that my weird bisexual furry brain finds attractive.",

Took the left image from the previous post (which might've even degraded it a bit more, I'm not too familiar with webp). Flux.1 Dev, absolute minimal workflow, no prompt, 32 steps, 1024x1024, otherwise default settings, Euler simple, seed:1. Added flux.1-dev-controlnet-upscaler. Set strength to 0.9, as default brought a bit too much grain, but it did come at the cost of losing a little bit of her facial likeness. Done. \n\nJust to be clear, if I tasked a professional with the job and this is what I'd receive, I'd want my money back. But that's not the point. This isn't just upscaling, it's also a fair bit of restauration. Even with AI, this requires much more work and multiple passes. Also, this was a VERY quick and dirty job, I didn't even try higher resolutions. However, I believe with some careful SDE noise scheduling, I could achieve even an better result in one pass. \n\nThe point however is, Klein can't do everything equally good, or even better than previous models (in this case F1 + a controlnet tailored to the task) and there's simply no perfect one-pass solution.",

Yeah, this tip works great when you use style LoRA. But not so great when you literally need 1.0 strength to make it work.

It takes longer than ZIT but not as long as just using ZIB since you don’t have to fully generate the ZIB image, and can also upscale your latent between steps (so only ZIT does the full resolution).

          "text": "OP, I have some ideas that you can test that might change your opinions on ZiT vs Zi.  The more I use ZiT, the more I encounter the limitations of distillation.  I'm not shitting on ZiT here - overall quality and speed are great - I'm just pointing out its limitations.\n\n### Caveats for all my tests:\n* You have to use a detailed prompt because the more detail you add, the more ZiT looses diversity\n* Yes, it's possible to *sometimes* do any of these things with enough rerolls and careful prompt tweaking, but then all speed advantage of ZiT is lost\n* Yes a lora can fix any individual issue here, but every lora decreases diversity in things unrelated to the lora, even sliders.  Once you use multiple loras, diversity loss gets extreme\n* These are just the examples I can remember, but I've banged my head against many other knowledge limitations of distillation\n\n### Lighting\n* ZiT strongly leans towards boring simplistic lighting:\n  * Either frontal flash photography (like your computer room example)\n  * Or simple outdoor sunlight (like your bicyclist and princess peach examples)\n* Try testing:\n  * indoor setting without sunlight (e.g. in a bar)\n  * outdoor setting at night time\n  * prompting for specific lighting like rim-light, specific directionality, specific colors\n * in your octane render example, the ZiT lighting looks great (are you sure you didn't accidentally switch ZiT and Zi?).  But I bet if that if you add specific details about clothes, hair, and background objects, the ZiT lighting will get boring\n\n### Hairstyles\n* ZiT knows very few hairstyles, and certain hairstyles keywords are strongly associated with certain ages/ethnicities/makeup/etc.\n* Try testing:\n  * caucasian woman with pink hair\n  * pink hair but without dark roots\n  * short hair but without bangs\n  * sculpted cosplay/wig style (like your princess peach example) but with normal clothes\n  * classic 90s blowout hair or \"pageant\" hair (google to see example).  ZiT thinks \"blowout\" means curly\n\n### Facial expressions\n* ZiT can only do extreme expressions - e.g. tongue out is waaaay out, pouting is like they just bit into a lemon, surprised is like a soyjak meme\n\n### Blending anything\n* ZiT is very blending concepts creatively.  People often mention the issue with seed diversity (e.g. composition), but SVE node at least helps with that.  Nothing can fix the general lack of concept diversity and ability to blend them.\n* Try testing:\n  * Blend clothes styles of two characters ZiT knows (e.g. princess peach and lara croft)\n  * Blend cyberpunk or mecha with princess-style ornate dress\n  * harder examples like blending a motorcycle and a toy horse\n\n### Body poses\n* ZiT often makes boring body poses.  If you try to tell it where each limb goes, it's like a limp marionette.  \n* Non-photo style has better posing - like you got great results in your isekai example.\n* Try testing:\n  * standing but with legs crossed\n  * kneeling with only one knee touching the ground\n  * running hand through hair (not pulling hair away)\n  * any interesting standing pose (google \"standing pose ideas\") any try to imitate with prompting",

ComfyUI direct workflow:\nAnimateDiff + ControlNet: You feed your smartphone video into ComfyUI. ControlNet extracts the 2D poses and depth from your video frame-by-frame, and AnimateDiff forces Stable Diffusion to keep the generated frames consistent over time. It requires tweaking to stop flickering, but it can be done.\n\n2. The 3D route :\nUsing Andrea Pozzetti [ComfyUI-MotionCapture](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-MotionCapture) to extract 3D motion as FBX + my node. I didn't test it but it should technically work. The advantage is being able to change the camera angle of your scene.\n\nHope it answers your question :)",

I designed a suite of nodes for MoCap directly inside ComfyUI, which exports 3D data using mediapipe as a json file, you'd need to go through some process to get some conversion going and redirect that 3D data to a 3D rig.\nOr you can experiment with my MoCap nodes to directly use the output (openpose skeleton), here's the link in case : \n[ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap)",

It doesn't understand shape language, identity, storytelling and design, etc.\n\nThat taste has to come from the human element. The ideas and taste the human imbues AI with, is what can turn the tool's craft into art.\n\nThe people who seek a one stop shop in prompting will find themselves amidst a wave of generic lookalikes. Those who use unique workflows, including manual work, won't save as much time, but can create a better sense of identity, stand out, and resonate more with a chosen audience.\n\nThere is a place for craft. We're surrounded by useful but forgettable things. However powerful AI as a crafting tool is, humans love novelty and surprise. It's often those who push boundaries which stand a greater chance at succeeding in those areas where this human desire shows up the most, such as in films, games, shows, marketing, etc. Whenever there's a need to get more eyeballs pointed someplace, higher engagement, talent will be requested.\n\nThen again, I could be wrong. Who knows, perhaps our future overlord Stable Diffusion XXL 20 will be superintelligent, have taste, be truly creative, and come up with beautiful ideas, unprompted, on its own.",

Everything just ends up looking like that same generic AI plastic.\n\nThe real moat is definitely *curation and intent*. Knowing exactly what frame you need for the cut, and literally forcing the model to spit it out so it matches your composition. It takes way more manual work in After Effects to glue it all together (the grain, the crushed blacks), but at least it actually has an identity.\n\nAs for SD XXL 20 turning into some super-intelligent art director… honestly, with how fast this tech moves, I wouldn't even be mad lmao. But until an algorithm can actually *feel* the tension of a 24fps cut-to-black, I think us manual editors are safe for a bit. Appreciate the insight!",

          "text": "A lot of people think the AIGC era made creating easy—just type a prompt and boom, you have a film. But tbh, as someone actually in the trenches doing this, I gotta say: **the technical barrier dropped to zero, but the aesthetic barrier just shot through the roof.**\n\nAI is an insanely powerful brush, but it’s not a brain. Without a solid foundation in visual storytelling, generated clips are just a random pile of footage with zero narrative breathing room. You literally have to think like a director: *How does this shot transition? How does the lighting serve the emotional undertone? How are you controlling the pacing?* You can’t outsource that to an algorithm. Without an overarching structure, your video just falls into disconnected logic and a fractured art style.\n\nNow that \"1-click generation\" is the norm, we're absolutely drowning in homogenous AI slop. **Your only real moat right now is your unique taste and your understanding of human emotion.** Don't let the tool box you in. In this human-AI collab, you *must* maintain your agency as the creator. You use your aesthetic judgment to ruthlessly curate and reconstruct what the AI spits out, making sure every single frame actually serves the theme.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tech empowers the narrative, but it can never replace the soul. Be the director who controls the vision, not just a \"prompt jockey\" moving text from one box to another. In an era where everyone has access to the exact same tools, your taste and creativity are literally the only things they can't automate.",

I've moved to a good 50-75% split of effort with that majority being AI but with tightly bound requirements in terms of target/end result. It works great and I'm very happy with my results.\n\nBut one thing I will say is that AI is also just very good at certain things and occasionally people (even those familiar with AI) ***don't*** recognize the difference between something that required deliberate thought/effort and something that was simply prompt/seed-luck. You do even see this with traditional artists occasionally getting mistakenly labelled as AI and it's a similar phenomenon.\n\nFor instance, I was initially unimpressed with this: https://v.redd.it/bi449b91u1zf1\n\nI assumed it was simply img2vid+prompt+some masking of the original video around the subject. In reality it's a much more complex and deliberate workflow.\n\nMore recently, I've tried to be a little less quick to jump to conclusion. If a piece is good, it's good. If a creator is ***consistent*** then they are good.",

But dictating a specific, cohesive aesthetic across an entire sequence, or tailoring it to a strict brand brief—that’s where the 'lucky prompters' fall off and the actual directors take over. That's the exact reason I'm building out a portfolio of these. Really appreciate the deep dive here.",

Anyone can pop open Cursor or Claude Code and vibe code a quick semi-functional frontend that technically 'works'. But when the rubber meets the road, these apps won't scale, they won't be able to handle anything that wasn't specifically prompted for, and they tend to be security nightmares most of the time. Give the same tools to an experienced engineer, and they can use natural language to steer the models in the right direction. They understand the underlying architecture, they know where bugs or security issues could pose bigger problems later, and they know how to use the tools to work around them and produce a more legit end result. \n\nAll the lifeless slop you're seeing is posted by people who had a passion or desire to make mograph, but never really had the skills to pull it off using traditional software. These tools give them a way to achieve results that far exceed anything they could make themselves in After Effects, so for those people the lifeless slop feels like a big win. You, with your motion graphics background know what to look out for, know how to take what looks like a set of student b-roll graphics and coax more out of them. \n\nI also work in the industry and while you're results did look better than most AI motion graphics I've seen, it's still falling a bit short when you compare it to professional mograph.

And like you said somebody who can mix it all together and make it work. Maybe and eventually will get to the point where you are people are needed but I think in the next five years these tools will be available for anybody with a creative mind to be able to start making their own beautiful creations of full-like TV shows or movies. Kind of like how the music industry is very easy to get into now because kids can mix music themselves and create whatever they want without needing a big studio.

Comics and manga specifically need an understanding of page layouts and panel framing; you can tell when this is done well and when it's done poorly. \n\nBut the bottlenecks in this case are *not* the tools you're using. Krita itself isn't needed here; you could use comfy or forge and then generate images and then arrange them into pages via panels via gimp, for example. \n\nBut the core hurdle with both comics and anime is that most AI models, even today, do not understand things like *spacial dynamics* or *perspective* beyond the standard ones. Why? Because they're all trained on 'good' art which for training purposes is almost always splash pages or covers or figure drawing. I actually find it impressive that you've gotten some unique perspectives here. \n\nBut then, you said you used controlnets and and loras and you're the one who is storyboarding and sketching what you want, so honestly, the models aren't really doing a ton of heavy lifting. At this point you're basically still doing it all yourself! \n\nHowever, the answer I gave you before (I think) still applies here: the question is not whether you could do it, because you could train a model to do the art, it's whether or not you as the creator grasp how panels are placed and how things are cropped. \n\nSo basically, this is more a proof of concept for *you* as a storyboarder and panel setter.",

In case this is a \"oh in Japan they wouldn't do this\", this is a fictional short story loosely based on a Japanese setting.

You are pointing out areas for improvement. However, this comes across as being unnecessary simply because you don't actually know the time or effort I've put into this. Even if the work comes across as amateurish, that's exactly what I am: an amateur. This is not an easy art form to get to grips with. Some people spend decades producing manga and comics and only make their debuts later in life, so without actually know my process, this kind of \"feedback\" comes across more as rude than actually criticism. \n\nBut I also wonder if it's not just a purist thing considering how you pointed out the way the character would act.\n\n\\>go read Nisekoi Chapter 1. it's in my humble opinion one of the best made manga in terms of layout, flow, timing, etc.\n\nThanks.

I am not aware of any developments that would enable something like \"deviate from the norm in an interesting way\" while not having to be very specific about what kinds of deviations you want exactly... \n\n\n\n\\> since greatness usually comes from experimenting and breaking the rules\n\n\n\nSort of.\n\n\n\nSo, just generalizing from a book about photography I read some time ago, one interesting aspect was \"you should either make your photo straight (then it looks like you know what you are doing), or with 10+° twist (then it looks like an intentional 'artistic' deviation), but don't do it only slightly off, because then it looks just accidental and therefore bad\". So, more generally, the idea is probably something like you should first learn the rules, and then break them deliberately and strongly, so you get a sense of the motivation behind them. It also means you should probably not break too many rules at once, particularly not at the beginning, because then it will also just look random and messy... but all of that is more of a \"general art thing\", than something specific to AI. However, AI probably enables you to more quickly iterate over and thereby learn all the various rules, so... that's definitely a good thing.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah, it's certainly interesting to see this result you made here, because (similar to programming), you still have to understand the fundamental principles relatively well (in some ways this is even getting more important), it's just that the execution-part itself becomes significantly less important.",

Can you write an ecchi fantasy adventure manga about a goblin for me? And then generate a hard science fiction novel about first contact with alien microorganisms on a colony ship, so I have something to read in bed.\"\n\nI can understand the appeal on some level, but we're already in an age of fairly disposable, commercialized media. The idea of less and less human intention and effort going into every sentence or panel... it just leaves me pretty cold.\n\nThis isn't wholly unique to gen AI. Lots of tools lower the skill or intent required to produce a work. Photography. Digital art tools. Buying paints rather than crafting them yourself, by hand. But I feel like there comes a point where the input from the creator becomes minimal enough that we risk *everything* becoming slop.",

But... I don't feel this way at all, and I see no reason why I should.\n\nI also find it a bit narrowminded... as in, this idea that \"crafting by hand\" is somehow inherently superior to \"crafting by mind\" seems unnecessarily restrictive with regards to how to use human creativity.\n\nAnd, what is the real motivation by those opposed to AI? Perhaps it is some kind of gatekeeping? As in, \"only artists should be allowed to produce art, because if everyone can do it, then us artists can no longer feel special\"?\n\nIn any case, one of this particularly important I think - we live in a free world, and, for example, people who enjoy porn and those who hold Puritarian beliefs can coexist peacefully. The same is true for AI-generated art, so if you don't like it, that is ok, and there is also nothing wrong about you communicating about your dislike for AI with others - as long as you understand that people like me will not look at people like yourself as someone whose opinions, views, and thoughts are worth taking seriously.",

It's not clear how much the ai workflow is doing though as you haven't shown what the level of the sketches are this time.\n\nI'm wanting to figure out a similar type of workflow though i'm more interested in using it to do half tone shading, speed lines, cross hatch shading, conversion of 3d bg into heavy stylized ink style backgrounds. I don't trust it with the figure drawing as I have more stylistic preferences. \n\n1) first image. the pose in the clock image is too flat, imo. You can stick the clock in the back of the first image.\n\n2) not really, yet. It looks good, but to really take advantage of A.I, I'd expect at least the visual quality of mitsuyoshi kanketsuhen. I like the high contrast look you got though. Just a little more immersion. There is not enough writing to know if its a story to be interested.\n\n",

All girls in images are clothed/in bikini, i just censored them to keep it safe. But i really can't emphasize how horny Anima is by default...\n\n  \nIt's easy to use, and i've included prepared workflow for you to compare both results for yourself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6bue5hulqlg1.png?width=2742&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fbead9bb4da338312d1055b3e16de4a12bce2c4\n\nYou can find it in repo. To use it, you don't need to write a prompt for it every time, generally you just use it as secondary quality tags, and wire negative and base in from main prompts.\n\nBased on official repo, you can tune it to affect different things, but i haven't tried using it like that, so up to you to test it.\n\nThat's it. Have fun. Till next time.\n\n\n\nAlso\n\n  \nShe's just like me frfr\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7r0b9lx8kqlg1.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=f375ad6d8b5bf587f876416d5bd8193af0ba11fd\n\nIf you're here, here are links from the top of post so you don't have to scroll:\n\n  \nOriginal implementation - [https://github.com/quickjkee/modulation-guidance](https://github.com/quickjkee/modulation-guidance)\n\nComfyUI node for Anima - [https://github.com/Anzhc/Anima-Mod-Guidance-ComfyUI-Node](https://github.com/Anzhc/Anima-Mod-Guidance-ComfyUI-Node)\n\nWorkflows also can be found right in node repo.\n\nFor images above i used CLIP L from here - [https://huggingface.co/Anzhc/Noobai11-CLIP-L-and-BigG-Anime-Text-Encoders](https://huggingface.co/Anzhc/Noobai11-CLIP-L-and-BigG-Anime-Text-Encoders)",

If you use a style Lora the difference becomes even smaller, it doesn't seem worth it overall as it just seems to make styles and NL slightly weaker with not much benefit.\n\nGranted I haven't done a lot of testing either but it doesn't seem to have the benefits I would've hoped for.",

A close approximation of `BREAK` with only core nodes would be to use multiple conditional prompts, one for each `BREAK` block, and combine the conds with a cond concat node. The other option is to use a custom cond node that has `BREAK` support.\n\nWhat `BREAK` does is allow you to control where in the prompt the conditioning is wrapped to the next layer. This only applies to models that use CLIP, which has a limit of 77 input tokens (effectively 75 because of start/end tokens). Generally I think the idea was to have complete ideas per CLIP chunk that would become the conditioning.\n\nEmbeddings are/were also a good way to control prompt length, a whole series of tokens can become one set of vectors to save prompt space. There was also magic with embeddings since you can compute those vectors via other means than just combining tokens.\n\nControlling these chunks boundaries and prompt length was more important in SD1 and early SDXL models. By late stage Pony finetunes/merges and modem Illus merges, it has become mostly unnecessary to worry about the 75 token thing. And almosy every model since SDXL (that matters), CLIP stuff is either mostly or entirely a non-factor.",

With some Pony based models I remember getting really weird results sometimes if the positive and negative prompts didn't have the same amount of chunks.\n\nThanks for the recommendation for the regional prompting, that sounds like a useful plugin.

If they're your own OCs, then you'll have to train a LoRA for each one.\n* **Inpainting** – Create an image with two (or more) generic characters and then use inpainting to replace each one in turn.\n* **Cut and paste** – Just generate each character against a simple background, try to make the style and lighting match and then cut them out and edit them together.\n* **Regional prompting** – The *Comfy Couple* node for ComfyUI offers an easy way to split an image in two and provide a separate prompt for each half. Just remember that each side can see the whole image. Use \"duo\" in each prompt rather than \"solo\" and try to make the characters as different as possible. (I'm a heavy user of Illustrious-based models and regional prompting myself.)\n* **Newer models** – SDXL models like Illustrious are good enough in a lot of situations. But handling multiple characters is one area they're quite bad at. Try the fp8 version of *Z-Image-Turbo*. It has similar system requirements and generation speed as SDXL but handles multiple characters without problems. I can name the characters in my prompt, provide a description for each and then position them relative to each other. Z-Image-Turbo is focused on photo realism though. There are some anime fine-tunes and LoRAs but I haven't spent that much time trying them out yet. *Anima* is a new anime model with relatively low system requirements. From my brief experiments it seems to handle multiple characters quite well. You can also try *Flux*, *Chroma*, *Qwen-Image* or *Flux.2 Klein*. Try quantised versions if your computer can't handle the full models.",

The masked regions will have additional prompts that essentially layer over the base prompt for that region.  As for where to put the masks, I would either gen most of the combined whole prompt to find a seed with composition I wanted to use, then used that as the input for making the masks, or do a more img2img inputs to the first stage, possibly with control nets.\n\nIt'll work for one-shot gens without having to go full effort inpainting from the start, but a good inpainting on the output of that is still likely going to provide a more preferable result.",

It runs a watermarked image through a diffusion model and the output looks the same but the watermark is gone. A single pass at low strength fools SynthID. There's also a CtrlRegen mode for higher quality. Strips all AI metadata too.\n\nMostly built this for research and education, wanted to understand how these systems work under the hood.
