          "text": "Small detail(s). If you're aiming for the dated stylistic authenticity, you should avoid using the Papyrus typeface for the title card. I have some pretty negative opinions about that typeface overall, but the big issue here is that it was developed in 1982, and the style of this video is decidedly earlier than that. The color, texture, and set pieces approximate 1960s futurism. The vehicle body styles are obviously not real, but look like the styles you might see around 1974-1976. And I could buy that as a window of time a real film like this could have been created. But, if you were to swap in older 1960s car models, that would be even more in the pocket.\n\nAnyway, a better typeface choice (though it may be a bit on-the-nose) would be [Eurostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile). Other good options might be: [Recta \\(bold\\)](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/recta-font-canada-type), Helvetica, or (if you want some more whimsy) [Craw Modern](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/craw-modern-font-grouptype). These would have been very on-brand for a retro-futuristic film from the 1960s.",

Sure it's wow for like 5 minutes but as you drive around most of the colour has gone because real life has seeped into it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_toA8lErAHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toA8lErAHg)\n\nBut at the same time I've often wondered how Alyx, Eli, Dr Kleiner, Barney and all the rest would look in real life. Klein allows that... or at least a level pretty close to it, and then after that curiosity is satisfied I can jump back into my unmodded copy of Direct3D 9 Half Life 2 from 2004 lol.",

I don't feel as excited. In fact, it made me remember of Ananta, and I'm even more stoked for that game.\n\nToo many games are obsessed with making things feel \"realistic\" that they forgot the \"fantasy\" in these games. Ananta retains that genshin/anime style that is a nice barrier to reality, even with extreme high graphics, there's a ceiling that cannot be broken. These GTA/CP games though, they push graphics to a point that it blurs fantasy and reality, and it seems to diminish the immersiveness away. I want higher definition games as well, but the erosion of stylization for \"more realistic\" has made things worse, imo.",

There is no SLI, no NVLink, no Crossfire support, SD will always run on **one GPU per job**.\n\nSo in practice, they will only be able to use **one 5090 at a time** for each generation. Yes, they *can* choose which card to run on by adding `--cuda-device 1` to their launch arguments, but that still means only **one** card is doing the actual work. And from what I can tell by their server rack, this is probably what they are doing. I just hope they do not plan to host THAT for stuff like AI videos, because those are still quite slow on RTX 5090 series, and this is going to suck if only 12 people can generate at the same time.\n\nAt that point, an RTX 6000 Ada would have been a much better choice. More VRAM per card and much better stability for heavy workloads. But my guess is their setup is probably not for the public but themselves and probably relatives.",

          "text": "Cool build, but let’s drop the fantasy: this is NOT “unified VRAM” and it’s NOT “1.5TB+ VRAM.” It’s 12 GPUs with 32GB each = 384GB total, distributed, and each job still sees 32GB per GPU. Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

Kubernetes doesn’t magically fuse GPUs into one big VRAM pool — it just schedules workloads. For Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, that won’t make a single generation faster, it just gives you more concurrency (more workers, more queues). And you split it into 6 machines × 2 GPUs, which means: more motherboards, duplicated RAM/storage, more failure points, more maintenance, and more wasted money for the same outcome.\nWant something actually smart and efficient? 3× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q (96GB ECC, 300W) gives you 288GB VRAM at 900W total, in a much cleaner, more stable setup with ECC memory. That’s how you run “big” workloads without turning your room into a heater. Your 12×5090 rack is basically an expensive prompt farm: looks great in photos, but it doesn’t give you a single giant GPU, it doesn’t “add VRAM” by magic, and the watts-to-results ratio is a joke.\nIf the goal is learning and showing off, fine. If the goal is efficient infrastructure, this is overcomplicated and power-hungry.",

It's just the language of the format, and it gives creators the most options when editing stuff together. It is the art form, in a way. \n\nIt's also a matter of style; some directors like quick cuts, like Michael Bay and most superhero films, others like long takes with one or several continuous shots. If AI is ever going to be taken seriously as a replacement for traditional filmmaking, it has to break the 10 second per shot limit. I'm sure it will.",

Congratulations!👌\n\nI'm not sure, but I'm guessing you trained a Lora in ZIT to give the character consistency, right?\n\nBe careful with those music apps; they might copyright your songs if you don't pay for commercial use, and even if you do pay, they have some legal loopholes.

          "text": "I know the video isn’t perfect, but my goal was to push the video length as far as I could on my modest hardware. Limiting the video to 40 seconds and pushing higher resolutions, the results are far more impressive. So how does it work? If you’ve ever used the 2x Spatial Upscaler to double your video resolution in a second pass, you’re halfway there. That same upscaler can actually be applied to the empty latent video output in the first pass to greatly reduce computational overhead, but we’re going to talk about something else.  \n  \nIn the same LTX-2 repo as the Spatial Upscaler, I noticed there was a 2x Temporal Upscaler, so I tried swapping it out with the Spatial Upscaler in my 2-step workflow. The result was a video twice the length of my original, but with the sound cutting out halfway through. The process was just as fast as the Spatial Upscaler, so I knew I was onto something. I tried doubling the number of audio frames in the first pass, and holy crap, I got a 40-second video, with sound throughout, and it only took 80 seconds to generate, so I did some research.  \n  \nBy applying a 2x temporal upscale to the empty latent, you’re essentially tricking the AI. Instead of making it imagine every frame from scratch, the model only has to calculate half of the frames, while the upscaler handles the filler frames in between. The AI is doing less work because the mathematical distance between frames is wider. This principle is the same for the Spatial Upscaler, but with the video resolution.  \n  \nIn my workflow, you can see options to chain both upscalers together in either the first or second passes, and I’ve experienced success with many combinations. I’ve even daisy chained multiple instances of the same upscaler together, for stupid fast generations with mostly coherent videos. The only thing that really suffers at extreme video lengths, is the AI-generated audio, since the temporal upscaler only works on the video frames. Anyway, this has been a lot of fun to tinker with, especially since I don’t have to wait ages for results. I can’t wait to see what other users come up with.  \n  \nLink to my workflow: [https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup](https://pastebin.com/e2jPLHup)  \n  \nLink to the LTX-2 Temporal Upscaler: [https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/ltx-2-temporal-upscaler-x2-1.0.safetensors)",

This is because after your input frames are converted into latents, the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\" node doubles the amount of latents. These doubled latents are then fed into the sampler for inference, which is no different from directly increasing the number of latents.\n\nSince the official documentation doesn't explain it, I believe the actual usage is like this: take the result output by the sampler inference, feed it into the \"LTXVLatentUpsampler\", and then perform an action similar to RIFE VFI frame interpolation. Consequently, you will get smoother footage, and naturally, the FPS count will double.",

And none of them involves LTX, I have too little experience with this model.\n\nSince the individual shots are short and there is little lip movement - and on only one character -  I'm pretty sure you could get away with using Wan 2.1 VACE (it's better than 2.2 VACE for what I have in mind). Create a consistent first frame for each shot with an editing model, and then do one pass per character with VACE, where in each pass you mask the character, apply Pose ControlNet to the masked area while using a reference image of that particular character. Sounds like it might work...\n\nEDIT:  \nActually, if you have a good first frame, you might not need separate passes and do it all in one. But again, it's all a bit theoretical, I do have some experience with VACE and think this would work, but I never actually attempted something *exactly* like this.",

The background features muted tones of dusty rose and faded gold with subtle reflections on metal surfaces, enhancing the moody yet ethereal ambiance.

          "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been working on this image-to-video project since LTX-2's release, 10 days and countless hours that I've decided to wrap up here before it completely consumed me. I want to share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the final result.\n\n**The Starting Point:** This project began with a single warrior queen concept image I generated last year (the one where she's sleeping in the video). I built a draft story around her and created storyboards using Nano Banana.\n\n**Full Disclosure:** I'm not a video editor or filmmaker, I saw this as an opportunity to learn while exploring the capabilities and limitations of open-source video models. I started with WAN 2.2, then transitioned to LTX-2 as my primary tool.\n\n**Hardware & Software:**\n\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)\n* **Platform:** ComfyUI with various community workflows\n* **Post-Production:** Basic video editing software for simple transitions and vignette effects in 1-2 places (kept it minimal)\n* **Upscaling:** I had originally planned to test video upscaling myself but honestly lost the appetite by that point. A friend with a Topaz Video AI subscription kindly upscaled the final edit for me (I don't have a subscription myself)\n\n**The Production Process:**\n\n* Generated **250+ video clips** to get what you see here\n* Experimented extensively with community workflows and custom parameter tweaks\n* Used First Frame-Last Frame (FFLF) workflows for some sequences\n* Created custom music using Suno (spent hours getting the tone right)\n* Generated voiceovers, narrations, and audio effects (ultimately decided not to use them)\n* Only used official LTX-2 camera LoRAs\n\n**The Challenges:** Getting consistent, high-quality results was... difficult. To achieve even something \"decent\" without ugly distortions, random shifts, or quality degradation often required 10-20 generation attempts per shot. The LTX-2 audio quality was particularly disappointing, roughly 95% unusable, so I didn't even attempt to incorporate it as sound effects.\n\n\\---Somehow I can't post the rest of my review, so adding as a reply to this message---",

              "text": "**Technical Notes:**\n\n* Only 2 **clips uses WAN 2.2** (the dragon extending its wings and roaring, woman looking through spear)\n* Everything else is LTX-2\n* Only official camera LoRAs used\n* Minimal post-processing (just basic transitions/vignettes)\n* Final upscale via Topaz Video AI\n\n**Why I'm Stopping Here:** The breaking point came when I reached the dragon vs warrior queen fighting scenes. I immediately realized this technology just isn't ready for action sequences, the complex movements, rapid interactions, and dynamic camera work that action demands consistently produced unusable results. Maybe I'm giving up too quickly, but the time investment versus output quality ratio became unsustainable.\n\n**What I Learned:**\n\n* Even with high-end hardware, these models require significant patience and iteration\n* Prompt engineering for video is vastly different from images\n* FFLF workflows can help with character consistency but introduce their own challenges\n* Action scenes are currently beyond reliable generation\n* Audio generation needs major improvements\n* Quality consistency remains the biggest hurdle for production work\n* ComfyUI workflows from the community are powerful but require deep experimentation\n\nI'm sharing this project as both a creative piece and a realistic look at what working with these early-stage tools actually involves. I hope it helps others set realistic expectations and maybe avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered.\n\nCheers!",

I've produced a few 1-2 full scene videos with layered dialogue, sound effects, etc. It takes a TON of time and energy so I appreciate your effort, and you have a good directorial eye for what it's worth. I like the closeup on her eyes as the dragon was approaching.\n2. For the LTX clips, were you using the distilled or dev model?\n3. What are your overall thoughts on LTX vs WAN at this point? I've had similar success ratios to what you mentioned: For every \\~12 LTX gens I get one good one, and for every \\~4 WAN gens I get a good one (where \"good\" = consistent, high-quality, and follows the prompt). The speed of LTX is completely negated by the lack of prompt adherence, and the audio element is essentially a gimmick at this point. I've completely returned to WAN already.",

Exactly like you described. I bounced between them back and forth. For LTX I don't know how to disable audio generation to save up on generation time, I didn't needed it and I wish there is a way to \"don't generate audio and speed up my generation\" option.\n\nWith WAN 2.2 14B my biggest problem was random slow-motion generations and generation time was slower for me even with 4step acceleration loras.\n\nIf I would start this type of project again  I deifnetly go over WAN and force myself to learn as much as I can",

As is also visible in some of your shots things tend to break and everything is always moving when it shouldn't be moving. As for the slowmotion effect in WAN, yes that can be anoying.

I was using a couple hundred images but without captions (well, a default caption), and I definitely made an improvement by just going down to 50 but captioning them with ChatGPT. Though learned some things like I had some lower res images that I upscaled, but that wound up training in artifacts etc, so don't do that. My recent training I tried bumping the rank up to 256 and training for 100 steps per image, but seems to have converged at around 2k steps and not much visual improvement afterwards.\n\nIt sounds like I might be able to do better by going back to using more images but caption them all, and caption them with longer captions, plus train at the right resolutions. I know data set quality is paramount to getting good results, but how to specifically combine it all is proving tricky to get past my current plateau.\n\nContent-wise for realism... when you are curating a data set, is it made up of subsets for specific aspects you're trying to train? Like lighting, or image artifacts present in certain cameras, skin details etc?\n\n\nEdit: holy smokes the latest iteration with 50 captioned images attempting to teach 4 different variations in the dataset trained at rank 256 for 4000 steps on Z-image De-Destilled actually produced some pretty stunning results. The high rank definitely led it to start memorising some of the training data, but also the skin details show up so much better. Excited to see how much further I can improve it with a larger dataset and better training techniques.",

Z-Image has its strength and use cases, but I prefer Klein at the moment for its prompt adherence. Its understanding is on another level. For example, just playing around, I took a selfie in my bathroom mirror and then used Klein to remove myself. The result looked perfect. I then used that as a reference image for the environment. I can now use another reference image of anyone I want and place them there.\n\nHere’s the most interesting part. In the prompt, I can tell it that the image should be through my own eyes and that I’m the person in the reference image. From that point, I can describe myself in first person language and its understands perfectly. I can say “my hair is blonde”, “I am leaning forward with hands on the countertop”, “I’m wearing a blue t-shirt”, etc. the interactions between the reference images is great too. \n\nAnyway, for prompts and generations like that, Klein is currently my favorite. Skin textures and tones are also much more realistic. Maybe it’s due to using reference images, but I haven’t noticed a plastic look at all. Once people start learning all of the unique things it can do, I have a feeling it will become much more popular.",

That is a relatively high ratio (33%), so it appears that the model really does struggle with this prompt ([https://imgur.com/a/x1kI4Mt](https://imgur.com/a/x1kI4Mt))\n\nHowever, when I ran the same prompt in Z-Image, the result was even worse, and I got 5 messed up generations ([http://imgur.com/a/RVyBr6Z](http://imgur.com/a/RVyBr6Z)).\n\nSo, overall, this confirms that Flux 2 Klein is better (or, at very least, less bad...) at anatomy than Z-Image.\n\nEDIT Note:\n\nOriginally, I accused OP of cherrypicking the seed - it appears that this is not true, based on these tests - more likely, OP was simply lucky about his Z-Image seed, and unlucky about his Flux seed. Here is the original comment for reference:\n\n    I think this can be safely ignored - OP likely just tried many different seeds until they arrived at this image, perhaps for shock factor or some other such nonsense... Because: If such a massive error was truly representative of the model, it would have never managed to do the much more difficult case of image 14 correctly.\n    Also, consider that Z-Image did not just get one hand wrong in image 14, but 3 simultaneously... this implies that the model more generally struggles with hands.",

For example, the origami paper looks nicer for Z-Image, but then I did a Bing Image search, and as it turns out, the relatively weak paper texture generated by Flux is actually closer to what real origami paper looks like... Or, for the \"16-bit\" picture: There is actually a significant difference between 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit colors, if you take the corresponding color modes on earlier computers as what those terms are even supposed to mean. And, Flux looks like it is around \\~12-bit-ish I would say, whereas Z-Image is closer to maybe 6-bits... Then again, this is such a small detail that it might as well be coincidence.\n\n\\> Z image will render whatever you want when it's trained. In terms of NSFW.\n\nShouldn't this also be the case for Flux 2 Klein?\n\nI guess we will find out soon enough... while it's not impossible that BFL somehow \"poisoned\" the model to make the learning of genitals more difficult (or at least I read such rumors, I didn't look into it), I am not sure how much that will really change.",

The lighting is harsh and directional, coming from a single source outside the frame. The contrast is extreme (chiaroscuro), with bright highlights on the subject's skin and deep, pitch-black shadows that obscure the rest of the scene.    The image has the texture of an oil painting created alla prima. The background and shadows are thin and translucent, revealing a subtle canvas grain and a dark warm undertone. The highlights on her face are rendered with thick, creamy impasto brushstrokes that follow the curvature of the form. The paint appears wet and oily, with visible bristle marks in the brightest areas.  On the far left, an ancient, sunken city is overgrown with vibrant, alien coral reefs and spiraling kelp towers in shades of seafoam green and soft pink. The center is a negative space of pale, aquatic mist and floating scintillating bioluminescent spores. Occupying this space floats a sinuous mythological sea serpent-dragon, entirely aquatic. Its body is a graceful ribbon that is curled into a simple spiral. It is covered in shimmering opalescent scales that shift in color like polished abalone shell, reflecting milky whites, pale pastel pinks, soft lavenders, and mint greens depending on the light. Instead of wings, its form is adorned with elaborate, flowing fins and trailing, leaf-like appendages made of pearly membrane  that ripple in the water like silk ribbons. A graceful crest runs along its back, and its noble, stylized head is adorned with soft, decorative tendrils. To the right, the blue eyed face of a colossal, graceful Siren floats weightlessly, consuming the entire right and middle portion of the image; her waist is partially adorned with pink and silver transluscent silk that flows like water.  She wears a pleading look of desperation.  her skin texture is highly realistic with visible pores, slight flushing, and natural variegation. The complexion is luminous but imperfect. her form is sparsely covered with interlocking floral shapes and soft multi-colored petals. her nose is large and prominent and straight with a natural, slightly rounded bridge.   Her breasts are only covered by a few flowers.  One arm is extended out toward the center, hand gracefully extended and cupped under the snout of the sea dragon.  Her outstretched palm is glowing with yellow energy. Her other arm is extended gracefully back behind her.  Her hair flows into the water as long flowing ribbons of liquid gold. The siren and dragon are staring into each other's eyes.",

      "text": "**The Problem:** If you are using Flux 2 Klein (especially for restoring/upscaling old photos), you've probably noticed that as soon as you describe the subject (e.g., \"beautiful woman,\" \"soft skin\") or even the atmosphere (\"golden hour,\" \"studio lighting\"), the model completely rewrites the person's face. It hallucinates a new identity based on the vibe.\n\n**The Fix:** I found that **Direct, Technical, Post-Processing Prompts** work best. You need to tell the model *what action to take on the file*, not what to imagine in the scene. Treat the prompt like a Photoshop command list.\n\nIf you stick to these \"File-Level\" prompts, the model acts like a filter rather than a generator, keeping the original facial features intact while fixing the quality.\n\n**The \"Safe\" Prompt List:**\n\n**1. The Basics (Best for general cleanup)**\n\n* `remove blur and noise`\n* `fix exposure and color profile`\n* `clean digital file`\n* `source quality`\n\n**2. The \"Darkroom\" Verbs (Best for realism/sharpness)**\n\n* `histogram equalization` (Works way better than \"fix lighting\")\n* `unsharp mask`\n* `micro-contrast` (Better than \"sharp\" because it doesn't add fake wrinkles/lashes)\n* `shadow recovery`\n* `gamma correction`\n\n**3. The \"Lab\" Calibration (Best for color)**\n\n* `white balance correction`\n* `color graded`\n* `chromatic aberration removal`\n* `sRGB standard`\n* `reference monitor calibration`\n\n**4. The \"Lens\" Fixes**\n\n* `lens distortion correction`\n* `anti-aliasing`\n* `reduce jpeg artifacts`\n\n**My \"Master\" Combo for Restoration:**\n\n>`clean digital file, remove blur and noise, histogram equalization, unsharp mask, color grade, white balance correction, micro-contrast, lens distortion correction.`\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop asking Flux.2 Klein to imagine \"soft lighting.\" Ask it for \"gamma correction\" instead. The face stays the same, the quality goes up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxv1zb19igeg1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aeba649a3a14636eefab47518e4b843217ec59c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q99s8c19igeg1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c8764e94c1b2c3006174f6d72ac1593866be1c2",

I've found that Klein is good at following directions even when being told what NOT to do/include (Like Negative prompting, but without needing to put it in a negative prompt node). That said, I've personally created two prompt/text boxes and strung them together. In the second text string I've just been putting instructions telling it what I DON'T want it to do, and the first string, what I want it to do. Been working for me so far!",

Basically anything that is mentioned will be changed, and sometimes related concepts too.  \n\nThe other thing for me is to pre-process images so that each side is divisible by 16 and to not use the \"ImageScaleToTotalPixels\" node to further change the size. I find the model works fine at both very low resolutions (like early-internet meme pictures) and up to about 2k pixels on the long side without rescaling. Ensuring your input is the right size up front greatly reduces the amount of shifting / squashing / stretching.  \n\nHere's a [simple example using Grumpy Cat](https://imgsli.com/NDQzOTY4). Same resolution as the original, light cherrypicking (ran 4, picked the best), mostly picked based on which image got the eye color more correct based on other images.  \n\nThis model will definitely swing for the fences if you let it in terms of the changes it makes, but in doing so it can look shockingly good and clear a lot of the time, even at low resolutions.  The \"restoration\" prompt was just this:  \n\n> Denoise and recolor the image with natural and realistic colors. Keep the subject’s pose and framing unchanged.  \n\nI've tried a few other prompts, but the seed-to-seed variance is so high that it was hard to tell if any changes were actually making things better, so I left it. The distilled model is fast enough that I can just run 4 seeds and then pick the best.  \n\nThis prompt will definitely go overboard with how many different colors it uses sometimes, but it's mostly fine. And if there is something that I really want to keep a certain color, it often works to just add a sentence like \"The [object] is [color].\"",

I don't know if this is something you can do in comfy but you can get something that's slightly more faithful to the original if you take the luma from the original picture and the chroma from the generated picture, here's that applied to your pictures:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdw3ep2c9ieg1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee002eb72433f05086aa8783d0fd5cc710b8193\n\n  \ne.g. the incorrectly added teeth are much less visible that way, although of course it necessarily also keeps the creases, which might or might not be desirable.",

Faithfully preserve 100% of the original photograph's composition, subject details, and historical authenticity. The (subject) must remain completely unchanged in its (model, stance, and existing condition), including any period-correct damage, rust, or missing parts.\n\nTechnique: Meticulously research and apply historically accurate color palettes. Use AI-powered algorithms to intelligently reconstruct and upscale only the degraded image data, carefully filling in microscopic textural details for the car's paint, chrome, glass, and interior materials based on the surrounding context. Correct lens blur and motion blur computationally without inventing new features.\n\nQuality Target: The final output must resemble a pristine, high-resolution scan of the original, untouched negative. Achieve unparalleled chromatic richness, dynamic range, and tonal depth. Render with the crisp, intricate detail of a modern Phase One IQ4 150MP medium format digital capture. No anachronisms.\n\nStyle: Hyper-realistic, documentary, archival quality. Neutral, realistic color grading with zero oversaturation.",
