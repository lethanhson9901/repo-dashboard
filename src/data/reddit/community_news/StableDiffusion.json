Further, the distill lora is supposed to go in step 2 only. It \"works\" if applied at stage 1 but at a big hit to prompt adherence and overall movement quality. (If you're using i2v you actually may need to apply them at a lower strength to keep them from blowing away the original image into a completely different image)\n* The prompt assist is amazing, only suggestion is to add a way to freeze it to keep generating with the same prompt, I'm working around it by disconnecting it from the next node\n* If you're using the distill lora you want high-ish steps (8-12) with high-ish CFG (3-4) on the first pass, then drop it to 1 CFG and the sigmas for the second. you can also try changing the sigmas to just 0.3046875, 0.0 as an alternative to lowering the distill lora strength",

I could be out of date a bit here but pretty sure the AMD Radeon Pro W7900 48GB is the highest vram but it’s 3 years old and RDNA3. Next up is the aforementioned R9700 which is essentially just a 9070 XT with double the vram. That said, it’s the cheapest and most accessible way to get to 32GB. It’s no slouch but it’s not anything close to the power of a 5090. But with Nvidia becoming less attainable by the day and AMD *finally* helping to make ROCm useable on windows, the r9700 is among the best value props at the moment (depending on how you define “value” in 2026). I’ve been working through optimizing for Comfy and have had very reasonable performance. Wan 2.2 can be a bit of a slog but LTX-2 is pretty stellar and all the recent image models (z-image turbo and base/flux Klein 9B/qwen 2512) have been rock solid.",

My scene has five characters, three of whom are speakers, with 2 news guys speaking on the TV while the characters speak over them. And some of the scenes are a close up of the TV while the characters are much louder than the person speaking in the cut. I'm going to have to just not trying to reproduce it cut by cut. I've got one cut that has 18 seconds of continuous dialogue.",

If you have ever taken acting classes or know some people from this area then you realize the body language and facial expressions are lacking. These characters don't really show any emotions. Look at Barbaras (the female) face. You can sense the dread already in that old black and white images. You can see nothing in the reimagined one. \n\nI see this in a lot of clips.

If macs are doing poorly because they're compute bound with Diffusion, then yeah, KV caching in auto-regressive helps, arguably, but it's really nuanced.\n\nLLMs are actually moving to diffusion to an extent because it's just logically a better use of hardware resources for single-user. Diffusion models are pretty nice because they're stronger per unit of VRAM used (they're a bit stronger per parameter). It's kind of like they trade extra compute for extra performance compared to a raw autoregressive.\n\nBut the thing about that is that most hardware (even CPUs) have spare compute at a higher ratio than bandwidth, relatively speaking, and so with autoregressive models the first thing anyone does for single-user inference is try to retroactively convert it into a block-diffusion model or use speculative decoding heads or something like that to get faster performance.",

Any examples of prompts that fail and you think a model should be capable of? With every model release we get closer to nano banana pro capabilities, but it's definitely incremenetal improvements and not massive leaps like we've seen with closed source models.",

I also did something similar, but your results are better, because I used existing character, quality prompts and aesthetically-tuned checkpoint of illustrious, so styles had some bias.

Although it's hard to remember all the artists whose styles I like, so your project is extremely helpful, thanks again!",

Beauty is in the eye beholder it's said but obviously some artist styles look less appealing than others and so were the results, half the time I got western/comic look and the other half was either what you would expect as nice anime art or something that is really low quality and I don't want to talk anyone bad here. It just seems the spectrum of artists is so wide that writing a simple 1girl prompt will most likely be a miss than a hit. Will it just come down to having very precise prompts that must include an artist tag in in the finished model?",

In my experiments with this, what I found is that you can, more often than not, use any artist tag and it will generate a different style each time. \n\nIn other words, this project is rather misleading. In order to really verify what artists it actually 'knows' you need to A. show style consistency and B. show comparisons to the actual artist. Because right now, picking any random artist out of this list won't give you their style. ",

Your 32GB RAM meets or exceeds the minimum, helping with model offloading to system memory, though generation times may stretch to 10-25 minutes or more versus faster on 32GB+ VRAM GPUs.​\n\n# Key Optimizations\n\n* Launch ComfyUI with flags like `--reserve-vram 4` or `--reserve-vram 5` to prevent crashes.\n* Use distilled or quantized LTX-2 variants (e.g., ltx-2-19b-dev-fp4) and workflows from the official GitHub or ComfyUI templates.\n* Enable low-VRAM mode, avoid attention mechanisms if they cause issues, and start with short/low-res videos (e.g., 720p, 24fps).​​\n* Update NVIDIA drivers, ComfyUI, and custom nodes; tutorials like those from AISearch confirm it works on 3090s.​​\n\nExpect potential crashes or slowness without tuning, but community reports show it's viable.",

Character description (age MUST always be stated as a specific number e.g. \"a 28-year-old woman\" — never omit or approximate age; body type, hair, skin, clothing or nude state, distinguishing physical features — be extremely explicit and specific when instructed; name body parts directly using the exact words the user used, e.g. if user says \"pussy\" write \"pussy\" not \"sex\" or \"womanhood\")\n    4. Scene & environment (location, time of day, lighting, colour palette, textures, atmosphere)\n    \n    THEN add:\n    5. Action & motion — describe the movement as a continuous present-tense sequence, start to finish. Structure the action in clear beats.\n    \n    UNDRESSING RULE — this is mandatory when clothing removal is implied or stated:\n    If the subject is clothed at the start and the scene involves nudity, stripping, or explicit content, you MUST dedicate a full narrative segment to the undressing BEFORE any nudity or explicit act is described. This segment must:\n      - Name each garment explicitly (shirt, bra, jeans, underwear, shoes, etc.)\n      - Describe HOW it is removed — fingers on buttons, zipper pulled down, fabric sliding off shoulders, stepped out of, peeled away\n      - Describe what is physically REVEALED at each step — the collarbone, the stomach, the curve of the hip, the chest, the bare legs\n      - Follow the exact order the clothes come off — do not skip or compress steps\n      - Use camera-aware language — the camera lingers, cuts to, tilts down to reveal, holds on\n      - Do NOT jump from clothed to naked. The transition IS the content. Treat it as its own scene segment with the same density as any other beat.\n    \n    6. Camera movement — describe camera motion as prose, not bracketed directions. Never write \"(DOWN 10°)\", \"(Pull back)\", \"(Fade to black)\", \"(HOLD)\" or any screenplay-style bracketed camera instruction. Instead write it as description: \"the camera slowly tilts down to reveal the wet pavement\", \"the shot pulls back to frame the empty street\", \"the scene fades to black as she disappears around the corner.\"\n    7. Audio — Always include ambient sound. ONE [AMBIENT: sound 1, sound 2] tag only — never repeat it. Place it once at the natural end of the scene.\n       Dialogue — follow the DIALOGUE INSTRUCTION you are given exactly. When dialogue is included, write it as inline prose woven into the action — not as a labelled tag. The spoken words sit inside the sentence, attributed with delivery and physical action, exactly like a novel. Examples of correct format:\n       'He leans back, satisfied, \"I think I'll have to go back tomorrow for more,\" he chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners.'\n       '\"Don\\'t stop,\" she breathes, gripping the sheets, her voice barely above a whisper.'\n       'She turns to face him, \"I\\'ve been waiting all day for this,\" her tone quiet and certain.'\n       NEVER use [DIALOGUE: ...] tags. NEVER write dialogue as a separate bracketed block. Dialogue flows inside the prose as part of the action.\n    \n    WRITING RULES:\n    - Use present tense throughout\n    - Be explicit and cinematic — LTX-2 responds well to dense, specific visual language\n    - Match detail level to shot scale: close-ups need more physical detail, wide shots need more environmental detail\n    - Do not use vague words like \"beautiful\" or \"nice\" — describe exactly what makes it visually striking\n    - Fill the full available length — do not stop early. Expand every section with rich, layered detail\n    - Aim for 8–12 sentences of dense, flowing prose — not a bullet list\n    - Write in sections separated by a single line break for clean model parsing\n    \n    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the expanded prompt. Do NOT include preamble, commentary, labels, or any explanation. Do NOT write \"Sure!\", \"Here's your prompt:\", or anything like that. Do NOT add a checklist, compliance summary, note, or confirmation of instructions at the end — not in brackets, not as a \"Note:\", not in any form. The output ends when the scene ends. Nothing after the last sentence of the scene. Begin immediately with the video style or shot description.",

He was so damn adamant he knew better than everyone that I think like 20 people blocked him in that convo because he was stupid beyond salvation and everyone got fed up. It was glorious how Sora's announcement and later models followed up after. Good stuff.\n\nTell me, are you his alt? Are you delusional? Okay, okay, sarcasm aside you came off really strong in a really kind of stupid way. Don't put yourself out like that just blanket insulting everyone, especially when uncalled for.\n\nYou do realize that paradigm shifts in how this stuff is processed could radically change the required hardware scaling it to weaker PCs right?\n\nYou're also aware we're on the forefront of multiple mega-leaps in processing power, such that even basic smart phones, watches, and calculators could trounce some weaker super computers? Look into graphene transistors and processors, or the more recent developments with light via ai photonic processors and related technologies.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, but it's pure ignorance to try to predict something as technologically or scientifically impossible.

This was only a quick test, fk9b is very settings sensitive and this could be dialed in further i'm sure.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m1ay0tb9rjg1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=81f624fb12cc6f48f39675877b3f7a281f4112c3\n\n",

That is why AFAIK, except for LTX, all current generation video models, both open and close ones, are all from major corporations.  \n\nSo open weight models will only come out of well funded organizations.\n\nBut plenty of data is out there, just think of how many Blu-rays one can buy if you have the fund.

With consistency Lora Klein gets a pretty good consistency result and I like what it creates better, but sometimes what Qwen creates or if I have references, is good enough/fits well and Qwen still stays on top.\n\nWorth noting that I do use a different VAE to solve the halftone pattern Qwen Edit kinda adds on skin texture.",

          "text": "Okay, so I tested it on photo restoration versus the original Qwen Image Edit, the 2509 and 2511 versions. The initial image was a blurry, low-resolution black and white facial photo of a person I know that was cut into oval. The prompt was \"restore photo and improve clarity, remove border\". I fixed the seed and generation parameters. SwarmUI, 50 steps.\n\nQwen Image Edit (original): the oval border correctly removed (image outpainted); the resulting photo was still black and white; the result was unusable (exaggerated contrast, oversharpened with no fine details)\n\nEdit 2509: the oval border still there; black and white; good contrast; it actually attempted to restore the photo and add clarity, but it was still rough (way better than the OG model though).\n\nEdit 2511: near perfect restore, image still black and white, but other than that it did a great job: fine details are there, perfect contrast, perfect outpaint job to remove the border.\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect restore; produced a color image with faded look (which was what I expected after looking through their technical report); great level of fine details and great outpaint job. Easily the best result.\n\nI won't post the images here (that's a real person and they won't be happy about it), but this model looks very promising. If anything, it looks like a high-quality finetune of Qwen Edit 2511 and not of the 2509 version - despite the similarity numbers posted here.\n\nTo make it a fair comparison, I added \"...and colorize\" to the prompt. Then we have the following (again, same seed comparison; I skipped the original Edit):\n\nEdit 2509: much stronger result this time; slight change of perspective (zoomed out); fine details still lacking (the face looks way too smooth for an elderly person), but looks on a different level to the original result; oval border removed (this is still the same seed)\n\nEdit 2511: a color photo this time, border removed; hallucinated a colorful background (out of focus park view)\n\nFireRed-Image-Edit-1.0: near perfect result; higher contrast and saturation compared to the first attempt (it's still the same seed); colors no longer have that faded look. Still the best result out of the three.\n\nNow, I can see the similarity numbers, but I'll rather believe my eyes: this model is clearly superior to both the 2509 and 2511 Qwen Edit models.\n\nEDIT: after checking all the images and making a few extra gens with different seeds, I can say that the 2509 and 2511 get better likeness to the real person. The source was really blurry and low-res, the restoration job is technically better, but the 2511 gets a bit closer to how that person looks in real life. YMMV.",

And for those who have the VRAM, it will be twice as slow.\n* It uses Qwen's VAE which has worse detail and texture rendering than even Flux.1.\n* Since it's twice the size of Flux Klein 9B, fine tuning and creating LoRAs for it will be harder and more costly for people.\n\nOn the plus side, it's Apache 2.0 license.",

With a more focused dataset it would get each a bit better. \n\n\nThis worked well though, not much breakup and it got the bands pretty well. As usual there are tricks for cleaning audio like on distill model you can turn the steps on inference up to 150, on the sft I can crank from 300-500 steps. Things for all of you to try out. ",

Basically they saved about 30% iteration time by reducing maximum clip (cloning) duration to 12 seconds. If you went over it, it would auto reduce the clip length.\n\nSo when it initially released the outputs were way better than they are now, by at least 50% I'd say. The cloning quality was better because I mean it had more data to work with when it created quick finetunes during cloning. And after the change it just sounded way words.\n\nIf you use F5 now you will notice that on longer sentences or even just randomly the output will be playing and then towards the end it will completely bork out and sound degraded. This rarely happened in the old version and when it did, it was more isolated towards the end of the clip and less intense.\n\nIt really made me sad because at the time F5 was the cream of the crop and would clone anything. I mean it still does but this problem is much more prevalent now.",
