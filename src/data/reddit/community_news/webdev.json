People still pay the subscriptions for those other services, which is why they continue to go up frequently (because they get away with it) while very little changes in them - the UI largely stays the same, the content on them is the same (and in some cases the quantity lessened due to other streaming services getting rights), they’re just as buggy, etc., and always claim “innovation” as their reason for the price increase.\n\n1Password can’t be compared to some of that as it’s not a streaming platform, but they address their bugs (usually in a reasonably timely fashion), and have to constantly stay on top of cyber threats to prevent unauthorized access to credentials housed in their product - which, I’m sure becomes increasingly difficult given some of the tools available today, and trying to weave in some other new things to help users.\n\nSo, to me, if any of the services legitimately justify a price increase (let alone one so little - especially in comparison to what streaming platforms usually increment by) it’s a password manager.\n\nNot going to get into a political debate for the rest.",

I miss the notes that you can add to entries and other fields you can add in 1Password. \n\nAlso it didn’t work great on windows before and you need to install the complete iCloud software for it to work. When you do that it uses windows hello to fill in a password which can be very unsafe imo.\n\nNext it doesn’t have an application for Linux. So if you ever want to move from windows to Linux you will be missing out on the password manager.\n\nAnother downside as a European is that my data now is with an American company which has me worried about privacy. I think 1Password is Canadian which tracks a lot better imo\n\nBright side is that my not so techy wife uses it because it’s pre-installed. Sharing passwords is easy with another user. And of course it’s free.",

Made a simple app for uploading and displaying charts and data with filters and such. \n\nIt worked, sort of. I went back and inspected the code it had written and dear god it looked like something I had written when I first started coding:\n\nThe view functions were massive, like 800+ lines of code for a single function, and while many shared the same logic, it had duplicated it instead of refactoring it out into helper functions. All the js and css was scattered throughout the html, and again duplicate logic with functions sometimes doing the same thing but named slightly differently.\n\nI think I spent more time trying to debug and refactor it into something that was halfway decent and maintainable than if I would have built it from scratch. \n\nThese people live in a bubble, and can’t see the forest through the trees. Anyone can build an app, but building is only part of the process. I will admit that it has boosted my productivity, but maybe 10%? 15% max, not even close to the claims I’ve seen made.\n\nI fear that we are going to see more and more apps like the one described above built by people who have no idea how they work.

Went to look what the agent suggested - sure, the code was fixed in backend, but the frontend app would be broken in some cases because of the arbitrary choices Claude made and he didn't fact-check. I spent literally 10 minutes to make a fix that can solve the test and show all the data in frontend.

In the last year alone, the platform I developed generated over $15k in revenue for him. It’s stable, fast, and it clearly converts.\n\nAnnual renewal for hosting and maintenance (just a few hundred bucks) came up, and he asked for a quote for a full rebranding. His exact words were:\n\"I only need to change texts. If you charge me too much, I’m going back to Wix.\". Clearly it is not only a text change but a complete renewal keeping only the same colors ignoring the UX adjustments, SEO migration, and the actual value of a rebranding.\n\nHonestly, the stress has accumulated to the point where I just want to let him go. If he thinks Wix is so great, let him deal with it. But here’s my dilemma: I don't want to just \"hand over\" all the custom logic and hard work I put into this platform for pennies, especially after this level of disrespect.\n\nWhat should I do? Just hand over the keys and walk away for my own mental health? Do I \"strip\" the custom proprietary logic before he migrates (since he only paid for the service, not the full IP of my custom code)? How do I protect my work without being \"the bad guy,\" while making sure he realizes that moving to Wix means losing everything I built for him?\n\nI’m tired.\n\nEDIT: There is no written contract, only an invoice for \"site development\"\n\nEDIT2: I clarified that my work generated revenue to point out that the funds to pay me are definitely there, my intention wasn't to reproach him or ask for more money",

Unless you are a true employee, by default programming code copywrite belongs to whomever wrote it.\n\nThe client possibly has a claim to the 'visual' portion of the website but not the underlying code.  Which would allow the client to rewrite the website in WIX.\n\nThat is why it is so critical that if you ever contract out to someone to write code for you that your contract includes a transfer of copywrite.\n\nA non-coding example.  A company hires me to film and edit a 30 second commercial.  They only thing they own is the final version of the commercial... they can't come back later and ask for all the unedited footage that was used to assemble the final product.\n\nWork for hire info\n\n[https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf)\n\n\n\n",

It gets a bit less clear when dealing with source code that may not be part of the final \"deliverable\" (website, etc); in theory, the client doesn't automatically have any right to that, but in practice it very well may be implied as part of the final product they paid for, such as any backend CMS type stuff.\n\nOne thing you want to be very careful with is when you are acting as a host for their site and deciding to withhold access to it during a dispute.  This is more frequently a concern for an MSP or someone else that has \"keys to the kingdom\" type admin access to actual business data (admin logins, DNS, etc) needed to function, but it's not often hard for a website with potential privileged information or revenue generation (like client contact info, user logins, e-store, etc) to get lumped into that.\n\nThat doesn't mean you are obligated to host their site, but you can't really deny them access to it while also taking it offline without a really strong contract or legal advice in place.  \n\nIn your case, I would suggest handing over whatever the original deliverable was (website you developed), including the most recent copy of whatever data is currently live.  Basically, provide them with the data they need to set the site up on their own hosting service.  Feel free to offer to help migrate it at your normal hourly rate if you'd like.\n\nDefinitely don't act like a jilted ex trying to claim ownership over some random shit (site source code) simply because you're upset.",

Saved me from bloating projects countless times.\n- **transform.tools** — Converts between JSON, TypeScript, SQL, GraphQL, and about 20 other formats. Paste JSON, get TypeScript interfaces instantly. \n- **caniuse.com** — Most people know this one but still underuse it. Before reaching for a polyfill, check if you actually need one.\n- **regex101.com** — Interactive regex tester with explanation of every token. Way faster than trial-and-error in your editor.\n- **httpstat.us** — Returns any HTTP status code you want. Dead simple for testing error handling in your frontend without mocking.\n- **jsoncrack.com** — Visualises JSON as an interactive graph. Brilliant for understanding deeply nested API responses.\n- **metatags.io** — Preview how your site looks in Google, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. before you deploy. Catches broken og:image tags fast.",

Spinning up a dummy Node server from scratch every time was just a massive time sink.\n\nSo I took a weekend to scratch my own itch and built a simple mock API generator called [MockBird](https://mockbird.co).\n\nYou just drop in the custom JSON payload you want, hit generate, and it immediately gives you a live URL to fetch from. I made sure the UI is completely dark and distraction-free so you can just get your endpoint and get back to the actual coding.\n\nThe only catch: I'm bootstrapping it on Render's free tier right now. If the server has been asleep, the very first request takes about 30-40 seconds to wake up. But once it's awake, it's lightning-fast and completely free to use.

We tried scaling VPS's but there is no clear pattern to when the platform might pick up and the scaling takes too long to react. Using a worker to handle the uploaded audio transmission blocks practically gets rid of the irregular scaling issues we had at the start. \n\nOnce the upload is received, the worker records it in the database and sends it to a Kafka stream which is how it is stored instead of traditional file storage. \n\nThe downside to workers is they are targets for abuse. You have to implement bot protection and build in authentication for each request. We use WAF to block repeated requests that fail auth (and also all countries that are not North America since our platform is specific to this region) alongside rate limiting requests as an added measure to prevent flooding. When your paying for every request a flood event that goes unchecked can cost you a ton of money. \n\n",

If a bot can find those, it will lose its mind and your site will get hammered and also your SEO goes in the toilet because Google can't finish exploring the site. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, if your site can be generated as a static site then you're also safe from this issue, for the same reason. The number of total URLs is reasonable. And of course it is also served very fast. \n\nIt's a pity because a potentially useful feature has to be taken away. But I'm finding my customers don't object strenuously when I remove it because they are more concerned about the bots. \n\nOther workarounds are possible, of course, like hiding the multi-filter links behind JavaScript, depending on whether the bots are simple or going to the trouble to actually jockey a web browser.",

That part is genuinely broken and OpenAI should fix it. But everyone in here celebrating blocking GPTBot entirely is making a bet that AI search won't matter. That bet is going to look terrible in 18 months.\n\nThe real solution is rate limiting, not blocking. Set up a robots.txt crawl-delay, put a CDN in front with bot rate limits, and cache aggressively. If Vercel can't handle that natively, that's a Vercel problem, not an AI problem.\n\nAlso worth noting: if your open-source docs show up in ChatGPT answers, that's free distribution to millions of developers. The ROI on that traffic is probably higher than organic Google at this point.",

Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company. I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.\n\nMoreover, with the recent updates from Claude i wonder if developers or going to last. Please note, i’m not naive. I have seen what the new models from Claude can do. It’s scary. So before putting in statements like “engineering is not only coding”, “we’ll get do roles like product or architecture”, “competent developers would always be required” please dont. The current state of these models is already mind blowing, imagine what they’ll achieve in the next 2-3 years. If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nI did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. But now i think all that was a waste, should have just prepared for govt exams like my dad used to insist me for. At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nThis all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists? \n\nI feel betrayed and cheated, i wish these ai companies and ai preachers rot in hell",

Anyone who is just going to bury their head in the sand and pretend it doesn't have to affect them if they don't want it to is just going to get left behind.\n\nIt might not actually affect you, personally, right now, but when you retire they're not going to hire someone to replace you. They're going to use the AI bot you've been using (and teaching) to do that job now. Your children, if you have any, will not have the same opportunities as you no matter what you do or how well you set them up to succeed.\n\n\nEDIT: I just had an interesting thought occur to me. What if you would spend your entire career using a bot to help you do your job, whatever that may be. When you retire, your kid gets your job and uses your bot to help, further refining it. I wonder how long it would take, until the bot developed some sort of \"personality\" that is one part of each of the persons who had been using it before. It'd be like working with your grandpa always being there to answer your questions. I dunno if that would be creepy, if it's good or bad. Certainly interesting to think about though.

The same thing is happening now with the big ai shift, you can hate it all you want, but it's literally just better ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEdit: This isn't to say I've figured it all out, either.

Because no-code tools that \"anyone can use\" have been around for decades, and managers still want to be telling developers what to build even if they technically could be doing the work with those no-code tools themselves. \n\nAnd the same will happen here. Developers will continue to be specialists wrangling all of the code. Really trivial \"plumbing\" category code tasks and simple UI will mostly be done by AI, but there will still need to be an expert involved for the foreseeable future.\n\nFrankly, most managers don't want to be coding or prompting. They are done with being an IC and want to keep track of higher level details. And there is no universe where some rando untrained minimum wage employee can replace a software engineer as the prompter.\n\nThe tools are pretty good, but they still make really bad mistakes with algorithm and architecture. They're useful to save some time at first, but if you're not a competent software engineer, you'll be spending 100x as much effort trying to iterate to fix errors you don't understand. And as the architecture gets further off the rails, the multiplier keeps going up.\n\nFinally, the way a lot of corporate management works, there's more prestige the larger your team is. It's rare that any manager will want to lose members of their team, so instead of cutting jobs (assuming AI is effective at increasing productivity) they will tighten schedules and add features.\n\nThere are always more features to add. Unless you're maintaining something like a web site for a restaurant that only needs a new menu update every couple of months, the backlog is usually enormous. If not the backlog, then the feature wish list. I'm skeptical that AI will result in more than a 10-20% productivity boost over the long term, but even if it does, they'll just ask for more work to be done.",

They are good enough to fulfill their purpose of shrinking wages and deskilling.

They can deliver some code yes, but it's full of (difficult to understand) mistakes and more importantly: it's not deterministically good code. The dramatic part of this is that this tech mimics something useful and good but you need to have deep understanding of tech to see why using it is only waste of time.\nCan you create a mobile app from scratch with few prompts? Yes. Can you fix a complex non-trivial bug? No. You can try to argue with the AI and it will drop some lines to try to fix but there's no way to prove that it will deliver a good solution. (Then release, ah still not good, rerelease and so on). As engineers we must discard this tech as useless and inefficient but the money people will for sure try to make us believe this is future.\n\n\nAbout the next models, I think the tech cannot get qualitatively better, it's super sophisticated (and impressive) auto complete tool, but what's needed to improve simply needs to be something else. \n\n\nI would try to find a better place to work, where you are back to be engineer and not AI manager",

Before AI, I would just go on and learn about the underlying technology to completely understand the problem domain. Now, I completely lost the intellectual curiosity to do so. I just prompt Cursor to do it. I give it every crumb of knowledge that I can and it still fails. Goes on a lot of tangents, hallucinates and gaslights.\n\nSo, I don't agree that it is able to do our job, at least not today. If I wouldn't have it, I would have probably already tried to understand the problem better. Now, I just don't care. I just let the AI fail again and again. Maybe, the next model release would be able to do it. Fortunately or unfortunately I am seeing that there is no detectable performance gain between Opus 4.5 and 4.6. Lot of people doesn't understand that this plateau can go on for years or even decades. As AI winters come and gone before.\n\nI also did a lot of work to get here, so I feel a lot of us are on the same page on this. I was very proud that I was able to deliver beautiful, elegant solutions at an acceptable pace or okay solutions very quickly. Well, I am not doing either now. I kinda stopped making the effort just moving along day-by-day, looking for other possible paths to make money if LLMs actually start to get good.\n\nAll-in-all, I don't think we can be replaced by now, but I also don't think that it will be impossible. What is certain, is that AI completely destroyed my productivity, motivation and effort. Our whole industry stopped caring a long time ago, everyone is just shipping slop, the user is our last concern and somehow everyone just believes what they read on X and follow it like the Bible.",

Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company. I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.\n\nAh. I can relate to that. Back in 2020 that is. \n\nIt's work. It's not really meant to be fun. It's great that you found it fun for a while, but that runs out for most people at some point.\n\nEventually you realise that you're not doing new and exciting things. You're just doing the internet's plumbing, and then it's not really quite as fun anymore.\n\n> If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. \n\nWhat is this full scale people keep talking about? I try keep up with all the latest research, I run a home lab, I try out various products, I watch podcasts, I follow announcements, and I just keep missing this \"full scale use\" that you describe. If anything, one think keeps being abundantly clear, AI does a great job at multiplying and magnifying human effort, and does a mediocre job of simulating human effort with periodic horrible mistakes that can set you back a ton if you miss them. \n\n> I did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. \n\nIt is. Getting good at AI, and understanding how you can leverage your life of experience in combination with AI is the next step you have to embrace if you want to be a good developer going forward. It's not like your skills are pointless. Sure you don't have to type out all that code yourself, but you still have to read it and think about it and discuss it and decide how to evolve it. Your skills and logic are still critically important, it's just now part of utilising those skills and logic is how well you can convey your intent to the AI, and how well you can track what the AI is doing.\n\n> At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nYou really think government employees are going to escape the AI revolution? You're just on the leading wave. You have the unique opportunity to surf this wave into the new age at it's crest, and your complaint seems to be that it's not fun anymore. Well, then try to use AI for something more fun, maybe something you've been putting off because it seemed way too hard to tackle. By the time AI comes for the government it's going to be late enough that they are likely to struggle far more than you will as you learn the new styles of working with AI.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nAI companies are focus on software because there's an infinite need for software, and that need is ever changing and evolving. Instead of bemoaning it, embrace the super-power your understanding of software gives you. You can talk to the AI on the same level, and direct it in ways people without that experience can't even hope to replicate.",

So after thinking a bit it realized it had added tooltips using the `info` class instead of `normal`. So it happily changed those and finished, but upon rendering the i’s looked different still. Turns out that the font difference for the i’s depended on using the `text-normal` class, and Claude rendered the tooltips using `text-info` and **in the same line where the info class was!** So of course I had to change that myself and be done with it.

I have been laid off for 2 years.. after 25 years in the field.. about 15 to to before retirement.. and was hopeless. AI revitalized that because for about $400 a month at most.. but usually about $200 a month.. I am able to have a team of 5 to 10 doing design, testing, coding, going back and forth on things, etc. YAh.. I know.. seems silly talking to AI but here is where things are so much better for me.. and I suspect many. Instead of dealing with younger pompous assholes who are out to prove how much better they are, or a senior dick head that constantly wants to argue/fight why his one way is always the right way.. i get to guide/chat/go back and forth with a level headed (relatively speaking) jack of all trades master of everything because it has VASTLY more data and access to even MORE data than any 10.. 100 engineers I've ever worked with. I've worked at big 500 companys and FAANG too. Sure.. you got some very good competent engineers in those places too. But.. as the saying goes \"opinions are like assholes, everyone has one\" and that is without a doubt the day to day shit every company I've worked in has been. I've thought I had a good team while working for one big well known company to find out my Indian boss had an Indian dev doing shit competing with my project without sharing any info, and then ultimately sidelined my work and chose that. So I gave up on trusting anyone I work with or for that they dont have some hidden fucking agenda to one up me or others. \n\nSo.. while I am not paid (living on some stock I sold.. sadly running out fast though with the insane 2x+ increase in cost of living in the past year in this regime) I will say I am having the absolute best coding/work of my life. I am directly building my dream product/project and it may never work.. but at least I am enjoying it while I can. It's turning out EXACTLY how I envisioned too.. and mind you AI is not \"vibe coding\" this. It's been about 9 months of AI and it STILL isn't even near ready.. so this is no tiny project that someone wonder coded over a weekend. This is a ton of back and forth, discovery, I have over 80,000 tests running on the regular.. unit, regression, spec, etc.. I am super anal about making sure we are always building tests with features, and I verify the tests do indeed work as intended not some generated slop that has no value. ",

          "text": "heres my ai response to this: \n\n\n\n“AI took all the fun out of programming” is giving **“cars ruined horseback riding.”**\n\n\n\nLike… yes. Gone are the days when you could flex that you can parallel park a horse, repair a wagon wheel with twine, and navigate by vibes and a lantern. Gone are the days when the entire town gathered to watch you fix the one axle nobody could fix, and you got promoted to *Senior Buggy Engineer* because you could tighten a bolt in a blizzard.\n\n\n\nAnd then the car showed up.\n\n\n\nAt first it felt insulting:\n\n“So you’re telling me some dude can just turn a key and go 10x faster? No reins? No oats? No *craft*? What am I even training for anymore?”\n\n\n\nBut here’s the part people forget: **cars didn’t delete transportation — they multiplied it.**\n\nThey created highways, mechanics, driving schools, traffic laws, logistics companies, race car drivers, road trips, ambulances, taxis, delivery services… entire industries that didn’t exist when “going somewhere” meant “hope your horse isn’t in a mood today.”\n\n\n\nThat’s where we are with AI.\n\n\n\nYou’re mourning the era where shipping a feature was a heroic solo quest:\n\n*“After three nights and two mental breakdowns, I found the missing null check.”*\n\nRespect. Truly. That was the sport.\n\n\n\nBut companies don’t pay for heroism. They pay for **outcomes**.\n\nAnd “one person writing a prompt” doesn’t magically produce production software any more than “one person buying a car” automatically makes them a professional driver, mechanic, or traffic engineer. You still need someone who understands:\n\n\n\n* what to build (requirements that aren’t nonsense)\n* what *not* to build (scope control, security, compliance)\n* how to test it (real tests, not “seems fine”)\n* how to maintain it (the part everyone forgets exists)\n* how to keep it from catching fire at 2 a.m. in prod\n\n\n\nRight now, AI is like an engine that starts instantly and goes fast… and also sometimes **drives confidently off a bridge**while assuring you it’s taking the scenic route.\n\nSo yes — it’s “cheap cognition.” But cheap cognition isn’t the same as **accountable engineering**. A company can hire the cheapest driver alive, but somebody still has to be responsible when the car goes through the living room.\n\nAlso: the “stop comparing it to calculators/internet” thing… I get the frustration, but it’s still basically the same pattern with higher horsepower. People always say “this time it’s different” — and it *is* different in capability — but the economic story is familiar: **tools change which parts are scarce.**\n\nTyping boilerplate gets cheaper. Good judgment gets more valuable.\n\nAnd the “why are they hell-bent on us?” part: because software is the control panel for everything. If you can automate *software creation*, you can touch every industry downstream. That’s not personal — you’re just standing next to the biggest leverage point on earth.\n\nSo no, it’s not “developers are cooked, become a government employee.”\n\nIt’s: the job is shifting from “hand-crafting every bolt” to “designing, validating, steering, and owning the system.” The fun doesn’t disappear — **the fun moves**. Less time shoveling coal into the engine, more time actually driving somewhere interesting.\n\nIf you want a one-liner summary:\n\n**AI didn’t take the fun out of programming. It took the whip out of your hand and handed you a steering wheel.**",

It can generate code at lightning speed, but it lacks the context of why a certain legacy technical debt exists or the nuanced empathy needed to build products for actual humans.\n\nWe are moving from being 'bricklayers' to 'architects.' It’s a painful transition, especially when you’ve spent years mastering the craft of laying bricks. But your hard-earned logic and fundamental skills are what allow you to spot when the AI is hallucinating a 'perfect' but dangerous solution.

          "text": "*This is a long post, but it's a master class in client relations, I promise you'll get something out of this.*\n\nOkay, most people in here are approaching this from a combative perspective or fear-inducing perspective \"What if it breaks?\" \"How will you update it?\". \n\nSome of y'all have never worked with clients and it shows. Neither of those approaches will ever actually land you clients.\n\nThis is an obvious client education opportunity. The idea is to educate them and reveal what the real process is and do it as humbly and tactfully as possible so they don't feel dumb.\n\nFrom the client's perspective they are thinking \"I can just jump in ChatGPT for an hour or two and bang out a website\". Our goal in the response is to acknowledge that they can indeed use AI to build a website, but subtly explain that it's more than just running a few prompts in ChatGPT.\n\nThis serves a couple purposes: it makes them realize \"Oh this is actually much more of a process and involves more work than I realized\" and it also makes them realize \"Wow these guys know their stuff\". You're essentially educating and selling them at the same time without them realizing it.\n\nOkay, all that sounds cool, but what does it look like in practice, here's an email you can modify to fit your agency:\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\],\n\nTotally fair question and honestly, you're right. You can use AI to build a website. We use AI in our process too, so I'm not here to tell you it's smoke and mirrors.\n\nBut I think it's worth being real about what \"using AI to build a website\" actually looks like in practice, because it's pretty different from how it gets talked about.\n\nHere's what actually goes into it:\n\nBefore you ever open an AI tool, someone has to figure out who the site is for, what it needs to say, and what it needs to do. That means understanding your customers, your positioning, and what makes you different from everyone else in your space. AI can help you execute on that, but it can't figure it out for you.\n\nThen there's the copy. AI can write, but it writes generically unless it's given strong direction. Someone still has to know what story your business is telling, what tone matches your brand, and whether the output is actually good or just grammatically correct.\n\nThen design. Then development. Then making sure it loads fast, shows up in search, works on every device, and doesn't break when someone actually tries to use it.\n\nAnd once it's live, a website isn't really done. It needs to be updated, monitored, and adjusted based on how people are actually using it.\n\nNone of that is impossible to do yourself, but it's not a couple of prompts and a launch either. The people getting real results with AI are the ones who know enough about strategy, design, and development to direct it well and catch it when it's wrong.\n\nThere's also something that tends to get overlooked: when you're deep in the day-to-day of running your business, it's really hard to see it from the outside. One of the most valuable things we do early in a project is sit down with clients and just ask questions, the kind a business consultant might ask. And almost every time, that process surfaces things the client hadn't thought to put on their website, messaging angles they'd never considered, or assumptions about their customers that turn out to be wrong. You know your business better than anyone, but that familiarity can also create blind spots. A fresh set of eyes with the right framework tends to find things you can't see from the inside.\n\nI think about it this way: you're probably great at what you do because you've spent years getting good at it. You've built up knowledge, instincts, and judgment that someone couldn't just pick up in an afternoon. We're the same way about web design and development. We're going to be more rigorous, more strategic, and bring ideas to the table that wouldn't come from a few hours with an AI tool, not because the tools aren't powerful, but because knowing how to use them well is its own skill set built over years of doing this work.\n\nThat's really what you're paying for when you work with an agency, not the tools, but the judgment behind them.\n\nHappy to chat more about what that could look like for your project if it's useful.\n\nBest,\n\n\\[Your name\\]\"\n\nThis does a few things: gracefully gives them an opportunity to reach out to you to learn more after all of that education. It reveals what is actually involved in the process of web design and the value of each part of the process. It shows that you know EXACTLY what you are doing. You relate it to their business and expertise and explain you have the same expertise in this field without outright saying \"I have experience doing this and you don't\". You're also talking to them like a human, you're not corporate BSing them, you're being real with them but in a tactful and tasteful way.\n\nTelling clients they are wrong is an absolute art that very few know how to pull off where it turns into the client trusting you MORE not less.",

You might be *damn good*. But you aren’t the only one doing it. The biggest differentiator in concierge professional services (such as bespoke web development) is the ability to establish a good working relationship with your clients. \n\nThey need to trust you, because their business depends on it.

You don't get paid for educating people, and by the time you've convinced 1 person of your value, you could have pitched 5 who are stretched for time and ready to cut a check.\n\nA business owner who says they'll do something themselves is someone who has more time than money, and those do not make profitable customers. Even when they sign they are often bad to work with - micro-managing and tight with their funds.\n\nLook for businesses who are stretched for time and desperate for what you're selling. Your clients should not be spending their own money, they should be employees at a company with the authority to spend a budget to solve a problem, and for which there are consequences if they do not solve it. Successful or fast growing businesses make much better clients as they have more money than time and will pay well to solve problems.\n\nIf you talk to 100 prospects and nobody wants what you're selling, change up what you're offering. Take a few for coffee and ask what their biggest problem in business is. Focus on the benefits not the features (\"10 new leads a month\" vs \"a great looking website\"). Are you a \"vitamin\" or a \"painkiller\"? That is, if you stop taking a vitamin pill there are no immediate consequences, but skipping a painkiller is something you'll feel right away.\n\nIn my business we sell subscriptions to companies that are in the 5-6 figure range, where we solve a very specific problem. The more specific we have gotten about the problem we are solving, the easier it has been to sell, and the more people will pay. It has taken a number of years to find that problem, and we can still refine it further. We do not speak to companies with less than 50 employees.\n\nI often speak to people who aren't at the point they need us or they don't see the value yet, to which the answer is \"thank you for your time, here's a problem I think you might run into as you scale... when you need help solving it, you know where to find us.\" Treat them with respect, leave them with a clear value prop, and sometimes they'll come back - maybe a year or two later - or more often we get people they refer to us.",

Well, I'd bought the cheap package, but google hadn't told me I'd need a bigger one, so I upgraded, then I tried to install WordPress and I got stuck! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, more reading, more trying stuff and messing it up, a week passes! HOW DISAPPOINTING! In the end I got WordPress installed, then I tried making a site. So you know how things like iPhones are easy to use because Steve Jobs used to walk around offices shouting THIS ISN'T EASY ENOUGH well nobody did that with WordPress and.. well.. I nearly LOST MY MIND! Then I installed elementor, and things got a bit easier, so I managed to get a site together... 6 WEEKS SO FAR.... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I get my site up and running thinking I'll GET LOADS OF VISITORS.... but I don't! I get NONE... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, and I found out that there's this thing called PageSpeed Insights, which gives an idea of how good your site is for visitors, so I run my site and... tell you what... it was LIKE A KICK IN THE NUTS! EVERYTHING WAS RED and I had this HUGE LIST OF \"OPPORTUNITIES\"... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I start fixing them, but there's some things I can't fix, and I'm going \"Why's this still really bad? What am I doing wrong\" so more googling more working out, then I FIND OUT IT'S ELEMENTOR! HOW DISAPPOINTING! That thing that made it easy, that's gone and screwed me downstream!!! So I find out to move away from elementor I've got to redo EVERY PAGE ON MY WEBSITE! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I do that, I pass my core web vitals, I think \"BRING ON THE VISITORS!\"... and all I hear is the sound of crickets chirping and STILL NO VISITORS, HOW DISAPPOINTING! Then I find out about SEO, and like some of it's OK, it involves me doing things to my site, so I'll do that first (because I can) see how it goes. So I REWORK ALL MY SITE'S PAGES. AGAIN. This time optimising titles and meta and doing a bit of schema (don't get me started on that, that was a WHOLE WORLD OF PAIN!), and I check to see if it's made any difference to like ACTUALLY GETTING VISITORS. I DON'T!!! AGAIN!!! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!! So then I find out about backlinks and I need some, right, for SEO, so I do a load of backlinky stuff like what's said on the forums and that... did it work? IT DID NOT! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!! See it turns out there's backlinks and there's BACKLINKS and the ones that work are like, well, pretty hard to get and you need to be able to tell the difference between the backlinks and the BACKLINKS because there are these people on fiverr that will sell you backlinks THAT DO NOTHING for a LOAD OF MONEY! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I find out it's really hard to get the GOOD BACKLINKS so I end up getting an SEO agency to do that. Then... when NOTHING HAPPENS AGAIN I find out there are a lot of crooks in SEO world so I have to make like 50ish phone calls just to FIND SOMEONE NORMAL THAT DOES ACTUALLY DO SEO. The good news is, I now get visitors. The difference between that, and what happens now with AI, is that you get to speak to some robot that talks down to you says things you then need to go off and google anyway (so you might as well be doing that in the first place) completely breaks everything and when you ask it \"why did you tell met to do that it broke everything?\" It says \"You're right, that will break everything\".... (wait for it)... HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!!\n\nDon't be repeatedly disappointed, let me make your website, and I'll be disappointed on your behalf and cut to the \"you get visitors part\" in a couple of weeks instead of a couple of YEARS!",

It's unbelievable, but 2 out of 5 clients have a cousin or a brother-in-law (it's always cousins and brothers-in-law, never a brother or a friend) who are \"experts\" in the field and will do it for the client for free.\n\nI always focus on what I can do that their relative can't. In the case of AI, you could drop something like: \"Well, if you want a generic website, to be dependent on a platform that might raise its prices tomorrow, and to be left completely on your own when a problem arises, then sure, use AI.\"\n\nIn my services, I offer website redesigns (because I usually focus on fixing crappy websites for businesses making over €300,000 a year), including the Figma UI kit so others can maintain it, and the HTML/CSS/JS code. I no longer offer backend because I'm focusing on edge computing with Cloudflare Workers, plus hosting, always trying to find the simplest and cheapest solution for the client to maintain.\n\nDepending on what you offer and what the client currently has (if they already have a website and it's a disaster, if the design is super outdated, or if technically they could save money or stop using prehistoric tech, and yes, I'm looking at you, jQuery), you hit them with the second part: \"I am offering you this, this, and this, which is something no AI or brother-in-law is ever going to give you.\"\n\nI don't have the best conversion rates in these situations, because at the end of the day, clients in Spain tend to be stubborn. They believe AI will do everything even if I tell them otherwise, or they go to another professional because they get offended when you tell it to them straight. But hey, at least you get it off your chest.\n\n\\---   \nI'm leaving the original message in Spanish here so you can verify that I'm not a bot, which has been believed more than once on r/copypasta:\n\nYo trabajo en España (y soy español, estoy traduciendo este mensaje al inglés con IA, que nadie me mate por favor), y más que la de la IA, te encuentras la de \"mi familiar lo hace más barato\". Es increíble, pero 2 de cada 5 clientes tiene un primo o cuñado (solo son primos y cuñados, nunca es un hermano o amigo) que son expertos en el tema y se lo hacen gratis al cliente.\n\nYo siempre me enfoco en lo que hago, y lo que su familiar no. En el caso de la IA, podrías soltarte algo como; \"bueno, si quieres una web genérica, tener dependencia de una plataforma que puede subir los precios mañana, y estar solo cuando te surja un problema, entonces si, usa IA.\"\n\nYo en mis servicios ofrezco el rediseño de web (porque usualmente me enfoco en arreglar las webs pestosas con negocios que facturan +300,000€ al año), con el ui kit en figma para que puedan mantenerlo otros, el código en html/css/js, ya no ofrezco backend porque me estoy enfocando en el edge computing \\[no se si he escrito bien ek termino\\] con los workers de cloudflare, y hosting, intentando buscar la solución más sencilla y barata de mantener para el cliente.\n\nDepende de lo que ofrezcas y lo que tengas del cliente (si ya tiene una web y es un destrozo, si el diseño es muy antiguo, o si técnicamente podría ahorrar dinero o dejar de utilizar tecnologías del prehistórico, y si, estoy mirando a jquery), ya le contestas la segunda parte tal que: \"yo te ofrezco esto esto y esto, cosa que ninguna IA/cuñado te va a dar.\"\n\nNo presento los mejores ratios de conversión en estas situaciones, porque al final en España el cliente suele ser un cabezón que cree que la IA lo va a hacer todo aunque yo le diga que no, o que se va a otro profesional porque le da coraje que se lo digas tal cual, pero bueno, por lo menos te quedas agusto.",

          "text": "Sales guy here. This is very much a sales question, so I'll give you a quick rundown of the situation. \n\nI'll keep it light on the lingo, but in sales terms \"I'll just have AI do it\" is a very classic \"objection\" (stated reason for not buying your goods or services)) - just a newer, shinier version of the ever-present \"Let's just build it in-house\". \n\nThe best way to meet an objection is with knowledge - both of the customer and of the competition. Let's start with the customer. There are 3 levels of things you should be seeking to understand when you engage in these discussions (this process is known as \"discovery\" in sales): \n\n1. Surface level - what's the project? Who's involved? What's the timeline? What's the budget? etc. You should get this stuff down as quickly as possible and move on to the meatier stuff.\n2. Business case - why are they doing the project? Is it revenue-generating? What happens if the deadline pushes? etc. These are at some fundamental level measured in $$$, but your client may be measuring using emotions, relations / promises to others in the company - it's best to speak their language, but seek to understand the math. \n3. Personal - what is personally motivating your contact? Excitement about a new project? A mandate to use AI services  already purchased?  Frustration over out-of-control consulting costs (sorry to bring it up, but you REALLY better know if this is the case)? These will primarily be measured in emotions. \n\nYou need to fully understand what is driving the project and the people pulling it together so that you know how to respond appropriately to the question. \n\nNext - the competition. How well do you know these tools? Do you know how to respond if a customer tells you that they are copy / pasting code out of Grok vs they have purchased Claude Code subs for the whole team? Do you know to quickly hide your smirk when they say Lovable? Do you have a feel for the difference between Haiku in VS Code and Opus in Cursor? If not, you'd better start learning these fast, because they will have very different implications for how the conversation is going to go. \n\nOk, back to your to objection \"I'll just have AI do it\". Now that you're doing the above, multiple paths are open to you based on what you've learned. Let's start with some FUD (fear, uncertainly, doubt) about the competition:  \n\n* \"Oh, great. Your product launch is in a month, right? Who's going to be doing the work?\" \\[aka: you just told me how important this project is - remember that hope is not a strategy\\] \n* \"Yeah, you mentioned you're trying out Lovable. Do you have anyone who's going to be checking the SEO for you?\" \\[classic move - you already know they are making a mistake and they're just starting to learn it\\]\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned that your intern is really excited about vibe coding? Which tools did you get them?\" \\[if they are woefully underinformed about the whole space - really let them flounder a bit\\]\n\nAlternately, you could take their side (this is more on the knowing the customer side): \n\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned there's a mandate to use AI from the CEO / Board - do you need someone to audit those efforts and keep them on track?\"\n* \"It's an exciting new space. I'm actually helping a lot of my customers project manage that work, because these projects work best when kept within a strict framework\" \n\nThere are a number of ways to align yourself with the customer's vision by making it clear that you are well ahead of them in terms of this new trend. (Heck, have a standardized AI consulting package!)\n\nAnyway, the key here is that when you are met with an objection, you should take a step back and ask questions, rather than trying to meet it head on. Make sure you 1) acknowledge the object 2) seek to understand the question / concern / challenge and get yourself properly positioned before 3) to dispassionately help your customer discuss what is best for them. \n\nThat got longer than I thought, but hopefully it's helpful!

The AI does it eating up a huge amount of your time and effort; having to deal with all it's problems, mistakes, wrong turns, and needing to know what to ask. \n\nIf they ask that, ask them what they think their hourly rate would be, and how many hours it would take them to do it. If they give a ridiculous rate act all surprised, and tell them that if they can really work that fast then you should work together on a web business because there's a ton of money to be made.\n\nThat might also be a good time to point out that they would need to learn all these things about web design, and a good place to bring up a anecdote like this one:\n\n> After Ford's engineers failed to fix a broken generator, Steinmetz was called in, studied it, and precisely marked a spot for repair, fixing it immediately. When Ford questioned the high invoice, Steinmetz itemized it: $1 for marking the spot and $9,999 for knowing where to mark it.\n\nYou're not charging money for writing a website. You're charging money for being someone that knows what a good website is, and how to build it, be it on your own and with an AI. It's the same reason they haven't actually gotten their nephew to built their site. Shit's kinda hard, and the nephew might be good with computers, but probably not good enough yet to design, build, release, and maintain a professional and discoverable website. (And, you know, go to school and such). That sort of knowledge takes experience and an understanding of the world, and of computers. You just happen to be a person that's put in the time to get good at both.\n\nSo really, best you can do is stay professional, lay out the financial reasons, and hopefully you started with a high enough initial offer that they can \"talk you down\" to something you can both agree on. That, or maybe you need to look into better expired boner pill investment opportunities. Some weirdo on craiglist just bought out my entire stock, so maybe the market's turning up",

          "text": "I’ll give you an anecdote. Maybe 7 years ago I called a business that had what looked like an early 2000s html website. Most of the service pages lead to an “under maintenance” page. I called the company and was talking to the owner who told me, “I’ve got a buddy who can do it for a 6 pack of beer why should I pay you?”. At the time I didn’t really know how to respond because hey if you can get your website made for a 6 pack of beer then why not just do it? I just checked the website, it hasn’t changed. \n\nThere’s a disconnect between what people “think” they can do or will do, and what will actually get done. They think AI is a magic solution that will do for them what would have cost $$$, and get the same result. The crux of it is, they don’t know how to make a website that converts. They won’t know good from bad, when something doesn’t work they will just say “fix it” to the magic chatbot then be confused when it doesn’t. \n\nYou’re not selling just website development or marketing. You’re selling your experience creating successful websites that convert. You’re selling someone to fix problems before they occur, and make changes when they are needed. It’s peace of mind and profitability. Will they sleep better at night by making their own website with AI, or if they don’t have to worry about their website and try to figure out why it’s not getting them sales?",

They can accomplish a lot, but you have to direct them very carefully or it soon becomes an unmaintainable mess because nobody is holding on to the big picture.\n\nHas AI changed how I work? **Yes, that's why I can deliver more than I used to in the same amount of time. And, my estimates reflect that.** But the skills to plan and manage the project, the skills to ensure your site isn't identical to everyone else's, and the skills to keep it reliable and secure for years to come require careful human attention. Without it, you soon have a mess. And at that point, it's often easier to start from scratch.\"\n\nI bolded a statement that might be unpopular because it could require to reconsider how much you charge for a given task. But as a developer with 40 years of experience, I have to tell you that I have barely touched code in the last month. I've been directing Claude Code instead, with close attention to the results. And that does make a difference, or I wouldn't do it.\n\nSo my advice is to master the technology, put it to work, deliver more work faster, and get ahead that way, accepting that you might have to change your rate for some kinds of work. If there are types of work you do that **can't** be done well by guiding AI (I listed some possibilities above), then of course you can take that into account. But overall, you will be one of the winners if you don't do the \"deer in the headlights\" thing.\n\n(P.S. Yes, I'm paying for Claude Max. Pro also includes some access to Claude Code with advanced models. There's plenty of good advice out there about how to use Claude Code successfully and it should be followed.

That part isn’t hype anymore.\n\nWhere it usually falls apart isn’t the code, it’s the thinking behind it.\n\nAI can generate a page. But it won’t automatically decide what to cut, what to emphasize, how to frame your value for a specific audience, or how to guide someone toward a real action.\n\nThat’s not a knock on AI - it’s just the difference between output and intention. The way I see it: AI can get you to 70–80% much faster than before.\n\nThe real leverage is in what you do with the remaining 20%.\n\nThat’s where strategy, positioning, and experience still matter.\n\n**AI doesn’t replace that, it just changes where the work starts.**",

Among other things, it allows you to make smaller DOMs.\n\nI talk about a modern CSS technique that does that here:\n\nhttps://op111.net/posts/2023/08/lean-html-markup-with-modern-css/\n\nIt is an idea I started playing with when custom properties landed in browsers, around 2016 or 2017? Around 2021 I started using the technique in client sites too.\n\nNow I want to write a 2026 version of the post that talks about container queries too. The technique becomes more powerful if you can rely on container queries and on the cqw unit. (You cannot always. That stuff is still new.)\n\nFor an example of the convenience cqw offers if you can rely on it, see the snippets I have in this:\n\nhttps://omnicarousel.dev/docs/css-tips-know-your-width/",

You ship fast now, accumulate some mess, and in six months the tools to clean it up are dramatically better than they are today. I'm not saying this is definitely the right approach, you can obviously go too far with it.

When fetching large data sets, the cost of instantiating ORM objects for each row can be non-trivial as well. \n\nIf I’m writing boilerplate backend, I use the ORM for safety and convention.",

At some point, you have to turn results into objects to do work, and whether or not that's using pre-built conventions or rolling your own mappers it's not something you can escape.\n\nThat said, I would divide the spectrum of ORMs into four rough groups:\n\n1. Tools that use SQL as the exchange language (e.g. raw JDBC or pg_query).\n2. Tools that use languages like SQL, but not SQL itself (e.g. Hibernate HQL).\n3. Tools that build queries in a way dissimilar to normal collections (e.g. Knex, SeaORM, Hibernate).\n4. Tools that build queries in a way similar to normal collections (e.g. Entity Framework).\n\nEach of these has their pitfalls, but generally as you go down the list safety and discoverability of the API increase, and as you go up the list transparency increases (what you write is more similar to what the database executes). Since I value safety more than transparency (much like how I prefer garbage collection to manual memory management), I lean toward the bottom end of the list and tools that more tightly integrate model definitions, migrations, and queries/statements with the language I'm actually doing work in; it's a much better experience to have a compiler catch most potential problems than to let them happen at runtime.\n\nThe best experience comes from mixing #1 and #4 like is possible in Entity Framework: most of your simple queries and updates can be handled as if you were just handling lists and objects in-memory, but the escape hatch is there to skip generation go directly to SQL when necessary for things like stored procedures and features not yet supported by the rest of the ORM.",

That makes sense now in hindsight because I was learning fundamentals, syntax, control-flow, looping, etc.\n\nSo when I got to my first startup i was frustrated because I couldn't use by then you could pretty much just do the same thing in vanilla js.

So people start chanting \"jQuery is bad\".\n\nFurthermore, jQuery can't do what React can. At least not easily. It isn't designed for complex state management. The people also started chanting \"just use React\". React became ubiquitous is almost all kinds of web projects, small and large. It's vast ecosystem also makes it attractive. You can show off \"mad skills\" in animation, 3d graphics or large data management very easily with the help of a few React libraries.\n\nHowever, I don't really get why the people behind it love it so much since it also makes your website/app much more complex and you lock in into React for the future. I got it when it was a small framework, but now it tries to cater to all edge cases most devs never encounter. Thus, smaller libraries came up that provide a thin layer of the reactivity React also offers. Especially those who respected the vanilla, so they will never be \"out of fashion\", such as Alpine. The og, Preact.\n\nMost modern front-end JS frameworks are React wannabes that learned their lessons. I'd suggest you adopt progressive enhancement, maybe with a small js library (especially for existing code), and off the races.\n\nReact should die off just like jQuery.",

          "text": "They solve different problems.\n\njQuery's main added value was providing the \"missing\" bits of the DOM API, and brushing over the myriad of implementation differences between browsers. This used to be a big deal back then, but the missing bits have been added since, and web standards have taken care of practically all platform differences. E.g., dynamically attaching a click event listener to arbitrary DOM elements used to be difficult, but these days, you just go `elem.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`, which is pretty much the same as `$(elem).click(function () {...})`. Likewise, back in the days, finding an element in the DOM through anything more complicated than an ID or a simple \"first child of that element with this class name\" would have been extremely verbose, so you would reach for jQuery and say something like `$('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, but now you can go `document.querySelector('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, and it'll do the same thing.\n\nSo all that's left is slightly more compact syntax and familiarity, but pulling in an entire dependency just for that is not worth it in most cases.\n\nAlpine.js and HTMX offer a completely different approach to DOM manipulations - with jQuery and vanilla JS, things are mostly imperative: do this, then do that, insert this element into that element, set this attribute on that node, etc. These libraries, by contrast, allow you to mostly skip the JS part entirely, defining most of the behavior declaratively as part of the DOM itself. You can, in fact, build entire interactive web apps with these libraries without writing a single line of JS yourself. They also take care of some of the trickier bits, such as dealing with error responses, delaying DOM manipulations to allow some time for transitions, blocking or cancelling requests when they start superseding one another, displaying spinners to indicate ongoing requests, etc. None of these are super hard, but getting them right can be annoying and gets old quick.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong; there is a lot of criticism on both Alpine and HTMX; one valid concern, especially with HTMX, is that it discourages client-side rendering, which can lead to unnecessary network traffic and server load. E.g., if you want to paginate your content, the way you would do that with HTMX is render the first page on the server, serve that up as HTML, and hook up the \"next page\" button to request the next page, which then gets rendered to HTML on the server and sent up to the client. With a more client-centric framework, you would instead serve the entire dataset as JSON, in one go, along with the initial request, and then chop it up into pages and rendering the right one on the client, without any further network traffic or server load required to flip through those pages.",

This means using jQuery you tell the browser what do to and how to do it: when this is clicked, do something, then manually update the value in elements x, y, z. Declarative libraries don't require you do do all these steps, instead you have a central state variable, and and when a user interaction changes that value, all those elements x, y, z that use that variable are updated automatically by the library's internal reactivity system.\n\nImperative libraries are more likely to lead to \"spaghetti code\" as a page grows more complex, as you have to remember and manually code for all the downstream updates when anything changes. You either just write this code haphazardly as needed by a page, or you start creating design patterns for app-level implementation, an example being the publish-subscribe pattern (\"pub/sub\"). You can see some of these patterns in older library examples in \"Learning JavaScript Design Patterns\" by Addy Osmani. Some of these patterns are now internal to these frameworks/libraries, and these abstractions allowed devs to approach coding with a declarative style. You could say the \"reactivity\" systems of React and Vue were basically pub/sub implementations at heart.",

They all used js (and css but not relevant here) slightly differently and the options we had were \n\n1. Make different js files for each browser\n2. Memorise the differences and do a check for browser inside each method and adding the different code in a bunch of ifs\n3. Use Jquery\n\nDoing some things (like ajax requests or animations) were incredibly difficult and it was so hard to find a working solution. Stack overflow wasn't anywhere near as big as it is now - people were still in the phase of finding answers on random blogs, or even buying physical books on coding.\n\nAlong comes jQuery, and let you write the code once and it works in all browsers, and everything that is hard to accomplish is wrapped in a one liner. Everyone rejoiced and we all jumped on board. It got even more useful for a few more years as we had to add support for IE9 and 10 and some companies wouldn't drop support for IE6 for far too long.\n\nThe trade off was performance. We didn't like that the user had to download an extra file (these were the days before fibre connections so that file could add an extra second to first open time) and everything was 100x slower using JQ. A lot of things were so fast that 100x slower was still 0.01 seconds so it didn't matter, but for the things that would take 1 second in vanilla js it could take 30s+ in JQ. It made systems more easily maintainable, so brought value in the eyes of the managers for a slight trade off of certain things being really slow. These were the days when everything was slow anyway, and you didn't lose customers for a page taking 5 seconds to load. Overall it was worth it for the saved development time.\n\nToday's benefits are very different. You can do things in 1 line instead of 2 like your example `$('.button').click(function...)` instead of `var button = document.getElementById` then `button.onclick = function...` That is literally the only benefit I can think of. Most browsers are based on chrome, and the ones that aren't still follow the JS specifications properly so you don't need to maintain different versions of code. Things that used to be difficult are now easier to do, and really easy to find a working example online of how to do it.\n\nThe trade off is still performance - last year I rewrote a jquery function that was replacing all td within a table using a vanillajs function and brought the execution time down from 30+ seconds to under 1 second. The performance that was previously worth it for saving hundreds of hours of developer time and increasing maintainability is now a performance hit just so that a developer can write things in 1 line instead of 2. It just isn't worth it any more.",

You do not audit the existing project for free ever.\n\nThanks for raising that as that's important and I kinda glossed over that because I just assumed this guy would scoff at the mere suggestion.\n\nThe best way to do this is to time box it. Be like - audit at $x an hour to a max of 5 hours.\n\nIf it's going to take more than 5 hours to figure out if this is a project you want to take on, it's probably not a project you want to take on, heh.\n\nBut it's also important to make sure you produce a deliverable. Take notes as you poke around of the things you're coming across that would contribute to your cost if you were to produce a quote. You want to be able to deliver a report for their money so factor that into your $x/hr rate.",

Great them. End of the story\n- tell them that, even if it's usually against your policy, you can have a look at the code and see what you can do. If you want to proceed, give your price.\n\n\nWhen you give your price, give it higher than what you need:\n- better that than having to fight for extra budget. Better for your image\n- if the customer agrees, great\n- if he disagree, say you will think of something, wait a bit, then you can throw your real price with random explanation why you would do the discount.\n\n\nAlways be nice and polite. Always make the customer feel and know that you care as much about what they want as what you want (not more, not less)",

There was an e-commerce WordPress project that someone reached out to me to take over, they had a bad experience with their first developer, both technical issues but also interpersonnel issues between the owner of the company and the developer ... some rumblings about legal action from both sides.  I agreed to take a look at it, started to consult with them, but pretty quickly jumped off the project, I didn't accept any pay for it despite spending \\~20 or so hours working on various parts of it.  There was a \"technical lead\" (the owner's brother in law) who I worked with primarily, he's the guy who hired me, and I was frank with him, told him that it's much harder to jump into a project and \"get it over the finish line\" than it is to build it the way that I built projects from the start.  I would have been making up for the technical debt of this developer, but also that the original developer did not have the experience to push back against the owner's vision and promised things that just couldn't be done for the budget expectations that she had set.\n\nI liken it to plumbing.  A plumber quotes $10,000 for a job, but someone else quotes $1,000 for the same job.  The home owner hires the person who quoted $1,000, but after weeks and weeks the work isn't complete, they're not around, there's water leaking.  You're brought in to \"finish their work,\" but your quote now isn't $10,000, it's $15,000, because it requires un-doing the shoddily done inexperienced work that isn't to code.",

It is also possible the other way around, albeit much less likely: LH may report 100 points, but if real visitors use dialup connection on 8 years old low-end devices your RUM data will be all red...\n\nI think at the end of the day SERP positions are only affected by the RUM data, LH is just an assistive tool for developers, it is not a source of truth for Google.",
