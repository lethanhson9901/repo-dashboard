You could add a bloom filter that matches known keyword files, so you prevent the majority of requests for keyword requests that do not exist\n\nIf searching for multiple words, the frontend takes a union of both lists. A union operation can be pretty fast if both lists are sorted in the same way. (Like ID ASC)\n\nFor supporting the NOT keyword, you also fetch both lists, then do the inverse of the above AND.\n\nOR is simple, just take the union of both lists.\n\nSorting is difficulty because you are working with id's. You could include markers for each is saying if it matches the title, body or from, then rank results with title matches higher\n\nIf you need a search that searches for things in between quotes, you need position information. You either bloat your existing keyword file, or make another larger file that includes the id's and offsets.\n\nAuto complete is tricky. For this, you need to compare your existing, with a computer result list of a new word is included, you really need to test each word, so you need the other word lists. But you can still include relevant keywords in the keyword file, and give it a score from 0 to 1 depending how big the overlap in search results for both words is. An autocomplete solution would suggest words where the expected overlap approaches 0.5",

When you’re running hundreds of API calls in a flow, it matters.\n\nThe HAR import with automatic variable mapping is exactly for your use case.

By getting the \"this is what service is signed up with that email address\" before authenticating, you allow strangers to learn two accounts that a person has simply by knowing an often public or at least unguarded piece of information about them.\n\nBest practice is to reveal as little as possible about an account to unauthenticated users. That's why it's also recommended that \"forgot my password\" prompts should say something like \"if that email is registered with the system it'll receive a reset code\" rather than \"we've found that account and will send you a reset code\" and why \"this is the wrong password for that account\" messages should instead say something like \"there is no account with this username and password\".\n\nIs it the end of the world? Often no. But it's the best practice because it avoids you having to decide for a user whether them having an account with you is private information. Only they have enough context to decide that and that's often something that needs to be continuously reevaluated as your service evolves, so it's better to start cautiously because you can't undo people finding out your user lists.",

Silent refresh is better UX but requires handling edge cases (user revoked your app in provider settings).\n\n**Account linking**: What happens when a user signs up with email/password, then later tries OAuth with the same email? Do you auto-link accounts or create duplicates? Duplicate accounts are a support nightmare.\n\n**Revocation handling**: Test what happens when a user revokes your app's access in their Google/GitHub settings. Your app should handle 401s gracefully and prompt re-auth, not just crash.\n\n**State parameter validation**: I see you're using state for CSRF protection—good! But verify you're also checking it server-side (not just generating it).\n\nThe tricky part isn't the OAuth flow itself, it's all the edge cases around account state.

Be aware of this if you're moving from Heroku.\n\nI think just learning AWS is the best alternative in the long term, and is actually extremely helpful because you'll learn much much more about architecture than if you just use render.",

Buildpacks, auto-scaling, managed Postgres. Railway's CLI is solid.\n- **Fly.io** — more control (you're deploying containers/VMs), but their CLI workflow is nearly as smooth. Better for apps that need edge deployment or specific runtime requirements.\n\n**If you're comfortable with a bit more infra:**\n- **Kamal** (from the Rails team, formerly MRSK) — deploy Docker containers to any VPS via SSH. No vendor lock-in, you own the servers. Think Heroku-style deploys but to a /mo VPS. Great if you want to understand what's actually happening.\n- **Coolify** — self-hosted PaaS that gives you Heroku-like UI on your own infrastructure.\n\n**If your app is simple enough:**\n- **Hatchbox** for Rails specifically — manages the entire server for you.\n\nThe no-new-enterprise-accounts is the real tell.

To this day a function definition looks naked to my eyes without a docblock even if the function is fully typed and self explanatory. Even if the block says nothing but `@return void` I still need to see it.\n\nSpeaking of MySQL, it was incredibly easy to fall victim to SQL injections. There were no query builders unless you wrote one yourself from scratch. Higher profile scripts like phpBB were absolutely rife with SQLi exploits. If you can believe it, `addslashes` didn’t stop SQLi.\n\nAlso, as others alluded to, WordPress. From a user/admin PoV it was sliced bread, but developers could smell the cat piss and dog vomit the bread was made from. Many developers traded their sanity for money. Your IDE had no power there.\n\n——\n\nThese days it’s a joy to work with as you can make it as strongly or weakly typed as you want/need. ORMs make life easy. Query builders automate escaping user input. In other words; you have to actively try to write bad code these days, it’s a deliberate choice to eschew all the language improvements.",

While `mod_cgi` was enabled only the `cgi-bin` directory had `ExecCGI` enabled. However `mod_php` was enabled and allowed processing in any directory. Rarely did shared hosting in the early days enable `mod_rewrite`. There was no access to run your own server process.\n\nAll of this meant that Perl/Python/bash/C CGI programs could be a hassle to get running and had ugly URLs. You also couldn't easily have a dynamic index since you couldn't rewrite URLs or do 3xx forwarding. With PHP it was trivial to have dynamic content and pretty, *professional* looking, URLs. PHP also integrated pretty easily into existing WYSIWYG tools since some dynamic content could just be inserted easily into your layout.\n\nNot all PHP was written as all-singing all-dancing CMSes like WordPress or PHPNuke. A lot of deployed PHP was simple CRUD apps or just some dynamic components of a site or eventually the dynamic back end that spit out XML for some AJAX front end. PHP allowed all of this functionality on shared hosting for a few dollars a month with no additional processes or administration.",

For example:\n   * `strpos($haystack, $needle)` puts the string first.\n   * `in_array($needle, $haystack)` puts the item first.\n   * `str_replace($search, $replace, $subject)` puts the subject last.\n\n2. Historical Vulnerabilities: In the beginning, it was easy to write unsecure code. for example, in the most PHP tutorials taught unsafe Database Queries. Or the register\\_globals stuff, which resulted in URL Parameters becoming variables.\n\n3. \"Fractal of bad Designs\": 2012, there was a famous blog article (https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/).

I want actual Promises, where I can fire them off and return them and then keep doing other things and there is no way to accidentally block on them in a way that blocks other stuff.

Honestly I’d argue if it weren’t for wordpress PHP kinda would never have grown into the language it is today and it would probably be less relevant. In the modern era the language itself is very readable and well designed.\n\nSide note unrelated to your question. You mentioned hating JavaScript stating that it’s unreadable. Try TypeScript. It’s an extension of JavaScript that adds syntax making things a lot more recognizable for someone with a background in C# or PHP for that matter. Once compiled it’s literally just JS but it adds a ton of valuable benefits to the developer experience including added readability",

It struggled to run well on Windows servers, and if memory serves, there was often significant delays in getting a new version released. I don't think in those days (2006 or so?) there was a release schedule.\n\nAt around the same time, people were using PHP chiefly because of WordPress. It was enormously democratising, but it did mean that a lot of amateur code was being written, and thus WP/PHP unfairly became synonymous with rubbish code. Sites were getting hacked left, right, and centre. And, to make matters worse, web hosts were sticking with older versions of PHP, making it harder to upgrade.\n\nSo there was probably a bit of a backlash. It became a meme to criticise PHP to a furious degree, and people were putting days of effort into multiple-page screeds. But some 20 years later, the language is very healthy, the boost it got from Facebook turned it around a good deal, and if anyone hates it now, well it just shows they're not using it.\n\nUse whatever language you enjoy using, including PHP. But don't restrict yourself to one language; it is always healthy to learn several.",

Maybe an array? That’s why I was handed a codebase on frontend littered with checks and hard to maintain code (thank god runtime validators like Zod now exist) - and I blame it all on PHP for not having strict type checking.

You can see where that went. It's also very flexible, so you have multiple \"wrong\" ways to do things.\n\nThe ecosystem of WordPress plugins is a spectacular dumpster fire of terrible code, and it runs a lot of the web. The CMS itself is fine, but I wish I could unsee some of the code I've witnessed. Nearly every time you hear about some \"PHP vulnerability\" it was actually some dumbass' WordPress vibe-coded-without-AI plugin.\n\nProgrammer memes are also very difficult to kill. The very initial versions from the mid 90s were experimental and did very silly things. The language evolved and got better very quickly (early 2000s), but to this day people still think that a PHP script will automatically map URL parameters to global variables.\n\nTutorials with terrible practices also lingered on for far too long even though the language had grown past that. People also criticize some legacy features (fair) but forget that at the scale of PHP you can't just up and remove everything that's old without breaking a good part of the internet, so it took time for inconsistencies to be phased out.\n\nPHP kept adding improved features, but most people stuck with the old ways. Most any programmer worth their salt knew to update themselves, so the endless arguments about stuff like legacy function parameters when there are built in alternatives are 98% moot. \n\nThen there's its early ecosystem with bad default settings. The main way to run PHP early on was as an Apache module, a slow and cumbersome solution for its time, but not a good one. Inexplicably, that continued to be the default for years even though FCGI was already a thing, and the meme lingers on even when we moved on. See also nginx being seen as \"fast\" and Apache as \"slow\" because of different default settings at the time. (Yes nginx is light on RAM, no argument there)\n\nFinally, the association with MySQL, which has its own unfair memes. Early versions inexplicably maintained a fast-and-loose table type as a default setting for _ages_ even when the nice InnoDB was already available.\n\nAll put together, this stuff gave the impression that it was a toy language, and the meme stuck.",

Literally, just ways for people to use good programming concepts and telling them when they are doing something wrong lol. Good code is good code man.

We didn’t had PHP applications, we had PHP websites. \n\nIt was just a server side rendered programming language through your HTML. \n\nBuilding PHP sites was just a bunch of index.php, contact.php, form.php wired to each other. You had a mix of HTML and PHP that could grow into hundreds or thousands lines of code. \n\nHaving business logic somewhere. So when you didn’t close your php tag properly you saw your source code through your website. Or even errors somewhere on your site. \n\nThere was no cohesion. We managed session on every page. Including a php file that was renamed and giving errors on certain pages. \n\nUpgrading PHP was a nightmare. We didn’t had proper IDE’s. No tests. Everything was wired manually. \nBecause of this you had to work in the pile of shit of someone else and adapt to it. \n\nWe also didn’t had any versioning system like git or svn. It was just a FTP share where you just upload the PHP files you modified. Oh yes this was on production because spinning an entire environment was cumbersome. \n\nOr you were running some XAMPP on your PC. \n\nSo the PHP of the past is used differently from today. Like using a proper framework. With templating engines for HTML. There is a testsuite. We have proper tools. \n\nI miss the cowboy days where any company just let you do anything.

I think nowadays because people associate it with WordPress, and WP can be frustrating.\n\nThe use of plugins and themes (especially page builders) means that web development with WordPress doesn't really _feel_ like web development. So much of it is working with plugins and the back-end UI to configure things rather than writing code yourself to do it. This _is_ powerful, but it has tradeoffs. You don't control a lot of the code and instead need to get a theme and plugins to play nicely together. If they don't, you need to look under the hood, which feels hacky since it's someone else's code and any customizations you make will be erased as soon as you update. It just feels like you don't have full control or power to do what you want to do.",

Modern PHP (7.4+, especially 8.x) is a completely different language.\n\nWhat changed:\n- **Type system**: Strict types, union types, nullable types, property types. PHP 8.1+ type safety rivals TypeScript in practice.\n- **Performance**: PHP 8 is 2-3x faster than PHP 7, which was already fast. JIT compilation in 8.0+.\n- **Tooling**: Composer, PHPStan/Psalm for static analysis, proper async via Swoole/ReactPHP/Amp.\n- **Frameworks**: Laravel and Symfony are genuinely excellent. Laravel's Eloquent ORM is better than most alternatives in other languages.\n\nThe real issue is **hiring bias**. Many companies avoid PHP because senior engineers have PTSD from maintaining WordPress sites or legacy Drupal codebases. Hard to attract top talent when the language has a reputation problem.\n\nBut if you're solo/small team and shipping? Modern PHP with Laravel is extremely productive. The deployment story is still simpler than Node (no build step, shared hosting still exists). For MVPs and small-to-medium SaaS, it's a solid choice.\n\nThe hate is 80% outdated, 20% legitimate ecosystem fragmentation (WordPress/Drupal codebases give PHP a bad name despite being unrepresentative of modern PHP development).",

Do you guys remember guestbooks on websites? No not facebook, that was ten years later?\n\nPHP in 1999 seemed like a collection of scripts with funny server side embedding syntax in a c like script language. Personally I never liked php. It was always just basic pile of garbage functions that were thrown together and frequently were redundant as versions of php increased over the next decade between 1999-2008. I used it, I did not love it. Back then there were few good choices. The ASP.NET became fist true web framework coupled with c# and all the bells and whistles. However it was all Microsoft ecosystem and in my opinion way over engineered for any use other than enterprise software.\n\nThe Node.js + TS is basically several decades of refinement that just works everywhere. Server, client, Linux, windows, Mac, android etc. I just can’t imagine writing web applications like it’s 1999 with embedded html and css on use various complex templates for UI in the backend code. Is it possible in 2026 to make and run php, sure. But why? It’s legacy stack, the php flagship app was always Wordpress CMS and it’s dying rapidly. The ecosystem is no longer there, basically people still maintain it due to legacy stacks that still need support but reality is no one in sane mind would propose to roll out PRD with php+mysql stack. You’d get laughed out of the meeting.\n\nIt’s not that php is bad, it served its purpose 25 years ago. Same reason you’re not using Pentium 2 pc with 2GB of ram, 1TB hdd, and beige CRT monitors in 2026. Because that’s what i used to develop php code on in 2001.",

It seems people only praise it because it’s the only language available in the browser.

I don't think anyone with a C or C++ background would hate PHP; they might criticise it, but PHP’s structure and syntax are very closely related to the C-family.\n\nSo, why do people hate PHP?

Today's PHP has static analysis (PHPStan/Psalm), strong typing, first-class async, and excellent frameworks. The language evolved, but the reputation stuck.",

The problem is, diletantism is in its DNA, and its naming conventions are a bit inconsistent. Another issue with PHP is that it's heavy, it doesn't really support multi-threading, so each web request needs initializing your program from scratch. On a scale, it costs money. So even using slower, but multithreaded, Ruby, might be more cost-effective. That being said, PHP paid my bills for 20+ years, and continues to do so.",

PHP7 was a huge shift (and basically a rewrite), which allowed for more positive opinions to be formed if the dev was willing, but plenty still just never bothered to care much when it was easier to learn JS knowing it could be applied to both the frontend and backend.",

So that's a big advantage gone.\n\nSo the real question is - why use it? Now don't get me wrong, languages with a strong niche (e.g. erlang/elixir) can be the best choice for a specific project regardless of popularity - but what is PHP a good choice for?

In practice you end up with prop drilling hell or reach for a state management library for things that could just be local state. I've gone back to colocating state where it's used and only lifting when there's an actual reason.\n\n  \nCurious what others have quietly dropped.

              "text": "I'm clearly in the minority here, but I do go with (near) 100% test coverage for my own projects. It's not a true 100% test coverage, because I don't test everything, but it's 100% with explicit /\\* c8 start ignore \\*/ and /\\* c8 end ignore \\*/ statements for code that is not reasonable to test (eg external services, code tested by types anyway, code where its brokenness would come out immediately upon execution of tests regardless of whether they are explicitly tested, and so on). Also, I prefer mutation testing metrics over test coverage as a \"metric\". Test coverage is not really a good indicator for code stability as probably most people here know. \n\nI prefer working it this way a lot, because I'll know based on coverage where I have \"wonky\" code that may not be thought through sufficiently and I can also be almost certain that the code I have written is doing what I expected it to do. Expectations themselves prove wrong at times regardless, but often I can go for weeks without having any bugs in the code like that. \n\nAs I said earlier, I also expect no survivors in my library code when using mutation testing. I've found that often it helps removing excess code and finds very obscure bugs in advance. It also enforces 100% test coverage although you can also ignore parts of the code like with test coverage. Having no survivors in the mutation tests makes the library code a lot more mature and reliable from the start. I've never regretted time spent there, although I think it'd be excessive for UI or even API code. I use it for business logic and anywhere I can have pure functions.\n\nFor very interactive or time-related code - like HTML template generation or FE interactions, I agree with having less than 100% coverage. It is simply so time consuming to test the details it that usually it's just not worth it writing the tests. ",

Before you know it, you have a single block of code with three or four different and competing ideas shoehorned in and, behold, now none of them work. \n\nThere is a certain boundary where DRY interferes with modularity. The one piece of code that handles 6 different things having a latent bug or catastrophic edge case is much more cataclysmic versus a scenario where the 6th slightly different implementation shits the bed. You don't drag down the 5 working cases trying to bludgeon the 6th one in. \n\nBits and bytes are cheap. I only reuse code if I am doing the exact same thing the original code was designed for. And even then, chances are, I am going to rewrite what I had before and make it slightly better with whatever new tricks I picked up since the first iteration (meaning, I'm not technically doing a repeat in the first place).\n\nWriting some God-level function you can reuse through your entire repo in perpetuity is a fantasy scenario that, even if successful, means you are stagnating on a single idea just because it worked once in a particular context. But the habit of saying 'oh, I shouldn't repeat myself, I wrote a function similar to this back a year or two ago... Let me go dig it up...' isn't always an efficient use of your time and can be counter-peoductive when you finally do locate it and there are slight differences that mean you'll end up rewriting a portion of it, anyway. You could have typically cranked out a tailored solution with your latest skill level during that same period. \n\nObviously YMMV, but I used to be OCD about DRY and it is unhealthy. I've been repeating the same CRUD going on 20+ years now. If I was strictly adhering to DRY, I likely wouldn't have changed much about my process during that time. My own improvement was often hindered in the past by leaning too heavily on custom frameworks and libraries I had concocted. Why write new code when old code does same thing? And the truth is, constantly rewriting the same blocks of code, you get better at it. Not just faster, but more efficient, more secure, prettier code.  \n\nKind of an extreme example, I know, but letting DRY rule your workflow process can be poison to not just your repo but your meta progression as a developer.",

They run against a fully mocked DOM, rely on mocked props and data, and render components in a headless engine that represents only a small fraction of real user environments, while still consuming significant CI resources.\n\n\nThese tests don’t account for the CSSOM at all and can’t validate whether a user can actually interact with the UI—like clicking a button—across real viewports and devices.\n\n\nIn a world with infinite time and resources, sure, write all the unit tests. But in practice, most teams would get better value by saving those resources or investing more heavily in end-to-end testing, which exercises the system in conditions closer to how users actually experience it. \n\n\nEdit: Clarity ",

The way architectural patterns are applied directly shapes how teams are organized and how knowledge is shared.\nWhile Clean Architecture solves real technical problems, in many corporate environments it is applied in a way that encourages team separation by technical layers rather than ownership of complete business flows. This separation reduces end to end visibility, fragments domain knowledge, and increases coordination costs, even when modern approaches like microfrontends are in place.\nI believe this often indicates that bounded contexts are not clearly defined. When a bounded context is well understood, there is usually less need for heavy layering and abstraction, because a single team can own and evolve the business logic coherently.\nFrom a strategic DDD perspective, technical layers should remain internal implementation details, not organizational boundaries. A good architecture is one that supports business understanding, enables end to end ownership, and keeps cognitive complexity manageable for the teams that work with it.",

What's worse is they've never even attempted to write low allocation and performant code to know what the difference is.\n\nEvery single *ism* has some merit, I won't ever deny that, but each one when taken as your whole approach with no exceptions will certainly cause problems in your app.\n\n>DRY exists so you don't fix the same bug in 50 different places six months later while paying people by the hour.\n\nThat's not failing to follow DRY, that's writing terrible code.\n\nI'm not saying you go out of your way to repeat code that's truly repeated, more that all these blanket statements about development are all slide deck slogans about how to write code that have no metric associated with them and worst still do not including what the downsides are or can be to using them.\n\nSaying you follow DRY or SOLID or DDD or anything else means you go into a project and that's what you do no matter what, it's your standard.\n\nIf I had the exact code in two places, I absolutely would not write it twice, that's mad, but I hate DRY.  What I don't do is go out of my way looking for places to do DRY and instead selectively apply what's appropriate.  If both code *and* intent are the same, then it's the same code.\n\nWhat it means is DRY is not a principle anyone should follow religiously.  It's not that you *should* repeat yourself, just it shouldn't be a goal of the application.  Using DRY as a primary goal creates tightly coupled code that is very difficult to debug and change because it's used in too many places to know what the intent of each place is and how one change can affect unrelated portions of the codebase.\n\n>Not every system is mission-critical, low-latency infrastructure, or some optimized embedded software.\n\nPerformance is a feature.  I am not advocating for extreme measures to squeeze very cycle you can but it's outright neglectful to create solutions that make a client pay excessively more for hosting than they otherwise could.  \n\nI write performance tests for all important code on the hot path and check how it performs relative to other implementations.  If I get one that's 80ns vs 60ns I'm going to chose the one that's easiest to understand and maintain if it's not an order of magnitude higher, but if it's ms vs us then I might choose the us - that's one second of CPU time over 1000 request faster in just one place that you gained for free.  \n\nSame with allocations, if I've trimmed JTW middleware to 120b I won't go out of my way to choose the one that's 80b if it's less maintainable, but if it's at 4KB that's wasteful because it sets a standard to not have waste in your app and if you find enough places to trim without it causing readability difficulties then you could find yourself down a hosting plan.  \n\nThen there's the question of do you even know how much a request is allocating and how much each are of code is?  Have you even checked?  Have you checked the idle heap allocations?\n\nIt's also about practice and learning.  *Can you write code that is low allocations and performant.*  Unless you can and have then you have no business judging if something is appropriately performance tuned because you don't know the range it can exist in and how to plan that.  You need to work with the business to find out what is their goal for the app, do they care about hosting cost.  If no one asked and they were just told *surprise, this is what you will pay each month*, that's gross negligence\n\nLet's take a hypothetical dapper query returning a paged list of 25 results at 25MB/1000 requests.  A comparable tuned EF query will allocate about 150MB/1000 requests.  If you don't know how low allocations can be then you can't even ask a client how important is cloud hosting and performance and be able to suggest to them an appropriate solution according to their response.\n\nIf a client tells me that hosting cost isn't high on the list of concerns and they have a big team who needs to greenfields move fast, then sure I'll suggest a solution that fits accordingly, and that might very well be an ORM and SOLID, but it's not the first place I go without first assessing the requirements.\n\n>SOLID isn’t about making software fast. It’s about making software understandable, familiar, changeable, and survivable when more than one human touches it. And yes, for most web apps, it's optional. For long-lived systems with multiple contributors it's often cheaper than the alternative.\n\nThere is so much to unpack here. Every single letter in SOLID is theoretically a good idea but has plenty of cases where you wouldn't do it.\n\nAs an example, Single Responsibility - *Gather together the things that change for the same reasons*.  A controller typically has the full CRUD in it and no one bats an eye lid.  There's more than one reason you might need to change a controller that is full CRUD.  I'm not saying you should have a controller per verb but at the very entry to your backend you have a common violation of SOLID.  \n\nFor long lived systems it's possibly best NOT to use SOLID and DRY as your primary (and again it's not that you don't do the things in it sensibly, it's that you aren't making yourself *only* do that because it's awesome).  Most of the cost of an application happens during brownfields, you make an app in 6 months to 2 years and it lives in prod for 15.  SOLID very much has a top down view of the world, where it makes the most sense from your controller down not you have a bug in prod in PricingHelper line 65 what's causing this.  Written 8 years ago, used by a base service in a virtual method.  Right how do we change this, what happens when I change this, how are implementers using this, etc etc.",

It feels like a growing number of UI designers out there are completely oblivious to how their designs actually translate into working code, and it's making our jobs as developers unnecessarily complicated, frustrating, and often, just plain awful.\n\nI'm talking about designs that are ​overly complicated for no good reason: \n\nLayers upon layers of custom shapes, shadows, and gradients that serve no functional purpose other than to look \"unique\" but take hours or days to implement. Do we really need a custom SVG blob shape for every single background element that shifts position on scroll?\n\nA Nightmare to Maintain & Update: \n\nWhen every button or input field has a \"special\" padding or a slightly different hover effect, building a reusable component library becomes impossible. We end up with thousands of lines of redundant code just to hit \"pixel-perfect\" variations that no end-user will ever notice.\n\nIgnoring Basic Accessibility: \n\nLow contrast text, custom controls that don't have proper focus states, relying solely on color to convey information, or completely custom navigation elements that break screen readers. These aren't just minor annoyances; they actively exclude disabled users and create legal liabilities.\n\nPerformance Killers: Demanding five different custom fonts, massive unoptimized background images, or complex animations and sliders that bring even modern browsers to their knees.\n\n​It feels like many designers are operating in a vacuum, treating tools like Figma or Sketch as purely artistic canvases rather than blueprints for interactive experiences. \n\nMy request is that UI designers should be educated to acknowledge that every asset, every custom font, and every complex animation comes with a cost in terms of load time and user experience. They should be educated to design in a way that is easy to update, maintain, and scale without creating edge cases, while also ensuring accessibility.\n\n​I appreciate good design, truly. But good design, especially for the web, has to be buildable, maintainable, scalable, and accessible. It will save alot of time for both designers and developers. \n\nThere is a place for complex UI designs, but they should be limited to personal projects, fashion showcases, or award competitions, not commercial projects.",

Even the most basic web dev knowledge is not required for them to do their jobs. Teach them. That's how they become good at it.\n\nThe ones who are actually awful are the ones who just toss the design over the fence and don't care to learn or hear any pushback.

A clever flashy _centerpiece_ effect makes for a definitive moment, but as such it should be a one-off that should be rare enough to be able to be its own thing.\n\nI'd also suspect a case of not enough communication, collaboration, or mutual respect. I've just started a new position with a lot more design-side collaboration involved (the last one was dev on a years'-long running project so it was a lot more \"Keep doin' what you're doin'\" in that respect) and it's definitely worth going over designs in a two-way conversation so the developer can learn the designers \"language\"-- how things like priorities or subtle wants are encoded in mockups and other communications-- and so the designer can get more of an understanding for how a developer looks at a request, to sync up on language and understanding and to gain more of an idea of what's \"expensive\" and what's \"cheap\" so they're spending the developer's effort on the most effect.",

However, I'm also reading a lot of lack of understanding of a designers' role, which is ironically unempathetic. There are a few things in there that are failures of the design folks you're working with. Text contrast, relying solely on color for information are the most egregious that every designer should be taught. Those are basic a11y concerns.\n\nThe maintenance and update concerns are just a big an issue for designers as well. Modern design tools can work great with reusable components and symbols to keep elements consistent and usable within the design toolchain as well. However, designers aren't often given appropriate time to maintain their libraries, or even the ability to update designs as stakeholders have demanded changes to them.\n\nThat last bit is the part where you seem completely unaware. In the vast, vast majority of cases, designers are powerless to pushback on stakeholder demands. They ask the designers to just \"make it like this\" and point to some flashy personal project, fashion showcase, or award competition proof of concept that has zero need for scalability. They're the lowest paid person on your WebDev team, do you think they have the clout to push back when an exec says \"make the button bigger on this page\" or \"that text is too bright, it hurts my eyes\"? \n\nImagine trying to do your job, only execs across the company will want to meet and workshop every single variable name you use. Or asking you why you chose an if/else block instead of an inline ternary. That's the level of exec interference they have when creating these designs.\n\nAll of your complaints are valid, but many of them are where you're shooting the messenger. Find a way to sit in and push back and defend these principals during the design phase and you'll be able to help your designers create more buildable designs.",

This was already in place from other projects but is trival to do with github and Vercel (replace with any other similar tool)\n\nThe other week as an experiment I built a Community (Hackspace) management app with auth (jwt & RBAC & login & signup forms), equipment, bookings, file store and a load of other bells and whistles. \n\nIt did take me about 5-6 hours from start to a deployed MVP. None of the code was lying around but I used very common and well documented products that are battle tested in production along with a detailed spec document. Claude did not one shot it but I asked it to break it into tasks which and updated a task doc as it went along.\n\nSo yeah i reckon i could build a functional gmail clone in 5 hours.",

Just think about COVID, if someone told us before it happened that the world would shut down like that, we wouldn’t have believed it. Now it almost feels like it never happened.\n\n\nThere are two types of people: the ones who do the work, and the ones who just talk about it. Be the one who does the work. Learn as much as you can: frontend, backend, databases, networking, security, DevOps. Put in the time. Lock in those 10k hours. At this stage of your career, don’t rely on AI to do things for you. Use it as a tool, and do not let it do the thinking and coding, use it as a pair programmer or google on steroids.\n\nMy advice: pick a project and build it from scratch. Learn how to take an idea from zero to a real product. That skill is insanely valuable and will separate you from most people.\n\nLet LinkedIn influencers scream about how AI will replace everyone. Just keep grinding and become a genuinely good programmer. You won’t be out of a job. If anything, companies (and new companies) will need strong engineers to build and manage these systems. If you’re in that bucket, you’re golden. If not, yeah, you might lose your job, but that’s true in any field.\n\n\nThis has always happened. Accountants who used paper got replaced by accountants who use software. That’s normal. There’s a ton of hype right now and everyone is panicking.\n\n\nAlso, honestly, use LinkedIn only for job searching. Don’t get influenced by corporate bootlickers and constant yappers doom-posting for engagement.\n\n\nMost important: take care of your health. Don’t burn out. If you have your health, you can survive whatever comes next. Focus on the present.\n\n\nWishing you the best of luck.",

If you continue to keep learning, I think engineers are all going to be expected to know the full stack and probably dev ops too and really know system design and architecture as these tools let us build faster.\n\nCurrently it is just another abstraction, another high order language. There used to be a bunch of assembly language engineers and then C came out and other higher up the stack languages that offloaded a lot of work to the compiler to all SWE to work faster and teams good be smaller and more nimble. This is one of similar, apps will get bigger and more complex.\n\nThat being said if you are just relying AI to do everything and aren’t actually learning what it is doing and reviewing its code and can only do the very basics in terms of understanding what it is producing and do not care at learning more. Your days are probably numbered.\n\nIt’s very different times. Keep grinder and learning as much as you can.",

Engineers are slowly turning into PMs who just delegate to AI, and the AI becomes the “developer.”\n\nThat might work short term, but long term it’s going to cause real damage of weaker fundamentals, less problem-solving ability, and engineers who can’t function without the tool. \n\nAI should amplify skill, not replace it. 😉",

We're not the \"smart tech guys\" anymore, we're just a liability whose work can be made by anyone with chatgpt (it doesn't matter if it's not true, but perception matters a lot both socially and professionally).",

That way they can be mentored and have real human interaction. We aren't meant to be isolated all day. Work at home is great for seasoned pros, but for young people new in their careers it is a depressing and isolating.",

I’d feel such an immense sense of pressure every time that I didn’t even have time to learn because I was so stressed about losing my job and being homeless.

          "text": "Background: I'm 50. I've been coding since I was 14, and professionally since I was 20 (I never graduated because I left school early to jump into my first coding job). And I am *very* good at it. I'm autistic and have ADHD and I can hold a 30,000-line code base in my head and \"see\" it. I am not the best developer in the world - not even close. But there is a certain special thing that I do well, and at that thing, I'd bet I'm in the top 20.\n\nI'm not tooting my own horn here. I'm just framing the next thing I say: I felt like this **yesterday**. \n\nI've been running my own consulting business since 2007. 99% of my clients are so happy that I've actually gotten thank-you cards at project wrap-ups, and that makes me feel really good. But yesterday I had a client create a lot of trouble, saying bad things about my responsiveness (which is very good despite them not actually contracting for it), code quality (which was independently reviewed/audited, and they \"had nothing but good things to say...\"), and lack of focus (I focus when you pay me to focus, after that I'm reading whatever Andy Weir just published than you very much.)\n\nBut they pay, and I have a mortgage and five kids. So I say \"yes, sir, I understand. I'll work on that\" Who cares what they think of me personally? I know my value, my family knows my value, and nobody else's opinion matters.\n\nFor an industry that likes to think it is some kind of egalitarian meritocracy, software engineering might actually be the most toxic of them all in the end. We're surrounded by people that want a Porsche for the cost of a Kia, they want a 6-month project built in a week, AI tools are gnawing away at the edges and getting hungrier every day, employers lay off staff by the tens of thousands and hire with absolutely no commitment to employee growth or success... and that's just the start of the list.\n\nListen, old guy to young (person? I don't want to mis-gender you). What we do is **hard**. Full stop. It's hard. One of my favorite programming quotes is \"We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they would be easy.\" I personally think success in this space requires at least some base level of self-delusion or nobody would ever bother.\n\nI don't mean to be all doom-and-gloom here. Another quote I like is \"Bad roads lead to good stories.\" (I literally have that on my wall.) Do you want some advice? You should place exactly 0 value on what I'm about to say - I'm just some rando on Reddit commiserating with you. But I do believe this is true:\n\n1. You're fine.\n2. Many jobs suck, programming or otherwise. Stop thinking you're special. 😅\n3. You're going to have to put up with some bullshit.\n\nAt the end of the day, do you love programming in general? Not at your job... just in general. Are you passionate about it? \n\nThey don't pay us because we love what we do Monday morning. \"Get paid to do what you love\" is a fantasy. They pay us because we wouldn't work for them if they didn't. \n\nSo do what they say. Make money. Do your best. Then leave your job at the \"doorstep\" and in the evenings, focus on you, side projects you might care about, hobbies, passions, family, and everything else. They're all that count in this world.",

Next I'd try to not penalise yourself due to a lack of process on their behalf for code reviews. Whilst you may have limited influence on their processes in a junior role, you can reflect on your own work and you'll naturally improve and become less error prone over time.\n\nRegarding searching for everything, that's a normal part of the job that I don't think ever really goes away. I've been in my development role for nearly 7 years now and still look up even the basics sometimes as my memory fails me. AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot makes our work considerably easier these days and we'd be crazy not to take advantage of them too.\n\nYou're going through the process that I'd imagine all developers do (I certainly did). Keep at it and I hope you have someone senior at your work to reach out to when you need and I would recommend you do so when needed.

I wouldn't have gotten hired otherwise.

Maybe the team is too small for everyone to be reviewing everyone's code all the time, but it's totally in the interest of the team for everyone to be on the same page about best practices and catching bugs before they hit prod.\n\n\\- Don't take PR feedback personally. It can be hard, but separating the ego from a PR was helpful for me in terms of keeping my emotions and work separate. Easier said than done.\n\n\\- Ask clarifying questions and write down the answers. Keeping an organized set of notes for work has made things much easier\n\nSlightly different but super helpful:\n\n\\- Get out of the house. Go for a walk at lunch. Take a 5 minute break to open the window and breath real air. If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a step back for a sec.\n\n\\- Drink water and look away from your screen regularly. Look away from the screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes (ish)\n\n\\- Sleep a minimum of 7 hours and wake up a good bit before the workday starts so that your brain can properly defrost from sleep\n\nI know it can be hard, I've got my days.

If you don’t know what you’re doing? Ask someone. Don’t waste time, show people you want to do it right you just need some help. Ask for feedback. If you don’t think you did something right, or a PR is rejected or whatever talk to someone. Ask them to show you what’s wrong and come up with plan to avoid making that same mistake in the future.\n\nSpecifically for misunderstanding tasks, this something I do. Get a notebook write down what you think you need to do, make a sketch or whatever. Review that with the product owner or tech lead. Explain to them what you think needs to be done and let them correct you. Record the meeting, if you can, listen to it again. If you have more questions setup another meeting and go over them until you know exactly what needs to be done.\n\nCommunicate with your manager and team. Ask questions. Write it down.\n\nNo decent person wants you to have a breakdown at work. Most people will try to help you if you let it be known you need help.",

I've found I appear more professional and maintain better accuracy by over-documenting everything in my personal notes. I also have a horrible memory and I have to hide it by over-documenting. I think I also suffer from anxiety and although I can't legally recommend this, I've used OBS to record meetings out of anxiety for forgetting it's so bad. But ironically, just recording the meeting would help me be able to focus more and I could remember better, even if I didn't use the recording. Especially at the beginning your job should be to map out what is going on within the app so you feel less overwhelmed in the future or else the anxiety will keep stacking. Learning the app and the business jargon at each specific business is part of the process (and the stress) of a junior, but you want to avoid being the guy that asks the same questions every week and annoying the other devs. You should at the very least have a note taking app on your computer you're filling up or one at your desk. Even writing things down helps me process and remember things even if I don't read them later.\n\nAnd before someone downvotes me for recording, I was working somewhere where we would have 4-8 hour design meetings weekly with nothing whiteboarded and be expected to remember everything we talked about with no notes or design documents. I was working with people that apparently had no trouble remembering things compared to me, so I was desperate to be competent since it was expected to recall random things.",

          "text": "You're a junior in a role where you aren't getting a lot of support, and being fully remote means you don't have the same opportunities to learn by osmosis as you would in an office.\n\nOne thing you could try is taking a couple of hours to go over the ticket (and relevant bits of the UI and code base), making a more detailed plan of what you think you need to change and what order to tackle it in, and running that by your team lead or manager before you get stuck in.  Most web apps are glorified CRUD so you could probably make yourself a checklist of things to consider, i.e. do you need new forms on the front end and where do they go, what API routes are going to change, what data needs to be stored and where, and what changes do you need to make to existing functionality of the app?  Getting input at this stage means you're clearer about what needs to be delivered, and gives your lead a chance to steer you in the right direction if you're a bit off course.\n\nAnother great practice for juniors is to spend a bit of time each day going through the pull requests that more senior devs are raising.  I have 17yoe and I love to do this when I'm new to a codebase, because it gives me an idea of how different bits of the system hang together, and what the team's agreed conventions are for how they write code.  Try to pick out one thing you've learned from each PR - it could be about the product, about the structure of the system you're working on, or a language or library feature you weren't aware of.\n\nThe lack of review and feedback is not ideal.  However, if you were doing really, really badly then somebody probably would've had a big picture discussion about that with you by now.  This is a job that involves a lot of learning by trial and error (lots and lots and lots of error).  Those \"bad results\" you're getting are learning opportunities - unless you're causing catastrophic production outages, you don't need to beat yourself up about them, just spend a bit of time reflecting on the lessons and deciding what you'll do differently next time.  (and if you are causing catastrophic production outages, the fault for that is at least 90% with whoever put a junior in the position to do that!)",

Most startups are _meant_ to move fast and break things, and this means all hands on deck and focused on tasks, not other team members. They just don’t have the overhead to properly mentor you.\n\nOn the other hand, as a junior _you need mentoring._ You are clearly seeing the cracks you are falling through, and are becoming stressed through this lack of support. This is _quite literally_ traumatizing you, and you desperately need help before it negatively affects your career arc.\n\nWithout more background on the company’s part, I see the company as possibly doing one of two things:\n\n1. They understand this lack of mentorship, and are cutting you a lot of slack in response. You can and will be allowed to fail a lot.\n2. They just don’t care about your lack of skills, as you are just another warm body to throw at the problem set.\n\nThere is a third possibility in that they do fully expect you to succeed under your own grit and effort, totally without mentorship, but this is an exceedingly unrealistic ask of you, and just highlights a toxic work environment that you should bail on ASAP.\n\nIf № 1, try and reach out to senior or even intermediate devs above you, and see if they are willing to help you. Many techs are neurodivergent in that they love to explain things, so this could be a positive for both of you. The key thing here is to build easy communication channels with other co-workers, generate good relationships, and never hesitate to poke any of them if/when you run into what appears to be a developing issue.\n\nIf № 2, you need to not take failure so personally. This will be the most difficult lesson you will ever learn, because so much of people’s egos ride on doing things right and succeeding at tasks. But being able to face failure and learn from it is what makes for success in a lot of careers, including things like Sales.\n\nHell, failure in sales is baked into the pie, as you _want_ to fail customers as fast as possible, to separate the wheat (those who are genuinely interested and ready to buy) from the chaff (those who are just kicking tires). It’s called fail-fast. Chasing after customers who are not immediately enthusiastic is a great way to waste time in sales, and _good_ salespeople build up a small stable of questions that allow them to quickly filter the people they come across so they can ignore those that will never become customers.",

Some things that helped me:\n\n**Planning prevents refactoring**: When you're about to start a feature, spend 15 minutes sketching out the component interfaces, what needs to be configurable, and where things might change. Not a full design doc, just enough to catch the decisions that will paint you into a corner. Refactoring is 10x more expensive than thinking through the structure upfront.\n\n**Small commits**: Break work into the smallest possible pieces. Instead of \"add authentication,\" commit \"add login form UI,\" then \"add API integration,\" then \"add session persistence.\" When something breaks, you know exactly which 20 lines caused it.\n\n**Debugger > console.log**: Learn your debugger (Chrome DevTools, VS Code debugger, whatever). Step through code line by line. Watch variables change. It's slower at first but teaches you *why* code behaves the way it does, not just *what* it's doing.\n\n**Ask for architecture review early**: Before writing code, describe your approach to a senior dev. \"I'm planning to store user state in Redux, fetch on mount, and cache for 5 minutes.\" Get feedback when it's cheap to change direction.\n\nThe breakdowns get less frequent as you build pattern recognition.

All that has me in a lot of stress and anxiety because it's constant. Is there any way to deal with it? Am I unreasonable and they right? ",

As time goes by, you will be able to smell all the red flags along with the signs of a good company. \n\nFor example, if you go to a company, and they have a pile of meeting rooms, and the meeting rooms have touch screens on the door to manage booking them, you are looking a company run by micromanaging fools. They will get you working evenings and weekends, because their micromanagment results in brutally low efficiency.\n\nBoomers everywhere. That is a near sure sign there's a problem\n\nComplex org charts in small companies, bad. \n\nComplex ranking systems such as programmers having P1, P2, P10, etc ranking means you will spend more time on backroom politics to get promoted, as merit goes out the window in those places. Complex ranking companies usually have treehouses; you are in the club, or outside. Those inside get the plum assignments and rapid promotions.\n\nOld tech, bad.

Get out a really good static analysis tool. Coverity is one I've used for this very battle. \n\nRun this fool's code through it. All his \"Perfection\" is BS. You can't do good work after all those hours. Assuming it is language like C++, find the buffer overflow errors, the off by one, the threading errors. And write a pile of integration tests which poke holes in your software. Big dangerous holes. Security breaches, data loss, things which would give your company's lawyers nightmares. \n\nThen, do a presentation showing his crap is dangerous and a huge negligence lawsuit waiting to happen. Say, that you are greatly concerned that it is a result of overwork and loss of focus; and that you don't want to have blood on your hands.\n\nYou will land a brutally satisfying blow, but make sure you have your new job lined up and have accepted their offer. You might be a momentary hero to some of the executive, but this fool will use his years of political capital to take you down hard. You could even use the \"Blood on your hands\" as the rational for quitting during that very meeting. Mic Drop.",

Even if you make this thing stand out and guide people right to it perfectly, you'll still probably only see about 10% conversion rate within the same time frame\n\nI mean, double the sales is still insane. But don't expect quintouple the sales.\n\nThen once that works you get another issue, there will be another choke point that converts the most users... Back to the drawing board.\n\nThis is why everyone says to make a new user walkthrough. Show everyone all the best features and how to access them right off the bat. The next trickiest part is making sure that stuff is as easy as it can be to access, otherwise you'll convert a ton but then have users dropping like flies when they get frustrated and during that time your support staff will be dying from floods of emails and calls.\n\nThen again, it could be that this feature is what 90% of users are looking for in your app and when they don't find it right away they go to the next competitor in line instead.",

They convert because they are interested, and they discover the action because they are interested. The two events have the same cause - the action is not itself causing an \"aha\" moment.\n\nSo do the experiment - make the path to that action easier in your UX.

Not people who developed things with AI but doesn't understand the architecture behind it”** \\- - - -\n\nEDIT: Proof that they said what they \\*now claim\\* they never said ([https://imgur.com/a/YdSN0Ve](https://imgur.com/a/YdSN0Ve))\n\n*That description sounds closer to the expectations  for a mid-level developer, right?*\n\nSo I’m curious, beyond the obvious reasons, what is actually preventing employers like u/UseApart2127 from hiring mid-level developers at mid-level compensation instead of expecting that level of expertise from junior candidates?\n\nWe’d all be curious to know.",

Yes, AI has made the whole problem worse, because it's so much easier for anyone to create code, even if they have no idea what they're doing. At least back before AI, a junior would need to have _some_ idea about what they were copy/pasting.\n\nAnother issue is that pipelines and tooling have gotten more complicated now. Back in the day, a junior could knock up some HTML with jQuery pretty easily, and push it via FTP. Now there's all kinds of frameworks and libraries with their own complexities, dozens of build tools, and even JS has many extra features which just never existed before.\n\nThe last part is that now managers and team leads _expect_ more and more from developers. If a junior _isn't_ using AI to produce their code, they will be left behind those who do. This further compounds the issue that the juniors are producing things that they don't understand.\n\nI don't think training is much of an issue. I don't recall any kind of training ever happening back in my career, beyond the very rare mandatory things pushed by HR. Now, I'm not saying that training _wouldn't_ help in this new AI era, but in a world where management are using AI to _reduce_ costs, I think this is not likely to happen.\n\nWhen the AI bubble bursts (and it will) then _maybe_ the bad management will finally lower their expectations to a reasonable level. However, I think we will have a gap of experience amongst devs in a year or so.",

No.  If you are not professionally competent in a discipline, you should not expect people to pay you and tolerate your mistakes until you learn.   That's not how apprenticeship works.  The first month on the job as an electrician's apprentice you're basically just sweeping floors - because that's all you're competent to do.  You're not an electrician, you should not expect to get an electrician's job or pay. Same with development.\n\non the hiring side: that you deserve mid-level competence/performance from someone who you pay entry-level wages.  It's not wrong to hire an entry-level worker, but you need to be very realistic about what the extent of their competence is.  The reality is, most jr devs are only actually capable of building a react component, using some sort of pre-built css framework to style it, and managing the local state of that component.  It's ok to expect a jr to be professionally competent at that.  It's not ok to pretend that they should be more competent.",

They come in with impressive portfolios full of complex apps and clean code. Then you ask them technical questions about their projects and they have no idea how to explain it.\n\nThe problem is people are learning to prompt instead of learning to code. They can generate entire applications but can't debug simple issues. Had one candidate who built this impressive demo. Asked him to explain how one basic feature worked. He literally said \"I'm not sure, Claude handled that part.\"\n\nI'm not against AI tools. Our whole team uses them. But there's a difference between using AI to move faster and using it to skip understanding. If you can't debug when AI gives you broken code or understand what's actually happening, you're not a developer. You're just someone who copies and pastes.",

The Web Audio API is surprisingly capable but React's rendering cycle can fight you hard when you need sample-accurate timing. Cool that you went with a backend exe approach though, that sidesteps a lot of the browser audio limitations. If you haven't already, look into AudioWorklet for the real-time processing parts since it runs on a separate thread and won't get blocked by UI updates.",

Can you cut them at 0? Can you snap to the time sig of the grid? Turn off snapping? Does it support a midi view? Where is the master? I already know this shit is going to suck without multithreading from web workers.   \n  \nLooks like a heavily unfinished POC. Where is the mixer? Where is the VSTs? Crazy how much work I put into my JavaScript DAW compared to this. I spent almost 4 months of my life on it before I showed anyone. Mine is multithreaded with web workers for VST effects it's gloriously performant. And it's all responsive design for all devices. I guess some people don't really use DAWs day to day, more of a toy to them. It's like someone saying they made photoshop but it's just basic paint and it has 1/16th of the features.\n\ncompile exe so it runs independently on the web? DAW doesn't work for pure clientside unless you provide no save state for the user or if that save state is based on files you have saved in the apps backend. The user can be prompted each time to upload samples but won't be able to save the map of those samples on their device due to CORS policy violation. That's why you need node/backend to write to files and search the users computer, allow the user to save the project with their own files on their system directories. You can already put this on the internet, learn how a backend works. If you want backend power you need a backend. That's how the internet works. An .exe implies an executable aka they install it locally to their device which isn't independently on the internet or how any of this works.\n\nI'm going to tell you right now you haven't even started to work on anything complicated in a \"daw' until you actually start building the daw out and have overlapping systems. Wait until you actually have a full song with dozens of tracks, several plugins for each track and buses/master and then run into differences in volumes during the serialization process where the math is all correct and LLMs don't have a clue what to do because the code technically isn't wrong. And is your ear trained enough to handle those hyper-small differences in audio to ensure things are actually working? I don't trust audio programs from people who aren't into audio. It's like trusting a vibe coder with security infrastructure. I already know things won't be to industry standards.",

I used an audio tuner to make sure the audio itself is accurate.\n\nThe DAW supports VSTs (VST3 specifically) as well as SF2s. I guess I should have made it more visible in UI, which I have edited since then, to include a full add instrument dialogue.\n\nWhat I meant by backend exe is basically a C++/JUCE backend which handles the audio playing and processing. None of that is done by the electron/node frontend. I assume we can compile that code so that node can run it directly using WASM?\n\nApart from that, currently it can handle multiple tracks and multiple VSTs instrument plugins, but I need to test the limit of my current code, as I have yet to add VST Effect plugin support.",

Just because it's beginner friendly doesn't excuse capacity of producing a complete song, since a lot of successful artists made complete songs in GarageBand, some even blew up and signed major deals while doing that. \n\nObviously most people transition into other DAWs, majority to FL simply because the devs made the whole experience \"video game\" friendly. \n\nI guess what im saying is I'd suggest a different approach, a simple mixer would help a lot of content creators today and you could sell it for 5$/mo or something.

No npm, no webpack, no nothing.\n\nObviously not for production apps (use React/Vue for that), \nbut for quick demos, prototypes, or learning - it's been useful for me.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/KTBsomen/httl-s\n\nDocs: https://ktbsomen.github.io/httl-s/\n\nWould love to hear if something like this is useful to anyone.",

You can’t just render thousands or millions of messages into the DOM without things falling apart.\n\nThe idea is to avoid keeping everything mounted, paginate and load messages in chunks, support jump-to-message and search, and still let users navigate back to any point in the conversation without crashing the page. Right now, it’s intentionally simple and just generates HTML, but the near-term goal is to make it solid for long-running chat histories.\n\nI haven’t published formal benchmarks yet, but I’ve been testing it with large message lists and watching memory/DOM behavior closely. That’s the problem space I’m trying to solve.",
