Even at 500k MAU users, I am looking at (estimated) a bill of less than $500/month. Even if I've miscalculated, we're still talking same order of magnitude, less than $1000.\n\nNow granted I only built out THIS level of infra because the MVP went very well by my metrics and the product depends on some amount of scale for success, but you don't need even this much infra for an MVP, will pay less even than $180/month (I started at like $40/month), and be able to handle a non-trivial amount of users.\n\nVercel would almost assuredly be charging 10s of thousands for 500k MAU.\n\nLearn infra, learn how to scale infra, choose cheap good hosting, and cost increases are much smaller and linear\n\nGranted, that has non-trivial cost - I have 15 years of experience programming exactly as of this month and I have worked on several major infra projects in the past, and it takes months of learning to pick it up really well. But if you're aiming for capital efficiency (which many startups aren't, but I was), it's a great skill to have.\n\nA boostrapper who can do infra can do their entire platform vastly cheaper than a bootstrapper who cannot, if it gains traction.",

Spend some time setting it up, deal with a few hurdles and ongoing maintenance, and you get extremely cheap operations with almost no cost difference between normal traffic and traffic spikes.\n\nRight now you are paying for your own limitations. That is the tradeoff. You have to weigh the pros and cons. From the outside, it looks like you are hitting the tipping point where managed serverless stops making sense.\n\nIf you are locked into the stack, getting back on your own feet will be painful. But that is the price of an easy start.\n\nYou just blocked one fair bot with robots.txt, but there are millions of unfair bots crawling the web that will slowly and surely drain your wallet. I did my own traffic analysis and found that more than 95% of all traffic on my sites is bots (so take your stats with grain of salt too). Half of them advertise themselves openly, and the rest are cleverly hidden. Official analytics tools report completely different numbers because they simply cannot detect most bot traffic. When I look at them, it feels like huge crowds are visiting my site, but the reality is very different. I had to analyze logs manually, and the true numbers shocked me.\n\nThe good news is I am fully self-sufficient, so I do not care if bots crawl my sites. I actually welcome it because it costs me nothing. It just uses otherwise idle resources on my servers that I would be paying for anyway.\n\nPractical advice: if you want to run your service long-term at low cost, use your own servers. I use Hetzner - this is not an ad, just my experience - and there are many competitors that are equally good or better, so do your research. Meanwhile, put your site behind Cloudflare free tier and enable their anti-bot protection. As someone who scrapes frequently, Cloudflare can be difficult to trick so I can recommend you this service to tame your bot problem and save costs.",

This significantly increased both processing costs and scraping time.\n\nSo yes, when I said it is \"difficult to trick,\" I didn’t mean impossible. It just makes low-effort, fast, and cheap approaches less practical, which is enough to achieve effective bot protection for the purposes of the OP.\n\nBut I agree, if you really care about every bot, for example if your site provides valuable data or your data points are rare and worth the scrapper's extra effort, then Cloudflare alone will not be enough - contrary it will stand in your way as it creates extra layer between you and bot that makes your traps more difficult to implement. In that case, a dedicated service or more advanced anti-bot solution makes sense. Scrapers have become extremely sophisticated. Cloudflare can block the script kiddies and average scrapers, but there is still a significant number of skilled operators who will find ways around basic protections, and those are the ones you need to plan for.\n\nBut in this case OP is worried about mass traffic - common scrappers so my advice stands.",

Seeing how the dynamic data on these pages should be fairly static you could use a fairly long cache or chose to keep it there until invalidated by busting the cache when that set of specific data is updated.\n\nThat’s 30k urls you can cache and any request made to a url that is not valid should not trigger a function. The fact these bots could trigger 29M requests from urls that are already generated tells me its very likely your app is just sensing a request to the function to see if there is something there with the query parameters given, rather than actually validating if the requested parameters are even valid.\n\nIf thats not the case you’re serving up those 30k urls fresh each and every single time which means your caching strategy is insufficient.\n\nIf your other end points are serving up any response that comes from a cloud function even when the url has no business in existing then you need much better validation logic.",

          "text": "Beyond robots.txt, here are some additional mitigations:\n\n**Rate limiting at the edge** - Cloudflare, Fastly, or even Vercel's middleware can rate-limit by user agent before hitting your functions. Set aggressive limits for known crawlers.\n\n**Crawler-specific caching headers** - Return `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` for requests from known bot user agents. Many well-behaved crawlers honor these.\n\n**Static pre-rendering for bot traffic** - Detect crawler UA in middleware, serve a static/cached version. Your dynamic SSR is wasted on scrapers anyway.\n\n**Challenge suspicious traffic** - JS challenges filter out crawlers that can't execute JavaScript (most of them).\n\nThe real issue is that serverless pricing assumes human traffic patterns. Crawler traffic is fundamentally different - high volume, low value, no sessions. The defaults punish you for being indexable.\n\nFor ISR specifically: the revalidate period only helps if the *same URL* is hit multiple times within the window. Crawlers hitting unique listing slugs bypass ISR entirely since each URL is a cache miss.\n\nConsider generating a sitemap with your actual important pages and blocking crawlers from deep pagination. Meta doesn't need to index 30M listing variations.",

Now I see some of my core ideas being used in slop around the web (including reddit).\n\nI've even seen this in the context of a reddit thread, where bots will reuse other people's comments from the same thread. If you post a link, they'll read the link and use the contents of the link in their reply.\n\nIn the case of software, there's so much slop being generated that even if you solve something in the most amazing way, almost nobody will know, because a billion other people are already trying to make money off of built-this-with-ai code they don't even understand, which claims to solve the same issue you're solving. Why should anyone listen to you specifically?\n\nOn top of that many companies run massive astro-turfing campaigns which prey on our proclivity to trust others.\n\nIt gets worse...\n\nEvery company out there is trying to capture as much search engine traffic as possible, so they're churning out articles on all topics, and many of them have very high domain authority, so they will bury any indie developer that does actual writing and research. His stuff will be on page 100.\n\nThose new to the game do the same thing, so they can get some visibility.\n\nAll of this is littering the web with second-hand information that is often altered to serve the agenda of the new publisher, and even if once in a while we get an article that aggregates all the right information, they're a net negative and a burden on everyone. The worst thing is that it demotivates anyone who might want to share some original thoughts.\n\nHow do we get out of this? I've been thinking about it for quite some time now and short of drawing blood every time you want to go online, I don't know what would work.\n\nIs this the end of the information era?",

It must be a distributed, decentralized source of identity that can remain anonymous yet still be proven to resolve to a real person, like a zero knowledge proof of identity. \n\nAnd there must be some method to unveil the actual identity when necessary, so that people can share controversial, embarrassing, or otherwise revealing information with limited risk, but resolution of human identity is prevented without either just cause or the individual volunteering the data. \n\nLike a Byzantine Generals problem, if enough people agree that anonymity must be resolved to a real person, there needs to be a method for that. Like a digital form of a court ruling. \n\nI propose a new approach where the production of currency is tied to a verified distinct living person (\"proof of life\"), and all interactions are monetized against the proof-of-life derived currency. All new currency production is distributed across the register of known real living persons. \n\nNot \"monetized\" in the sense that they are oppressively costly and some intermediary is making some incredible profit by gating access, but \"monetized\" in the sense that running a horde of bots is prohibitively expensive, while acting as a unique real person has a real but valid and manageable cost attached that can be paid against the distributed currency. \n\nThis answer leaves out more than it explains, but it's the only one I've come up with that seems capable of actively preventing bot hordes, supporting real humans, without preventing real humans to use bots/automation in a rational and productive manner. \n\nI could go on at length but this answer is, in my experience, more than sufficient for vast numbers of people to immediately hate me, so I'll stop here unless someone requests detail.",

The new challenge, then, is not to pull in information fast, it's to figure out which parts of that information are actually useful, i.e., digging up the valuable stuff from a heap of dogshit.\n\nThat's what the \"information era\" is like. The pioneers of the information age envisioned that just being able to exchange information fast and efficiently would solve all problems, and it kind of did, but they did not anticipate the consequences of being able to send arbitrary amounts of arbitrary information out into the world at practically no cost.",

In 2016 these things were still years from entering public awareness, couldn't even attempt to generate an image or walk outside a lab.\n\nIf that rate of progress is typical of what we can expect going forward then its going to improve in abilities in the same way computers did from the 80s until about the 2010s. What now requires a data centre will become the kind of chip that is causally thrown into any device thats far beyond the abilities of any modern model by 2040, 2050.\n\nWhile I don't think jobs are under immediate direct threat, I also don't think the technology needs to improve impossibly far to get into that situation. If you can show it an arbitrary role and just expect high quality reliable results, what is left for Human employment? \n\nEvery existing team can be reduced to a single human lead being actively and intelligently prompted through their high level requirements and reading reports. Even accounting for massive expansion of activity I would still expect Human employment to fall far below 50%, maybe even 20% - its a generic solution that seems to apply everywhere once the models improve and to any activity you come up with keep people employed.",

Biological devs increasingly acting like tech leads to digital devs. Understanding requirements; interacting with project managers/stakeholders; going to meetings; writing prompts; testing; code reviews; feedback; the occasional manual intervention. And it might take AI a decade to reach the next phase after that. Which I imagine to be completely autonomously and reliably working to specifications with no code review necessary. \n\nIf that happens, then the best path for devs gets a bit murky. I think a sideways move towards analysing business problems and specifying solutions might be one way... for a bit. In 10 years AI might be able to autonomously meet with people, read documents, observe a workplace and fully handle that by then. A full robo business analyst digital director. That can identify the entire gamut of a business and by itself manage construction of all the systems required to support it. Which would pretty much make digital agencies obsolete.\n\nBut when you extrapolate that idea, if you can get to that point exactly how many of the rest of the employees in companies are required? If you work in an office in any capacity your years may be numbered. And if you work with your hands? Better keep one eye on the robots.",

For effective use, this means learning effective patterns and prompts, getting your own pace and review cadence right, and who knows what else eventually - it’s a learned skill. It’s a learned skill ON TOP OF the existing skills, sure you’re writing less code, but to use it effectively you need to read and understand the same amount of (or even more) code as before.\n\nFor some low hanging fruit it can do a pretty good job with minimal intervention, but for most real design/engineering/analysis tasks you really need all those foundational skills _and_ the practice at using AI to complement your conventional skills.\n\nSo I think there’s a very real threat to juniors employment, because it’s hard to justify another salary on basic grindy tasks that we can ask AI to do, but I do think most established software guys will actually be _more_ valuable if you learn the new tools effectively.

          "text": "Hey hey breathe. I understand your fear, and you'll be ok.\n\nFirst of all, your career isn't over, it's shifting. I can talk calmly because I've been around enough in the industry to have FU money, but also because I've already gone through some (smaller scope) transitions that made me think the same thing only realize it wasn't. Believe it or not even in the early 2000s, you still were expected to buy books, but by 2010 it was all the internet. If you were lucky enough to be in college during this transition you'd get it. But if you had already begun your career you suddenly had to learn some skills halfway through. Imagine being a developer in the late 90s, who realizes now everything is going to be on the web, and that they have to learn this html thing. Then you pivot and the whole thin crashes, then not even a decade later people are now making entire programs like web-clients, or office-suites in this html/javascript world! What insanity to transition your skills.\n\nSo what you'll find out is that there's a big key part of what you do, of what you've learned, that is still critical, and it was useful 20 years ago too. And those are the most important skills, the ones that actually matter and make you valuable. The skills that set you apart as a senior over a mid are still just as valuable. The skills that make a junior be amazing, or a mid be solid are changing dramatically, but the things that set you aside as a senior are there.\n\nIt's scary because you have to relearn the other skills. And maybe this is triggering your impostor syndrome: you still see yourself as a code monkey and not realize you are a problem solver.\n\nYour career is changing, as it always was, and right now we are seeing one of those breakneck changes we always talk about but rarely see (these are things that happen every 20 years or so after all). You are using the tools, and exploring them, and you know the old ways too, you'll be fine. And it's ok to feel anxious, that fear there is valid: it's telling you \"we can't take life for granted, we have to take it by the horns\" and yes: this is a moment to take it by the horns.\n\nAnd maybe you'll come out the other side realizing that this career just isn't doing it for you. There's a reason so many software developers [become geese farmers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1jgcfx9/peakprogrammercareertrajectory/), this career changes so much that people realize they want to do something else, and then they do. You don't need to be able to retire to pivot your career.\n\nSo it's fine to feel scared, it's fine to be a bit anxious. This is driving you to face questions you need to ask yourself, to find the path that will make you happy. But don't feel dread: for the tides may only obey the will of the moon, but we little fish can just swim against the current if we want to. It may be lunacy, but it's your choice what to do about it. You have your eyes more open than most, hell maybe even more than me tbh.\n\nAnd remember this: if you lose your job, it isn't your value. You aren't your job. Your job is something that you do to let you do what you actually want. It's yak shaving in the big scheme of life. Trust me, you'll find out that you are, before anything else, a survivor, and you and I will come out the other side, not broken but changed and transformed, different (wo)men (for it's not the same river and all that malarkey) and it'll be a challenge and a struggle, but that's what gives us something to do.",

I've been in projects where using AI accelerated the project, and projects where AI actually slowed down the development time and we had to fix and clean up so much garbage code. Long slow paths are sometimes the way to go to make sure the code is well written, and you can use AI to assist of course. I'm not anti-AI, I use it too.\n\nAs I said, it's just a tool at the end of day. If you write a prompt, press Enter, check the end result and call it a day, then you are in for big surprises.

I feel terrible for people graduating college right now. \n\nBut OP it sounds like you’ll be one of the lucky ones who’s in a good spot with all this. I pray that I am too. The worst thing any of us in this subreddit can do is bury our heads in the sand and pretend Claude and the other AI tools will go away. Sadly I see so may in comments choosing this path.

The fact you’re barely writing code while still employed means your role has already fundamentally shifted whether your company acknowledges it or not.\n\nThe value proposition isn’t coding anymore, it’s knowing what to build, why it matters, how it fits user needs, and whether the AI output is actually good. If you can’t articulate why you’re valuable beyond code generation, then yeah, your anxiety is justified. Product sense, architecture decisions, and stakeholder management are harder to automate than implementation.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is some frontend roles will disappear, especially junior positions focused on translating designs to code. Your survival depends on moving up the value chain into product thinking, technical leadership, or specializations AI struggles with like performance optimization or accessibility. Loving UI creation doesn’t matter if AI does it faster and cheaper.

And yet, I could not help to notice that the work they produced felt very formulaic and predictable. Every time period had their \"it\" theme that everyone imitated. I made a few not very good ones myself as well.\n\nPerhaps, an average UI designer doesn't really know enough about his profession to be AI-proof. Saying you only do UI design feels very narrow. How can one make good UI, if they don't consider UX and conversion performance feedback from actually deployed and maintained products? How many designers actually think about the purpose of the design of their product? It is to satisfy the customer and to make a sale, a conversion, whatever the person hiring you expected. How many of you take enough time to even understand the product and company you are making a design for? Not many, hence the AI scare.\n\nOften these tasks are not covered by the same person and the UI-only person is kind of flying in the dark. What most of you do is you go to dribbble and then rip off one or parts of several existing popular themes and adapt it slightly to the branding and niche of your customer. And that is most certainly something even an average AI can do.\n\nThe more analytical and the less generic copy paste UI patterns your work flow is, the more AI-proof you'll be. Quoting me 5k for a theme that exactly looks like 50 others on dribble is simply not gonna fly anymore. If AI actually gets good at most tasks one day, well then it will all be a race to the bottom and it will completely reshuffle who ends up with the fruits of the labor.

AI is here, it’s powerful, and it’s going to stick around whether we like it or not. \n\nOne thing I try to remind myself of to prevent me from doom spiraling is that while yes, our jobs are changing, there’s still a large part of being an engineer/developer that isn’t writing code. Claude is an incredible tool for codegen, and there’s not arguing that. The primitives of development are no longer typing syntax into an editor, it’s now describing expected outcomes to an LLM. \n\nI see this as a positive, as I get a lot of my energy back that would be spent on keystrokes of syntactical sugar trivia of a language. I get to solutions faster, and get to focus more on the design and architecture of a problem I’m trying solve rather than spending an hour perfecting a piece of code. I know what I want the code to feel like when I’m working in it, and now we have a fast pass to get there, though with a bit of hand holding.\n\nAnd also, never forget that LLMs don’t own outcomes. As the engineer in the room, you do. So when shit inevitably hits the fan in production, a critical business system starts throwing a fit, or you have to shoehorn in some contractually obligated feature into an ancient legacy application that still runs the business, that’s going to be on us developers. There’s always going to need to be an adult in the room (for now), and that’s where I see the dev role shifting. Wielders of AI to make computers do things faster than before.",

Built out some popular software and services and end users rave about it but some devs and security researchers have been looking through the actual code and finding various security flaws (XSS and another was requiring tokens with far more permissions than necessary such as write access to your github when only read was required).\n\nThere's plenty of vibe coded stuff both in apps and libraries popping up, some are skilled and experienced dev backgrounds but they're prioritising velocity over safety (_some have NIH syndrome and vibe their own security solutions instead of using the ecosystem, and then market it like it's trustworthy?_).\n\nIf anything gives me anxiety it's the consequences of all these concerns, there's just so much activity / noise and hype that I guess it's going to require some serious widespread grief for people to take more caution of the shiny perks from AI accelerated dev 😒\n\nI know that for me personally I have to be much more careful in software / apps I'd choose to use and that's even more so for the Web when a service pops up. Human error with bugs and vulnerabilities was totally a thing in the past, but often there was more expertise involved to minimise that, or the quality of a service on the surface would give pause.\n\nIt's the lower barrier to entry and speed to come off as confidently convincing that's a worry, the scale and skills to build like that required a fair amount of investment to pull off.

If I use AI to build something cool.. a product that is software, ideally a tool used by other developers/etc, but they are all disappearing.. how exactly am I going to get my own product sold? I asked AI this question.. and the answer was that AI would consume my product.. e.g. a GUI app somehow AI will become the \"user\" consuming the GUI. Clearly it would be API and not GUI.. and I hope that my GUI app will remain relevant for a few more years for end users to use.. but if AI is really replacing a lot of the \"customers\" that my app would be used by.. then that means my app is no longer relevant even though there is almost nothing like it now anyway. \n\nSo.. do APIs become the primary way apps are built in the near future.. so AI can consume them? I mean.. YES.. I know it is to some degree.. but I do wonder if the majority of us that use software products.. like HR apps, desktop apps of various types, etc.. as we disappear from the work force, will things shift to mostly APIs that AI uses and the desktop/web app disappears? \n\nAm I wasting my time with about a year or so out for my product launch (trying to get there sooner of course).. unsure if AI will advance THAT fast that the majority of those that would use my product for many years to come will lose jobs too and make my offering irrelevant?",

The end result is always that the customers are unhappy with the result and that you either throw it away and replace it with proper software after some years (best case), or that you try to fix the broken mess and spend way, way more time and money than doing it right initially would've cost while also having a bad product for the end user for many years.",

          "text": "I’d note a few things about vibe coding people don’t really talk about. \n\nNew vibe coders on average produce better results than new engineers. New engineer code quality has always been a dumpster fire at times. Vibe coding being better, even if just a little, has pretty substantial impact on the industry. \n\nA second issue is people ignore is that vibe coders can learn, just like new engineers can learn. They learn what works and what doesn’t. This creates a vibe coder that becomes fully capable of developing full applications that scale well and have good security. \n\nThe primary issue with vibe coders from my experience is that it can be hard to distinguish the ones that learn from the ones that don’t if you’re looking at resumes and portfolios. A non-engineer can never tell the difference. But an engineer sitting down and talking to these people, you can quickly discern the ones that learn and the ones that don’t. \n\nBut at the end of the day, people prefer results. If it costs you $5 for a website that works fine for 3 years then runs into issues, so you spend $5 again in 3 years for a new one, that’s a better deal to people than spending $2000+ for someone to make one today that won’t have that issue later. Then again, it’s worse if you spend that money and the rookie engineer manually programmed the same issue anyway.\n\nThat’s my main issue with the vibe coding criticism I see. The issues vibe coders run into are less frequent, and less problematic, than the issues I tend to see nearly all lower level engineers I’ve worked with. And, unfortunately, the vast majority of freelancer engineers I’ve met (certainly not all) I’d consider far less experienced than the average engineer I meet working at a bigger company. \n\nI also see people around here sometimes treat vibe coder products like something being made to handle 100 million active users when in reality, most people just want a small website / app for like <1000 users, so “scalable” is the farthest thing from a concern these companies would have. A lot of people around here imply that aggressive over engineering is the right path forward when it’s not.",

              "text": "Well, the biggest difference between vibe coders and new real devs is that when a vibe coder runs into a problem or an error they don’t understand and can’t get AI to fix they have no idea what to do and get completely stuck. \n\nBut developers, even fresh ones already know a lot of information they can use to work the problem. They also know how to search for answers, and have even some idea if a potential answer they found is right or wrong.\n\nVibe coders fixing bugs and problems have to rely purely on hope and prayers that their beloved machine god fixes their mess. That just doesn’t sound very efficient to me.\n\nSo even though a vibe coder could of course learn and become a better developer, they most likely just won’t even try to. Like that’s the point of vibe coders, right? They don’t want to learn programming and become actually knowledgeable devs, although they most certainly could if they wanted to.",

A CEO isn’t about to become a vibe coder, but they’ll vibe code themselves something and struggle along the way. A vibe coder, on the other hand, does experience issues like other engineers, but they actually try to resolve it using google, AI chatbots, reach out to engineers, etc. for guidance on the issues.

Sometimes the best code or design idea comes in a few minutes of deep focus, not hours of surface-level busy work.\n* Context switching kills productivity. When you’re in flow, you can solve problems holistically. Breaking that for meetings, notifications, or tickets fragments your thinking and increases bugs later.\n* Outcome > motions. If your “vibe” sprint produces clear deliverables or insights that move the project, it’s not slack , it’s efficient cognitive work.\n\nThat said, flow without alignment or measurable outcomes can be just distraction. The real art is creating spaces where teams can enter that state toward a clear, shared goal.\n\nTo the community:\n\n* How do you balance deep focus time with team coordination and accountability?\n* Do you measure productivity by output or by outcome?\n* At what point does “vibe coding” stop being productive and start being avoidance?\n\nWould love to hear how others define that boundary in real projects.",

That's where the value in the kind of service that our kind of shop provides is; sit down with the client, ask questions, offer your own ideas, come up with detail in solutions etc.. If your spec is little more than \"build an AI agent and a website\" then the possible outcomes are almost endless. A tight specification before starting any dev project is essential and one of my concerns about the people using AI (which includes non-developers now finding them in a position to be able to \"code\") is that without understanding how to scope a project, the output is never going to be great. It really is a case of shit in, shit out.\n\nI'm enjoying reading the experiences of dev teams who include vibe coders...",

You would never walk into a place and learn to maintain the perl unless the creator was there and have documentation.  It merited the phrase, \"write once read never\"; therefore, the emphasis was constantly building upon solid modules and extending them for features, or spending a week rewriting the whole thing.\n\nThat seems stupid but Perl is easy to write once you're proficient and that was during the era of no stackoverflow, few forums, and everything was books and memory.  Like the perl cookbooks that nobody uses because they're essentially useless.   You wouldn't read a HeadFirst Java book except if your goal was to purely learn Java.  You would just fire up Cursor and use the new toolchain to write your code.  That's the difference really, companies will have style guides for prompts like \"only use Elixir\", \"only use rust\", so you'll upload large spaghetti prompts of context for the LLMs, and then prompt away.\n\nThere will eventually be birthed a form of structure to it; however, this structure may look like interacting with AIs while they write slop code.  The only caveat is that everything is a blackbox so it doesn't matter what's happening as long as it mimics your instructions.  I'll say this, people will surely know how to express themselves in future IT roles or they won't be around for very long, thank you momma for forcing me to do grammar err'day.",

      "text": "So I just finished repairing my clients website, which involved entirely rebuilding the frontend and the backend and very labour intensive data migration.\n\nIf I could list absolutely everything this previous web dev did wrong, I would need a publisher. But let's go over some of my absolute favourites.\n\nIf you're an aspiring developer, then read through this carefully and make sure you **never** follow in the footsteps of this developer.\n\nFirst, this developer **loved** client side validation. When you would sign in to the platform as an administrator, the only validation happening was on the client side. So if the server responded back that the login was successful, then great! In that case I'll redirect you to the admin panel!\n\nCan you guess what this means? YEP. Admin panel is entirely unrestricted and anyone can freely access it if they want, they just need to *know what the admin panel URL is*. No one is going to be able to find that URL without logging in as the admin though, right?\n\nWell have a guess as to what you think the admin panel URL was. Even if it was `/administrator` it would have a thousand times better than the reality of it. The admin panel URL was `/a`. I am not joking. That is it. So you literally could have just gone to [`domain.com/a`](http://domain.com/a) and you would have been on the admin panel. Not only was that panel unrestricted and being gated behind client-side validation... BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE THE URL EVEN REMOTELY HARD TO GUESS.\n\nWant to hear what makes it even worse? Guess who was a clever one and decided to include that URL in the sitemap so that Google could kindly index it for everyone?\n\nThat has to be by far the worst thing I have ever seen. But there is more.\n\nDo you think he validated anything on the server? Nope. So when you'd log in, he'd just confirm the login endpoint returned successfully (with a 201 status code by the way - he couldn't even get that right), and then he would store the users data inside localStorage to work with the frontend.\n\nSo what do you think he was doing if a user wanted to change their email, or their password? Correct again, those server endpoints were also totally unrestricted. As long as you provided a valid user ID, you could change information for whoever you wanted!\n\nThe guy even returned the users hash in the login request! Why on earth would anyone ever want to do that? He even had a server endpoint... wait for it... named `/users` and that would return all the users in the database, including their hashes. So I had to notify my client that he needs to send an email out to everyone saying their data has been breached, because I spent about 30 minutes cracking those hashes and got about half of them. Yes, no salting or PBKDF2 algorithms either, just plain old SHA512.\n\nWant to hear the cherry on top? He was hashing the passwords on the frontend. So if you logged in, the frontend would hash your password, send that hash to the backend, then the backend would validate \"*do the hashes match?\"* and if so, would log them in... So he's effectively made the **hash** the **password**. Now that on top of the fact he was even returning the users hashes in API responses means you could have just used the damn hash that was returned and used it to log in with 😂🤣 I swear to you I am not making any of this up!\n\nThe damage? My client paid him a total of $40,000 for this absolute garbage. Something like this isn't even worth a little personal hobby project, let alone real money, and especially $40,000!\n\nBased in the US (the developer) and apparently according to his LinkedIn and other socials was an engineer before trying out web development and creating *professional* systems for the last 6 years. Charges $75 an hour.\n\nThis isn't just rookie mistakes. This guy invented his own entire auth logic! Even a junior would search up at the very least on how authentication works. It's like this guy just asked himself how he thinks it would work and went from there.\n\nDon't be like this guy.",

But to anyone with an ounce of technological knowledge about web development could see the atrocities behind the scenes.\n\nRemember I only came into the picture as the client started to have some doubts. I was already working on another project of his and so he asked me if I could check things out on the other project. I found critical security issues straight away and from that point on I replaced the developer on frontend duties. That was when I started to discover everything and how bad it truly was, leading to him being completely removed from the project.\n\nIt's like saying the customer is also the idiot because they didn't recognise that the computer repair man did a crappy job and overcharged them. You can't always rely on the customer to know these things and I think it's poor judgement to assume that they should and box people in so that only those who would know about how websites work on a technical level should be able to pay for someone to build them a platform. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense and from my experience doesn't check out either.\n\nSure, if they know about how it all works then even better. But I don't think the judgement lies with the client for not knowing. That seems excessively harsh and shifts the blame from the guy who was charging for a skill he didn't have to the person who was paying someone for the skill they needed.",

              "text": "If you are hashing the password on the frontend, you are completely defeating the purpose of what the hash is there for.\n\nThe hashing is meant to be done on the backend. If you hash the password on the frontend, then that means the backend receives the hash instead of the plaintext password.\n\nIf the backend is only receiving the hash and comparing them, then that hash is now effectively the password.\n\nTry to think of it like this. If the backend receives the password in plaintext first, hashes it and **then** compares the hash, then if you were a hacker and had access to the hash, you couldn't use that to log in, as sending it to the backend would result in the backend hashing the hash again, which would result in a different hash, therefore the hashes would no longer match. The hacker would need to know your **password** in order to get around this.\n\nBy hashing the password on the frontend first, you are ensuring that now it is possible to just send the hash to the backend and it will work, you no longer need to know the password.\n\n>When the frontend hashes your password, that doesn't mean you could just enter the hash. Hashing the hash of your password would lead to a different hash... or did I miss something\n\nYes you are misunderstanding a crucial thing. You are thinking that the frontend is the gate-keeper. You're assuming that it is impossible to communicate with the backend without the frontend. Sure, if you put the hash in the login form and submitted it that way, then the frontend would re-hash the hash again. But you don't have to do that. You can just send a POST request directly to the login endpoint on the server and skip the frontend entirely. Or you can use a tool like BurpSuite to intercept the request that the frontend makes and replace the request body with whatever you like, i.e. the hash you stole.\n\nBecause the frontend operates on the clients browser, the frontend can never be used as security! The frontend can be manipulated in a multitude of ways. So by hashing the password on the frontend, you are wrongly assuming that no one will be able to bypass the hashing phase. So if the backend is expecting the hash and you can bypass the frontend hashing process, you can just send the original hash to the backend and it will log you in. That is why hashing must be done on the backend, because then there is no way to bypass that unless you hack the server. The user will always be forced into the flow of whatever they send gets hashed and then compared, and that means the only way for anyone to log in would be to send the original password.\n\nHashing a password is there to protect the password in case the database is leaked. But if you hash the password on the frontend, then the backend treats the hash as the actual password, therefore if those hashes get leaked, they can just be used to log in with because they **are** now the passwords. That was exactly what happened in this scenario too. Hashes were being stupidly leaked by the developer, and the passwords were being stupidly hashed on the frontend, therefore the hash can be used to log in with by sending the hash directly to the backend.",

That paired with the fact that he was also hashing the passwords first on the frontend meant that even when I got him to implement JWT tokens, it was still vulnerable as anyone could just read the hashes that were being leaked and send that directly to the backend to authenticate and gain a valid JWT token (as the backend wasn't hashing anything and only accepted the hash as an input).\n\nStupidity all round.

Funky little animated games and 'cartoons' with a very low bar to entry. It was a remarkably intuituitve product and there were websites comprised entirely of Flash.\n\nThe rest of the suite was pretty good too and Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Flash were core tools for a bunch of early devs. \n\nFireworks was great at image optimization -- we needed that for our image swapping rollover navs. Dreamweaver was an excellent text editor and FTP client with some WYSIWYG nonsense bolted on. It automated a lot of the grunt work required to manage browser incompatibilities and the templating system was robust for it's time.\n\nHappily, CSS came along to save us right around the time the inevitable Adobe enshitification started to kick in.",

The only software that could have produced vector-based animations that were 20-50kb, and you could do it relatively easy compared to what you had to do using html5, svg or whatever at the time. It’s incredible how fast tech changes over time, and some stuff, objectively good and performant at the moment, becomes completely obsolete over time. Currently working as an instructional designer, and I have already a gut feeling that this will be taken over by AI as well and I should start looking for some trade that do not wane off in 5 years. I hope that UBI will be implemented soon, otherwise many people who aren’t geniuses of marketing and sales, will just go mad or homeless (or both).",

For example:\n\n- What technologies did you use in your latest projects and why (be able to discuss and explain each one, advantages and disadvantages, etc) This includes databases, caches, servers, deployment, languages, frameworks, etc\n- What are some of the most common design patterns you used in your last projects? \n- Have you used a particular architecture in any of your last projects (Clean/Event-Driven/Microservices/DDD/etc)\n- What is your philosophy for testing? BDD? TDD?\n\nTo me those are more useful questions rather than: Explain how to create a recursive descent parser to parse JSON using only functions, javascript, vaseline, duct tape and a banana.\n\nFor your case though, because you needed some very specific knowledge, I think it's okay to ask that, just saying, you might give the wrong impression to people just asking for general \"senior role\" questions",

We pay them for the day.\n\nIn our case I have a simple exercise where they need to build a small form \"age, address, category of products you buy the most, favorite brand\", and then present statistics on the form responses.  \nI give them a docker boilerplate with our stack, with empty logic for frontend, api and database, connections already built and tested, an in-house built frontend library fully documented that they are told to use for the form build.  \nThat will force them to deal with the frontend, both on the form as well as present some basic charts and tables for the information, will force them to organize an api and a couple of classes. It is a very simple thing, but that can go to different levels of detail, naming and organization.  \nDo they document their decisions? Do they use AI? Are they able to understand your documentation? Do they build foundational methods? Do they understand and use patterns? Do they reproduce the already existing structure of the library you provided? All of these questions can get answered right there.  \nPeople tell me \"that is a costly hiring process\", I normally answer that hiring the wrong candidate is a lot more expensive than whatever we pay to the 3/4 people we interview every 6 months. My CEO agrees.\n\nTo answer the \"why vs how\" part I mentioned on top, I have a question on the preliminary interview that is somewhat silly and vague on purpose:  \n\"Given a class vehicle, describe auxiliary classes, variables and methods/functions that you would find essential to build\"\n\nMost people go and create classes Wheel, Seats functions \"move(location A, location B) etc...  \nSome people go and start creating abstraction classes \"Locomotion\" \"Engine\".\n\nBut the best candidates most of the times ask:  \n\"What do you want the Vehicle to do? Is it a vehicle to carry people? load? for exhibition? Is it to do so on land? sea?\"  \nI haven't had a single one who asks that who doesn't draft a small set of classes and methods correctly after, to the point in which when someone questions the exercise I just give them full points and move onwards.\n\nBare in mind I am not discarding the others, I can still take insights from the way they organize their thought and helps me see how they construct their code.\n\nMy idea is always that you don't need to ask very complicated questions to assess knowledge, in fact when you ask about the Columbus Egg question (can you invert a binary tree?) you only get people who studied that specific question, and that tells you very little of how they proceed on their day to day. I prefer to give very simplistic exercises, that people will go more/less in depth as they feel more /less comfortable with their stack/knowledge. End of the day you are hiring someone to help you drive things forward, not someone to do what you have already done in the past.\n\nEnd of the day always remember, you can teach stacks, you can teach patterns, but thought process is mostly an inate skill that takes way longer to adapt to.  \n  \nAlso remember that (at least in my experience) teams thrive with different thought processes and personalities, sometimes you need someone who documents heavily, sometimes you need someone who questions a lot, sometimes you need someone who just executes.  \nSo try to hire for the blindspots of your team when possible.",

Hiring is hard.\n\n> what specific moment or behavior made you think “okay, this person is legit?\n\nI think \"legit\" needs some clarity here. I'm not being pedantic. It's important to fully flesh out the qualities that you're looking for. Think of it like hiring a writer for a show you want to produce. \n\nHiring the most brilliant writer doesn't matter if they're difficult to work with, if they're unreliable, if you want a comedy but they're more of a drama writer. Or maybe they're incredibly talented with characters and plot, but can't seem to write to the spec of the show. \n\nHiring someone to code for you is analogous. They may be legit, but that doesn't mean they're a good fit for you. It doesn't mean you're going to get the outcomes that you want. Thoroughly define what you need, heavily weighted to long term goals. Then work backward to defining the type of person you'll need.\n\nFinally, don't ignore the most obvious factor: budget. Make sure you can afford the person you want. Trying to save money, especially if you're inexperienced in hiring and won't have any established mentors on board to supervise, will almost always come back to bite you.",

The hardest thing we have to deal with is the legacy parts of our codebase, which we're currently migrating away from.\n\nBut we do have tens of thousands of users and our software is mission critical for our clients, so we have to deal with a constant pressure to produce new features and feature improvements and balance that with the necessity of a stable platform and our security requirements. \n\nSo, when I interview new developers I want to ensure they know the basics of code and systems design, and figure out if they will be good to work with. We have a great team with no jerks, and I want to keep it that way. That last point is really important because being a great place to work is a big part of our excellent retention. \n\nSo, I do a live coding test that involves calling APIs and integrating the responses, and a system design test that shows they know the moving parts of a production web app, and how databases work. \n\nThat's it. \n\nIf we interview ten people, I see one or two who have the technical chops to pass that test. And it isn't just about passing it. A good senior developer will fly through it. Their code will be clean and well organized, and they'll grasp the subtle challenges of it immediately. They'll rattle off answers to the system design challenges and they'll add details that come from experience building working applications.\n\nAnd if they can do all that while being articulate and having a pleasant disposition, they have a very good shot at landing the job. \n\nI know there are companies that need a lot more from their engineers but at a lot of SaaS companies you pretty much just need solid basics and experience delivering real-world, production applications.\n\nFor junior engineers we give pretty much the same test but our expectations aren't as high. \n\nAnd that's the whole thing. Know how to code, know relational databases, know how web application infrastructure works, and be a good person to work with. For juniors, make sure you have experience building non-trivial apps and actually deploying them.",

Do you value fast results or critical thinking, a mix of both? Depending on what you want, then you can try to ask the right question to make sure they will fit in. Don’t hire someone who asks a ton of questions and care a lot how to do it right if all you want is quick and fast, you will find that developer annoying and will not value them. Same goes with the opposite. Hire for what makes sense as your business values and team values. It will help bringing clarity in your research.",

          "text": "Hello. I am only 24 but I’ve been programming since about 7 years old. Ive done all types of competitive programming and I pretty much never stopped being good at it. I am very autistic though in person, so I have failed most job interviews. I went from homeless after undergrad to signing 400k of solo projects in about a year last year and now I run my own company. This is not to hype myself up, but to give you context into how I can tell other talented or high potential young people apart. These are the common patterns I’ve seen from every person who is both good and not easily recognized all the way from high school until my professional career. \n\nFirst off, everyone who is talented but not recognized is weird. If you are thinking you are going to find them by selecting for “normal people” you might as well just stop reading. If you think you are talented in CS and “normal,” that’s not normal. Your talent has just been “normalized” by your environment. The average person can’t read beyond a 6th grade level. Let weird be endearing from now on, or else just give up your search.\n\nMost of Full stack is system design, so I am going to go with that as my shining star in terms of skills. Dont solve this by looking up “systems design interview question” because everyone has seen all of those before. Its so trivial for anyone who knows what they are doing, but time consuming and so easy to nitpick that its almost insulting. I like to be given questions with real answers, that actually test what I am expected to do when hired. Hell, it might even be funnier and a better test to ask them how they’d respond to a bunch of slack messages in a deck of flashcards. If you are going to like working with someone, you can tell from how they might respond to slack interviews. It might also take the sword of damocles off of their head.\n\nAlso, you are going to need to make a relaxing environment probably. The stakes are high every job interview. While it’s normal for you to interview a lot of candidates, most of those candidates probably haven’t gotten any interviews in weeks. The job market is totally fucked for everyone. I hope you understand the nervous system tension of trying to feed yourself and family. There are plethoras of studies showing intelligence as really driving up nervous system sensitivity across the board, so these candidates might be more nervous because to you its another day and to them its their whole future.\n\nPlease select : Corporate or Startup. Your best guys are always going to be split. Either they were found by corporate and poached early (talented and well known) or they were not. Typically, the talented guys who were not poached went to make some money. I know some pretty rich weirdos in SF. The best people I know either corporate extremely early and stayed (but didnt promote to higher levels, bc politics) or went to go work for a no name startup. Best programmer I ever met to this day works for a small game studio. That dude used to ship like 2000 of systems code a day and it really impressed me. No matter what though, either they stay for a long time, or they move fast and get promoted repeatedly. Please stop judging for layoffs. These big tech companies hired stupidly and fired stupidly after they went broke. Too many of them are zombies, and are not going to tell you that. A layoff means nothing if you actually live in reality.\n\nThere are pretty good pools of young people because the hiring process is so scuffed. The trick is to ask them questions they have never been prepping. You always find talent by scoping out a wide variety of factors. If you only test leetcode, you will only find people who overfit for leetcode. Just play tricks on them and keep them on their toes. I think smart people tend to hate boring things. Or at least I do. I’ve never found a smart person who doesnt like solving new problems in some capacity, as long as those new problems arent “stupid” problems.\n\nAlso, a lot of tech is huge complexity theatre. The less you tell a computer to do, the faster it is. Anyone who adds more steps for a computer to do without good reason and doesnt separate concerns immediately probably isn’t cracked. If you are a small company and the interviewee says monolith, you are in good hands hahaha. If they say anything about some more microservices, they are probably listening to too many people on the internet. Don’t blame them for that, as theres not much else to do while unemployed. If a person isn’t familiar with how fast something CAN be and that sometimes you should focus priorities on something else other than speed, then they probably dont know A LOT. This one is a bit easier to not be familiar with these days.\n\n\nHonestly you guys trying so hard to select also probably weeds out a lot of candidates. You are most likely best off using the euler method for statistical random guessing, since sometimes your heuristics can be worse at selecting talent than random. Just make your own tests for god sakes. No more complaining about candidates cheating all the time. Weed every candidate by putting a few “random questions” they arent supposed to answer or hidden white text questions to avoid chatgpt. Chatgpt for resumes is OK, for interviews is nonsense. Everyone is going to play the “pick me” game, which is fine as long as you have the skills to back it up. If you are playing “pick me” and know nothing, I believe you should study up some more and work outside the field. I know this sounds harsh but its actually the only economically viable strat. I only found any type of money once I stopped looking at tech companies and just started fixing problems for people who had a lot of them and a lot of money.",

Just wrapped up a 3-month migration of our SaaS product from React to Svelte 5, and wanted to share our experience.\n\n**Background:**\n- Mid-sized dashboard app (~50k lines of code)\n- Team of 4 frontend devs\n- Used React + Redux for 2 years\n\n**Why we switched:**\n- Bundle size was getting out of hand (450KB+ gzipped)\n- Performance issues on lower-end devices\n- Wanted to try Svelte 5's new runes and reactivity system\n- Tired of useEffect debugging sessions\n\n**Results after migration:**\n- Bundle size: 450KB → 120KB gzipped (73% reduction!)\n- First Contentful Paint: 2.1s → 0.8s\n- Time to Interactive: 3.5s → 1.2s\n- Lighthouse score: 72 → 94\n\n**Developer Experience:**\n- Code is more readable (less boilerplate)\n- Svelte 5's runes are intuitive once you get the hang of it\n- Much easier to reason about reactivity\n- TypeScript support is solid\n\n**The challenges:**\n- No direct equivalent for some React libraries\n- Had to rewrite our component library from scratch\n- Learning curve for the team (especially runes vs stores)\n- Some edge cases with SSR took time to debug\n\n**Would I do it again?** Absolutely. The performance improvements alone made it worth it, and our users have noticed the difference.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the migration process!",

If you’re constantly fighting effects, it usually means state is poorly structured or effects are being used for things they shouldn’t be. Svelte avoids a lot of these pitfalls by design, React allows them. That’s a difference, but not proof that React itself is bad or slow.\n\nUsing Redux for a 50k-line dashboard over two years also explains a big chunk of the pain. Classic Redux adds a lot of overhead and makes it easy to trigger unnecessary re-renders. With more modern state patterns, many of those issues could’ve been reduced without switching frameworks.\n\nThe performance numbers are also hard to read as a pure framework win. Comparing a grown, \"legacy-heavy\" React app to a freshly rewritten Svelte app is mostly showing the rewrite effect. Rewrites almost always ship less JS and feel faster, no matter the framework.\n\nSo yeah, sounds like switching was the right call for your team. But to me this post shows how forgiving React is of bad architecture, not that React was the root cause of the problems.\n\nSo imho, this looks more like a problem with using “raw” React than a problem with React itself, Redux aside.",

Did you do it incrementally or rip the band aid off and rewrite everything at once?\n\nAlso curious about the Redux to Svelte stores (or runes) transition. Most of the complexity in big React apps lives in the state management layer, not the component rendering. Going from Redux boilerplate to Svelte runes must have felt like going from writing assembly to writing Python.\n\nThe one thing I would push back on is the \"no direct equivalent for some React libraries\" point. The React ecosystem is genuinely massive and that library gap can bite you hard when you need something niche 6 months down the road. Worth keeping an eye on.",

Use C, Zig, Rust, or any other programming language that can access memory directly.  \nAfter that, cut out the pg driver and directly write the pg protocol.\n\nAfter that, you would need to go non-sql to save a little more.\n\nAnd then in-process, e.g. LMDB (many databases are now based on LMDB).\n\nIf you still want to go faster, memory map a file and write to that. If you only want to log a stream of events as it seems, you could really just do append-only on a mmap'd file and open it in a second thread to read it if required. Only limit at that point would be the max mmap size depending on your OS, your free disk space, and in terms of speed, most probably I/O.\n\nFrom that onward, in-memory is the only way to go faster, so basically just a memory area you dump your data to. To keep it usable, it would probably have to be some kind of chunked ring-buffer.\n\nThere you go, your plan for the next few weeks :)\n\nNote: been there, done that, pretty interesting. And actually only really required in VERY special cases.\n\nP.S.: You could implement your own json serializer to improve serialization performance. The biggest issue with json serialization and deserialization is usually that it's a non-linear process - bytes arent read/written 100% sequentially. Also, the size isn't known beforehand usually. Both can be circumvented when you hand code it though.\n\nThe most efficient serialization / deserialization is still \"none\" though. E.g. with C you can just write the memory as is, and mmap it, or, if you prefer, memcopy the whole block over a (carefully engineered, due to padding etc.) struct.",

You can still say if it's vibe coded or not without releasing the source code. The fact that you're reluctant to do so just makes me nearly 100% confident it is vibe coded, and that is the reason you don't want to make it open source (since the reasons you gave for not doing so don't make any sense either).",

There is no \"about\" information. The link to your privacy policy and terms of service don't work. Half of the things that look like links on the footer aren't actually links. You've got social media buttons that don't link to your media.\n\nWhy would anyone trust this website? How would the average non-websavvy person be able to even trust your claims even if by some miracle they managed to stumble across your site?\n\nI'd suggest you strip it back. Actually add proper terms of service and a privacy policy. Link to your social media feeds and put a proper bio on there so people at least know you are a real person. I personally still wouldn't trust it. But if it's just a hobby project and you don't intend to monetise it then you shouldn't be worrying if people use it or not. If you do the basics right, over time people might start using the tools. But don't expect much in just 10-15 days.",

I think there’s unpopular opinion at the moment based on LLMs and vibe coding that are tainting the discussion and pushing it away from your initial intent. My honest opinion to your question is that I wouldn’t trust a random website with my sensitive data even if it claims it’s only processed on my device because I’m used to Meta and Google claiming a lot of BS too. It’s hard to gain trust in the current landscape where every corp just wants to steal your data at any cost. But the fact that your vibe coded or AI assisted or whatever has nothing to do with that. It looks really awesome, by the way, but it doesnt change the principle. Personally, for small utility tools, I look for open source apps that I can find the binaries on brew (Mac). If it doesn’t exist, I create one and put it there, not to collect clicks and downloads and fame, just for my future convenience (and others). If it fills a need good, if it doesn’t, well, at least it filled my need. Lastly, it made me think that if you put those tools into a cli (or MCP) that LLM can control, that’d be dope. I’m constantly asking Claude for editing with ImageMagick and ffmpeg. The more “Swiss army knife” tools there are, the more my LLM will be helpful for me. Just my 2c! Good luck, I’m pretty sure you had fun and you learned a ton with that project, don’t let the haters kill your vibe.",

These are one off things that people do, and certain things are done locally by the OS (PDF merging), and the only guarantee of privacy is you saying you aren’t saving the user’s stuff. That’s not much of a promise when people can’t verify.\n\n> 2.\t⁠Am I wasting my time building these tools as nobody wants them?\n\nYou’re wasting time here - you built something without market validation, thinking people will flock to it. It’s not a high demand service, so you need to dominate the SEO game to get people to find your site when they need to use it. \n\n> 3.\t⁠Suggestions on how I can promote it without money as the platform completely fee to use.\n\nProbably seeking out hashtags and seeking people complaining about what you’re attempting to solve. I don’t think it’s an easy thing to automate.\n\n> 4.\t⁠Should I just drop it as nobody cares?\n\nDepends on why you did this. You want to showcase your work? Do it. \n\nYou want to build a client base? There are better ways to do it. \n\nYou made a free tool. If it’s free, why do you care if millions use it? Especially if it’s not OSS.",

Have you built up any credibility? \n\nSince you've asked, here are my answers to your 4 questions:\n\n1. Now more than ever people care about privacy, but we care more about credibility and proof that we can trust our data to new unvetted sources.\n2. No, you are not waisting your time, you're building an asset that has promise. Do you use it yourself? Have you worked out all the bugs? Can you produce a case study?\n3. If you're promoting it without money then getting the word out over 10-15 days is too short a time to expect much. Organic reach to earn the trust level you're assuming takes months, not days or even weeks. \n4. \"Should I just drop it as nobody cares?\" You're finding out right now -- on Showoff Saturday -- that we DO care about privacy. But we also need to trust you and your software. \n\nHere's a thought: have you researched what other apps like yours do for promotion? Not just paid, but with reviews, walk-through videos, and case studies. It may be worth the time to research and regroup before you pull the plug on your creation.\n\nGood luck!

Why should anyone use a single use tool? yes it has a lot of functionality, but will someone spend more than 2 hours per month on the tools you built? More than that, will someone be even ok to pay for something that can be vibe coded in 20 mins? If it is truly offline first and private platform, why is it on a browser and not a desktop application? If you are so confident about the product being secure and care about privacy why is the code not open source?\n\nMaking a product involves a lot of steps. It starts with problem statement, market research and then solution. I want to merge my pdf is a problem. i search google and find that it is possible to do it for free with google docs or ms word. i use both google docs and ms word, so why would i go to your platform to merge pdf documents?\n\nyou may say google and microsoft collects your data. \n\ni am typing the entire document on google docs or ms word. the document information is already there. so.... yeah.... that is not a problem at this point.\n\nedit1: You cannot say you are hipaa compliant without having an audit and certification.",

Even if it can be vibe coded in 20 mins most people don't have the knowhow or won't bother, they would rather just throw their data anywhere to get the job done, if this came up on Google I would use it over other websites.\n\nTbh I think it's a great idea, no heavy server workloads as all the processing happens locally in the browser. If you could steal some of the market from the other tools and throw a few ads on the site I think you are on to a winner albeit maybe a small one, but you can deploy this for free on something like cloudflare pages so it's no cost to you. If you enjoy making it then why not continue?\n\nFair enough on it not being open source but if OP intends to make money then open sourcing would make it much easier for others to launch competing websites... They probably still will but why make it easier? OP could open source later once there is traction and they have good search engine rankings otherwise someone with a marketing budget could come in and gain market share much faster.\n\nWhy isn't it a desktop app? No one these days looks for a desktop app for simple things, they will Google first and if a website comes up that can do the job they will use that, it's a much more frictionless experience. Also with web apps there is no need for compiling the app for different architectures, hosting different binaries etc. (given the small caveat of browser differences) I think it's a much better approach.",

If they won't provide a number (or a range) I'll just say that I want to make sure we both have the same expectations so we're spending each other's time wisely and I cannot proceed until we have some basic understanding that we're a good fit for each other. If they want to ask some basic fit questions of me for the same reason that's fine (ex. remote/on site split, time zone work hours, etc). I like to take care of this over email or linkedin messaging but if they insist on a call I will agree to 15 minutes to clear this stuff up (this is what the recruiters want first for their reasons, but it's what I want as a last resort since we can clear up these basics in 2 mins over email or linkedin messaging and use even less of each other's time if it's not a good fit).\n\nIf the number is too low, then I will tell them what I would need to proceed with the next step. I genuinely don't want to waste their time and I want the same courtesy in return. Some might think it's rude to talk about numbers up front, and it can be a little uncomfortable if you make it that way, but if you're assertive about what you want and you're transparent about your expectations then I think that will avoid more awkwardness in the future and you'll end up with a company that has the same values as you (courtesy, transparency, fairness, etc).",

There are many. But the company doesn't want to hire there. Why? Because they don't have the budget. That's why they're looking to hire in a lower cost-of-living region so that their $$ have more mileage. Its a win-win for both parties - company gets to hire good talent for lower rate & the talent gets employed with above average pay.\n\nYou are also doing the same - looking for a US based company for employment instead of something local to your region - because you know you will get paid better. If you are not the wrong then why would another be in the wrong for doing the same thing?\n\nIf you're holding out for US pay rates then keep looking. Some companies do pay standard rate irrespective of where the employee is located. Just not many of them.\n\nAs for equity & contractor role - well, you have a big misconception there. Unless the company has a registered subsidiary in your country, you can't be a full time employee. You'd need a US work permit for any US company to put you on payroll. So, yeah, you will get contractor role. And as for equity - contractors don't get equity.",

It can help visualize basic HTML and CSS concepts, but most real-world teams design in tools like Figma and write code directly in editors like VS Code. My advice is to treat the class as a fundamentals course, learn the core ideas behind layout and structure, then mentally translate those skills into modern tools on your own. The fundamentals will carry, even if the software feels like a time capsule.",

Writing code on the other hand was easy for me and I am still in the field today.\n\n\nMy minor was in education and there I learned to understand the wish for a teacher to simplify or visualize the topic they teach about... but the stubborn kid in class (me) may not respond well to it and create friction.\n\n\nDreamweaver _is_ a way to learn webdevelopment but only the graphical basics. To learn true webdevelopment I would suggest learning HTML and CSS since these languages have become very powerful (especially CSS) and allow for complete understanding of how something works (but I am not your teacher giving you a passing grade!

In all of my years making websites I’ve never been rejected for a job because I didn’t have a degree. I’m self taught and started messing with websites back in the day with angelfire and geocities. If you need school or a teacher to tell you how to learn things, you’ll never make it as a web developer.. the technology is changing so fast that you’ll need to be a self learner.

Almost every company I’ve worked at has had some random, kind of silly, software that they’re using just because they’ve been using it for the last 10 years. Learning random software really is its own skill set.\n\nI think Dreamweaver probably has the perfect amount of randomly frustrating shit for you to learn so that you can actually get used to some of the silly things that corporate America will throw at you.\n\nI say that as an alum of several fortune 500 companies and one Silicon Valley unicorn… you’re gonna have to get used to learning random software that you probably don’t want to learn to do your job.\n\nSo for now, I would say just to focus on the basics… And treat dreamweaver as a necessary evil… I feel like you can still learn in this class, but maybe don’t take the follow up class where they do a deep dive into adobe fireworks lol",

Adobe stopped active development like 4-6 years ago and it stopped being industry standard somewhere in the middle 00's.\n\nAs others have mentioned, figma and vscode are where it's at now.\n\nThat said, DW apparently works with sass and responsive design though, so you might be able to use it about like you would webflow or something. It's also a pretty easy way to learn the fundamentals of basic web design, without getting too caught up in the code. \n\nPhotoshop is still used for a lot of different things depending on who you're working with. Figma is the standard for designs, but there's no shortage of people still out there pumping out WordPress themes they originally drew up in Photoshop.",

The *personal* web, *independent* web, *small* web (whatever you want to call it) is still very pleasant to use.\n\nIf you're sick of seeing spam and AI slop everywhere, you need to move beyond centralized social media platforms and traditional search engines for website discovery purposes. Use those big human brains of yours and stop expecting to have an endless stream of \"content\" delivered directly to your eyeballs via a social media recommendation algorithm. Try ... I dunno, something like *kagi dot com forwardslash smallweb*. If you look at the master list for that directory on Github, there are almost 30,000 independent websites represented there. And Kagi's small web directory is but ONE example of several. Another directory you might like (since the websites are categorized to make it easier to find stuff you're interested in) is *blogroll dot org*. You can also join well-moderated forums where people share their independent sites with others (there are plenty out there). Bookmark any independent sites you happen across that are created by humans and relevant to your interests. Add their RSS feeds to an RSS reader and curate your own algorithm-free, slop-free feed.\n\nAs web developers, you are better equipped than anyone to participate in and contribute to the independent web community. Use SSGs to build simple HTML / CSS / JS websites, and fuck all the bloated corporate web frameworks you're expected to use in your day jobs. Have FUN again, and remember why you wanted to build websites in the first place. If you don't think that the existing independent web discovery surfaces work well, build your own better solutions. And if you're worried about your shit being stolen, do what you can to block known scrapers via .htaccess and honeypots.\n\n**tl;dr: fuck all the slop peddlers and marketers of the corporate web. Fuck SEO, and fuck \"GEO.\" The OP of the post I'm responding to asked how we \"get out of\" this mess. We get out of it by refusing to participate in the corporate web for our daily browsing activities. The independent web is what you want if you're tired of this BS.**",

              "text": "I completely agree. One of the biggest consequences of app stores and walled gardens is that they’ve trained people, especially average device users, to think the internet is just a handful of apps. For many, online life now exists inside two or three corporate platforms. They might still visit some websites for school, work, or government needs, but the wider web barely registers anymore.\n\nWhat gets lost is the idea of the internet as an open platform. It’s not the wild west of the late 90s or early 2000s, but the open web still exists. Independent websites, forums, blogs, open-source projects, donation platforms, and grassroots political and social organizations are still out there. They didn’t disappear, they just became harder to see once discovery was funneled through apps and algorithms.\n\nThe real problem is structural. When most people live inside a few applications, those companies become the gatekeepers of speech, culture, and organizing. What you see, what you’re allowed to say, and how far it spreads are shaped by corporate policy rather than public norms.\n\nWe should be reminding younger generations that the internet itself is where real agency still exists. Websites can’t be shut down by a single platform decision, and protocols don’t care about brand safety. If people don’t invest their time and energy in the open web, they’re choosing a future where online life is permanently confined to a few corporate silos.",

One of the things that saddens me the most is when I talk to teenagers and young adults from gen z and beyond and how they play barely any games and touch barely any websites.\n\nFor them, the internet is just social media and a handful of websites but that's about it.

Instead of whining on Reddit about how \"the internet\" (the whole freaking internet) is \"dead\" or \"unusable,\" we can actively make a difference. For everyone who uses the internet? Maybe not, but we can at least help those people out there who are sick of seeing slop everywhere and are ready for a change. Increasing numbers of \"normal\" people are leaving social media and WANT somewhere else to go online. We can help guide them to independent online communities, and we can help to build those independent online communities.\n\nEven if the independent web becomes more popular over the next several years and the corporate web tries to infiltrate it, they'll fail; the minute you see slop on some corporate website pretending to be \"independent\" is the minute you blacklist that domain. This is the beauty of the internet and tried and true systems like RSS.
