They start adding absolutely ridiculous metrics like trying to calculate how much of your code is written by AI versus by you, check to see how frequently you're using the apis via tooling (IDEs, CLIs like Code Puppy, etc...). Their goal is to fully implement AI as coders and humans as reviewers. You already have tools like Qodo Merge that can actually do a very good job at code reviews but still requires manual intervention. It has a bunch of false positives that show up but with time that will get better as well. \n\nThe major Gap that I've seen so far is that for experienced engineers at senior level or above, this can absolutely speed up their development and they'll catch the problems they see for the most part. However, for the Junior and mid-level, they don't have the experience necessary to understand what is actually happening when they do their reviews. They don't have the reps in to identify issues that are only gained by experience. \n\nThis is just the opinion of a two decade software engineer forced to try to use AI to replace my knowledge so I can watch it wither away along with my career.\n\nI'm just glad this didn't exist when I was starting my career. I wouldn't have the skills I do today, especially in staying calm when things go wrong, having to design an architecture from scratch with no tooling, and learning how to problem solve without extra tools beyond debug messages and AltaVista -> Google search",

This obviously leads to the junior positions in many companies completely decimated due to both the shrinkage of the demand(1 junior with a claude subscription can replace 5 juniors from 2020) and the supply (everybody can code with ai).\n\nAll the current senior devs still have their experiences and expertise from the last 2 decades and won't be negatively affected by the adoption of ai, but there will come a time where they'll retire and have to hand over the role of \"senior\" to the little juniors.\n\nA senior solves a problem by thinking about it from more perspectives, usually out of their years of experience, completes the overall skeleton of the solution and hands the mundane part to the juniors, where they learn how the overall architecture and system should relate to each other and function properly. Obviously seniors also know how to use ai, so companies will stop hiring juniors to save on costs, and when the seniors eventually retire, there will be no new seniors since all the juniors were never there in the first place.",

Software developers less and less look at code, they just get the AI to do stuff and then make sure it conforms to requirements. On the one hand of this means juniors can exist, because their role is basically splitting up work into very small chunks (absolutely a skill) and holding the hand of the AI through it. On the other hand this is actually slower than building good quality software in the medium and long term, but businesses don't care, because businesses never care about that sort of thing.\n\nSoftware development then is forced into this cycle: ship crap, restart every few months when the model hits its limit. Our entire industry reshapes. New SDLC models emerge, are hyped, and entire consultancies built around deploying them (ah la Agile). New frameworks emerge on this model (eg rest framework that wrap you in a secure sandbox, managing externalities, allowing your code to be as shit as you like). Many breathless blog posts are written about how to be efficient in this model.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been learning the piano in this timeline for multiple years.

Then after that people would draw on a computer and then design each building component and send that off to be made and then make designs for the builders to follow whilst construction. Then better software was made where you draw the building and it does everything for you. This massive productivity boost didn't lead to job losses and we still have junior architects today.\n\nWe're going through this same change now. In 10 years time maybe we won't even be writing code, we'll just write a list of things that must happen when events are fired or APIs are called. Like how buildings have got bigger with more requirements and more materials and cheaper maybe software will too but we will still need people with technical understanding, design and vision in one way or another",

This was after we had some admittedly bad experience with a couple of back to back contractors that claimed to have 12-15 years of experience each (I think they both lied on their resumes but that's a story for another day). \n\nMy boss largely blamed their poor performance on refusal to adopt any kind of AI tools, hence declaring his mandate, lots of, \"old dog, new tricks\", analogies. \n\nMy main concern is exactly what you say, I tried to stress to him that to my mind, hiring a junior dev with no grasp of the fundamentals but can vibe code is eventually going to be just as bad if not worse than a \"senior\", that refuses to adopt AI. \n\nEven if this isn't a problem immediately, it will be an increasingly more fire issue in the coming years if we don't make an effort to train these juniors now on things that are not just AI and Vibe Coding",

If a business is successful, it means the workers earned much more than they cost.\n\nIf work in a large enough chunk of the economy becomes a dancing contest between humans and AI, well—humans have to study for decades at a great expense to become experts at something like programming. If the whole field is destroyed, faulting them for failing to anticipate the destruction of their investment leads where exactly? A maximumly agile person in the world you describe isn’t allowed to develop expertise because the investment is likely to be eradicated by AI. The whole game of reducing worker numbers while increasing output can’t go on forever without collapsing the economy, so this Muskian blame just really doesn’t hold water. The system doesn’t promise to replace what’s destroyed, and humans can’t spend $100k + 8 years of study in an instant in order to redirect. Like asking a 50 year old to make that investment is crazy because the time it would take to recover it even if they commit to a total career change is much more likely not to be realized.\n\nLike I’m 50, my son is 18.\nI’m a programmer and I’ve been put out of work by AI. \nMy family needs money, but none of us are skilled with valuable skills (even though my skills are recently THE MOST valued).\nThe cost for skills is $100k.\n\nWho gets the $100k skills? Me or the 18 year old.\n\n18 year old is better get because I’m more likely to die at they point. But then what?

It’s about creating. And honestly, there’s something refreshing about skipping the overhead of research, users, or constraints and just putting something out there.\n\nWhat really stands out is the confidence. No unnecessary complexity, no messy edge cases, no burden of reality getting in the way. Just a clean demo, a compelling narrative, and a clear sense of momentum. That kind of focus is rare.\n\nI also love how this reframes the problem. It’s not about solving a specific pain point — it’s about unlocking potential. And potential, as we all know, is much easier to scale than actual value.\n\nThis isn’t replacing traditional approaches — it’s redefining them. By prioritising speed over understanding, and presentation over depth, it shows what’s possible when you optimise for output instead of outcomes.\n\nIs it finished? Probably not.  \nBut finished isn’t the point. Shipping is.  \nAnd shipping something will always beat thinking too hard about anything. Build it and they will come.\n\nReally curious to see where this goes next — whether that’s iteration, expansion, or a bold new reframing of the same core idea.\n\nKeep going.

The chance that it will get bette and better are very very low and its more likely that we are actually at the limit of what an LLM can provide.\n\nAnd I also have to disagree, often the AI produces over complicated or messy code when it comes to more complex tasks. It can help a lot when using it for small units though and focusing on TDD, its rather good in generating code from tests, but even then it often adds unnecessary things to it or generates way too complicated code.

The root of the problem is that the arXiv paper is pretty bad: it uses a dataset ([HMCorp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04704)) that generated pairs of functions (human-generated, AI-generated) by stripping the docstring and letting ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo recreate the same code. The authors expanded this ancient dataset with their own ancient models (DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct 33B, released in November 2023, and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 32B, released in September 2024), and all this methodological mess was needed to claim that AI models write flawed and vulnerability-ridden code. A much better summary of this \"research\" would be:\n\n\"When outdated AI models are given vague instructions without project context, they write generic, simple code that fails to use all function arguments and defaults to insecure patterns.\"\n\nPlease, people, if you cannot evaluate a research paper on your own, don't mindlessly share it, or at least ask GPT-5.2 Thinking or Gemini 3 Pro to critically analyze the paper for you instead of spreading misinformation. Trust me, any of those models is able to perform much better analyses than most people.\n\nOn the other hand, as a security researcher, I had a good laugh when I read this, since nothing could be further from the truth:\n\n> human mistakes tend to be low-to-medium severity — typos, minor logic flaws, a missing null check. messy but catchable.",

Is it incongruent with what their company does elsewhere? Are they just learning something new?\n\nI just passed 25 years of adult work in programming and tech. It has always been this way to an extent. Now it’s amplified by more people, tech being closer to mainstream culture, and a media environment that amplifies it. It’s a bit like how my parents and grandparents complaining about all the suffering they see in the news. Suffering has always been there but they hear more about it.\n\nLow interest rates caused a cash glut which resulted in a period of power for many more devs. During this period they had outsized influence over tech choices and the ability to jump ship before the results made an impact. We all suffer from them not using boring tools. \n\nThe reins are tighter on real world scope/influence of devs. With a tighter market there is now more pressure to hype to be heard.

I think that coding is not literally for me. I'm burnt out from this job, I'm burnt out from this career itself, there is no joy here tbh. I almost feel like I'm a machine who needs to go at some place from mon-fri do this and that and then spend my weekends in anxiety that omg wtf am I doing with my life.\n\n\nI'm a very creative guy, I've tried music, singing, writing in the past. Also, I'm thinking to be a technical writer because I just love writing, bit coding is really hard for me I feel like an imposter and I don't want to do a job which is as fucked as me not feeling a passion to do what I'm doing.\n\n\nIt would be a great help if there are people who can guide me the jobs in tech or outside of it that actually involves very less/no coding at all and is pretty a good one to invest in.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so so much everyone, for your genuine responses, I'm really getting clarity and you know what I think my role should look like it should be where I'm the lead, where I'm the visionary leader, where I divide tasks, manage teams, I think I'd love something like this.

I find this is especially true in people who are creative because most Corps have wrapped Dev wok in so many processes to try and measure output they have squeezed every drop of joy from the job\n\nIf you are really passionate about something, I know from experience you can work day and night and still wake up wanting to get back to it as soon as possible.",

I got laid off 7 months ago and have only had 3 interviews, making it to final two twice but not getting the job. \n\nI have also felt like a complete imposter the entire time, barely staying afloat. I’ve been laid off from every dev job I’ve had so not only is the imposter syndrome stressful but I feel like there is no job security and the future looks much more bleak.\n\nI’m turning 40 years old this year and have been feeling totally lost. I started my dev career when I was 30, after skipping college and hopping around between low wage entry level office jobs, with all signs pointing to this career in web development being in demand and super stable well into the future. \n\nMy 25 year old friend manages a coffee shop in my neighborhood so my fallback has been to start a new career as a barista at 40 years old. Woof.\n\nHowever my luck has changed somewhat recently. Luckily my wife is a very talented senior shoe designer that is beloved by everyone at her company. The VP for the costing department has been struggling to fill a position for a Senior Costing Analyst and is willing to train the right person. After researching the role I discovered plenty of skills that translate from dev to this role and it sounds pretty interesting to me. I generalized my resume to cater to the position and had a chat with the VP and it’s looking pretty promising and pays well. I’m having to learn excel which is a simple breeze compared to programming. \n\nSo my advice would be take advantage of any networking you can and do some research into open positions that sound like something you could generally be interested in. There are so many jobs out there that I had no clue even existed. After learning programming I feel like learning anything else is possible and probably a lot easier. You just gotta find someone willing to take a chance on you.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Being a designer for almost 25 years, frontend dev for around 20 and doing it professionally for well over 12-13 years, I'd say the last 5 years were a nightmare in the dev world (especially with the rise of AI). \nFully get that you're feeling burned. \nSeems like a new shiny framework pops up almost every day, existing projects are outdated the moment you release them, constant optimizations, new browser features, shorter deadlines, \"why so expensive? I can do this with ai in a few minutes...\" ... Yeah, this is quite a lot that almost every frontend dev has to deal with these days.\n\nPersonally I'm trying to keep design and dev in balance because creativity is something you can't just toggle on/off or force. So when ever I feel drained, I'm diving more into dev, once I'm tied of dev and feeling creative again, I'm jumping back into design. A benefit of doing my own thing and working only with clients I want to work with. \n\nIf you're in a corporate world, try agency. Simply because being a dev/designer in a company and doing things only for basically one client can be super exhausting. In am agency, you have multiple clients but also tighter deadlines and might have to deal with people who don't have the suggest clue about your work... Can be draining as well\n\n\nWhat you can try is focusing on something specific. Like building pages for a specific CMS. \nI've used to create/develop things for Joomla, WordPress, dipped my toes into TYPO3 but then switched entirely to HubSpot around 8 years ago. \nBest decision ever to be honest",

I looked at pages that had designs I liked, tried redesigning them with my own touch and thinking about how I'd slice then into assets for a table structure. Back then it wasn't that hard, as there was no such thing as responsiveness, fancy css or fancy js stuff. Even something like jQuery wasn't a thing at first. Every websites was basically just a big static table tag.\n\nAnd at it's core this approach hasn't changed. \nTables got replaced by divs or semantic tags. Css frameworks like bootstrap and tailwind became a thing to provide predefined and reusable css classes so you don't need to write everything from scratch every time. \nBut in the end, it's still the same. It just got fancier and easier to start & repeat. \n\nmy recommendation would be to start with the basics like HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. You don't need to master each of these languages, but a good foundation is very helpful. Also look into three atomic design principles by Brad Frost. This should boost your coding approach immensely. \n\nThe very first job i got was a freelance job in a marketing-like agency where I did basically everything. Designing stuff for internal purposes, building and maintaining the website of a sub company of the agency... At some point I landed a freelance job in a design agency and got hired by one of it's clients as a developer a few months later.",

Project management - In the place I work and also the place my friend works. Just hearing how poorly their projects are managed. How they work till about 1pm and the rest of the days they are in meetings discussing how they're going to work the project and then they have to go home and work some more. Also in my company projects are handled extremely poorly. \n\nSo these are the ideas I am playing with. \n\nDevOps I can at least shadow and learn where I am at the moment project management I will have to go and do courses. \n\nI hope you find your new direction or maybe find a way to revive your passion.",

The frameworks change every couple years as you noted and AI is everywhere and you're so abstracted from everything.  Projects are short-lived and timelines are incredibly aggressive.  Could just be that even a small career path change within the industry could be enough?  As you get lower (or mid) level, projects tend to be more durable and slower paced and perhaps more interesting imo.  It could also be that a few more years in the industry and you'll get on a management track and then it's a totally different can of worms. A couple of my friends and co-workers have found that extremely rewarding having come from a long Dev background\n\n\nGood luck out there",

With that said, I'm not convinced this changes a ton.

When you say \"creative, music, singing\" it makes me think you're not a person that should be working on commodities... at the same time, you then mention technical writing, which is kind of the opposite. Bit conflicted on what to advise here, lmao. But FWIW, technical writing is cool. My journey went \"studying > nope, not being a dev > writing gig > project manager > product manager\".

One of Astro's strengths has been being relatively platform-agnostic - you can deploy it anywhere.

Cloudflare has been making really smart moves lately with their developer tools and this acquisition gives Astro the resources and infrastructure to scale properly.\n\n\n\nWhat I find interesting is the timing. Astro has been gaining a ton of momentum as the go to framework for content heavy sites that need to be fast. Cloudflare obviously sees value in owning that space especially with their Pages platform competing directly with Vercel and Netlify.\n\n\n\nThe real question is whether Astro will stay framework agnostic or if theyll start pushing deeper Cloudflare integration. One of Astros strengths has been that you can use it with React Vue Svelte whatever and deploy anywhere. If they start optimizing specifically for Cloudflare Workers or Pages that could be great for performance but might alienate people who want to deploy elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side Cloudflare has a pretty good track record of keeping their acquisitions open and community focused. Wrangler and Workers are still usable outside the Cloudflare ecosystem so hopefully Astro stays similarly flexible. Plus having Cloudflares resources behind it means better docs faster bug fixes and potentially some really interesting performance optimizations at the edge.\n\n\n\nOverall this feels like a win for both sides but time will tell if it stays true to what made Astro appealing in the first place.",

So many older coders just don’t know how to use AI or get the most out of it. But you have high school students building million dollars applications weekly that would take the top engineers at Google years to develop just a year ago. Claude is just better. Sorry. If you have a powerful AI workflow and know what you’re doing, there is actually nothing that humans are better at in every field, not just engineering. If this wasn’t true, i wouldn’t have been able to build a billion dollar business in sub 2 years with a team of 4. Every VC in the U.S. is begging to get in our Series A round next month. Why if AI is just hype? 4 people. Imagine. So the only valuable convos moving forward, for me at least, are convos with other engineers about their AI workflow and stack. Asking a question about coding is borderline embarrassing and actually would be grounds for not getting hired and fired at my company. It’s actually part of our interview process. We are specifically testing for how proficient programmers are with AI and rapidly weeding out anyone that is still that narcissistic and egoistical that they think they’re better than AI. I kid you not. It’s in our interview process as a trick question. It reveals everything if you agree with the comment above and yeah, pro tip, you’ll struggle to get hired anywhere if you don’t fully embrace AI. Queue the downvotes but I’m legit trying to help. People need to adapt. AI is not replacing you. It’s just displacing you. We are hiring dozens of coders right now but only those with an AI-first mindset.",

I joined during the initial beta, so know it really well.\n\nIMO it can absolutely be saved, but it'll need a fundamental shift in how it works.\n\nBack in around 2010 there was a push towards how SO handles the inevitable duplicate questions at scale. Some of us liked the idea of leaning into the wiki concept, and others wanted a single question. It's obvious which side won.\n\nI'd go back, and reopen all closed duplicate questions. I'd push people towards answering with high quality answers, and would reward those that provide canonical and combined sources for questions - have them merge instead of close, but with two threads and a canonical \"right\" answer if they both apply.\n\nFrom there I'd redo all the cool shit they used to be known for, real community shit with an updated feel, like:\n\n* A yearly tech conference, with cheap tickets, solid speakers, and dates around the world.\n\n* Lean into chat again, creating logs that can be cross-referenced. Maybe embed it into Discord, but with full logs that are then referenced via the site?\n\n* Bring back the job board, but lower the costs and make it cheap for start-ups to post jobs. Maybe acquire LeetCode or build a competitor that people can use for hiring? I'd also lean into Pramp-esque video chat and videos to allow people to run mock interviews, learn about complex topics, etc.\n\n* Open the platform to universities. Let them have private instances, and provide free accounts + benefits to CS students. Be the resource for students, so they continue to use after graduating.",

      "text": "I've been a web dev for most of my career, professionally at fortune 500 companies for over 8 years (mainly LAMP/WAMP). I've also built many side projects there were SAAS, and unfortunately never were profitable, but that's fine. They helped me build my resume/portfolio up, so it wasn't a waste of time IMO.\n\nBack when I made those SAAS products (\\~8 years to 2ish years ago, pre LLM's), it took quite some time to develop the product and you had to settle on a \"great\" idea to make it worthwhile to develop. After spending hundreds of hours making the MVP idea come to life, it'd be time to market it. At that phase, you kind of still had a chance to stand out, since everyone was in the same boat in terms of time spent on the idea, and effort put in.\n\nNow with AI tools and vibe coding, people are making websites and apps on a whim, and a ton of them are honestly junk. Either poorly coded, or just not useful or novel ideas. Even the ones that are good are completely buried by the insane amount of services being created. I'm actually grateful that these tools exist, but now we're in a different game where marketing is pretty much everything. Obviously marketing and the business side of a SAAS was a huge portion of it, but now it's become the primary blocker to creating a profitable product.\n\nI see a ton of people try out these AI tools and ambitiously think that they can create a product that makes them financially free, or at least get some side income. Because of this, the market has become absurdly saturated from a product and marketing standpoint. I'm sure some people are making successful businesses, but it's becoming a majorly decreasingly small percentage of projects that succeed, mainly due to the absurd levels of market saturation. Just a few years ago, if you wanted to make a SAAS website, you were genuinely competing with a pool of creators that was a fraction of the size of what it is now. \n\nTo make matters worse, it's becoming less obvious from the consumer side of what's just a trash product slapped together using AI, vs something that is actually worth paying for. Anyone can vibe code a project now in like an hour and plug in Stripe to accept payments. I see this is especially bad for SAAS products in industries like finance and social media. \n\nI don't want any of this to come off as negative, it's just a shift in the market. The barrier to entry now is so low, that you have to focus on more organic channels of sales like local markets, and build products that serve even more niche needs. I'm already starting to switch gears to more of a consulting strategy, where I try to find businesses that need specific web automation or support on existing enterprise products, rather than trying to create new SAAS products from scratch. And no do not DM me or ask for details about that, the point stands alone, and I don't use Reddit as a commercial channel in any capacity.\n\nI've seen other posts online about this, but they're generally just complaining like \"vibe coding/AI bad\", or some other doomer take. I feel like my skills are as valuable as ever, because I'm still working on projects that are super ambiguous business problems and can't be done without having the knowledge of the business ahead of the product and web code itself. On the other hand, a ton of people are hopping into web dev, marveling at their ability to quickly generate SAAS products, and thinking they've got something valuable. I hate to compare it to AI art, but it really is quite similar. Both are ultra saturated, so the value comes from the actual experience and implementation of the artist/web dev within the business itself, not just making something pretty that you can quickly pump out that \"looks good\". \n\nCurious if anyone else feels the same way about this.",

In addition all their marketing is the same too. \n\nIt's fairly easy to separate the spam, but perhaps that's because I've seen so many. \n\nEither way, I don't feel as pessimistic about it honestly. I'm iterating a side project now and all this saas slop is mostly helping me figure out just how to promote it when the time comes. \n\nIt doesn't seem difficult to stand out based on this, but maybe I'll check back here in a couple months to let you know if I regret my confidence.",

The twitter algo picks you're crappy novelty SaaS, a lot of people suddenly pay $5 to you, you get big moneys, and that's it. But that happens for a tiny tiny slice of the population. Most SaaS made by people fail. Some people make great products but can't find the market fit. Others make shitty products in an already saturated market.\n\nWho will win? Whoever can make a product that makes a difference AND has the knowdlege and power to market it (and some luck, ofc). A simple example: I've been looking for an expense tracker app for weeks. The one I use has some flaws. If you search the app store there are +100 apps out there. But there's not a single one which fit my needs and that I consider good enough to use.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to make big bucks building a crappy SaaS, give it a try, it's easy to create the product, it's hard to make it stand out, it's hard to market, and it's unlikely to get it to make money, but it's easy to try I guess",

          "text": "I think most of this post is plain wrong and pretty misleading for the Reddit community — not because “AI good / vibe coding good,” but because it mixes a few real observations with big unsupported leaps and then presents them like market truth.\n\nA few points:\n\n1) “Back then you needed a great idea” is mythology.\nYou didn’t need a “great idea,” you needed a clearly scoped problem, a buyer, and a distribution path. Tons of profitable SaaS are boring, obvious, and iterative. The hard part was always: pick a pain people pay for, position it, sell it, keep them paying. That hasn’t changed. If anything, faster build cycles make it easier to test whether an idea is good instead of betting “hundreds of hours” up front.\n\n2) “Marketing is everything now” is an overcorrection.\nIf “marketing” means “getting attention on X/Reddit/Product Hunt,” sure, that channel is noisier. But that’s not the same thing as “marketing is the primary blocker to profitability.” In most real businesses the blockers are still: willingness to pay, trust, switching costs, onboarding, retention, reliability, support, compliance, integrations. If your product actually solves a painful job and fits a real buyer workflow, you don’t need to win the influencer lottery.\n\n3) You’re confusing “more people shipping demos” with “more competition for customer budgets.”\nThe internet is flooded with low-effort launches because it’s now cheap to publish. That doesn’t mean the market is saturated in the only way that matters: customers already having a good solution they’re happy to pay for. A thousand junk clones aren’t meaningful competition for a product that’s embedded in a workflow, integrates with existing systems, and has support + reliability. Noise is not the same thing as saturation.\n\n4) “Success rates are shrinking because saturation” is a story, not a fact.\nSide projects have basically always failed at high rates. What changed is visibility: more people can ship something, so you see more failures (and more half-baked products) in public. That’s not evidence that the percentage of serious attempts that succeed is collapsing, it’s evidence that the denominator got filled with hobbyist attempts.\n\n5) “Consumers can’t tell trash AI from real products” is backwards in many categories.\nIn B2B and especially regulated/high-trust areas (finance, healthcare, security), buyers absolutely can tell quickly. The moment they hit missing edge cases, poor support, shaky compliance, or unreliable data handling, it’s over. In finance in particular, the barrier isn’t “Stripe checkout,” it’s trust, audits, risk management, and operational competence. AI makes it easier to fake a landing page; it doesn’t make it easier to pass diligence.\n\n6) “Anyone can plug in Stripe and accept payments” is a rhetorical trick.\nA checkout link is not a business. Real billing means taxes/VAT, invoicing, refunds, chargebacks, fraud, subscription edge cases, accounting, customer support, and legal/compliance depending on the domain. Reducing “getting paid” to “plug in Stripe” is exactly the kind of simplification that misleads newer builders.\n\n7) The conclusion (“you have to go niche/local/consulting”) is fine — but the framing is off.\nYes: narrower ICPs, specific distribution channels, and consulting/productized services are often the most reliable path. But not because “AI killed SaaS.” It’s because that was always how you win without an unfair distribution advantage: you find a clear buyer with a costly problem and you solve it better than their current workaround.\n\nA cleaner version of what’s true here:\n— Build is cheaper and faster.\n— Therefore the advantage shifts toward domain insight, trust, distribution, and execution depth (reliability, integration, support).\n— Public launch channels are noisier, so “generic SaaS for everyone” is harder to sell via vibes.\n— But that doesn’t mean “marketing is everything” or that SaaS is now pointless — it means the bar for differentiation and trust is higher.\n\nIf anything, the opportunity is bigger for builders who can:\n— talk to users, map workflows, and ship the unsexy parts (integrations, admin, audit logs, permissions, support),\n— wedge into an existing business process,\n— and sell directly to a defined buyer instead of chasing attention.\n\nSo yeah: lots of AI-made junk exists. But treating that as proof that “the market is absurdly saturated and only a tiny decreasing % can succeed now” is doom narrative, not analysis. The game didn’t become impossible — it became less forgiving to “build first, hope marketing works later,” which honestly was always the most common reason side projects died.",

No developer I've worked with ever knew nor questionied how the magic of some frameworks works - like Vue's proxy or Laravels automatic dependency injection. And no employer ever cared that I know how to develop these things myself. \n\nIn a past job we had very strict bandwidth limitations. I'm talking about limits like 100 KBs of initial load including all assets, so in practise we had like 10 KB left for our code. Common libraries would've taken a lot of that already. I've developed our own little \"jQuery\", our own animation library, and our own basic \"Vue\" specifically for our usecases. Devs, especially juniors, didn't need to figure out these things repeatedly themselves anymore and could spend more time actually coding for the project rather than google how to write an animate function in JavaScript.\n\nWhen I left that job, the only thing that interviewers asked was how much experience I have working in their 0815 stack specifically. It was always easy to show them my knowledge and experience right then and there, but coding the same thing 255 times each month, the same kind of API endpoint, the same kind of UI element, became depressing pretty quickly. From what I've gathered, creativity and deeper-than-surface-level knowledge is rarely asked for. Reasonable - why pay for skill that you don't need in your company?\n\nYour overengineered web app beats every single (frontend) web developer I've ever met by multiple magnitudes already. But that level of skill and knowledge isn't even remotely needed in most companies.",

Deep knowledge of the browser just *amplifies* what I can do with them. I've tried and worked with a lot of frameworks throughout my career. This particular project is built with Svelte plus a few pragmatic hacks -- for example, it shows a boot log immediately and only switches to the desktop once everything is ready. It hides latency without an ugly preloader. And this part is obviously not framework-based.\n\nAnd yeah, I'll be honest: the HR side of things is pretty depressing. Repeating how many years I've used React to people who can only process yes/no answers is draining, especially when that experience barely reflects what I actually know or enjoy doing.\n\nThanks for the compliment -- I really appreciate it.

I don't know if you can guarantee it will involve all the aspects you desire, not at first, but in the long run having a passion for this stuff and \"overengineering\" is what people will notice. At least that has been my experience as doing a similar project helped me at Microsoft and to get my job at Coinbase.",

Once you depart the positions that appear in books, it starts making illegal moves and blundering relatively quickly, which makes sense from the POV of a model that’s generating a plausible next move, not necessarily a good or even legal one.\n\nIn any case, LLMs are not actually doing the things you listed, at best they’re generating code based on what it’s been trained on. When you say “it fixes bugs” I interpret it as you finding the bug, prompting to fix it, and the model spitting out something that looks like a fix, but may still be incorrect, all while telling you it’s all fixed now. After all, if it can actually investigate, find and fix the bug, why was it wrong in the first place? That’s what you’d expect from a human. When you prompt it to plan a system for you, it’s just generating what looks like a plan, but it may be off.\n\nForgive me if I don’t buy that your solo Claude operation generated such a sophisticated enterprise SaaS product when the current poster project for LLM code is a web browser where the heavy lifting is done by a couple of open source libraries, and it still cost a few millions, IIRC, in tokens and API calls.\n\nEDIT: I guess I missed a pretty obvious question. If the LLMs can actually do all that, why not just add \"make it bug-free and secure\" to the prompt, let it take a couple more hours crunching and have a working, near-bug-free and near-secure product? No need to answer that, the API call for any given prompt takes about the same amount of time as the API call including \"bug free and secure\", which means the model didn't actually do any extra work.",

What's the point of a library? Instead, developers used it as a tool and learned to be better programmers. Swaths of programmers came up this way instead of traditional schooling.\n\nI remember when I was in traditional school and we had to learn C# and ASP.NET for frontend. We could just drag and drop full form elements onto the page and students and teachers alike were like: \"This is the future, eventually programming will be obsolete and everything will be drag and drop. For now though, we still have to connect our logic to it.\" That was like, 15 years ago. Sure, the web has come a long way, and a lot of easy things we can just drag and drop now. Turns out that even the companies and their workers don't want to do this, though. They'd rather hire out a company to do this for them.\n\nNot to mention businesses that need unique functionality that makes sense to them and their business, but may not fit anywhere else. Your boss is not going to want to prompt this, implement it, refine it, and deploy it - I guarantee it. It's the reason they have workers below them to begin with: delegation.\n\nEven the most sophisticated AI isn't going to be able to build a fully functional app if it's not given a full, descriptive picture. AI is a tool just as IDEs are a tool, just as search engines are a tool, just as spell-check is a tool. Like all tools it needs to be understood to be used properly and efficiently.\n\nAnecdotally, I find AI responses to be faster almost 10 fold than trying to search the same thing. If I know of a function or method in a framework, but don't quite remember the name or arguments - AI is wayyy faster than searching the docs for the same thing. It's just computation power. 99% of the time when it comes to actual documented framework it's right too which is helpful to me in my projects.\n\nThere's no \"getting rid\" of AI. Being able to crunch a solid subset of knowledge and algorithmly access it quicker than a search API query is super useful in literally all fields. Major governments around the world are using and integrating some form of it. It's in the Open Source communities where it will be perpetuated by hobbyists and professionals alike. Corporations are pushing it and integrating it.\n\nI don't think AI will lead to full automation of all jobs, but there's certainly a subset. The biggest concerns we should have as a society regarding AI is regulation, energy consumption, and UBI. That's what we should be talking about and pushing for.",

I don't particularly have high aspirations as a career goal, but ive built a small build-in-the-open consulting company.\n\nThis fits into what I do perfectly. \n\nOpen-source software has very high ambitions, but struggles in manpower to challenge establishment companies short of massively successful products.\n\nA common tactic for legacy software companies is to offer smaller companies an on-ramp and then lock them down with vendor lock in. For example, Salesforce or Zoho might start as a simple contact manager, but before you know it, you're spending 5 figures a month. \n\nMigrations are hugely expensive and time consuming. A lot of small companies are running very old code bases as a result.\n\nThis let's me punch way, way above my paygrade. Where I would normally push a company to Salesforce, which locks them into costly subscriptions for a simple contact manager, im able to give them a much better, fully open-source application which is tailor made to them. \n\nThis is software developments Napster moment. Software, to me, has always been about software. I give away what I do. It was never about money. I do, of course, need to put food on the table.\n\nI don't think this is going to put me out of work. I do think it will put the people who took the clicks-not-code approach in a pinch.\n\nIt absolutely devalued portions of the industry. However, for enterprising and industrious folks, you will see the total destruction of legacy software vendors and democratization of software and ideas. You'll see a lot better open-source software. You'll see a huge uptick in garbage.\n\nFor the developers who are able to review the code quickly, and understand the big picture, who open-source their software are going to absolutely decimate legacy software like Salesforce, Oracle, parts of Google.\n\nThe whole thing sucks for the industry, but its here.\n\nEdit: ok guys, a nuanced take?!

What's going to happen to those jobs when before there were only 3 plumbers in a 100 mile radius, but now there are 30?

I've got back issues and knee issues. They're well-managed now but I'm fucked if I have to be on my feet or do intense physical labor all day, and I'm far from the only one with such issues. We've raised generations of kids with the idea that they should strive for some stable, high paying office job and some of them have paid the price for it physically. Who's going to be able to afford living at that rate? And we haven't even talked about the advances in robotics which could potentially one day make even things like the trades entirely obsolete.\n\nAnd if you're secretly hoping for something like UBI coming along to save your butt from such an outcome, then I hope you don't live in the US. There's nothing that half of this country hates more than the idea of the government paying people to live without doing any work. It's a non-starter for those people. They would sooner burn the country down than let something like that happen.\n\nThe economy simply cannot survive with so many billions of people all doing the same handful of jobs, at least it won't be any kind of survival that grants the average person any modicum of comfort or dignity.

The main reason is that modern vanilla JavaScript has caught up to what jQuery made easy. Things like querySelector document.getElementById and fetch make DOM manipulation and API calls straightforward without needing a library.\n\n\n\nThat said theres still tons of legacy code out there using jQuery and if youre working on an older codebase youll definitely encounter it. Some WordPress themes and plugins still rely heavily on it. For new projects though most teams have moved to modern frameworks or just vanilla JS. The browser APIs are so much better now that the abstraction jQuery provided isnt as necessary.\n\n\n\nIf youre learning web dev I wouldnt prioritize jQuery. Focus on understanding vanilla JavaScript first and then pick up a modern framework like React or Vue. Youll pick up jQuery quickly if you ever need it since its just a simpler API wrapper around the DOM.",

Every niche has 50 clones, every “simple app idea” already exists, and the vibe around building stuff has gotten so weird. Now there’s “vibe coding,” where people who never really bothered learning a language are pumping out half-baked apps because they saw a tiktok about “making money with A.I\", on top of that, there are whole courses being sold on how to “create apps and get rich” without knowing how to code. It’s like a big circus.\n\n\n\nI’m not even mad at people for trying to improve their situation, but it’s hard not to feel depressed when you’ve put years into learning the craft and the whole market feels like it’s getting noisier and more shallow at the same time. Not to mention the people rooting against you, and saying that you'll be replaced, that you should watch out for A.I so you don't end up homeless... The same motherfuckers who used to go around saying that I.T is the profession of the future and that's where the money is.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall? If you got past it, what helped?

Either the client or the company I work for has dictated it. And I don't really see a reason to use some of the short list of big players that have established themselves.\n\nI've never really coded outside of work. I like coding but similar to your I like solving problems. And I've never had a problem so unique and important that making something myself was the only solution.\n\nAs far as AI - my company has been mandating it. Started out as using the AI Assistant in JetBrains. Which was pretty good. Great for rubber ducking. Debugging vague problems. Filling in some gaps that I have.\n\nWe have now moved on to more agentic coding per leadership. Claude Code is now part of my every day life.\n\nI hate to say it but it has put a little spark back in me. It's something new. Something shiny. Something that can be scripted and customized. I've always loved automation. Removing tedium. Not some new framework or language that's mostly the same thing as the last one.\n\nThere is a feature our product needs. It's not high priority or particularly complicated. It would just take time. But I have a solution in mind. A solution that I probably wouldn't get to do normally because of the time investment. But I really want to tackle it because I know I can architect it and Claude will spit it out in 10 minutes 80% of the way there and how I would have done it.\n\nI learned that you can a great deal of functionality with MCP servers. Found there are already several that can tie into our ticketing system's API. I could put in a slash command and I could pick a ticket, make a new branch, and pull in context.\n\nIt reminds me of when a company I worked for had priced themselves out of WordPress work but weren't pulling in the numbers form the bigger clients. So they decide to invest in a couple robust, developer friendly WordPress builders. I was offended. I know it's just WordPress but I still took pride in the way I did it.\n\nWhat I found out is that it removed a lot of the boring stuff. It allowed me to focus on the handful of important features. Turns out I didn't actually like fussing about making template files and admin forms. I liked solving problems.",

AWS certs, obviously. A+ cert as practice then Sec+ based on what was available locally. 100+ resumes (at that time) later with no responses, I'm 100 pages into the A+ book and I just think \"is this what you're supposed to do with your life?\"\n\nIt didn't help that the propaganda for vibe coding had hit a fever pitch while the deleterious effects hadn't yet become apparent. So I was feeling concerned at that point that vibe coders could actually replace real coders (though my experiences with the two dunces in my office who were doing it should have clued me in).\n\nSo I walked away - Sec+ book still in its wrapper. Sorry if you wanted a motivational story about getting back into this specific field, OP.\n\nI've still got my side gig, it's covering the bills. I have summers off, so I spent half of last summer converting my garage into a shop, doing woodworking, charcuterie/cutting boards. Hopefully moving into furniture this summer.\n\nI'm still coding, though. Working on a Unity game, aiming to have it in Early Access by summer. I have a couple niche website ideas I keep telling myself I'm going to put together and try to monetize.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I'm changing what I build, *and* taking a break from for working for someone else.",

A job for me without creativity/some flexibility will always leave me feeling stale and well redundant. \n\nI understand easier said than done for some people.

      "text": "Would be curious to hear your thoughts both for and against! To be clear, I don't bear any inherent ill will towards Firefox/Mozilla.\n\nI've listened to many podcasts and read many blog posts that advocate for the survival of Firefox (and more specifically, Gecko). The arguments generally distill down to the same idea: \"We do not want to experience IE6 again\" and I agree with the sentiment, I do not want to go through that again.\n\nHowever, as someone who's been building websites since the days of \"best rendered in IE6\", I don't really feel like we're in the same place as back then. Not even close.\n\nIE6 wasn't just dominant by accident, it was far better than any alternatives until Firefox came along (and I was a very early adopter). It was also closed-source and was the default browser on the dominant OS at the time.\n\nToday, we have a variety of platforms (mobile, desktop, etc.) and all of the rendering engines are open-source. Anyone can create a new browser and anyone can influence the rendering engine through the source. There are also several large companies and individuals who are on the standards/recommendations bodies who govern how HTML/CSS/JS develop.\n\nThe current environment doesn't seem conducive to a monopoly even if Firefox and Gecko were to disappear. Conversely, web standard adoption may pick up as Safari and Chrome are often faster to deliver on new features (though kudos on Temporal, Firefox!).\n\nCurious everyone's thoughts. Is it just nostalgia/gratitude that's pushing people to support Firefox or is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: I should've titled this \"Is it bad for the web if Gecko dies?\" as that's the conversation I'm really after.",

Companies want to race so far ahead with features and paradigms that they own from top to bottom, before standardized interoperable protocols get stood up.

We don't know what is going to be yet, but you don't want to get caught flat-footed, and so investing in that now is important.

You had your vested players -- Internet Explorer -- the upstart challenger in Firefox, Apple with Safari for OSX, and then your minor players doing some interesting things (I Still remember when Opera was a browser that shipped with a dedicated ad bar and it was considered *a feature*).  But in 2004 it felt like IE would always dominate browser traffic, they had a 95%+ foothold, corporate/workplace lock in was complete, and it seemed impossible for any challenger to overtake them.  And then by 2012, IE was basically dead in the mindspace of browsers, and very few people saw mobile browsing as one of the mega trends that would unseat them.  I say maybe the exception of Apple because there is a very clear throughline to developing Safari for X, porting it to iPhone OS just a couple years later, that you figure that Apple was having those internal conversations about it.",

          "text": "When it comes to control of the web, it may as well already be dead - Chromium *dominates* the market, and if Google wants to push a standard they get their way, full stop. I don't think this is as catastrophic as it sounds, but it does put the web in the uncomfortable spot where standards that don't align with Google's business interest are unlikely to get any traction. Some years ago, Mozilla tried to push a non-advertising standard for monetizing websites (more or less micro-transactions instead of ads). There were some real issues with the proposal (do you also throw up a bit at \"micro-transactions\"?), but that kind of thing is (and will continue to be) essentially dead on arrival so long as implementations of new standards rely on Google. We're already living in The Bad Place - but outside of a few (real and non-trivial!) issues it's not so bad for most of us.\n\nThere's a couple niches that would feel it significantly worse than others. I work with graphics heavy apps that need to use WebGPU, Firefox maintains their Rust implementation (wgpu) and Google a C++ implementation (dawn). I think it's pretty unlikely to have this kind of diversity around reference implementations with only Google in the game, which I don't love looking forward.",

Forking Chromium doesn’t really fix that — forks follow upstream, they don’t shape standards. \n\nIf Firefox dies, we lose the only major browser that:\n\n* isn’t tied to an ad business (Google), and\n* isn’t tied to a closed platform ecosystem (Apple).\n\nStandards also don’t protect us by themselves. Specs only matter when multiple engines implement them. If Chromium becomes the only serious engine, whatever it ships becomes the de facto standard, regardless of what the spec says.\n\nAnd from a dev perspective, Firefox is still a critical reference implementation. When things work in both Chrome and Firefox, you know you’re not relying on accidental behavior.\n\nSo it’s less “save Firefox out of gratitude” and more “the web needs at least one independent engine to stay healthy.”",

We are slowly finding uses for genetic browsers, one developer can now solo build out product (even if half-baked and riddled with vulnerabilities for the time being) with the help of agents and maybe the hurdle of developing new browsers from the ground up with unique principles and features will slowly start to shrink, opening up the market for better, more aggressive movement on the browser front… but I am probably just being overly optimistic.",

Looking at [2023](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) to [2024](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2024-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) we see a ~12% increase in the rate of app submissions, but also a ~10% increase in the rate of rejections. This isn't a wide-ranging look at the data, but what we can see hardly sounds like an industry that's becoming crazily more productive, *even at shipping crap*.\n\nApart from statistics, shouldn't we be seeing an insane number of new videogame releases, or social networking sites, or Excel competitors, or just... anything?

Those things don't do that, beyond a certain point. If developers are faster, that means they will just be brought more shiny-new-feature-work.

But when people say it makes coding faster, unless you're not bothering to review and understand it, then it can't be THAT MUCH faster. Not at fast lightning speeds. The AI can do what it does, good or bad, at lightning speeds, but not you. You yourself will always have a slow input and output speed at which you can review and understand all the code.\n\nGiven that any speed gained from this, if any, is it really worth the billions going into these data centres, the amount of power they are consuming, for those tiny gains?\n\nLet's not even get started on the dangerous level of information it provides. I am finding a lot of the time it just really doesn't understand things, even simple things.\n\nSeems crazy to me the amount that is needed for AI, and I for one do not see this as a revolution at all yet. Not even close. My life has not changed at all since AI. I genuinely can't say it has made me more productive in any way shape or form. Even when asking it to explain something, I am constantly having to search up the answers myself to confirm because it can get things wrong so much. So would you call that being more productive? Considering before AI I would just search up the damn answer anyway. Now it seems I have this extra baggage of having to ask it something first and then end up doing the research myself.\n\nAt best, AI is just useful to talk to. If you are bored and want to entertain yourself, it's ok I guess. But for using it for anything that requires attention to detail?

To some extent, this lets them kind of print money, because they can give out shares easily, and use that to bid and make deals.\n\nThis incentivizes big companies to hype up the latest tech bubble, regardless of what it is, in hopes that it will last them until the next big thing. This way, near tech monopolies with billions of users can still be seen as growing.\n\nRegarding AI specifically, the claim is that it will be able to replace all those expensive workers and increase productivity, at a fraction of the cost. The incentives are aligned to make software engineers into people who just review AI code all day, and take the heat whenever something goes wrong.\n\nHowever, the current AI setup is extremely expensive and propped up almost entirely by investors, with no foreseeable path to make enough revenue to cover their absurd expenses.\n\nFor the near future, I predict it will continue to be an excuse to fire employees in economic downturns, while still keeping shareholders under the illusion that things are great. It will push the engineers with jobs to churn out slop and be responsible when AI breaks everything. Then the bubble will burst, rich people will make off with lots of money, regular people will lose their retirements, and we'll all be left with an absolute mess of tech debt to clean up, all while big companies look for the next big thing to hype up.",
