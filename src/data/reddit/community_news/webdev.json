With skills/plugins for AI tools, there's often zero review pipeline.\n\nPractical checklist for anyone using AI coding tools:\n\n- **Audit every dependency the AI adds** — run `npm audit` / `bundle audit` after each session\n- **Never trust AI-generated auth code without review** — LLMs love to generate JWT implementations that skip signature verification or use weak secrets\n- **grep for outbound network calls** — `fetch`, `axios`, `Net::HTTP`, `urllib` in any generated code should be manually reviewed\n- **Use allowlist-based CSP headers** — even if malicious code gets in, it can't phone home if your Content-Security-Policy blocks unknown domains\n\nThe hard truth: if you're using any tool that can execute arbitrary code on your machine, you need to treat it like you would a new hire with root access.

They do functionally the same thing - grab data, filter it, format it, and then return it to the GUI. For set A, it builds a custom filter function and a custom format function. For set B, it builds another custom filter function and custom format function.\n\nA smart programmer would recognize that if they built a slightly-more-flexible function that handles the filtering AND the formatting with a couple extra lines of code, they can replace those four other functions.\n\nThe example I'm channeling above went from \\~1,200 LOC to \\~800 LOC after we humans cleaned it up. Probably could have done better, but I was new to using Lambdas at the time, and I didn't know how to have it access a shared master functions file (where I could have offloading the fully-extensible sort-and-filter function entirely). Also, at a certain point, the code \"worked\", and there were higher priorities, so I moved on.",

Green field projects are obviously the easiest but I’ve had good results with more rimless one shorting changes to existing monolith UI.\n\nHowever taking those same tools to the backend has proven a lot less reliable. Mostly because backend dev is very detail oriented so you have to have a very in depth prompt to get the results you want and then often still need massaging afterwards. The biggest pro is I hope this will encourage other devs to write better feature documentation and tickets since you can take all those hours of writing and plug it into your prompt to get 90% done. Working through the edge cases and verifying everything with stakeholders is still a massive bottleneck though and AI ain’t fixing that.  ",

This is how I'm working these days and yeah it's not 15k lines but it's definitely somewhere in the thousands. That's just with open source models and no AI budget so to speak. Imagine if I had actual resources..\n\nThe force multiplication is real but you still have to know what you are doing to get something good out. You get better at working with the whole roulette wheel of it as you go too. \n\nIt's not faster in the incidental sense but there is more happening overall with less. \n\nSome of the layoffs are MBA's jumping the gun but some are not and we are still in the stages where i.t people adopt faster than everyone else. Just wait 5 more years until it has hit every profession in every way. \n\nI already lost my job due to economic forces and that's how I had the time to piss around and retrain for all this nonsense and there is a lot of nonsense! There is also a lot of truth buried amongst it. I hate it all but what the hell else you gunna do. I need to run faster than the next lion about to eat me and this industry has always been that way. The more people taking hard stances against it will be fine, until they aren't. Like that Tyson quote. Everybody got a plan until they get punched in the face. \n\nSo on one hand I'm mad that I had just got my place sorted out after 8 years before they decided I made too much. On the other hand. This break, this gift has me 2 years ahead of many others on the topic. My wife doesn't understand, she just sees me knee deep in .MD docs. My network of i.t friends are starting to ask me if I can make them one off things because I can do it faster.\n\nThe other ones are scared to ask me questions. I try not to talk about it because it upsets a lot of people but at the same time I'm doing more. A lot more and quality is not the issue. I'm a card carrying better offline advocate as well so emotionally it's a turbulent thing to listen and agree with Ed all day long and then open my ide and sell my soul to this. I.t people are going to be seen as no different as people who contribute to oil industry. Business is going to be absolutely addicted to it forever. \n\nAt least when it was Google search back in the dsy. We got to be positive and less cynical about the world. Then spent years lifting people up, educating etc. This is not that. It's the antithesis of that. This is dog eat dog survival unless some unforeseen boom is coming but I don't see it. I just see more enshitification. More broken garbage and a few people who know what they are doing, do a lot more but not be able to easily separate themselves as such.",

I've seen AI generate 3000 lines that could be replaced with 200 lines of well-structured code. The models optimize for 'working output' not 'minimal correct implementation.'\n\nThe actually useful metric for AI-assisted dev is something like 'features shipped per week that survive production for 30 days without a rollback.' That captures both velocity AND quality.\n\nWhat I've noticed in practice: the developers who are most productive with AI tools are the ones who spend 70% of their time *deleting and refactoring* what the AI wrote, not the ones generating the most. -1K LOC days are genuinely the best days.

What an ignoble end. But really it was those years of the free tier than sank them I’m sure /s\n\nNgl DHH quadrupling down on being an untenable, repellent dickhead and the slow motion car crash of Heroku both gave me a bit of a professional midlife crisis last year. I came out a better, happier developer but it didn’t make dealing with those feelings any more pleasant, it’s a real shame when things turn to shit but I thank my lucky stars that I got to come up right before dev bootcamps saturated the market with juniors and sort of broke the sustainability of focused, mentor/apprentice pair programming dynamics.",

Buildpacks, auto-scaling, managed Postgres. Railway's CLI is solid.\n- **Fly.io** — more control (you're deploying containers/VMs), but their CLI workflow is nearly as smooth. Better for apps that need edge deployment or specific runtime requirements.\n\n**If you're comfortable with a bit more infra:**\n- **Kamal** (from the Rails team, formerly MRSK) — deploy Docker containers to any VPS via SSH. No vendor lock-in, you own the servers. Think Heroku-style deploys but to a /mo VPS. Great if you want to understand what's actually happening.\n- **Coolify** — self-hosted PaaS that gives you Heroku-like UI on your own infrastructure.\n\n**If your app is simple enough:**\n- **Hatchbox** for Rails specifically — manages the entire server for you.\n\nThe no-new-enterprise-accounts is the real tell.

By getting the \"this is what service is signed up with that email address\" before authenticating, you allow strangers to learn two accounts that a person has simply by knowing an often public or at least unguarded piece of information about them.\n\nBest practice is to reveal as little as possible about an account to unauthenticated users. That's why it's also recommended that \"forgot my password\" prompts should say something like \"if that email is registered with the system it'll receive a reset code\" rather than \"we've found that account and will send you a reset code\" and why \"this is the wrong password for that account\" messages should instead say something like \"there is no account with this username and password\".\n\nIs it the end of the world? Often no. But it's the best practice because it avoids you having to decide for a user whether them having an account with you is private information. Only they have enough context to decide that and that's often something that needs to be continuously reevaluated as your service evolves, so it's better to start cautiously because you can't undo people finding out your user lists.",

I used to chase that number like it meant something. Now I write tests for business logic and integration points and skip the trivial stuff. A test that checks if a button renders is not protecting me from anything.\n\n  \nAnother one: keeping components \"pure\" and lifting all state up. In theory it sounds clean. In practice you end up with prop drilling hell or reach for a state management library for things that could just be local state. I've gone back to colocating state where it's used and only lifting when there's an actual reason.\n\n  \nCurious what others have quietly dropped.

Destructive actions, core user flows, anything that if it failed in production would be a real catastrophe.\n\nUsually don't waste time writing tests that boil down to implicitly testing library or framework functionality. If a mature library has to have an undocumented breaking change in order for a test to fail, it's probably not a super useful test, except perhaps in super sensitive mission critical contexts.\n\nOften integration or snapshot tests will implicitly cover a lot of unit test cases - in those scenarios the unit tests probably not  adding much extra value.\n\nFor UI, automated visual regression testing tools can and should replace a lot of \"did X component mount\" type testing, and these days can also do a lot of interaction testing as well.",

It's not a true 100% test coverage, because I don't test everything, but it's 100% with explicit /\\* c8 start ignore \\*/ and /\\* c8 end ignore \\*/ statements for code that is not reasonable to test (eg external services, code tested by types anyway, code where its brokenness would come out immediately upon execution of tests regardless of whether they are explicitly tested, and so on). Also, I prefer mutation testing metrics over test coverage as a \"metric\". Test coverage is not really a good indicator for code stability as probably most people here know. \n\nI prefer working it this way a lot, because I'll know based on coverage where I have \"wonky\" code that may not be thought through sufficiently and I can also be almost certain that the code I have written is doing what I expected it to do. Expectations themselves prove wrong at times regardless, but often I can go for weeks without having any bugs in the code like that. \n\nAs I said earlier, I also expect no survivors in my library code when using mutation testing. I've found that often it helps removing excess code and finds very obscure bugs in advance. It also enforces 100% test coverage although you can also ignore parts of the code like with test coverage. Having no survivors in the mutation tests makes the library code a lot more mature and reliable from the start. I've never regretted time spent there, although I think it'd be excessive for UI or even API code. I use it for business logic and anywhere I can have pure functions.\n\nFor very interactive or time-related code - like HTML template generation or FE interactions, I agree with having less than 100% coverage. It is simply so time consuming to test the details it that usually it's just not worth it writing the tests. ",

Before you know it, you have a single block of code with three or four different and competing ideas shoehorned in and, behold, now none of them work. \n\nThere is a certain boundary where DRY interferes with modularity. The one piece of code that handles 6 different things having a latent bug or catastrophic edge case is much more cataclysmic versus a scenario where the 6th slightly different implementation shits the bed. You don't drag down the 5 working cases trying to bludgeon the 6th one in. \n\nBits and bytes are cheap. I only reuse code if I am doing the exact same thing the original code was designed for. And even then, chances are, I am going to rewrite what I had before and make it slightly better with whatever new tricks I picked up since the first iteration (meaning, I'm not technically doing a repeat in the first place).\n\nWriting some God-level function you can reuse through your entire repo in perpetuity is a fantasy scenario that, even if successful, means you are stagnating on a single idea just because it worked once in a particular context. But the habit of saying 'oh, I shouldn't repeat myself, I wrote a function similar to this back a year or two ago... Let me go dig it up...' isn't always an efficient use of your time and can be counter-peoductive when you finally do locate it and there are slight differences that mean you'll end up rewriting a portion of it, anyway. You could have typically cranked out a tailored solution with your latest skill level during that same period. \n\nObviously YMMV, but I used to be OCD about DRY and it is unhealthy. I've been repeating the same CRUD going on 20+ years now. If I was strictly adhering to DRY, I likely wouldn't have changed much about my process during that time. My own improvement was often hindered in the past by leaning too heavily on custom frameworks and libraries I had concocted. Why write new code when old code does same thing? And the truth is, constantly rewriting the same blocks of code, you get better at it. Not just faster, but more efficient, more secure, prettier code.  \n\nKind of an extreme example, I know, but letting DRY rule your workflow process can be poison to not just your repo but your meta progression as a developer.",

Instead of making a \"validateAndLogin\" function, make a bunch of smaller ones like \"validate\", \"login\" etc. Yeah you'll have to repeat *those* functions in a few places, but you can't make your code DRY free. There will always be cases where you just need to plain copy paste boilerplate.",

They run against a fully mocked DOM, rely on mocked props and data, and render components in a headless engine that represents only a small fraction of real user environments, while still consuming significant CI resources.\n\n\nThese tests don’t account for the CSSOM at all and can’t validate whether a user can actually interact with the UI—like clicking a button—across real viewports and devices.\n\n\nIn a world with infinite time and resources, sure, write all the unit tests. But in practice, most teams would get better value by saving those resources or investing more heavily in end-to-end testing, which exercises the system in conditions closer to how users actually experience it. \n\n\nEdit: Clarity ",

The way architectural patterns are applied directly shapes how teams are organized and how knowledge is shared.\nWhile Clean Architecture solves real technical problems, in many corporate environments it is applied in a way that encourages team separation by technical layers rather than ownership of complete business flows. This separation reduces end to end visibility, fragments domain knowledge, and increases coordination costs, even when modern approaches like microfrontends are in place.\nI believe this often indicates that bounded contexts are not clearly defined. When a bounded context is well understood, there is usually less need for heavy layering and abstraction, because a single team can own and evolve the business logic coherently.\nFrom a strategic DDD perspective, technical layers should remain internal implementation details, not organizational boundaries. A good architecture is one that supports business understanding, enables end to end ownership, and keeps cognitive complexity manageable for the teams that work with it.",

If both code *and* intent are the same, then it's the same code.\n\nWhat it means is DRY is not a principle anyone should follow religiously.  It's not that you *should* repeat yourself, just it shouldn't be a goal of the application.  Using DRY as a primary goal creates tightly coupled code that is very difficult to debug and change because it's used in too many places to know what the intent of each place is and how one change can affect unrelated portions of the codebase.\n\n>Not every system is mission-critical, low-latency infrastructure, or some optimized embedded software.\n\nPerformance is a feature.  I am not advocating for extreme measures to squeeze very cycle you can but it's outright neglectful to create solutions that make a client pay excessively more for hosting than they otherwise could.  \n\nI write performance tests for all important code on the hot path and check how it performs relative to other implementations.  If I get one that's 80ns vs 60ns I'm going to chose the one that's easiest to understand and maintain if it's not an order of magnitude higher, but if it's ms vs us then I might choose the us - that's one second of CPU time over 1000 request faster in just one place that you gained for free.  \n\nSame with allocations, if I've trimmed JTW middleware to 120b I won't go out of my way to choose the one that's 80b if it's less maintainable, but if it's at 4KB that's wasteful because it sets a standard to not have waste in your app and if you find enough places to trim without it causing readability difficulties then you could find yourself down a hosting plan.  \n\nThen there's the question of do you even know how much a request is allocating and how much each are of code is?  Have you even checked?  Have you checked the idle heap allocations?\n\nIt's also about practice and learning.  *Can you write code that is low allocations and performant.*  Unless you can and have then you have no business judging if something is appropriately performance tuned because you don't know the range it can exist in and how to plan that.  You need to work with the business to find out what is their goal for the app, do they care about hosting cost.  If no one asked and they were just told *surprise, this is what you will pay each month*, that's gross negligence\n\nLet's take a hypothetical dapper query returning a paged list of 25 results at 25MB/1000 requests.  A comparable tuned EF query will allocate about 150MB/1000 requests.  If you don't know how low allocations can be then you can't even ask a client how important is cloud hosting and performance and be able to suggest to them an appropriate solution according to their response.\n\nIf a client tells me that hosting cost isn't high on the list of concerns and they have a big team who needs to greenfields move fast, then sure I'll suggest a solution that fits accordingly, and that might very well be an ORM and SOLID, but it's not the first place I go without first assessing the requirements.\n\n>SOLID isn’t about making software fast. It’s about making software understandable, familiar, changeable, and survivable when more than one human touches it. And yes, for most web apps, it's optional. For long-lived systems with multiple contributors it's often cheaper than the alternative.\n\nThere is so much to unpack here. Every single letter in SOLID is theoretically a good idea but has plenty of cases where you wouldn't do it.\n\nAs an example, Single Responsibility - *Gather together the things that change for the same reasons*.  A controller typically has the full CRUD in it and no one bats an eye lid.  There's more than one reason you might need to change a controller that is full CRUD.  I'm not saying you should have a controller per verb but at the very entry to your backend you have a common violation of SOLID.  \n\nFor long lived systems it's possibly best NOT to use SOLID and DRY as your primary (and again it's not that you don't do the things in it sensibly, it's that you aren't making yourself *only* do that because it's awesome).  Most of the cost of an application happens during brownfields, you make an app in 6 months to 2 years and it lives in prod for 15.  SOLID very much has a top down view of the world, where it makes the most sense from your controller down not you have a bug in prod in PricingHelper line 65 what's causing this.  Written 8 years ago, used by a base service in a virtual method.  Right how do we change this, what happens when I change this, how are implementers using this, etc etc.",

You don't check for errors, don't try to understand the code, and ship it to live without testing it. This is how you get template-like websites, very common variable names, no customization, and generic designs. It's a lot clearer when someone clearly vibe coded a website into existence, no different from using a Wordpress template, Wix, or Weebly of the past, except a lot easier now. It will most definitely be buggy, full of errors, insecure, and lack any understanding from the person who vibe coded it on how it all works.\n\nIt's extremely different from getting an LLM to generate code to accomplish a task that would take hours of Googling to find how to do it because documentation is either vague or non-existent... It's different when you actually taking the time to look at the code and understand how it works so you can use it in more spots in the future. It's basically a teaching tool in this scenario.\n\nI don't think using LLMs to streamline your work flow is considered vibe coding. Because there's no way for someone to know something was LLM assisted in this scenario, as you spend the time to debug, kill errors, secure things, understand the code, custom design, and most importantly, you make the code it generates yours. You change variable names, you remove redundant variables LLMs love creating for one instance, you spend the time to make it better, and just know what it all does.",

Vibe coding platforms are a tool, and the purpose of a tool is to make a product better or faster. Vibe coding can do that, but only if it's used correctly.\n\nTo successfully implement this across an entire project, you would need very extensive knowledge in both prompt engineering and all the development disciplines you want to apply. That would advance the world of development.\n\nTherefore, I do believe that what you're excluding here belongs to Vibe coding and even corresponds exactly to the perfect application of this tool (you're using a relatively simple query for a specific discipline and have the ability to manually check for nonsense code). It's like with \"normal\" use of LLMs: Check your stuff.\n\nThe conclusion is that the goal is to make the difference invisible and that (partially) vibe-coded software is no worse than \"normally\" coded software.",

There's been way too many times where a company spends months writing PRDs, user stories, design docs, etc, only for the feature to completely flop because it doesn't address the real unspoken need. \n\nIf you're a product manager or other non-technical role, being able to vibe code a prototype, focus group it to users, incorporate the feedback and repeat until you know exactly what you want built is goated.

Forgive the giant wall of text, but this is a story:\n\nI found a job post for an interesting position that I matched so well it was uncanny. It was an amazing, 100% point-for-point match for my skills and experience, like they'd designed it for me. I sent them an enthusiastic email and my resume, and had a good initial phone screen with the hiring manager.\n\nThen he told me I had to do a take-home before the interview. He gave me a totally unfamiliar proprietary, idiosyncratic platform, which hadn't been mentioned in their job post—which he told me he'd chosen because I'd never seen it before. He told me to author several pieces of sophisticated functionality on it, including complex custom procedures using this platform's idiosyncratic paradigm, integrating an undocumented external API, and scripting live cross-process communication... and use AI to get the finished project back to him in two hours. \n\nHis project intro said the two hour limit was \"recommended, not mandatory\". \n\nWhich is good, because Claude Code then proceeded to hallucinate wildly for two hours, confidently emitting heaps upon heaps of garbage that just plain didn't work as promised. As I closed in on the two hour mark, I nearly called the guy and told him to forget the whole thing. But I plowed on. \n\nFinally in about another 45 minutes I managed to cajole a complete working solution out of Claude Code. Not only that, but this solution accomplished the requirements with two fewer fields and one less script than the hiring manager's own solution had. (He'd told me what he thought it would take.) \n\nThe next morning I got an email complimenting that the solution I turned in was more elegant than his own, and, saying that I wouldn't be proceeding to the interview because \"other people got it in in 2 hours.\"\n\nSo, he tested Claude's programming skills instead of mine, and turned me down for even an interview solely because Claude happened to hallucinate for me for over two hours on that day. The next day? Maybe Claude would have solved it in 15 minutes for me and hallucinated for two hours for someone else. Who knows. Seemed like a stupid reason to decline to even interview an exceptionally well-matched applicant.\n\nLater that week, I saw on LinkedIn the CEO of the company reposting the position and complaining that in a month of looking they still hadn't found a suitable candidate.\n\nI let him know what I thought.\n\nI still don't know what vibe coding even had to do with the position they described in their job post.",

That was why we begrudgingly accepted rethinking the entire app development structure with immutable state. \n\nRe-introducing SSR back into the mix is the worst of both worlds, with the only notable argument being that we can still -sort of- take advantage of React components and not be coupled to a specific framework. But, in addition to _yet another dependency layer_, it adds either the complexity of managing another service, or the costs of adding a vendor to run it for you, without the fully integrated advantages of an MVC framework. \n\nI have yet to see the \"SEO factor\" quantified on any level. Google has been able to read React just fine for over a decade, and pre-hydrated content just doesn't meaningfully move the needle on rank. \n\nOr maybe I'm being optimistic about its downfall and that's just my neck of the woods.",

It defaults to being an SPA. But it also has an optional SSR sidecar that runs on H3 through an Nginx proxy (< 5ms latency). I strongly discourage our team from using the SSR sidecar unless the project explicitly requires it. Architecting that sidecar was one of the most illuminating things I've done in recent years. It did NOT give me an appreciation for all the heavy lifting Next.js and Nuxt are doing - it instead solidified in my mind that these hybrid CSR + SSR clusterphucks aren't sustainable.\n\nPeople either need to build a CSR app or build an SSR app with a little HTMX baked into it. Combining CSR with SSR like Next.js and Nuxt are doing is almost always over engineering. Google can index SPAs just fine, and SEO is becoming less relevant anyways because of AI.\n\nReact itself is sadly here to stay despite it being the literal worst of all the major UI libraries/frameworks. I'll take Vue, Svelte, Solid - hell, even Marko - over React. As an aside, I think once Vue's new Vapor mode is released in 3.6, it's going to upset the paradigm a fair bit.",

I'm sure it's all user error, but our code base runs so much quicker on vite, both startup and HMR, it's really worlds apart.\n\nAnd to make things worse, they are now introducing serious security flaws left and right. The non-vercel hosting is also still not resolved.\n\nI've used it as a easy choice for multiple years, I would not reach for it again for new projects, actively moved projects away from it.\n\nIt will not go away anytime soon as it's used so much, but unless they get on top of things I think a silent slow decline is coming.

My advice is to treat the class as a fundamentals course, learn the core ideas behind layout and structure, then mentally translate those skills into modern tools on your own. The fundamentals will carry, even if the software feels like a time capsule.",

To learn true webdevelopment I would suggest learning HTML and CSS since these languages have become very powerful (especially CSS) and allow for complete understanding of how something works (but I am not your teacher giving you a passing grade!

He was very good at getting stuff done but just never updated the way he did things to meet industry standards. Thankfully i never had to work on the code he worked on but he would have been an incredible dev if he just kept up with industry standards which are easier than what he was doing.\n\nSome people just really don't keep up with well established industry standards and its especially prevalent in education. When i was first introduced to webdev the high school teacher taught us image maps as if it was the standard and that was well outdated way back then (fine because a high school teacher shouldn't be held to the same standard as specialized tertiary education). Then i had a uni class where they taught the foundation framework which i criticized that they should have at least been using bootstrap since it was overwhelmingly the \"industry standard\" for that style of UI framework at the time.",

And I think you should focus on that. I can also say that being a software engineer for so long, there are so many random pieces of software that you’re going to need to learn. And about 20% of them will feel utterly stupid. Almost every company I’ve worked at has had some random, kind of silly, software that they’re using just because they’ve been using it for the last 10 years. Learning random software really is its own skill set.\n\nI think Dreamweaver probably has the perfect amount of randomly frustrating shit for you to learn so that you can actually get used to some of the silly things that corporate America will throw at you.\n\nI say that as an alum of several fortune 500 companies and one Silicon Valley unicorn… you’re gonna have to get used to learning random software that you probably don’t want to learn to do your job.\n\nSo for now, I would say just to focus on the basics… And treat dreamweaver as a necessary evil… I feel like you can still learn in this class, but maybe don’t take the follow up class where they do a deep dive into adobe fireworks lol",

          "text": "OP, I get how you’re feeling, and sorry if I go a bit deep here, but nothing in life is guaranteed. Just think about COVID, if someone told us before it happened that the world would shut down like that, we wouldn’t have believed it. Now it almost feels like it never happened.\n\n\nThere are two types of people: the ones who do the work, and the ones who just talk about it. Be the one who does the work. Learn as much as you can: frontend, backend, databases, networking, security, DevOps. Put in the time. Lock in those 10k hours. At this stage of your career, don’t rely on AI to do things for you. Use it as a tool, and do not let it do the thinking and coding, use it as a pair programmer or google on steroids.\n\nMy advice: pick a project and build it from scratch. Learn how to take an idea from zero to a real product. That skill is insanely valuable and will separate you from most people.\n\nLet LinkedIn influencers scream about how AI will replace everyone. Just keep grinding and become a genuinely good programmer. You won’t be out of a job. If anything, companies (and new companies) will need strong engineers to build and manage these systems. If you’re in that bucket, you’re golden. If not, yeah, you might lose your job, but that’s true in any field.\n\n\nThis has always happened. Accountants who used paper got replaced by accountants who use software. That’s normal. There’s a ton of hype right now and everyone is panicking.\n\n\nAlso, honestly, use LinkedIn only for job searching. Don’t get influenced by corporate bootlickers and constant yappers doom-posting for engagement.\n\n\nMost important: take care of your health. Don’t burn out. If you have your health, you can survive whatever comes next. Focus on the present.\n\n\nWishing you the best of luck.",

If you continue to keep learning, I think engineers are all going to be expected to know the full stack and probably dev ops too and really know system design and architecture as these tools let us build faster.\n\nCurrently it is just another abstraction, another high order language. There used to be a bunch of assembly language engineers and then C came out and other higher up the stack languages that offloaded a lot of work to the compiler to all SWE to work faster and teams good be smaller and more nimble. This is one of similar, apps will get bigger and more complex.\n\nThat being said if you are just relying AI to do everything and aren’t actually learning what it is doing and reviewing its code and can only do the very basics in terms of understanding what it is producing and do not care at learning more. Your days are probably numbered.\n\nIt’s very different times. Keep grinder and learning as much as you can.",

Current Ai is limited in terms of scalability as well, there's only so far they can go with LLM design, and it is nowhere near to being an autonomous and independent brain. In many ways the cracks & lies about it are showing now -- For example, Waymo using remote car drivers in call centers overseas.\n\nJust like we saw Social Media, The Metaverse, Web3, NFTs, and now Crypto melt down and fade, what they call \"Ai\" will melt down too and be replaced by another overmarketed scheme.\n\nThe only way to stay relevant & on top of the game is to innovate genuine & original things that last, and that cheaters can't copy easily.\n\nAs a web dev, you're already ahead of most of the working world that doesn't hold any knowledge of how tech works. Use that as a strength, buy a house, make safe investments, avoid running up debt. Let the cheaters & scams burn out.\n\nSometimes we have to buckle down because of rocky roads... In many ways there are speed bumps along the road, but as long as we carefully navigate the path to success without breaking in the process, you'll find that all the hype dies down, and that's when they ask the problem solvers for help...

It will be easier to become a freelancer, since AI can make up for lack of skills in some areas, especially for the quality level required by small businesses. But every customer will always have a crappy vibe coded prototype that will allow him to say: \"the job is almost done, just fix a few things\", when actually rewriting from scratch would be faster and lead to better results. \nThis leads to another issue: I'm noticing a fall in the dev perceived value. Many people's first impression about the job has gone from: \"cool, you must be smart\" to: \"do you think AI will replace you?\". This will just help drive wages down. We're not the \"smart tech guys\" anymore, we're just a liability whose work can be made by anyone with chatgpt (it doesn't matter if it's not true, but perception matters a lot both socially and professionally).",

There's a lot of variability between a modestly sized house and a 20k sqft mansion with a bunker in the basement, even though they may share some of the same fundamentals.\n\nCRUD applications just match a pattern where you're modeling a solution as data objects that you're managing somewhere (database, cloud storage, memory, etc.)\n\nThis is a popular design pattern because in lots of cases it makes sense to model the problem this way. But there are other situations where CRUD doesn't make sense. Imagine you're developing an API to control a robot. You might create some control APIs using RPC and send streams of commands. This is inherently \\*not\\* a CRUD application and while you could try to model it that way, it wouldn't be the best approach.\n\nSoftware engineering is about problem solving and learning different techniques to do so. The ceiling is as high as you make it.",

There are plenty of functionalities that are more complex and go well beyond basic CRUD/posting and updating stuff. Generally everything online will have a database so it can store and keep record of what you posted, like this Reddit post, but that doesn't mean you can do everything with just that.\n\n\nAn example would be like implementing an algorithm for Doordash so couriers can be assigned to orders and creating a queue stack for it. Or imagine you're making a browser game and getting into 3D and vector territory which has fuck all to do with CRUD and can be quite complex (fairly big industry considering how big online gambling is). There are also plenty of common backend servers running that have no frontend and nothing to do with CRUD - web hooks, processing or automation scripts, crawlers, etc. ",

So the second is kind of derived from the first.

You need to intercept people right after signup and guide them to that moment not with docs, but with an actual interactive walkthrough.\n\nUsers don’t hate being guided during trials. They actually want it. If you say, Hey, let me show you the fastest way to get value, most people are relieved.\n\nTrigger a tour on first login. Have it walk them through your high value action with tooltips and highlights. Tools like Hopscotch or Userflow make this easy without code. Test it for two weeks and compare conversion rates. You’ll probably see a huge difference.\n\n",

Something else to consider is that yes maybe that action converts at much higher rate, but how much of that conversion is because the people who stuck around and looked around long enough to find it only did so because they were already a more serious prospect.\n\nIt's probably a lot honestly. Even if you make this thing stand out and guide people right to it perfectly, you'll still probably only see about 10% conversion rate within the same time frame\n\nI mean, double the sales is still insane. But don't expect quintouple the sales.\n\nThen once that works you get another issue, there will be another choke point that converts the most users... Back to the drawing board.\n\nThis is why everyone says to make a new user walkthrough. Show everyone all the best features and how to access them right off the bat. The next trickiest part is making sure that stuff is as easy as it can be to access, otherwise you'll convert a ton but then have users dropping like flies when they get frustrated and during that time your support staff will be dying from floods of emails and calls.\n\nThen again, it could be that this feature is what 90% of users are looking for in your app and when they don't find it right away they go to the next competitor in line instead.",

People can give me long detailed explanations, but I will still be blank until I actually get my hands on whatever I need to do.\n\nI was never able to understand the basics of grammar, and the school books were completely useless. The only way I could learn English was to watch tv and read English books so I could see how people spoke to each other.\n\nI have always liked to take machines apart and put them back together to understand how they work. \n\nNow I realized that this is how I code, and while some call it a strenght, I personally struggle because of it. \n\nI have been working as a full stack developer for 5 years despite actually being a UX designer. I was lucky to have a boss who was open to my way of learning. He asked me if I could use Vue, Java Spring and SQL. I said nope and he replied \"Meh. I am sure you will figure it out\", so I did.\n\nSo for years I have been working on large scale applications for a PropTech company, setting up integrations, unit tests, doing debugging with SSH commands, managed complex queries etc. but if you ask me any basic question about Java or how to do something from scratch I have zero clue. I have watched countless of videos and even paid for courses, but my mind simply cannot wrap around any of the concepts.\n\nI need to see the code, take it apart, see which parts does what, and then I can come up with a solution.\n\nThis was all well and good until I lost my job and had to go to interviews. I am still jobless because I simply can't answer any technical questions. It sucks, but there is only so much one can do when the mind is shaped in certain way.\n\nIf anyone else here have this thinking pattern, how did you overcome it / embrace it?",

Do you understand basic web infrastructure and networking? What databases are you familiar with? What cloud providers have you worked with? What are different caching strategies? \n\nThese are random questions I thought of that have nothing to do with code, but most senior engineers would have an answer to or thoughts about.\n\nSo I'd second what other people are saying, you probably have ADHD and should see a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis (don't just start taking some friends pills).\n\nBut I'll also be blunt: You need to figure out a way to learn. You're memorizing, experimenting, and repeating. Getting ritalin is not a magic pill that will fix all of this for you. \n\nIt's super valid that you're more of a hands on learner, but no one is going to give you a job trusting that you'll just figure it out one you get your hands on it. So if you're a hands on learner, you need to learn in a hands on way.\n\nHave you ever built and deployed a fullstack app? If the answer is \"no\" then that's a problem. If I were you I would go through building a fullstack app, with a backend repo, frontend repo, infrastructure as code (use terraform), leverage CI/CD (GH actions is fine), and deploy it to a real url.

          "text": "You're just a pattern learner rather than a conceptual learner, and the tech industry's interview process is brutally biased against your type of intelligence. The real kicker is that your learning style probably makes you better at the actual job than half the people who can recite design patterns and Big O notation in their sleep. You've proven you can build and maintain complex systems for five years, but now you're stuck in this absurd situation where you can't get hired because you can't perform in an artificial quiz show format. The solution isn't to force yourself into a different learning style - it's to find ways to demonstrate your actual abilities during interviews. When they ask theoretical questions, redirect to concrete examples from your work, walk them through actual code you've written, or ask if you can show how you'd approach a problem by working through it in real-time rather than explaining it abstractly.\n\nYour best bet is targeting companies that do practical take-home assignments or pair programming interviews instead of whiteboard theory sessions. Smaller companies and startups are often more flexible about interview formats, and you can sometimes negotiate the structure if you're upfront about your strengths early in the process. Frame it positively - you excel at understanding existing systems, debugging complex issues, and learning on the job, which are incredibly valuable skills that many developers lack. If you're struggling to get past the initial screening, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you prepare responses that bridge the gap between theoretical questions and your practical experience - I built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of interview challenges.",

All of my work revolved around joining existing large scale projects so I never really got to build a project from scratch. I took a year off and came back to an ai filled industry and much more demanding interviews. It took me three times longer to land a job now than it did any time in the past. I’m talking 10-15 interviews in the past and today close to 40. \n\nFirst of all, don’t lose hope know it’s ok to feel down and doing interviews suck and make you feel like shit, but it’s a period that has an end. \n\nStart with the basics. Go watch videos about the fundamentals, start a project just so you get used to writing code. \nMost important thing to do is from each interview list what don’t go well or don’t know about and stud those topics. You will start seeing there’s a pattern to these interviews and a few topics they usually focus on. But the thing is you got to keep at it. Send resumes out, contact people on LinkedIn and play the game. \n\nI started taking vyvance and it has been life changing. I stopped taking Ritalin because of the side effects and vuvance has really been an eye opener about how much adhd affected my productivity and ability to learn. \n\nAgain, it sucks and depressing, the market is rough right now but it’s not impossible, and once you land a job you don’t need to think about any of that anymore.",

It also helps that I have built pretty much everything there is to build in webdev from LMSs to CRMs in my 15 yoe. So more likely than not I have already built what the client is asking me to build.\n\nTLDR: it kinda sounds like you're maybe a little weak in your algorithms, is that the case? \"Thinking in code\" is very rarely necessary in any kind of software development, but if you can \"think in algorithms\" it's fine.",

Prepare a summary of how your different way of thinking has impacted the teams you've been on and the challenges you've faced and overcome. If they want to verify this, a technical test—not a theoretical one, but a real-world problem that can be tackled in a reasonable amount of time within the context of an interview—would be ideal. I have the opposite profile to yours, and I don't know, but I think yours is more prevalent in programming, and you do it very well.

We fixed the messed up UI, fixed all the backend bugs, cleaned up the DB in just a few weeks.\n\nHe ended up going back to hiring the original developer of the app, who was way cheaper, who then wrote a long series of emails as to why what we did was terrible and inexcusable.\n\nHe spent 6+ months on the app, after getting it back from us and what we fixed, to just write those emails. I'm not joking, he was a full time employee for that company to just manage that app, and in 6 months he did not make any updates or changes, just \"analyzed\" our changes to shitpost those emails\n\nMost of his concerns were fringe. Talking about things he didn't know about. He talked so much about prioritizing security, this and that. It was a fuckin' React app, not tied to anything critical or vulnerable. He also wrote long email chains about performance, trying to sound smart because some of the js files could've been reduced by a few bytes lol. The kicker was when he talked about the server, and how it was utilizing maximum CPU, but he didn't know that those cloud servers display CPU data based on cores (so 100% would be 1 core in full use, 200% would be 2 cores, etc). When the server would process something like a database migration, one of the cores would naturally spike up, bro wrote a huge email as to how that was unacceptable",

No frameworks, just PHP querying a MySQL database and barfing the query results out onto the page. If one team's app needed data from another team's app there was no API or data model, someone in operations would just configure iptables to allow their app server to access the MySQL port, and then configure MySQL to allow them access to whatever table. They were then free to do whatever with the data with the only constraints being those defined on the table.\n\nThere was another web app written by someone else in BioInfo in Lua. I poked around the repo once and just saw a bunch of SELECT statements in the code, with the results again barfed onto the page. After some more digging, I found out that all of the business logic for this app was handled in trigger functions within the Postgres database. Further, someone had installed [Lua as a procedural language for Postgres](https://github.com/pllua/pllua), so some of the trigger functions would invoke a web request from the database to some other application server on the network.\n\nThat place was wild.",

No tagging in such versions. Only way you tell what’s shipped in each version is by looking at master branch (and assuming the fucker didn’t change production manually, which he often does). Master branch is a black hole of its own atrocity. No fucking sense of what git is for. \n\nI want to quit tbh. No one seems to care. Infra goes down often and only he can fix it. He’s burn out and I’m supposed to relay him but every time I try to change things, my PRs don’t make it through him, as kiddo needs explanation of very basic things. I feel we must agree we should redo things from scratch, and bite the bullet, knowing prod must go down to realise the impact of this shit.\n\nI miss the muddy but structured piece of shit repo we had in my last job. I miss having to fight bugs not people. I miss so much not having to deal with incompetent senior engineers that can’t see further than their own comfort, making a mess become normalised and crying because they’re tired of being the only ones fixing it.

In the middle of endless repetition of cURL setups, you'd occasionally find helpers used in some places but ignored in others, alongside near identical helpers under different names in some other file somewhere. Sometimes even mixing and matching. From the comments too there were messy hotfixes that were meant to be tidied up but just never were.\n\nIt's number one for the most fragile codebase I've ever worked on.

It caused me to develop some bad habits, and it caused me to have 12+ hour working days the first year or two.\n\nGranted, I learned so much in those first couple years that I'm confident in being able to do just about anything now - from frontend to backend in several (or any at this point) languages and with common design patterns to writing complex database queries with 44 left joins to automation scripting to devops/server and web server management to whatever the fuck else because I've dealt with it all already.\n\nThe job is A LOT easier now, but I don't know how many people can survive that first phase. At least I had the privledge of programming before AI was a thing, it's only going to be harder for everyone after and AI will screw them up way more than they think",

Yes, AI has made the whole problem worse, because it's so much easier for anyone to create code, even if they have no idea what they're doing. At least back before AI, a junior would need to have _some_ idea about what they were copy/pasting.\n\nAnother issue is that pipelines and tooling have gotten more complicated now. Back in the day, a junior could knock up some HTML with jQuery pretty easily, and push it via FTP. Now there's all kinds of frameworks and libraries with their own complexities, dozens of build tools, and even JS has many extra features which just never existed before.\n\nThe last part is that now managers and team leads _expect_ more and more from developers. If a junior _isn't_ using AI to produce their code, they will be left behind those who do. This further compounds the issue that the juniors are producing things that they don't understand.\n\nI don't think training is much of an issue. I don't recall any kind of training ever happening back in my career, beyond the very rare mandatory things pushed by HR. Now, I'm not saying that training _wouldn't_ help in this new AI era, but in a world where management are using AI to _reduce_ costs, I think this is not likely to happen.\n\nWhen the AI bubble bursts (and it will) then _maybe_ the bad management will finally lower their expectations to a reasonable level. However, I think we will have a gap of experience amongst devs in a year or so.",

No.  If you are not professionally competent in a discipline, you should not expect people to pay you and tolerate your mistakes until you learn.   That's not how apprenticeship works.  The first month on the job as an electrician's apprentice you're basically just sweeping floors - because that's all you're competent to do.  You're not an electrician, you should not expect to get an electrician's job or pay. Same with development.\n\non the hiring side: that you deserve mid-level competence/performance from someone who you pay entry-level wages.  It's not wrong to hire an entry-level worker, but you need to be very realistic about what the extent of their competence is.  The reality is, most jr devs are only actually capable of building a react component, using some sort of pre-built css framework to style it, and managing the local state of that component.  It's ok to expect a jr to be professionally competent at that.  It's not ok to pretend that they should be more competent.",
