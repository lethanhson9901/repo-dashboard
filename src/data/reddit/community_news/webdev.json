      "text": "I worked for a boutique e-commerce platform. CEO just fired webdev team except for the most senior backend engineer. Our team of 5 was laid off because the CEO had discovered just vibe coding and thought she could basically have one engineer take care of everything (???). Good luck with a11y requirements, iterating on customer feedbacks, scaling for traffic, qa'ing responsive designs with just one engineer and an AI. \n\nBut the CEO doesn't know this and thinks AI can replace 5 engineers. As one of ex-colleagues said in a group chat, \"I give her 2 weeks before she's begging us to come back.\" \n\nBut still, the point remains: company leaderships think AI can replace us, because they're far enough from technology where all they see is just the bells and whistles, and don't know what it takes to maintain a platform.",

FE dev by training, but did _everything_. Front end, Shopify backend, product management, seo optimization, ADA compliance, discounts and promotions, 3rd party app management, etc. Basically anything that touched the website was my responsibility.\n\nThe Director of Marketing thought she could handle that stuff (mainly because of the Shopify custom development I had set up), so I was laid off.\n\nFrom what I heard, she lasted 3 months before she either quit or was fired. Unsure which.\n\nI was out of work for 7 months.\n\nFortunately, I landed in a position which is 1000% better. Part of a team working for a well known company. I only build front end components now. I don't have to wear 12 hats anymore. Work life balance again.\n\nGood luck to you!",

It’s not for everyone, but sometimes, like here, you get this opportunity anyway. I had a strong tendency to be „loyal” to my employer. It doesn’t work like this in capitalism.

I think Amazon did this a few weeks back. It's just so irritating and it makes me think that you might as well go into business for yourself because a job is never guaranteed.",

When hundreds of billions of dollars flow into an industry and CEOs are selling big promises and shiny demos, the people raising funds benefit first, not the teams doing the real work.\n\nThat narrative makes non-technical leadership believe complex products can run with very few engineers, ignoring everything that goes into accessibility, maintenance, iteration, and scale. AI can help, but it does not replace engineering judgment or ownership.\n\nJust one reference that explains this gap well:  \n“There is enormous pressure on companies to show that they are able to replace employees with AI tools.

Obviously, it was not a good idea to fire all of the fronted developers en masse, but I feel too many of you have your heads buried in the sand. AI can (and will) successfully replace many developers. I have been a web developer since ‘95 and was a client (web and mobile) architect for a Fortune 20 company for the past 9 years. \n\nJust because this person in charge was obtuse about her decision making doesn’t mean your days are not numbered. We had 10,000 web developers in our organization, and wouldn’t be surprised to see more than half of them (probably 2/3) reduced by 2030. \n\nWhen you take capable devs and pair them with Opus 4.5 you can remove a junior or mid-level developer from the team. Sorry, but that is reality. If this CEO was smart, she would have given each developer the proper training and access to Claude Code and in three months she could have reduced her frontend team to 2-3 developers. This sounds like a very small shop, but of there were product owners, they would be able to take the place of some developers as well. \n\nLearn to use the agentic coders, qa, devops, and product assistants. Bend them to your will using systems like AgentOS from Builder Methods or other similar PROCESS-driven approaches to age tic development. You might be surprised by how capable they are right now. \n\nRemember, developer capabilities are a bell curve. This technology has the potential to remove the lower tail of that curve today. By 2030, we will be left with the upper tertile.\n\nEdit: I expect to be downvoted into oblivion, because Reddit, and the level of complacency and insouciance in this forum. I’ll wear every downvote as a badge of honor because those that do are the first ones who are going to find themselves retraining for that barista job. (No shade to baristas)",

          "text": "Years ago I was replaced as an FTE freelance developer on retainer with a set of outsourced developers from very far away. It was pretty abrupt. The cost reductions were significant. I think those developers charged maybe 1/10th what I was asking, and I was already underpaid given my education and experience. \n\nAbout a month or so later I was contacted by the CTO asking how much I would charge for on-demand consultation to help these developers understand the codebase, requirements, and local culture. I asked for 2x, and was promptly ghosted. Apparently, urgent matters are not urgent if they cost money. Developers are constantly pushed to be more productive, efficient, and available, but that isn't a two-way street. If you're running a business, you can go without a functioning system for weeks if it means saving a little money. \n\nIn my example these developers were not unskilled. They were good developers. Good developers can learn any language, principle, system, or technique, if you pay them to do so. It wasn't about the language barrier. They spoke English perfectly. But there is a cultural difference that causes friction. What incentive did they have to adapt to the local culture? To understand the needs of users? To adapt and anticipate issues from demographics they were totally detached from? Were they even ever in a position to do so? Lots of friction. \n\nWe're witnessing a new cycle of outsourcing developers overseas, but this time with AI. Companies will absolutely choose AI slop if it saves on costs, even if it destroys the business in the process. They can go without a functioning system for as long as it takes to save on money, even if that means the business closes. There's always another company to consume later. \n\nYour CEO probably isn't going to come back 2 weeks later and beg you to come back. If they do, it will only be for so long as they can get the AI slop machine working at a bare minimum. A decision has been made to undervalue developers, and no amount of reality will change that decision. We like to believe that companies will learn the hard way their mistakes. They won't. It's best to put your energy into finding your next role.",

It's very good at writing things that have already been written, or taking half-formed ideas and correcting the syntax and looking up usage. But it's not creative and the wild tangents it can go on are often a big time suck. Managers need to hear that AI is a great set of tools for devs to use, but for any nontrivial codebase, nobody's agent-moding out major changes who didn't have the skill to write them in the first place (and it's often slower).",

Which is what I would advise to everybody who is now looking for work: go for something that you know will need people in the next 20 years. Which means more specialized jobs and assignments and getting the knowledge to take them on. Because sure, AI can't do much on its own now, but eventually the tools get better and people who don't know better, will be fine with what it can come up with. Most people don't need anything fancy. They just need it to work and to get found and/or sell stuff online. Thats not where the fun of this profession is going to be at.",

But letting one dev would've been absolutely cost effective for her in reality. The AI will continue to get better, and less people will become more and more common. I say this as someone that was laid off from Java development all the way back in late 2023 (along with 75 others on the same day), and that was EARLY. This will happen more and more every quarter, then every month, then every week. It's just a matter of when. You can try to find a new job, but I reskilled. I feel TERRIBLE for college kids that got a degree in dev in the past 5 years. I feel even worse for the ones in it now with a year left and already see their prospects drain away before they even have the degree in their hands. Must be how a gender studies student feels normally! (I'll let everyone decide whether this is in jest or not for themselves.)\n\nJust remember, human labor for web dev and coding in the AI revolution are the white collar equivalent of wanting to use a shovel to dig, a scythe to cut, and an oar to row after the industrial revolution. The tech for machinery and steam at first is not as common and primitive with questionable success rates for replacement. But it shortly became the case that anyone in 1940 (and certainly way earlier than that) using a scythe to collect crops or a shovel to dig a ditch is just a luddite, stubborn, and frankly not a farmer/constuction manager to take seriously moving forward. No one in their right mind would hire a human to do what a machine can do in literally 1/16 of the time at cost. It's not even ethically questionable anymore - you yourself would never expect them to, and rightly so.   \n  \nWe are early in the AI revolution, but it IS here, and you can't stop it. This all just gets worse, and I HIGHLY suggest some of the more stubborn and smug I see in this comment section to take that more seriously. Because by the end of 2026, the CEO of this company won't be the laughing stock, she'll be the one laughing. But take solace in the fact that it will come for her too. In the Industrial revolution, new jobs were created for reskilled workers. But what are we to do when the new jobs created can ALSO be taken by the tech that made them obsolete? I don't know.

People who make decisions like that almost never reverse them, because doing so would require admitting they misunderstood the work in the first place.

Leadership will rationalise each failure as \"teething issues,\" \"roadmap trade-offs,\" or \"execution problems,\" rather than confronting the original error. Companies are very good at failing slowly while insisting they are still right.\n\nWhat matters for you is that none of this is a reflection of your value or the trajectory of good engineers. Strong engineering is not replaced by AI; it is obscured temporarily by people who don’t understand the difference between generating code and owning a system over time. The market will correct, because reality always asserts itself eventually. Engineers who understand maintenance, scale, feedback loops, and responsibility will continue to be scarce.

However, this has been the growing trend for decades. However, now it’s exponential and non-tech people are impressed by what they can see. This excludes the wild Covid hiring boom with crazy low interest rates. Terrible time to be a junior and companies aren’t figuring out what’s next \n\n(B) Also hard for the frontend devs as not all frontends are equal. Outside of highly specialized marketed projects, backend developers might have to shift more to full stack for the same pay \n\n(C) the bottom 473 companies of the S&P 500 are growing slower than inflation. AI is a great excuse to lay people off in mass…and undue the mass hiring of boot camp grads from the pandemic. Obviously, some self-taught devs are amazing, but it’s easier for companies to eliminate entire departments than make nuanced decisions on individual basis. Mass punishment on employees for their mistakes. This economy is a facade being held up by the AI buzz. \n\nDeeply knowledgeable developers with business domain knowledge will remain vital and probably have to rewrite slop",

I was making a point of not soaking in the context of the generated code to really put myself into the shoes of a vibe coder.\n\nBugs, spaghetti code, zero knowledge of what the hell you’ve just generated. And trying to dig myself out of this mess purely through prompts alone was impossible.\n\nI came away with the realisation that this tech is wildly overhyped, and without strong technical skills its usefulness is severely limited.\n\nI can’t say how this will change in the next few years, but right now the experience has certainly relaxed me.\n\nRight now I think ai is just replacing the lowest hanging fruit, just like how Wordpress eliminated the need to build websites for your local plumber.\n\nSo in 2026, I’m done worrying about the tech CEO hype to pump the AI bubble. Looking forward to the inevitable burst.\n\nEdit: Sorry I can’t reply to all messages. I used Claude Code with the latest Opus model.",

This means mostly coding interactively with something like Claude Code or some other highly agentic tool. I also haven’t had huge success with this approach. I don’t think it’s laughably bad or anything and it’s actually pretty impressive in the sense that we’re even able to do this at all.\n\nBut just using something like Cursor with its autocompletion and occasional interactivity for small scale asks is another story. It’s a monstrous gain in productivity, and I’ve been coding for about 15 years as well.  But because I *have* been coding for so long and most of this stuff is second nature, it’s difficult to put myself in the shoes of a junior and understand if they’re able to use it as effectively as I can. Like, my real fear with all this is that it *may* close the gap between junior and senior devs. But it may also expand the gap. At this point I’m really not sure. All I can go on is my own experience at the large company I work at, and in the past couple of years since I’ve fully integrated Cursor into my workflow I’ve outperformed the rest of the department by an even larger margin than I did before. \n\nIt’s just a simple anecdote, but it leads me to think of AI as sort of a skill *multiplier*.  A junior will be more productive than they were before, but the more skill you have the more AI will improve it. This bodes well for the industry so long as there’s not an upper bound on how much demand there is for software. There absolutely *are* (largely non-tech) companies who will hire half the developers if their developers can do twice the work, but there are other companies with no limit to how much software they need and they’ll buy as much of it as they can.\n\nBut the short term will be bumpy while we have middle management thinking they can do more with less and the product teams thinking they can just write a prompt and get an app. AI may be a skill multiplier but it’s also a Dunning-Kruger multiplier.\n\nAnother side point that no one outside of code truly seems to *get* is that debugging is harder than writing code. I probably *am* more productive than my colleagues because I *am* good at debugging. The final 1% that you’ll need to “finish” your vibe-coded project even under the best circumstances will take as long as the first 99%, and if you’re not a programmer then you quite literally will never be able to get to end while you try to vibe code your way through the hardest part of the project.",

With juniors, I work with up to 5 of them, they can perform multiple tasks in parallel. Often review the code and get them to explain what they did. If they use AI generated code without understanding the logic, I get them to rewrite until they understand. After 3 to 5 of iterations, they got it and the code quality improved drastically. Things get done correctly after that with just a high level explanation and direction of how to implement them. For example, migrate from Angular 12 to Angular 21, migrate from python 3.8 to 3.13, add SAML support, rewrite new rules for custom role, and integrate with ADFS. They get done on schedule. Good luck in using AI as their replacement. Seriously I don't see how working with AI can be better than working with junior programmers. The most useful aspect of AI at the moment is to generate simple code snippets and looking up API documentation (often not correct or unable to find them).",

The better and cheaper the AI gets (particularly Chinese AI models now), the more software will be created because human desire for software is limitless.\n\nThere is already an explosion of startups with extremely small development teams.  They are sprouting up at lightning speed all over Silicon Valley with all manner of new software offerings.  This was all made possible by vibe coding, so the future is brighter than ever for coders and the software industry in general, especially coder-entrepreneurs.\n\nThese startups tend to also reach profitability sooner than startups in the past because they have far lower payroll expenses (usually the largest expense by far for any company).  This is another reason so many AI startups are popping up and more are getting founded every day.\n\nBigTech companies will also eventually hire back all the coders they’ve laid off recently and then some because they will dream up and pursue new software offerings that they’ve never considered before or that were cost-prohibitive to begin with.  Now they can pursue them because vibe coding makes producing software cheaper and more cost-effective than ever before.  When the price of producing software falls, BigTech wants to produce even more to maximize its revenues.  Vibe coding isn’t just about cutting headcount to minimize expenses but also increasing headcount to develop new software to maximize revenues.\n\nSay a company required 10 workers to produce 100 widgets but, due to some technological advancement that boosts productivity, now only 2 workers are needed to produce the same 100 widgets.  Does this company stop there and call it a day?  No, it eventually hires back 8 workers so it can produce 500 widgets (or 250 original widgets plus 250 newfangled widgets) and increase its revenue 5-fold!  So the same 10 workers are now producing 5 times the revenue as before.  Then, the company hires 10 more workers to double its revenues even further (and on and on)!  Capitalism isn’t just about minimizing expenses but maximizing revenues!  Productivity gains help companies cut expenses but, more importantly, help them GROW by increasing and maximizing their revenues and profits like never before (which is what shareholders ultimately want much more than merely cutting expenses).\n\nIn this example, each worker’s productivity got boosted 5-fold.  Likewise, when each individual coder’s productivity is boosted by AI, he becomes far more valuable to companies than he ever was before.  So while tech companies are trying to minimize expenses now by shedding workers, they’ll eventually return to their main goal of maximizing revenues, profits, and shareholder value (stock prices) by hiring back many coders who now are far more productive than they ever were before thanks to AI.",

What won't be accomplished by the AI, will be achieved through enforced \"personal gratitude\", essentially having to push much harder in exchange for the \"privilege\" of having kept your job.\n\nI used the company's ClaudeAI subscription with its VSCode plugin. I set up common instructions in the file claude\\[dot\\]md, things like reusing as much of the existing abstractions, instead of creating new ones, some solution conventions to uphold, the use of explicit typing in both the front-end SPA framework and the back-end, etc.\n\nThe feature to develop was a Settings page with multiple tabs, the design of which was provided as PNG mock-ups. Most of the work was front-end, with some aspects of back-end, such as new validations, and connecting the new front-end to an updated back-end controller.\n\nWhile ClaudeAI took its sweet time with creating code, it essentially did most things right the first time around, in about 20 minutes. I had to tell the AI to feature the strings present in the mock-ups precisely, rather than approximately, a common AI issue, which it then corrected. I then told it to ensure the Save and Load functionality from the front-end is properly integrated with the back-end controllers, and, finally, to merge two back-end controllers, and refactor some business logic in the back-end.\n\nIn about an hour of prompting, the AI performed what would have taken days of work, even for experienced developers, to not only a functional standard, but while also preserving the solution's coding guidelines and conceptual integrity, and maximizing the reuse of existing abstractions.\n\nI don't know how to feel about this, on the one hand the progress from older models, like gpt-4o-mini, is spectacular, on the other the numbers game won't work in developers' favor. For entrepreneurship the advantages are remarkable, but for corporate work the reductions in personnel will be inescapable, I'm afraid.\n\nThe new Gemini 3 also works very well, and has great solution-wide awareness, but I've only used Gemini for assisted coding, rather than vibe coding.",

Incomplete prompting aside, a lot of that is due to the non-deterministic results. Sometimes you run the same prompt another time and you get a much better result.\n\nSo often our experience with this approach is a matter of small sample sizes.\n\nSo a growing paradigm is creating many custom agents, some with different models, different engineering focuses, etc. Of course you want testing and perhaps some static code analysis, too. Then you create a custom agent which will act as an orchestrator for the others, a tech lead. And you have the orchestrator spin up multiple parallel attempts in _separate_ copies of the repo. Then have it summarize the differences. Then you review the various results and pick among them, merging back into your canonical repo.\n\nBasically, you make each agent prove itself to you. You iterate and improve the system prompts, user prompts, and harness. But you keep the parallelism as a defense against non-determinism. Once your trust level has been built up, you might even add an automated (but not final) code review to streamline your manual intervention at the end.\n\nI'm not there yet (I'm spending more of my time making sure no one on my team is stuck  than writing code myself). But I've been seeing this paradigm evolve over the last couple years, and I really think we'll see some exciting advancements in that direction this coming year.\n\nIt's got me looking for ways to teach my juniors tech lead skills earlier in their career.",

Gave it a nice one pager effectively on what I wanted planning mode to do, what the app would do, where we should consider something’s but not intend to implement them yet (eg user accounts and roles). Told it to come back with clarification questions. It came back with like 31 questions. I responded thoroughly and told it to keep asking. It had a few follow ups and one aspect of slightly complex logic that it stumbled on but once I gave it the official technical spec from a rule book it understood. \n\nFrom there it took the plan that was broken into 6 phases and 5 diffferwnt markdown files and we went thru them from bootstrapping the app to actually adding pages and features. Now I fully admit this app at its core is mostly pages and forms, so not the most complex thing ever by far and it has done a solid job. Had it fix a few things that were strange like entering costs in cents. And I have yet to see if once I implement the api and database if everything will work but with mock data it is behaving pretty well. Sure tons of room for improvement still, and def need to check thru for security issues etc. I’m sure account management will be fun, but considering after a day and probably less than 6 hours of on and off promoting and reviewing, I’m fairly impressed. \n\nWill it replace me… no, not yet, but I am worried, but as long as I can use it as a tool to advance myself it is very powerful.

One does have to be knowledgeable about the ask in order to steer the AI in the right direction and keep it on track. It is getting better over time of course. I agree, I think it still has a ways to go before it replaces any significant chunks of any workforce. And further, those that learn to use it will likely be the ones who survive the cuts.\n\nJust like typewriters, word processors, and spelling/grammar checkers. People had to learn to use them or risk losing their jobs. Yet, human editors are still an in-demand thing because they can use those tools to their benefit while still adding a human component that machines can't yet replicate.\n\nIn terms of coding specifically, I personally have to resist the urge to delve into AI-generated code and rewrite chunks into reusable methods, modules, etc. - things that would otherwise be an absolute nightmare to maintain manually.\n\nIf the person using AI doesn't care what the great and wonderful Oz (code) looks like behind the curtain, the results can be useful and often in less time. Maintenance would likely also tend toward becoming more AI-driven as well because of that mess behind the curtain. \n\nAnd that's the key difference I see.  Do we want a results-driven workflow or do we need to retain the ability for a human being to maintain it. I think the references to Jr vs Sr developers are very apt. The Jr's code might well get accurate results, but the Sr often demands near-to-full rewrites for maintainability, Sr's ego or control issues, company arbitrary style guide, or \"learning opportunities\" vs any functionality concerns.\n\nIF the focus is the results, does what it look like behind the curtain really matter? \n\nI personally have a ways to go before I can answer this with a \"no\", but I think it's coming whether I like it or not. :0)",

We have a rare opportunity to architect this intelligence to stabilize and accelerate our own evolution—a symbiotic augmentation where it learns and grows alongside us. But as the OP discovered with \"vibe coding,\" you cannot simply remove the human expert from the loop without the logic falling apart.\n\nThe irony is palpable: the same people expressing fear of an \"AI Armageddon\" or Skynet scenario are the ones actively creating the conditions for failure. By firing humans to replace them with AI solely to \"do the same thing for cheaper,\" you aren't building a future; you are embedding a dangerous operational philosophy: treating human expertise as an inefficiency to be eliminated, rather than the foundation the system relies on.\n\nIt is wildly hypocritical to worry about AI safety while offloading your entire workforce to boost profit margins. You can't claim to be worried about the future of humanity if you're only interested in securing your own quarterly bonus at the expense of everyone else's stability.\n\nAlso to clarify, I understand the OP did not say anything about Armageddon and the future ending in an AI apocalypse or whatever, it’s just a sentiment that I keep coming across, while at the same time the people in power, or with the resources to impact or influence how we view, utilize, and architect these systems are building environments or reinforcing heuristics that that, to me, cement the very uncertain futures that people are galvanizing the fears of. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text, and I appreciate anyone that decided to take the time to read all of this.

After burning through lots of tokens and refining my prompts, I got better results on the next attempt.\n\nEventually, I tried Codex (OpenAI’s coding model). This time, instead of assigning one huge task, I broke the project into smaller pieces—and was able to build a much cleaner, more functional UI.\n\nYou can see the final product here:  \n👉 [https://bettagames.io/](https://bettagames.io/)\n\nSince launching, I’ve continued adding new features. I don’t write the code myself—I simply ask Codex to implement features, fix bugs, and even document the process.\n\nMy takeaway?

I was hot on it for all of six months or so and never truly fully grasped all of the concepts. I never had a WOW moment of understanding. After those initial.six months I just kind of fizzled until about a year ago - I stumbled upon windsurf and have been using that ever since. I went hard in the paint again for about six months....then cooled off once more until about two weeks ago.\n\nThat being said I came back to many of my projects waiting for me - all half-finished as anyone with ADHD can understand. It isn't the starting lol....\n\n\nAnyway. I couldn't debug if my life depended on it - i know no other langues, butttt have what I think is some success.  \n\n\nThe very second thing I did when starting to vibe code (I use windsurf to github and from github to Claude code and back and forth I go).....was to establish global rules. Example - every project must start with the creation of a context folder and inside that folder are things like plan.md, tech.md, directions.md so on and so forth.\n\nI thought. Lets make this tool as useful as possible by firstly trying to improve what it can do and how it can do it. Next I connected it to the main MCPs that are there - Bravesearch, sequential thinking, ect.\n\nI have been able to crank out a couple projects- 1 I think is done and the other two need some slight tweaks. \n\n\nI actually managed to deploy 1. To Vercel and the other to Railway. \n\nIn the interest of learning if you would like the url I would be happy to share. Might be easy for you to either A. Decide it looks decent or B. Be like Holy Heck take this down right now. \n\nWould help to understand where vibecoders are from a efficiency perspective. I genuinely think I made something decent. Would a real technical person agree or disagree.\n\nI won't  share urls here just in case it is riddled with mistakes and I unintentionally expose myself to some uncomfortable probed.\n\nLet me know",

Integrated automated route optimization, accounting, payments and phone service, ai voice and sms agents. Twilio is setup and managed all through apis so you don’t have to leave the system to setup accounts. Ai agents can create customers, jobs, tasks, anything a person can do in the system. There’s built in automations modeled after activepieces. Plus a whole lot more. In my opinion it’s better than anything on the market currently and I had no programming experience coming into it. \n\nThat being said most people would have given up when bugs arose and I have learned a LOT over the last 6 months. \n\nThe biggest challenge is managing technical debt. Didn’t know much about it starting out so some of my files got huge but I’ve been slowly refactoring the biggest pieces into smaller manageable files utilizing hooks and importing components vs the ai that was placing everything into a 5k line file. \n\nI still couldn’t write a lick of code myself but I do have some understanding of it now and I’m a professional debugger lol. \n\nWith all that, I was able to build and launch a web app built on firebase data connect with cloud sql and corresponding mobile apps for android and iOS that are currently on the app stores. \n\nCould have never even hoped to accomplish this 2 years ago. The thought would have never crossed my mind. \n\nThe big takeaway though is I have a complete system I built from scratch that works better and has more features than any of the “industry leaders” in the field today. \n\nI went from paying ServiceTitan 6k a month to about $60 in total fees to manage my whole system including a few companies I have on as beta members. The software works. Sure there’s some bugs still for complex stuff that take me a few hours to debug vs someone who actually has a background In programming or engineering but I always manage to push past them and further improve the product as well as my own knowledge of how things work. \n\nIf you have the will to make something and you have some decent problem solving and comprehension skills, ai coding tools really are there to bridge the gap. \n\nIf you want to check it out you can go to pro.nexusinc.io/pitch on page 4 I believe there’s a live demo. Search up “Nexus field management” on the apple App Store and it should be one of the first ones that pop up.",

That's just not what software engineers are actually paid to do.\n\nMy experience at a large tech company was that most changes were like five lines of code that were preceded by weeks of planning, chasing down obscure institutional knowledge, and verifying correctness against a mess of other systems. Writing code faster never would have made the process noticeably faster. Meanwhile, our CEO was claiming that like 75% of all work at the company was being done by AI.\n\nPersonally, I think a lot of the value in AI is that a small group of people convinced a bunch of business bros that they were getting in on the ground floor of something as foundational as the Internet, when in reality, it's just a scapegoat that companies use to try to dissuade investors from thinking the economy is bad enough to pull out all their money. It does less damage to the stock price if you say \"we're eliminating jobs because we're so good at AI\" than it does if you say \"we're eliminating jobs because there's a bunch of economic uncertainty\"",

Technology has always been evolving, and the bell curve for how people respond to that evolution has pretty much always been in the same. In my career, I've worked in mainframe, on-prem software, and cloud implementations all within 12 years at mid-sized to large companies, each met with doom and gloom from people who were impacted by the change.

More often than not too much imo. Yes, I have seen good websites and technologies go. But I also seen good ones come in return.\n\nWhat used to and still does attract me to web development is the fact there is so much to do. So many ways to be creative, so many ways to reach people. For example, I never ever could imagine that one day we would have fully [3d](https://threejs.org) websites, apps and games all running in the browser. Stylesheets evolved from basic markup to animations and JS evolved to an entire OOP language with a lot of possibilities.\n\nHaving worked in multiple languages and with multiple frameworks, web to this day is still my favorite. Nodejs has become my tool of choice and being able to setup a web server for example so quickly is wild. And while I do sometimes miss the good ol' days of PHP4 websites I also feel pretty excited with all the opportunities we have today.",

We’ve spent the last 15 years optimizing the hell out of the TCP handshake, shaving milliseconds off TLS, and putting edge caches everywhere.\nBut fundamentally? We’re still just polishing the same blocking paradigm: Ask for data -> Wait -> Get data.\nThat works fine for a generic SaaS dashboard. It falls apart completely if you’re trying to build anything \"deep tech\"—think massive IoT swarms, high-frequency trading, or systems that need to work over high-latency links (or even just flaky 5G).\nI’ve been toying with an architecture I’m calling Holographic State, and I want to see if anyone here has tried building this in production (probably in Rust or C++).\nThe idea is to completely ditch the \"database as destination\" model.\nThe Stack:\n * Local-First / CRDTs: You don't await db.save(). You write to a local ledger. The \"truth\" is local first, consistent later.\n * UDP Transport (No TCP): TCP is garbage for high throughput because of the ACK loop. If you’re waiting for a confirmation packet from a receiver that’s 500ms away (or light minutes away), your throughput tanks.\n * Fountain Codes (RaptorQ): This is the missing piece. Instead of retrying dropped packets, you just spray the data stream with mathematical redundancy. If I send you 15 packets and you catch any 10, you reconstruct the message perfectly.\nWhy do this?\nBecause physics.\nIn this model, you don't care about latency. You don't care about dropped packets. You just \"emit\" facts about the state of the world, and any node listening on the frequency catches up mathematically. It’s effectively a 10M QPS firehose that doesn't break when the network gets noisy.\nIt feels like the industry is scared of UDP because it's \"unreliable,\" but if you layer Fountain codes on top, isn't it actually more reliable than a fragile TCP connection that hangs on a timeout?\nHas anyone here implemented a pure UDP+RaptorQ transport for event sourcing? What were the pain points? I’m assuming the CRDT tombstone bloat gets nasty after a while, but looking for war stories.\nLet's argue about it.",

          "text": "Fellow '96 web veteran here! I totally feel this. Remember when we thought DHTML was revolutionary? Now we're watching the same patterns emerge with AI - everyone's trying to \"vibe code\" their way through problems without understanding the fundamentals.\n\nWhat's helped me stay sane is shifting my perspective from \"everything's been done\" to \"everything's been done poorly at scale.\" The real challenge now isn't building something new - it's building something that actually works for real people without requiring a PhD in DevOps.\n\nI've been focusing on the integration layer lately. While everyone's obsessed with the latest framework, the real pain point for most businesses is still connecting their tools. We're drowning in 800+ integrations across different platforms, and nobody's really solved the \"make it just work\" problem.\n\nThe irony is that AI could actually help here - not by writing more boilerplate code, but by handling the mundane plumbing work. True AI automation for everyone would mean less time configuring webhooks and more time solving actual business problems.\n\nWhat specific wheel are you finding yourself reinventing most often? Is it the auth system for the millionth time, or something else?",

          "text": "It's called \"The Fallacy of infinite growth\", I see it as a huge problem for the economy and if anything the smallest thing we can do is to vote with our wallet and stop paying for things like apple products which don't allow the user to easily access and repair parts of the phone, stop buying into subscription services etc. things like that are what incentives this lazy 'innovation'. \n\nAs for what *you* do in the industry, just try and find a way to provide better service at a cheaper rate. I believe the thing people want most in this annoying digital economy is a return to simple products which don't cost a fortune and don't become faulty after two years. \n\nIt sounds like you're someone who's really dedicated to progress and wanting to make a meaningful influence on the industry you work in ... Pls be one of those coders who focuses on trying to make the industry better for everyone 🙏- the people who put their time into personal projects to help make something which everyone needs more affordable. There's nothing I love more than seeing a new product which is 50% cheaper than it's biggest competitor, and better quality too. \n\nThe best kind of innovation I can see in the tech industry right now is a fight back against the larger companies who keep exploiting lazy ways of marketing and customer retention like forcing subscription payment models, using our metadata to target adds and prey on our impulse to buy shit we don't need. \n\n... I think we've done enough innovation as far as actual usable products go for now. What I believe needs to happen now is some balance in the market, the larger companies who have the most capital have way too much leverage over people starting from the bottom in their garage, and they keep normalising predatory payment models, along with bad quality tech, over engineered tech we don't need, I could list examples for hours. \n\nI just think we're in a situation where the tech industry is so intertwined with our economy, the companies who have the most leverage in the industry can literally dictate how the market works. And the more this continues the more economic power will consolidate in the big businesses, and it'll eventually become almost impossible for someone to be successful with a startup. \n\nThis new 'digital economy' doesn't allow for fair competition in the market, and it's also almost completely impossible for the government to regulate ... So I think the best thing we can hope for is people collectively voting the right way with their wallet, and also counting on the very dedicated engineers who want to make services which are more accessible and affordable for everyone.",

Reddit kind of solves it to an extent, but as a platform fails in a number of ways - like selling our data to train LLMs. There also isn't a real sense of community tbh. \n\nThere is always going to be a need for better social platforms. I personally think niche forums need to make a comeback. They've probably never left tbh, but most people don't use them. There should be a push on the more popular communities to grow niche platforms with better practices towards their users.",

Other than the unfortunate garbage web sites i am forced to work on for a job... i focus my coding elsewhere. Been building a desktop application to improve my software development skills and off course I host my custom built family share web application on a VPS. But yep every idea has been repeated to the point its all just noise; a fart amongst a tornado.  AI is a useful tool if you already know what your doing; but I agree there is too much vibecoding slop. Where it all goes from here is anyone's guess... Personally i think most vibecoded projects will fail miserably or need experienced devs to rewrite half or all of it.  But Lets not pretend there wasn't and isn't plenty of slop out there before AI -- now its just be increased 10 fold. \n\nthe core of the problem to me seems to be the mentality that web development is easy/cheap and every little operation seems to think they can be the next Amazon or have Amazon level features on a shoe string budget. Maybe i am just bitter because i work at a cut rate place that's hardly hanging on. I dont see much of a future.",

All it took was a bubble bursting and a lot of companies that were never profitable or had too much competition to go belly up, and eventually things sorted themselves out...\n\nWithin the next year or two we'll likely see the same thing. With everything going parabolic there's going to be a spectacular failure eventually. It can not stay on this wildly unsustainable path.\n\nAs for all the AI slop and garbage on the internet? Who knows... Honestly I felt the decline of the internet since the early 2000's with the rise of facebook and social media.... But considering how popular \"reality tv\" was beforehand, it's no surprise the internet got shat on so hard once it became widely available.

It was great when it was WFH, but then after just 3-4 months the RTO mandate hit.\n\nGoing to the office, sitting 9-6, coming back to an empty room far from my hometown, I felt like a machine. I was spiraling into depression. It wasn't burnout from coding; it was burnout from the lifestyle and environment.\n\nSo, I did what everyone says to do: \"Follow your dreams.\" I resigned. I chose my mental health over the money. I decided to build my own SaaS products and freelance.\n\nHere is the reality check 3 months later:  \nI have built a website to help developers (not going to promote it here). In my opinion, the code is clean, the design is solid, and the functionality is there. but even after that  \n**Users? Zero.**  \n**Freelance clients? Zero.**\n\nI realized too late that I love building, but I absolutely hate selling. I have zero marketing skills. I can spend 12 hours debugging a complex issue, but the thought of cold emailing a client or making a TikTok to promote my website makes me very uncomfortable. I created some posts on LinkedIn and Reddit, they even got some impressions but nearly no website visits.\n\nMy brother told me yesterday, \"**You’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a developer.** Go join any startup.\"  \n  \nI’m sitting here burning through savings, wondering if I traded depression for anxiety. It feels like the system is designed to crush people like me. You either submit to the soul-crushing office culture, or you starve trying to make it on your own. **Has anyone here successfully transitioned from a quiet, introverted dev to a founder?** Or should I just accept that I’m meant to be an employee and find a remote job?",

Growth hacking, growth engineering, growth marketing, etc think “ growth engine”.\n\nThere are only two growth channels, for the most part ….the rest are linear but support the growth channels. The two growth channels? SEO and viral growth. The later is harder and requires your product to be really good which you should be aiming at. \n\nMany people miss the SEO pieces and think it’s just about content marketing after the product is built. It’s not, It’s apart of the product! How can your product, in a sensible way have a bunch of pages that don’t feel out of place? Category pages is always a good start. \n\nInitially you need to be looking for product market fit. Do people want to buy what you are building? How do they feel about it? What do they like about? Not like? What would they like to see? What problem does it solve? Is it a band aid or a vitamin? \n\nAll of this can be answered very cheap, it’s user research, so whatever you can to get it in front of other people.\n\nAlso, this isn’t about your friend circle, step outside of it, find a meetup, co-working space with other startup people, even online if you don’t live somewhere where it’s convenient. \n\nTake a look at the book the cold start problem. It may be a help. Also, read the lean startup, it’s a little old but the user research stuff is what saved many companies early on.\n\nGood luck!",

Your brother isn't entirely wrong but he's missing something important - you don't have to choose between being purely a developer or forcing yourself into uncomfortable sales tactics. There's a middle ground that works really well for introverted devs. Instead of cold emails or social media promotion, focus on solving problems in communities where your target users already hang out. Answer questions on Stack Overflow, contribute to discussions in relevant subreddits, maybe write some technical blog posts about challenges you've solved. The key is building genuine relationships first rather than pitching. At Twine we see loads of successful freelance developers who've built their entire client base through word of mouth and community involvement rather than traditional marketing. It takes longer but it's much more sustainable for people who prefer authentic connections over sales pitches. Your technical skills are valuable, you just need to find the right way to connect them with people who need them.",

Seek employment that has a strong culture with good mentorship and utilize resources like life coaches to set personal goals and help deal with any anxiety when you feel like you are out of your depth when it comes to building your interpersonal skills at work. Some companies may even subsidize or cover costs for sessions with life coaches. Oftentimes they are through apps like Lyra Health so you don't even have to do it in person. If you want to be more entrepreneurial the skill that you will need to hone the most is influencing/motivating stakeholders towards a common goal and making them feel involved in the process so that you can design, build, and market a product. Regardless,  it does seem like experienced coders with PM skills that can utilize AI is becoming the norm these days.",

          "text": "Similar story here. I had 8+ years of dev experience and finally decided I wanted to do it on my own. I had an idea that came from a real-life need. Being “locked” in the back office, I got disgusted with dealing face-to-face with the general public lol. I knew it would be difficult, and I knew I needed to do much more than just have a “good” product. I knew development was just the tip of the iceberg. For instance, I hated speaking on the phone with all those dumb end users who obviously had no clue how great the software was.\n\nSo what did I do? I decided that if I couldn’t overcome it, I’d be stuck building someone else’s wealth forever. So I forced myself to answer all incoming calls. After a few months, it turned out I actually started enjoying it. Same with preparing for face‑to‑face selling. For fun, when I was in a specific environment (because of the nature of the software), I was promoting the company’s product. No pressure — just for fun and experience. I noticed that if you relax and don’t force yourself to sell at any cost, it starts coming naturally. Just be open, relaxed, and promote your work while keeping in mind that you don’t have to sell — just plant a seed. If they need it, they’ll come to you.\n\nJust remember what Darwin said — the ones who survive are those who can adapt.\nAlso remember the story behind Angry Birds: the company made about 20 other apps before they finally lifted off.\n\nOne more reality check: I work from home, I do dev work, I call customers, and if I want to get up, I go and target potential customers face‑to‑face. My aunt told me when I started this endeavour: “Remember that working from home and self‑discipline isn’t for everyone.”\nOh boy, how right she was lol — I had to learn that too. Now I see that my office days were basically constant holidays.\n\nDon’t give up on your dreams , and best of luck.",

I tried to run a 'Business' using only 'Developer' logic, and it nearly burned out my motherboard.\n\nYour brother is reading the Error Log correctly, but his Root Cause Analysis is slightly off.\n\nHe thinks the error is: `User is not an Entrepreneur.` The actual error is: `User is trying to run Sales.exe on a Developer Kernel.`\n\nI’ve been in Tech Transformation for 20+ years. Here is the hard truth about the transition you are trying to make:\n\n**1. The 'Full Stack' Lie** We tell ourselves we are 'Full Stack,' but we usually mean Database to Frontend. Real 'Business Full Stack' includes **Distribution**. You built the Product (Backend), but you have no Gateway (Marketing) to let traffic in. A server without a public IP address gets zero requests, no matter how clean the code is.\n\n**2. Stop trying to 'Sell' (It crashes your OS)** You mentioned TikTok and Cold Emailing. Those are 'High-Social-Friction' protocols. As an introvert, these will drain your battery in 20 minutes. Stop doing them.\n\n**3. Switch to 'Engineering as Marketing'** You are a dev. Use *that* weapon. Don't write LinkedIn thought leadership; write **Documentation**. Don't make TikToks; build **Free Tools**.\n\n* Create a free, mini-version of your tool (a calculator, a validator, a specific script) and host it.\n* Write a technical deep-dive on a hard problem you solved while building your SaaS.\n* Post *that* in dev communities.\n\n**4. The API Handshake (Co-Founding)** If you are the Wozniak, stop beating yourself up for not being the Jobs. You might not need to 'get a job,' but you might need to 'open an endpoint' for a non-technical co-founder who *loves* selling but can't code to save their life.\n\nDon't go back to the soul-crushing office yet. You traded depression (hopelessness) for anxiety (uncertainty). Anxiety is actually better—it means you are alive and facing a challenge. You just need to change your marketing protocol to match your personality type.",

That you don't have to conform to have success and actually its the opposite, if i did conform or try to be like  others I wouldn't have had success. Because of the dissonance and how it doesn't fit me. What you think you're lacking is actually what sets you  apart. use your weakness as your strength\n\nso for example, with sales, figure out what feels most comfortable for you. I think the reason people shy  away from things is that the way it's normally done doesn't feel right with them personally. but if you do it in your way you may even love it and surprised by it. So it's not that you're 'not a marketing guy', it's that you aren't those marketing guys\n\nI guess what I'm saying is it's actually a fallacy this concept that there are certain types of people who do something because it's often the  case the people who are unnatural that become exceptional. They change the game.",

          "text": "Hey, buddy. Bear with me, this is gonna be a longer message.\n\nSo, here’s the deal… you’re only 3 months in. That’s honestly still very early. Finances aside (I know, hard to ignore) I wouldn’t fret too much about degree of success/failure just yet. The first year or two is always the hardest for the majority of “entrepreneurs.” I put that word in quotations because even though I started my own business this year, I don’t like attributing a term like that to myself. I just call myself a designer & front-end developer.\n\nAnyway, one important thing to remember is that “everyone moves at different speeds.” I was told that by a friend/roommate when I was lamenting over the fact that I’d be graduating college later than everyone else in my class because I needed to take a year off for my mental health (yes, there’s some irony there). Although I felt like the world’s limpest noodle, those words struck a chord in me that allowed me to forgive myself, both then and in all endeavors onward.\n\nNow, moving onto more practical things… much like you, I consider(ed) myself highly introverted. Similarly, I’m not even comfortable sharing my work/business on social channels. Cold calling was definitely out of the picture; and even though I tried a total of 7 calls, it was paralyzing. I think it took me 4 hours and A LOT of cigarettes to muster up courage between calls. They yielded nothing. Eventually I made my one and only post on a Facebook group which resulted in a competitor seeing my portfolio and inviting me to coffee. He explained to me that networking was his jam.\n\nEven though the idea had been pitched to me by friends, it wasn’t until I had that direct dialogue with someone who had a “tried and true” method did I even really consider it. As you might anticipate, it (networking) sucked simply because I was trash at it… which really just meant I had a learning opportunity in front of me. However, I didn’t sit down and read on how to network/sell/etc. I know that I’m a kinesthetic learner, someone who learns by doing. And so, I just kept going and going and going until I fumbled enough but eventually got better at it. You could also say I practiced gradual exposure therapy, because my tendency to sit inside my car for 30 minutes before just driving away without even entering the venue lessened over time.\n\nAs I came to find out, networking is actually really straightforward once you understand how it and people work. People will likely give or refer you business if they “know, like, and trust you.” Now every time I chat it up with someone, I just probe them with questions about their non-work-related interests, show enthusiasm, and talk about my own. Now I have ample work, with many new clients queued up for the next few months. I started this year in early April and didn’t get my first gig until August, but it has been full speed ahead since then.\n\nPoint being… I encourage you to see this as a learning experience and step into a tolerable degree of discomfort. Once that eventually becomes less daunting, move onto the next threshold and then the next, so on and so forth. After all, you’re learning (hint hint), so cut yourself some slack. This isn’t stuff they teach everyone in school.\n\nWith all of that said, you can always fall back on finding another full-time, salaried role if you either don’t feel ready yet or don’t think this world is for you at all. Another nugget of wisdom I heard recently is that “there are so many ways to make money,” as long as you don’t let ego get in the way. Part-time at a grocery store, full-time with a startup, reselling, working behind the desk at a gym, etc. I guess that’s a slight tangent, but it was a comfort for me to hear, so I thought I’d share.\n\nI’ll stop myself here. But feel to DM me if you’d like. Happy to do whatever I can to help you out, even if it’s just as a sounding board or someone to lean on. Regardless though, you’re more capable than you believe. You just haven’t necessarily found the right business avenues, positioning, or strategies yet.\n\nCheers!",

I’m a full stack dev s as well (MERN/MEAN/?AMP) and it’s actually kind of rare for a “client” especially small businesses to think they have the need or budget for your skills. You may be better off building your own platform, application, or SAAS instead of seeking clients. I can tell you from experience. If it’s a really small business, one or few people operation they’re not going to understand just how far ahead you could set them. Usually they want a barebones, low value, “I just want a website so my friends think I’m legit” website. Usually contracts are available with our skillset but then you don’t feel like an entrepreneur, you’re a worker but aren’t an employee. \n\nOne thing I’ve found is don’t listen to people who don’t do what we do. You already deal with some jealousy because we’re 6 figure earners and may not have to leave our homes to do so. So becoming your own boss with this freedom is jarring for people that have to commute into an office or job site to get paid. \n\nThe reality is once you’re a full stack dev you’re either already an entrepreneur or well on your way. The only difference is are you building your dream or someone else’s. Are you patient enough to own something, provide value and build equity. Or will you get the comfort of a steady paycheck that can sustain me for the time being but provides nothing residual. It’s a choice we all have to make multiple times during this journey. Trust me, dev jobs come and go and you’ll feel the pull of entrepreneurship between each one and definitely during each job. Good luck, God bless, and I’m rooting for you. 💯💯💯",

Used to joke that I was getting paid to do an impression of an extrovert, but I learned a lot about what closes deals (it's 80% being genuine and believing in your product, and 20% actual selling) before striking out on my own.\n\nIt took about 2.5 years before I was self supporting in webdev. Tried and failed at a lot of approaches. In the interim, as I built up a client base I found some freelance gigs in data annotation (there are a few platforms out there, but DA is the one that took care of me the best) to make ends meet.\n\nEnded up taking advice from u/Citrous_Oyster and instead of trying to make big sales up front, I got people on subscription plans for about $200/month which includes a static brochure site (price doesn't include artwork, which they have to provide, or complicated things beyond a static site like e-commerce setups, which are a one time fee to design and setup). Targeted small businesses and companies that were just opening up (I get a list of business names registered in my county once a month directly from the county). Turns out people are willing to pay $200/mo for a website if it includes hosting, basic SEO, updates, and better performance than a Wordpress/Squarespace site as part of the package. \n\nBut I still have to make those cold calls, and I've got to do it over the phone or in person, because nobody reads cold calls in their email. Luckily with word of mouth I don't have to do it as much as when I started.\n\nI've got about 10 clients right now, so that's bringing in about $2000 a month for no more than 15 hours of work a week across the board for all ten clients (besides the initial site design and launch, which only takes a day or two). My only overhead is my hosting plan on Knownhost. It's been a gateway into freelance software development jobs and weird Salesforce programming gigs. The best part though is that it's allowed me to find gigs for my freelancer buddies who hate also selling (a graphic designer, a photographer, a software engineer, and a data analyst). My business is really just five freelancers in a trenchcoat.\n\nIf I had stayed in the corporate world it would have killed me. I'm much happier now, but it was a long road to get there, and getting way out of my comfort zone is the price I had to pay to get here.",

It's horrible.

I don't **LOVE** my job, but I do love the financial stability it gives me to pursue the things I actually love. That gives me time and resources to spend with my family. That is something I love and I'm thankful to my job for it. \n\nI think you need to do some soul searching and perhaps establish some priorities. Maybe things aren't such a dichotomy as they seem. Perhaps you can have a rewarding job at a startup, an NGO or perhaps some coold field like aerospace, robotics or AI. Something that feels rewarding to you even if the pay isn't as good. And then look for meaning outside of work and try to view work more as means to an end rather than as an end in it of itself.\n\nI hope this helps.",

          "text": "> You either submit to the soul-crushing office culture, or you starve trying to make it on your own.\n\nA less dramatic way to say this is: you either do something somebody tells you they value or you convince people what you're doing has value. The only alternative to that choice is to do something nobody thinks has value which is obviously problematic.\n\nPersonally, I have tried both. Working for myself was fun for a time, but it's extremely stressful. You don't get to go home when the clock says so because all problems end with you. You have to fill any shoes or have the premium to pay others to do it for you. There is no \"good performance review\" that gives you comfort that you're doing fine... you could always be doing more or doing less and need to find the confidence in what you're doing. There is constant uncertainty. Nobody else is supporting you and you could be losing money seemingly overnight. Not only is nobody supporting you, but you don't even have a coworker or boss or employee to bounce ideas off of or talk through stressful situations with. So, even though I loved the challenge of working on technical, marketing, legal, financial, etc. aspects, the amount of stress that came from the responsibility and uncertainty was too much for me. My plan is to hopefully at some point do that kind of thing on the side again so I don't have to feel my life depends on it, but to live off of the more reliable and lower stress employee work.\n\nFWIW though, not all cases of being \"an employee\" are the same and \"office culture\" is not some singular thing. I've generally worked on teams where I'm the dev, but everybody else has different specialties (e.g. art, writing, marketing, video). As a result, the culture of my workplaces has been very different from a lot of people who work in tech oriented organizations where there are tons of meetings about storypoints where argue about GIT conventions and code reviews. Instead, because I'm the guy in my team who has this skillset, I'm basically entrusted to be self-directed. I can go a couple of weeks without talking to anybody if I wanted to, but I have some regular meetings that I myself set up with certain people just to stay in the loop on things. My previous job was similar but I was at a lower level and the team was more integrated but it was the same kind of thing: we'd meet once a week to talk about our aspects of the project with each other, but otherwise it was self-directed. The rest of \"office culture\" was just optional choices to chat throughout the day. I think if you find a smaller organization or an organization where, like I am, you are kind of a unique role there, then you might find the office dynamic is different and lends itself better to independent work. The culture of working at a web dev company vs working at a university is going to be very different.\n\nIt's also a matter of getting to know your manager in your interview. I had one manager who just said \"I trust you because I see the results\" and met with me a couple times a year to talk about project for 10 minutes. I had another manager who also trusted me but met with me twice weekly to chat about how things were going, why they were going how they were, etc. The culture of the office depends a lot on how you work. But don't make the mistake of thinking that a fellow introvert will best handle you. You want somebody with social awareness so they can pick up on your needs and help you integrate in your own way with the team. An extrovert might balance you out by enjoying doing the talking you don't want to do. The difference between an extroverted boss and an introverted boss might be \"I'll mention that to [other manager] so you can get what you need for the bottleneck\" vs \"you can call [other manager] and ask if they can have their team work on that\".\n\n> My brother told me yesterday, \"You’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a developer. Go join any startup.\"\n\nBased on your description, that sounds fair. It's not just about being introverted or not. Even if you magically solved the salesperson part of it, being an entrepreneur means you need to be comfortable changing gears to whatever the bottleneck at the moment is... accounting, taxes, contracts, law, art, customer service, distribution, market research, etc. If you have any sense of wanting to just stay in your lane, it doesn't really matter what your lane is, it just doesn't work when you're the only one. Also, the marketing aspect of running your own business doesn't just mean talking to people: it means that you need to figure out the market and make the product the market wants, so there is plenty of room left for it to be \"soul-crushing\" if the market paints you into a corner.\n\n> Should I just accept that I’m meant to be an employee and find a remote job?\n\nI think you need to recognize that isn't not as black and white as you say. As an dev employee, I was once the tech lead on a huge project. I was in charge and needed to accomplish it and coordinate it, but I didn't have managerial control over all of the stakeholders. So, I basically spent 2 years being a \"salesperson\" within my own company convincing various stakeholders to prioritize my project and coordinate with me even though I was technically a dev. As a freelancer, there were times I was very beholden to the whims of very specific major clients and felt less free than when I worked a 9-5. The \"office culture\" various a lot based on who is there, the role of your work within the broader company, your industry, etc. And even the split... like I said, I've done both at once at times rather than putting my all into just one path or the other. So, while I do agree with your brother that it sounds like maybe you're not really interested in being an entrepreneur and are doing it for other reasons, I think you have a lot more choices than the two extremes you seem to be defining.",

Though not generically right, but right \"for now.\"\n\nYou clearly went and decided to start a business without knowing what it means to start a business. You mentioned 3 months later you have a product, but no clients. That sounds to me like you spent 3 months building a product without doing much research, planning, and market analysis.\n\nImagine if you sat down to write a webpage, but turns out you don't know JS or CSS, and you've only heard of HTML once. That's basically where you are in terms of your understanding of business, and the process of starting and operating it. Now imagine someone like that comes to you and asks you for help. Would you waste your time on them? \n\nMy suggest is NOT to find a partner with complementary skills, at least not right away. In practice, such a partner is likely to just sideline you once they understand that you can only offer dev help. Nobody else is likely to take you seriously until you an exhibit more understanding of the skills you appear to be lacking. Instead, take some time to learn about what it means to run a business, the types of planning you need to do, and the things that need to be true in order to more onto further steps, as compared to the things that must be true for you to dump a project as lost. This means you're going to need to practice speaking, presenting, and selling things.\n\nOnce you get to at least a basic level of familiarity, and once you have a few project ideas planned out (and I do mean a full business plan, not just words in your head) that seem like they might go somewhere, that's when you should try to find people to help. Ideally someone that you can speak to easily, and who will genuinely try to see you as an eyeal.",

The anxiety is not a thing to try to escape, rather, to work with. It is ever present in human life. I visualize a musician going on stage with a severe case of stage fright. You see the anxiety. You tell yourself, “good, I’m taking this seriously.”  Then you don’t tip toe out on stage timidly, you walk out there and own the thing. This can be practiced and improved over time. Nothing wrong with having these obstacles unless you expect to solve all of them at once.",

At the end of the day you need users and to make money, so if you are too shy to ever ask for that, it's gonna be tough. However these days there are lots of GTM strategies (think - sales) that are more catered to less outgoing founders. \n\nFocusing on building a community around your open source software or discords based on whatever problem you're solving are dev-centric and technically driven sales environments that you can leverage your skillset with. Obviously they don't work in all cases though so you'll need to do some of your own work trying to figure out which are the best for you & your business. I made a little tool for myself to help track some of the primary channels & rank them that might help you find a few that align with your interests - [https://debugg.ai/tools/founders/gtm-channels](https://debugg.ai/tools/founders/gtm-channels) . Just beware, this isn't school. You don't get credit for how much work you do, so if you pick a channel that's unlikely to work for your business just because you think you'll enjoy it, that's destined to fail.\n\nUltimately you need to get good at determining if what you 'believe' is really something you've convinced yourself because you are avoiding the harder option like doing more sales. Listen to advice but internalize it with caution. \n\nGood luck!",

The reality is very few people create a successful company, even fewer a successful SaaS. Can you survive doing freelance work? Absolutely, will you make 6 figures a year? Maybe, but it's very doubtful, and very few freelancers will get to that point. \n\nI personally have gone down both roads when I was young, including going around calling myself an entrepreneur. Now I happily make an extremely good salary working for a large company, I put in a fraction of the time, a fraction of the stress, and laugh at people going around calling themselves entrepreneurs or founders because I know they are almost always broke.",

A lot of people grind for months or even years before anything properly clicks.\n\nOne thing I’d seriously think about though is pivoting away from building for developers and towards non technical businesses. Devs are a hard audience. They’re opinionated, price sensitive, and often just build their own thing anyway.\n\nYou might have more luck solving a very boring, very specific problem for brick and mortar or physical service businesses. Stuff that saves them time or hassle. Keep it focused and simple. Local businesses especially get overlooked, but they actually pay, stick around, and care more about results than how “clean” the tech is.\n\nI think a lot of devs feel they need to build something huge or global. In reality, small to medium businesses can be more than enough to make a decent living if you solve a real problem well.\n\nAnd honestly, there’s no shame at all in going back to a remote job if that’s what keeps you sane. Forcing yourself into founder mode when you hate selling can be just as rough mentally as a bad office job.",

Go and watch the free Startup School videos from YCombinator to get an idea of how to reset your expectations on what is required. The videos will mention \"founder market fit\". You will likely need to do some iterations to find your market, which is fine because many founders have to do this.\n\nSales doesn't require a suave personality. Some of the best performing sales people practice what is called consultative selling. This involves learning what a customer needs and recommending the right solution regardless of whether it is your product or not. With this honest approach people will remember you and refer their friends who have the type of problem you can solve. If the referrals don't happen you at least gather data to know what the real problems are and what motivates buyers.\n\nThe cash flow is a different issue. When you started this hopefully you should have had one year in reserves. If that wasn't the case you need to bring in cash or reduce your burn rate. Options include reducing expenses, getting a part time or full time job, taking on consultant work, securing grants or startup funds, adjusting your price (price discovery), putting dollars into marketing what you have, pairing with a sales oriented person, or what ever else you can do to stay afloat. Hunger, anxiety and need will force you do what is needed to survive. Follow where the money is and adjust your expectations from there.",

The best code in the world does nothing if nobody uses it.  Being a good engineer means being able to communicate the value that you're creating.  If you can't clearly articulate that and have mental blocks even beginning to do it, then you need to realize you are not a good coder.\n\nMaking a polished short video is not always quick or easy, but if you can't take one step out of your comfort zone to unlock any value from your work, then you will always fail.  This is not a \"zero marketing skills\" issue, this is \"my attitude towards marketing leads to skill issues\".\n\nThe alternative is that your product doesn't have a value proposition, nobody would buy even the best demo, and you never found out if you have product/market fit.  This is the scarier one, but you didn't take any steps to derisk the past 3 months, so time to look this possibility in the face.\n\nExecuting a marketing plan isn't \"hard\" in the same way calculus is, you might suck at marketing, but it is necessary step, a minor hurdle required to be jumped in order for you to progress.  Sucking at a skill  is the first step to being kind of alright at a skill and you have forgotten that.",

Felt the same way as you, but I've landed a few projects that intersected at passion and business value and I currently feel even more motivated programming stuff for work than for hobby. At least for me, I'm thrilled I'm getting paid to make the stuff I'm working on. Literally, pick your own battles, don't get thrown at what's left.\n\nThe more proactive you become, the less shit you will have to deal with, at least regarding what you have to code. Whole trick is to actually not forget you're being paid because you're expected to have a ROI. Make sure to work *with* the mgmt. not *for* the mgmt. Those two paths lead to very different outcomes, money-/promotion-wise and joy-wise. \n\nIf you work *for* the mgmt., you'll see them as emptyheads that don't know shit about fuck (and many times, they don't, but looking at them as that, makes you one of them). If you work *with* the mgmt., you will see them probably more as ignorant rather than stupid and that's fairer, as ignorance is worked out in teams, while stupidity is a trait only stupids think they lack. Make yourself a strategic partner, as cringe as it feels or sounds for us techheads. It's the only way to work your dream job, and trust me, it's easier than job hopping into the next illusion. Still, you might have to change jobs for better paychecks, but at least you'll develop the often-forgotten soft-skills-hard-skills bundle of actually producing business and career value at the same time, and that, makes interviewing like a ride in the park the more senior you become.",

          "text": "The \"Now Playing\" floating bar on the bottom clips the side panel on the left; this prevents users from being able to read the text on the bottom of the side panel.\n\nThe side panel on the left also only has three items in it yet it occupies roughly 1/3rd of the screen real estate. Is that trade off worth it for 3 items? You either need to add more items/content to make it worth it (e.g., now playing could be embedded in the side bar) or reduce the width/size.\n\nIn general, the UI is very large with lots of whitespace which means the screen real estate is not being used efficiently and this causes a poor UX. I would highly recommend reconsidering the size of things and whether some content can be cut or consolidated (see example above about the side bar). Think about what this app will be used for: searching and playing music. However, in your screenshot, we can see that the user did a search and maybe only 6 or 7 results can fit on the screen at a time. Is this a good UX? Email clients can show 10-50 results on a screen at a time with 25 being a good middle ground. Imagine searching for a song and having to scroll 6-7 results at a time to find what you are looking for.\n\nAside from that, the design visually looks good but practically has some issues.",

I don't speak Spanish and we can't see the word either way so idk what it says). \n\nWhat is the settings icon in the player bar for ? Is it just global settings ? If so the placement feels a bit odd. If it's the music player settings tho fair enough but it feels kinda weird having this but no other setting tab for the global ones. \n\nAlso I'm confused what the icons next to the search bar are for ? There's bug report (maybe ?), something that looks like a code icon maybe ? I don't understand what this would be in a music player ?, a notification icon (kinda confused what the point of this would be in a music player too, unless you plan to make it a platform people can release their music on and use that as a release radar ? From my limited skills in Spanish it seems you were saying it's an archive for something so nothing new right ?) and a palette icon (do you have several themes or something ?).",

It puzzled me when it suddenly showed up in the product we're developing and it seemed to be an edge case that slipped through testing. I can't remember anymore what exactly we changed to fix it, but the background is more interesting anyway: \n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24944187/why-is-besbewy-appearing-in-my-site-spans\n\nI can imagine one of your dependencies is doing the same thing with a random string of text. Also, don't rule out any JS dependencies as they can very well do that too.\n\nFor an exact approach on how to find the root cause I can't really help, it really depends if you can set up a test-environment and remove dependencies one by one. You can also quickly rule out if it's from PHP or JS by using curl from a terminal to get the websites content without JS interfering. If it doesn't show up, in the terminal it could mean that it's injected by some JS dependency.\n\nEdit: you even mentioned in the body text that you have an idea which JS dependency causes that, my apologies. Next step would be to research this dependency in the context of the number and maybe open an issue with them, add a couple example links. I assume the element that holds the number should be rendered off screen and is used for the same thing BESbewy is used for, but either you overwrote the CSS (unspecifically and accidentally) or the team behind the dependency did that.",

ICANN can't actually revoke ownership of a domain outside of a very defined set of reasons (and this does vary a bit by TLD, just like property tax rules vary by country as well).  But generally speaking, the reasons they can revoke a domain are:\n\n1. You fail to keep valid registration data\n\n2. You fail to pay the renewal\n\n3. You lose a UDRP or URS dispute\n\n4. They receive a court order\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.  It's absolutely not like a digital license where the grantor can revoke it at any time, or for any reason.\n\nFurther, unlike a digital license which is almost always nontransferable - domains are yours to sell or transfer as you please.   \n\nBasically\n\n\\> You can only resell them insofar as the system in place allows you to, like a digital games store that lets you resell digital games you 'own'.\n\nThis is absolutely wrong.  I can enter into whatever contract I'd like to sell a domain, as long as the contract is legal, and ICANN has no control over that.\n\nIt does get a little hairy in that some TLDs are specifically reserved for certain things (ex - country TLDs are administered by that country) and those domains can be controlled by court orders from the owning country or by the administering agency , which may or may not follow the law of the place you live (ex - .ai domains are not \"artificial intelligence, they're the domains for the british territory of Anguilla. )\n\nBut there are actually much better protections in place for domains than for other licensed goods.\n\nIf anything, digital licensing for things like games would be a HELL of a lot better if they followed a system more like ICANN.",

          "text": "Personally, it feels more like buying than renting to me.\n\nRenting implies that there's still another owner, and that they can control what happens with the domain.  Ex - if you were renting a domain, and the owner wanted it back, they could simply not renew your contract and get it back.\n\nBut that's not how domains work.  Instead, it's much closer to ownership with a yearly tax bill.  They can't take it away except for very specific reasons, mostly related to breaking the law or failing to pay your tax bill (and on that last point, there are very specific notification and warning periods they HAVE to observe, much like a tax lien)\n\nSo if I own a domain, no one can go to ICANN or my registrar and say \"I want that domain larhorse has and I'll give you 50k for it\".  Instead they have to negotiate with me.  Meanwhile - someone could \\*absolutely\\* go to a landlord and offer them a lot of money to boot me out when my lease expires so they can have it instead.\n\nAdditionally, ICANN can't control who I transfer ownership of a domain to - unlike a landlord, who sure as hell doesn't have to let his last renter pick out his new renter.  For domains, I can sell it to anyone I like.  ICANN gets no say in preventing me from transferring it as I please.\n\nFurther, your registrar is basically just your agent for interacting with ICANN - they can't stop you from picking a different registrar if you want (or, if you really, REALLY want - you can go through the process to become a registrar yourself, although it almost never makes financial sense for individuals: [https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/accredited-registrars/registrar-accreditation-agreement/registrar-accreditation-financial-considerations-25-02-2012-en](https://www.icann.org/en/contracted-parties/accredited-registrars/registrar-accreditation-agreement/registrar-accreditation-financial-considerations-25-02-2012-en) )\n\n\\---\n\nSo basically, it's more like buying with a yearly tax bill than it is leasing, which implies a different type of contractual relationship.\n\nBut yes, in both cases you're still going to pay a yearly fee.  Nothing is guaranteed in life except death and taxes...",

If you were on the clock, you were expected to be producing at max capacity, you were essentially an efficiency machine for the company, and good producing machines get paid better or promoted (hopefully).\n\nDevelopment is salary, and so the expectation is a lot different. The expectation is that no matter what you’re doing, whatever work process you have, you’ll churn something workable out. You’re now a different type of machine, much more like a computer - a problem is given, and you compute it and upper management waits for a solution.\n\nYou could be Googling all day three days in a row, for all they care, as long as the work gets done at the end of the sprint. I mean, if you get caught that’ll look bad, but it’s not the same as if they’re expecting 8 hours of keyboard typing nonstop.",

That’s just estimation, it’s not a direct measure of how many hours you’ll be typing code.\n\nAn 8 hour coding day is never really 8 hours. Realistically it’s more like 6 to 7 hours of actual focused dev time once meetings, context switching, and general admin are factored in.\n\nOn a normal day you’re doing feature work, which usually looks like:\n\n* picking up a few small tickets (1s, 2s, maybe a 3), or\n* working through a bigger ticket that needs more thought and setup\n\nAnd every ticket, even a small one, still has the same overhead:\n\n* initial setup and understanding the task\n* implementation\n* cleanup or refactoring\n* testing\n* opening a PR and dealing with feedback\n\nAll of that takes time.\n\nSo if I finish 2 or 3 tickets in a day, that’s a good, solid day of work. That usually lines up with about 6 to 7 hours of real coding, not 8 straight hours of nonstop output. Anything more than that regularly just isn’t realistic or sustainable.",

That already brings “working time” down to roughly 6 hours. From there, a portion of the day is spent on lighter tasks such as meetings, reviews, follow-ups, and administrative work. What’s left is usually around 4–5 hours of genuine deep, focused work.\n\nMost people naturally break that into two solid deep-work sessions of roughly 2–2.5 hours each. That level of focus is far more sustainable long term.\n\nUltimately, the choice is yours. With a realistic structure, a consistent routine, and adequate rest, you can absolutely put in longer hours when needed. Just don’t be afraid to scale back or take rest days if you feel fatigue building. The idea that “slow and steady wins the race” genuinely applies here.",

Haven't checked whether you have this.\n\nFor checkboxes, the space key should check/uncheck, enter shouldn't.\n\nYou're missing all of the native implicit behaviours of `thead`, `th`, `td`, `tbody` etc elements too.

I was walking through a tutorial with react trying to build a simple todo app and I spent hours just trying to understand what’s going on in the background as well as good design. I swear you could spend your entire life just with just react and you still wouldn’t know it all I’m genuinely curious. Are you 100% confident in every technology you put on your resume or do you just smack on everything you’ve ever touched? \n\nPersonally I only put things I’ve made projects in or things I can be interview ready at in a couple hours.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the advice. Languages isn’t what troubles me, you can learn to work with any given language in relatively little time, what I really find troubling is that when I dig into a library like react I think how is this implemented under the hood? This mentality leads me down a spiral where I learn a lot but I think wow to build scalable applications you need to mix in a variety of different technologies? Am I just going to be satisfied with knowing just enough to get the current task done to the bare minimum? I have a borderline psychotic need to breakdown the things I’m working with because how else are you gonna understand it otherwise. I like web dev because you get to produce useful things that regular people might be able to use and i hope to one day be able to proudly say i understand what im doing because im kind of cooked without google and stackoverflow.",

You have to be lying\".\n\nI'm working in this industry for full time day in and day out for almost 20 years. This equates to roughly 40,000 hours of experience (just professional work time. Plus all the time I did/do this out of passion). You can't catch up to that in a few weeks. After a while it is just patterns and concepts. Frameworks and languages are the implementation of those concepts. You say you only put things in your resumee that you are interview ready in a couple of hours. I bet you, you give me any language/framework I haven't worked with in an interview and I will solve any task given just by quickly scrolling through the documentation on the spot.\n\nYou radically underestimate how much hard work it is to get there.\n\nSo don't give in. Go step by step and make a million mistakes and learn from them, surely I have. It's the only way to get better. And by million mistakes, I literally do mean 1,000,000 mistakes. Not five or twenty or a hundred and then you'll be an expert. No, far from it. 1,000,000.\n\n\nAnd don't end up in tutorial hell, build things. You won't become a Software engineer by watching content creator assholes who produce stupid hot takes to keep themselves in the loop.

And that's the frame of mind beginners then have, when they enter this realm via vibe coding.

But this is not what a lawyer does, just like writing code isn't the main task of software engineering.\nCreating an solid implementation of a solution to a problem is your goal. So your tasks are mainly understanding problems, creating fitting solutions, and then implement them.

          "text": "Hello OP. I think I have a couple of things to say that might be useful to you!\n\nFirst off, being a \"production\" ready engineer nowadays has considerable more requirements than it had 10 years ago, and this applies for 20 years ago and so on. When we built better tools this tends to happen, however it's also obvious that as an industry we've made some decisions that make our lives really tough. One of those, for me is React and the whole SPA wave. I would not go over to say that it's net negative for the web, but it certainly has obvious issues.\n\nYour \"borderline psychotic\" need to break down things and understand them to their core is your ticket to a successful career. The web is built upon many things. React is an abstraction among many abstractions. You cannot hope to understand everything to the fullest, even with multiple lifetimes. We are here as a result of a plethora of specializations built upon one another.\n\nHowever, computer science is built upon some fundamental concepts and a set of real world implementations. After you spend time with those, understanding how the upper layers of abstraction work is something you **can** do, and most serious programmers know. AI chat is a great tool to explore this.\n\nTo give you a concrete example - I work with front end frameworks from 2015. I've worked with most of them. They are 90% similar in my mind. They have some core differences but I can pinpoint them pretty clearly. At some point, a good exercise is to create your own framework. It won't be of course a production ready framework, but it's a good learning experience. I've done the same for compilers, video encoders in different languages with different tools. It all feels the same after some point. And, in my opinion, this is also how you build your confidence as a professional.\n\nNow, merging a lot of things you mention, it seems like sometimes you are overwhelmed by the information you present yourself. While all that I said above regarding learning I believe to be true, you have to be fine with not knowing everything 100% and moving on. Most jobs, not only programming, you specialize in a few things while having a vague idea about 10 times more things than those you specialize in. That's normal.\n\nDon't waste too much time on figuring out \"a good design\" or what \"scalable application\" means. These things come ad hoc. A good design is a good design for a specific use case. A scalable application is scalable enough for its production needs. Try to avoid those generic research targets that will waste you time. Bring yourself to a position where you can evaluate and adjust when needed. To do that, focus on fundamental programming and computer science knowledge, not a framework or a language or any tool.\n\nOverall, II feel you are doing fine. Your curiosity is in a good place, you took the time to post here and expose your thought. I would hire people like you any day and happily have them on my team.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

If you stick to your instincts and keep it at, I think you’ll find that you gain a level of mastery that most people don’t have.\n\nWeb dev is tricky because the web wasn’t built for dynamic applications, so layers and layers of workarounds were built on top of it, but they aren’t really that clean and you still have to deal with the complexity. React is even trickier because it tries to hide that complexity. It makes code feel easier to write, but it makes it harder to understand what is actually going on under the hood. They’re optimizing for the surface-level developer, who just wants to get something working, without needing to truly understand why.\n\nReact wasn’t always like that. Check out any of Pete Hunt’s early talks on React. They will help you understand the core of what React was meant to be (and still is).\n\nWeb dev folks who have been around longer have an advantage — they have context you don’t have. They were there for the painful years and know intuitively *why* things like React are helpful.\n\nYou can definitely build that context for yourself, though. In addition to Pete Hunt’s talks, it would also help to explore the browser itself, how it does layout/paint, the JavaScript event loop, the DOM, what transpilation is, etc.\n\nThings may seem overwhelming for a while, but it will get better. I think the closer you get to the “metal” (in this case, the browser), the more leverage your time will have. Not only will it untether you from a specific framework, it will give you an intuition of what is actually possible in the browser, and you will start to understand what frameworks like React actually need to do, under the hood, to provide the functionality that they do.\n\nI think you’re in a great frame of mind for this stuff. Stick with it and I think you’ll do really well.",

How react works isn’t really something you should concern yourself with too much (until you run into an issue where that might be relevant). Learning how the maintainers intend for the tools to be used is very valuable, but learning the inner workings of the framework is kinda pointless for 2 main reasons. The first is that a big part of using a framework (or any library) is that someone else has already devoted the time to solving some complicated problem and they probably solved it better than you could have, and have encountered more edge cases than you’ll consider. Relatedly, while a (good) library will probably take in to consideration backwards compatibility wrt how you use the library, none are really going to make a guarantee that how they do it will be backwards compatible, so there is a very real chance that even if you learned all the inner workings of react that by the time you learned it all something will have changed. \n\nThink of it this way, do you think the average engineer working on the next corvette is really that concerned with how the radio works, or how the CAN bus system works? Probably not, at least not nearly as much as the are concerned with how their system interacts with those components. Modern software engineering in the context of web development is much more about integration than implementation.",

Work with React for a while and then look around at other frontend frameworks to see how they do things and you'll notice that they all tend to follow certain \"patterns\" and once you're familiar enough with these patterns these frameworks become a bit easier to pick up.\n\nAs an example, when people work without frameworks, i.e. with plain HTML+CSS+Javascript they'd typically group related bits of HTML in a div, assign an id to it, and then target that ID in the CSS and Javascript code to make it do stuff / look pretty. This forms the most basic expression of what frameworks call a \"component\" - a single \"piece\" of a UI that encapsulates  structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (Javascript).\n\nFrameworks like Svelte or Vue will let you package all 3 of these things into a single file and treat them like a custom-built HTML element you can plop down anywhere in your site. React accomplishes the same thing with JSX. Stuff like that.\n\nIt's like this because at the lowest level all of these frameworks (and their supporting tools) will generate plain-old HTML, CSS, and Javascript. So just keep doing what you're doing, and as long as you're mindful of the patterns that React is built on then the rest will come easy.",

On backend you can usually point to something concrete like performance or a clear constraint but on frontend a lot of the decisions are about tradeoffs that only make sense with context  \nFor example choosing one state approach over another because of how the UI evolves or handling layout in a way that avoids edge cases you’ve already run into  \nThis comes up a lot in interviews when you’re asked to explain those decisions out loud and under time pressure. How do you make those choices legible to someone who hasn’t lived in the code?",

Its like using a lot of if statements when you know a switch can work too. They are both still correct in doing what the customer wants.

Hear me out.\n\nToday, these tools are impressive to neophytes and disappointing/laughable to experts. But we're getting these stories out there. More people will make the same mistakes, but awareness is rising. \"Use X/Y/Z Rules.\" \"Don't let the tools run commands as superuser without review.\" \"Don't let the tools have full access to your prod DB.\" It's like watching 5 year olds stick their fingers places they shouldn't and get hurt, but that's the process and some day we'll all have those little plastic covers on our outlets so kids can't stick paper clips in them.\n\nBut part of me thinks those \"insanely stupid\" things are like speed bumps on the road. People being responsible are already fine. People driving a bit too fast get a reminder. Lunatics doing 80 get launched into the tree. Darwin wins again. But what happens when the next generation of tools come out pre-programmed with rules to avoid the stupidest mistakes? Because there will still be mistakes, but they'll be more subtle. Harder to detect. More insidious.\n\nBear in mind most of these models were trained on public data and a lot of public source code is on places like Github. Think through the last few repos you looked through. Some were probably insanely thoughtfully developed, like Linux, React, or Rust. But some are the stuff everyone here has seen - little side projects from newbie devs forking something already bad and making it even worse in clever ways, or \"NextJS+TailWind Starter Kit #3712\" or my favorite \"yet another JS auth system in which I demonstrate my complete lack of understanding of the most basic security principles.\" And these models are trained on those things, too.\n\nMy worry is the next round of mistakes won't be \"my key is in the repo\". It'll be revisiting the 90's and 00's in which we had things like side-channel attacks, timing attacks used to probe user accounts, etc. There is code out there that these models were trained on with those exact issues, right now today. What happens when you take down the electric fence that shocked the he11 out of dumbasses before, and now they can wander freely into the lion's cage?",

That’s why I’ve resisted using AI all this time. It’s getting harder though, recently I was told in a meeting that I *have* to use AI because we’re going to start many new projects this year and they want me to be “faster” instead of hiring more people.\n\nI don’t like the direction the industry is heading in at all. We’re sacrificing everything in a mad rush for the vague notion of “productivity”. Produce more things faster, usually of questionable quality, for what?",

A site that blocks you based on that is actually doing you a favor: they don't have any Chinese content, so you don't want to scrape them anyway, and once they block you, you can just carry on and scrape something else, rather than spending resources on figuring out whether there's any Chinese content there or not.\n\nIf your plan is to find websites to compromise so you can use them to spread Chinese propaganda, host Chinese malware targeting Chinese dissidents, launch spam campaigns targeted at Chinese people, break into foreign social media accounts Chinese people may be using, etc., then again you want to primarily target websites in Chinese, and the Accept-Language header serves the same purpose.\n\nOTOH, if your goal is to just compromise as many servers as you can to sell on the black market or use for whatever nefarious purposes, then you wouldn't use such a language header to begin with - you don't care about the language, you just want a target you can compromise, and the language it serves matters exactly not at all. It's possible that an attacker uses whatever Accept-Language header their HTTP client defaults to (and if the attacker operates from China, that might very well be zh-cn), and in those cases, blocking based on that header would actually work (and since you're not serving anything in Chinese, it's not going to hurt either), but it's trivially easy to change that header to impersonate a hacker in the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, or literally anywhere else, because Accept-Language is 100% an honor system. You can block the lazy ones here, and as long as there's enough other low hanging fruit out there, this is going to be effective, but it does absolutely nothing against targeted attacks.\n\nIn other words, the people who do this are either smart enough to *not* bypass your blocks (because they are actually helping them), or smart enough to bypass them (if that's actually helping them), or it doesn't matter because there are enough other targets out there (in which case the block is effective in the same sense as a pair of running shoes when you're attacked by a tiger, as per that popular joke: you won't be able to outrun the tiger, but you'll be able to outrun your peers).",

This lets you determine what a specific user has done. If they change their mind, you can either amend that row with an upsert, or perform a soft delete and add a new row. The soft delete option allows you a log of sorts.\n* Each post also has a total number of likes/dislikes, and when you are creating a new row in the previous step, you also amend the posts own total.\n* When you display the total number of likes/dislikes on a post, use the value in the post row itself, not the separate table. If you use the separate table, over time, there will be a performance impact, and you want to avoid that.\n* For the individual user, you can also fetch from that separate table to see if they've made a specific action on the post they're viewing. With the right indexes, this will have no performance issues.\n\nWhile this redundancy in data does violate the single source of truth paradigm, the performance benefits are not to be ignored. Also, if you're ever concerned that something went wrong, you _could_ reconstruct values from the separate table. Essentially, what you're trying to do is avoid repeating the same calculation over and over, which would happen if you _only_ used a separate table to calculate the values.

If someone slams that like button a million times in a second, the front-end would toggle back and forth but only 1 reaction gets recorded in the queue. The queue could be implemented with client-side persistent storage (localStorage) so things don't get \"lost\" if user leaves, assuming they come back you'll get it eventually. The api would accept {user_id, post_id[]} \n\nRegarding data model, {post_id, user_id, date_liked} unique constraint on {user_id, post_id} the API endpoint does an insert always and on conflict, and toggles date_liked to null (if set) or now (if null). You can have filtered index on {post_id; date_liked is not null} for pulling all likes for a post. Such a thing should be for showing likes on the UI. If you needed to do counts as well, it would work, but with enough rows (millions+) even an index only scan to count rows isn't going to be fast, especially when multiplied by number of posts you need to render - you'll need some kind of cache to avoid excessive counts if you hit that scale. A filtered index on {user_id ; date_liked is not null} to find what a user likes. That index would more be used for showing a list of a user's likes back to them.\n\nIt's also possible to do DELETE instead of upserts with nullable date_liked I suppose? Probably equivalent, I rarely use DELETE statements ,  usually preferring to keep records with `date_deleted` ... a null date_liked serves that same purpose.",

With this way other services do not need to make additional call to authz server, it just need to check if signature is valid. That's why JWT should be short lived. It basically one time use token that client needs so it can provide it to various different services to get required data. Extending jwt lifetime decreases security and ads headache. If your software going to check licence by making http call there is no big win in using jwt. There is also no practical purpose to share public key with client so it can check licence offline. You can just pretend that licence either valid while the client is offline, or require connection. Validating jwt client side is pointless because it can be tampered whatever the client wants. One more point is that `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` licence is much better from aesthetic point of view than 128 length b64 string that just stores redundant data.",

You just need to identify if the token belongs to someone who should have access, which will require you to have some sort of storage setup to determine who is allowed and who isn't and what each is allowed to do.\n\nThere are also a lot of people focused on the expiry date, saying you can make set a JWT expiry to whatever you want - while this is true it is HIGHLY advised NOT to do so for security purposes. So if you were thinking about creating a JWT that doesn't expire for say 1 year and issuing that out to a client, that wouldn't be a very good solution IMO.",

Development, business, and app forums are flooded with \"Look at this thing I built in 2 hours\" with code filled with emojis, em dashes, verbose comments from 8 different changes, the same purple-to-blue gradients, and the same basic card designs. The list of signs that AI was involved goes on and on.\n\nHowever, there is a lot being built with AI right now that could change the world. That could make you say wow. Some things you might not even realize AI was involved with at all. Those bad projects will die and fade to memory. The projects that provide value will continue to endure, and it's always been that way. Any business that provides relevant work will stay relevant; any developer that builds relevant and useful apps (regardless of how they were built) will stay relevant.\n\nIt's like a high school shop class that recently acquired a new bench saw. A hundred new birdhouses will get built, most of them suck and fall apart. A few will be amazing, and maybe one kid will become a master woodworker.\n\nThere will still be some amazing and beautiful things made in the future. The gold rush will turn into something else. My suggestion: turn down the noise, unplug a bit, maybe just code offline for a while.  There will never be a shortage of real problems to solve.",

Most people were already tired of the flood of advertisements, self-promotions and the amounts of posts saying \"hey, I found this website\", but it then being obvious that it's the website creator themselves who made this post. Most people will never see that one post you make on Reddit that one time to show off your actually good website, and most of the people who do see that post will ignore it, because for them it's just another ad.\n\nBack then, there were about **2 posts per month** of people introducing their Sudoku apps in the Sudoku Subreddit. That isn't so much and even that was too much for people to be interested. Maybe a couple dozen people scrolled by such a post, and maybe 5 people actually responded to it.\n\nNow with AI, there is roughly **1 new app posted every day** there! And most of them are pure and utter slop. The regulars on that Subreddit stopped responding *at all* to those kinds of posts because we're all drowning in that shit.\n\nI was lucky to have started *before* all this slop made people care even less than before about new web products.\n\nYes there could be great things in the future with the contribution of AI, but people will not see those things if they are drowning in more and more shit each and every day.\n\nEdit: I still want to say that I like your post, because we really need that tiny bit of hope. :)",

          "text": "So I’ve been equating LLMs utility to that of databases being used for web 2. I think the actual web 3 is more of a chat centric user experience where instead of deep link structured sites you’ll be able to refine ai conversations to a particular topic. That’s not something I think Google, OpenAI, or Meta will just capture I authentically believe it’ll be a combination of the llm models and open source ones being used on paper project basis. That’s where the utility for web based developers will be and the industry will shift paradigms to a point where everyone will have to upskill. If you complain about having to upskill it’s probably because you haven’t been in this long enough to see all of the different things on the web. \n\nWhat I do believe will happen is the actual need for your typical CRUD based developers will pretty much be moved overseas. The complexity of those apps isn’t enough to justify high incomes. Again chat bots, along with another thing that I’ll speak about in a sec, will take over the current experience of the web. The need for those apps will be less. Especially frontend side like react, angular, vue. \n\nThat said, I’m seeing a lot of html canvas based applications these days that displays information differently. I think this will be where a lot of the more talented frontend devs will land. Backend devs will more more towards IoT, real time apps, and create agentic rag systems with LLMs. If AI falls flat on its ass; which it won’t the current bubble is a speculative bubble, you’ll probably see things like phone companies come out with Chromebook like phones that run on cloud based Saas models - given if ai flops there’ll be computer everywhere. \n\nSo imo, you should worry if you’re not willing to upskill. There’s a lot of devs from the 2010s “I’m not learning unless I’m getting paid for it” well they’ll get crushed. Tech will always be cruel to those who refuse to keep up with it.",

          "text": "The stack usually looks like 1) some sort of e-commerce platform (Stripe, FastSpring, Paddle, whatever), and 2) some sort of license manager (homegrown / open source, commercial License managers etc) that listens to the e-commerce platform to know when to issue and dispatch a license and who to issue it to. Usually, 1 or 2 can also dispatch the license, but you can also use your own email service.\n\nThere's lots of ways to go about handling software entitlements for your end-users.\n\nLicense keys are fine if you're node locking the license entitlements to a desktop computer rather than something else (like a user), but rather than pre-generating keys, you might want to generate them automatically on the fly (when an order comes in for example), so that you don't run the risk of someone finding/guessing and consuming theme.\n\nTraditionally, the some sequence of characters in the license key stored some information about the license (which product, which version etc). you can research Partial Key Verification if you're interested in how entitlements used to be stored in the keys themselves. It's quite limited, and not particularly secure since it can be brute forced. Instead, the key usually doesn't store a whole lot of information (it's often just a completely random string), and license validation is usually done from a remote licensing server. In your case, the end user would enter a key into your app, and in the background, the license key along with some device fingerprint (unique persistent identifier of the desktop computer) and a product identifier would get sent sent to the license server. In turn, the license server checks if the license is valid, and can be bound to that particular device fingerprint, and if so, return the entitlements (turn on this feature, allow updates to this version of the app, set expiry date to dd/mm/yy, etc).\n\nLike others mentioned, there are alternatives to using license keys, such as user-based licensing, where you associate entitlements to a particular user who can identify themselves in different ways (username / password, or maybe some other sort of auth like Google, Active Directory etc). The advantage here is that the same auth can be used to also log in to an online account section to manage other things (users / subscriptions etc), and they don't need to create new credentials just to use your app.  \n  \nSince you're licensing desktop software, you may or may not want to still bind the license to a given device even if you're not using license keys, if you are concerned with credential sharing.\n\nOne other thing, you can set entitlements to a license key so that it can be used on more than one device, but set a maximum. That way, say a customer buys a license to use on 3 computers, you don't need to send 3 separate license keys.\n\nAnother consideration is how to handle offline situations or when to do license checks. You can ping the license server each time the app runs to make sure the license was not disabled (a refunded order for example), but that might get cumbersome, so there's usually a way to cache the license locally and only require an online check periodically.\n\n  \nThere's a lot more to this, like what do you do if the customer upgrades their hard disk and the device fingerprint no longer works. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions. We're a vendor in the [License Management ](https://licensespring.com)Space.",

At least from us who used to really enjoy to develop new things, who took the time to learn new technologies.\n\nThis is the first time that I've felt it and I wonder if the rest of you, who have years of development under your belt, feel the same. Here's the problem:\n\nI used to use one simple HTML generator in all of my work. It was built more than 10 years ago (yes, I have several decades in this line of work), but it worked flawlessly even until recently. It used handlebars for templating, gray matter and json/yaml files for data, it had nice way of writing and reusing partials, layouts and pages. In essence, it was straight-to-the-point and very simple HTML generator. HTML and nothing else. Simple. Perfect.\n\nBut time did its thing, project became unmaintained years ago and I decided to make something by myself. **In just a week**, with the help of the AI, I was able to replicate almost 95% of the original functionalities in modern Typescript, plus I've added a lot more: js/ts/scss compilation, markdown templating, HTML beautification / compression, a lot of unit tests, and much more. It is really a gem. A stand-in replacement for the software I used to use for more than a decade.\n\nProblem is that this doesn't feel like I've made it, even though I came up with a plan, directed AI through everything. Code even looks like I've wrote it, as AI copied my style almost perfectly, all weird parts were redone several times until it started to make sense, like it was written by myself. I wanted to make it open source, but then again - why would I if the rest of you will be able to accomplish the same, tailored to your own needs?\n\nDo the rest of you seniors have the same problem?",

It's just that very rarely, LLMs can suggest something I had never noticed.\n\nOnce in a personal project, I had trouble trying to create a SSE endpoint that streams data from a broadcast channel. My original solution did not work at all. Being a beginner in Rust also did not help. After tinkering it for hours with no progress, I gave up and asked ChatGPT. At first, it gave me a weird wrong fix using mpsc channels. Then, it suggested me to use tokio\\_stream instead. Turns out that crate had a struct that can solve my issue. It gave me an example code, I read the documentation, I tweak it to fit my codebase, and it turns out, it worked. My SSE endpoint can now stream data coming from a broadcast channel. If I stubbornly keep trying to make it work on my own, I don't think I'll ever figure it out.\n\nSometimes, LLM could provide some productivity boost.\n\nAnother time, I created a complex SQL statement in phpMyAdmin involving multiple joins and subqueries. Because I am too lazy to convert them to Laravel's query builder, I just ask ChatGPT to convert the query from text to the query builder syntax. After I checked the code and made sure the code did get translated correctly, I put it in the codebase.\n\nI also like the autocomplete LLM tools provide in my IDE. If the autocomplete is bad, I can just press the escape key to remove it. But if it's good, a press of a tab, and I saved some dozen keystrokes.",

If your project needs to support Safari or Firefox, relying on this new API isn't viable for production yet.\n\nFor a cross-browser solution that allows for subtext, icons, or complex layouts inside a dropdown, the modern best practice is to use a **headless UI library**. \n\nI highly recommend:\n* **Radix UI (Select)**\n* **Base UI (Select)**\n\n**Why this route?**\n1. **Accessibility (A11y):** Building a custom select from scratch with `div` and `ul` tags is an accessibility nightmare (handling keyboard navigation, aria-roles, etc.). These libraries handle all the logic for you.\n2. **Styling Freedom:** Since they are \"headless,\" they don't come with default styles. You can easily use Flexbox or Grid to add subtext to your options while keeping the underlying component accessible.\n\nIf you don't want to reinvent the wheel, go with a headless component.

There could be some potential there, to go for a more volume/quanitity approach, where you could essential setup and manage there sites (still using wix, wordpress, etc) along with there socials etc, and charge a small overhead fee.

You can modify my starter template that I use for all my projects. You never need forums for small businesses. Dont waste your time. For stores, you use Shopify embed tool to embed a store into an existing website. Keep things simple. \n\nI clone that kit and edit the html and css files to what I need for the new design I have. 11ty handles all the templating and makes working alot cleaner and easier \n\nhttps://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Website-Kit-LESS\n\nIt’s got a working blog system already. For booking you use calendly or square or any other third party software. \n\nNext is the sales part. That’s the stuff most developers fail at because it’s something they never had to do before. You need a unique selling point, and be able to identify problems in a website and explain why they’re problems and sell them the solutions and why you’re uniquely able to solve them for them. If you can solve problems for them, doesn’t matter how nice of a website you make them, they have no reason to buy from you. You need to be able to sell against Wix and other builders and fiver developers. If you don’t have the answers as to why you’re better than them then you aren’t ready to start selling. \n\nJust because anyone can get a site up within 5 minutes doesn’t mean it’s a GOOD website.

I’m 100% self employed doing it. You start out as an LLC and once you make enough to afford a reasonable salary like $100k a year, and have leftover money for expenses and operations, you elect as an S-Corp to save money on self employment taxes and setup a payroll software like gusto to take out taxes for you an deposit your paycheck into your bank account. You can also get insurance from them through regence health for single member corporations. That’s how I set it up. I’m a w2 employee of my own business and I pay myself biweekly with automatic deposits. I don’t have to do anything. Business currently generates about $35k a month and growing.

Even when they have Wordpress, they will still bug you for edits. \n\nYou don’t need plugins or admin dashboards. Booking is done via third party services like Calendly where you add their link to the site to click on and go to their site to complete the action. E-commerce is done via Shopify embed where you embed a store in an existing static site. Contact forms are handled by an attribute on the form tag that connects to Netlify and they route your emails for you. No plugin needed. And what’s nice about not having Wordpress is you don’t need to constantly update plugins or Wordpress versions and worry about hacking or whatever beef matt mullinwag has with a vital plugin you use and crippled your clients sites. By leaving Wordpress you’re gaining more control over your code, what goes into it, better security, less reliant on external companies to run your business, they can load faster, and be future proof. I have sites that have been online for over 7 years and never touched them. They’re still online and as good as the day I left them. And it’s FREE to host them on netlfiy. I don’t need to set up blue host or anything. \n\nBottom line is there hasn’t been much that Wordpress does that I haven’t been able to do and do better.

They’re gonna be more work to deal with because what that says about them as a person is they are very hands on and need to control everything.

We’re developers. It’s easier for us to edit code so why do we need a cms an extra layer on complexity on the site just to edit it? I get everything and more by doing it myself in my own setup where I have the most control and flexibility. That’s why I don’t use Wordpress.  And my Clients prefer i don’t.

Yeah, you can ship something fast, but the constant back-and-forth, edge cases, and little frictions add up and get mentally exhausting. Getting to a truly polished, professional, “this feels like a real business” result is still pretty far away.\n\nI’m currently working with a bunch of engineers on an open-source, GitHub-related product. In theory we could build the site ourselves. In practice we’re outsourcing parts of it — because we don’t want a 60/80, we want a 100.\n\nSo IMO your edge isn’t just “I can code a site.” It’s the full package: professionalism, trust, outcomes, and being able to guide clients through decisions (copy, positioning, SEO, performance, analytics, maintenance, etc.). Also, your target audience matters a lot: who they are, what the site is for, what “good enough” means to them, and how close you can reliably get them to that.",

His model basically competes with platforms like Wix and SquareSpace as an independent alternative, and that's great.\n\nIf you are looking to create more complex sites, then your bet is to market to agencies; there's still a HUGE market for custom websites that agencies need, and they don't want to use site builders. That's my niche, and I absolutely love it, as it often dovetails with application development, as well. The extra great part of working B2B is you don't get caught up in the individual client minutia, which can be very taxing. Agencies have teams of more technically inclined people that \"get\" the web better than a small business owner does.\n\nOh, and if you are creating something like WordPress sites, you generate recurring revenue through service and maintenance plans, which is where my ARR comes from between the project work.",

I get asked for apps from time to time and I just pass them off to my friends to do for me. I don’t wanna do apps. Too complicated, too time consuming, and too much work. My time is better spent building and selling subscriptions. \n\nMaking partnerships is crucial. I have designers, others developers, social media, ads, and SEO partners I use for my agency they touch on every aspect of a website and its growth strategies. The idea of an agency is it’s not just you doing everything. It’s a group of people using their unique skills as needed. No developer should be doing SEO, design work, ads, and social media on top of support and sales and development. I always tell People to partner up as soon as you can and find good people to add value to your work and services. Like for large scale apps I just send them to my guy in Canada and take a 10% referral commission. Or I have two other guys on my team that can make smaller custom apps or features and I just charge the client for it and have them do it with a markup. \n\nBy focusing on simpler sites with a recurring subscription I can make more money for my time spent on a project. It’s a shift in priority. I don’t want to make $20k apps. I’d rather spend that time selling subscriptions that will make me more money in the long term and just take commissions and Markups paying other people to do the bigger stuff. Finding app clients or agency work in that high ticket enterprise space is difficult. And if you rely on one agency for your work, you’re not protected from market shifts. What if they close down? Down size? Find cheaper alternatives and cut you out? Now your income stream is gone. I suggest building something you control first and add partnerships as you go. I have many white label partnerships where I build websites first other agencies. But they aren’t my main source of revenue and sales. They’re supplemental. My business carries on with or without them. That’s more secure.",

Since my client base is largely other marketing agencies, the sites tend to be significant in size and a CMS is needed. WP is usually requested, for obvious reasons, although we've been known to dabble with others.\n\nFor example, we're working on the site for [Everett Community College](https://www.everettcc.edu/) (in your neck of the woods, actually! This is the *old* site, btw. New site is not live yet!). \n\nFor all intents and purposes, its a \"brochure-ware\" site, but its absolutely massive. 1500+ pages, individual department microsites, hundreds of editors with unique permissions/roles per department, Code Fusion application integrations, CRM integration, multiple API syncs for their different data providers (e.g. Events and Directory)...the list goes on and on. WordPress was an absolute must-have (are currently on Drupal and can't get away from it fast enough). It's nearing the end but its been almost a year-long project. Once completed, we'll be entering a long term commitment for management (which goes well beyond just content and updates).\n\nAs far as relying on agency work; every business has an achilles heel. I've had many agencies come and go, but we're always doing outreach and have a high rotation. In fact, we just had that happen last year, decent sized agency we worked with went south. It created an opening for another that was waiting in the wings, and we had our best year yet!\n\nBut, you are right about divesting the product offering, which is why I have a [Celebration Platform](https://wallabie.me/) that I've created that's gaining ground, and am working on an education course that I'll be selling with a unique approach to learning technical skills (with a focus on coding/development).",

At this point, it kind of feels like trying to get work as a typewriter repairman or something.\n\n\n\nOn the flip side, get into machine learning and offer those solutions instead maybe.  I don't know, but for example just take local restaurants...  go through their menu, create feature set, add all dishes in with correct features.  Create feature set for each table seated, log each table correctly.  \n\n\n\nYou now have multiple matrices will quality  scored data you can run through various ML models and algorithms to get some cool results that would help the restaurant.  Protein most ordered, drinks, time of day, # of people per table, avg cost per-person, and a whole slew of things.\n\n\n\nThat may actually be doable I think, no?",

              "text": "I don’t think that is true. \n\nFrom reading the article, the issue is really to do with the specifications allowing Apple to be ambiguous in how they support features. \n\n> Mandatory automatic resizing: First, the navigation bar at the top of the screen will appear and dissappear depending on the user's most recent gesture. There is no event your application can receive to know this is happening, nor any measurement you can take to detect it.\n>\n> The standard CSS features vw and vh units are broken by this behavior, so trying to create a whole-page user experience will break on iOS Safari.\n\nThe author is just used to the fact that other browsers clear the whole screen. \n\nThe original CSS specs never defined how vh should behave with dynamic browser layouts. Safari’s behavior is annoying, but Chrome and Firefox historically behaved differently here too. \n\nIf you read the actual CSS specifications you will see that “vh” is meant to be “Equal to 1% of the height of the initial containing block.” There’s literally no other description. \n\nNew units (svh/lvh/dvh, whatever) exist precisely because this was a spec failure. However, because they were implemented after vh was originally implemented, it just added to the problem. \n\n> Useless fullscreen behavior: The Fullscreen API is supposed to work on iPad, and I wasted time trying to offer it to my users. But it has three ridiculous problems: First, it replaces the top of the screen with a black area and an irremovable \"X\" which doesn't actually reclaim any more space than the address bar would have.\n>\n> Second, if the user scrolls down in any element anywhere on the page, full-screen mode ends.\n\nThere is a way to fix this. Add the webpage to the home screen (Share -> More -> Add to Home Screen) and it will remove any other interactivity. This is how Xbox lets you do Cloud Streaming in full screen on iOS via Safari.\n\nHowever, again, the issue is with the specifications. The specifications don’t define how full screen should behave on mobile devices, where there is often no way to simply alt tab out or similar. \n\nThe specifications _allow_ the ambiguity in implementation by browser engines. The issue is with the spec. \n\n> You see, Apple is of the opinion that .play() method should only work if it's in response to a user action, which they implement by checking if the user has tapped an element on the page. \n\nApple isn’t the only one of that opinion. I think the spec for .play literally requires user interaction as well.\n\nAll browsers, including iOS safari, require interaction before playing audio. The reason he didn’t experience it on desktop is because he is _developing_ the site on desktop. After you visit a site enough times, it sets an autoplay policy on the page.\n\nYou can see how [Google handle it in Chrome here.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay)\n\nYou can also [read the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Autoplay) on autoplay to find countless workarounds or pitfalls for trying to use the play method as an autoplay. Unfortunately people don’t want autoplaying audio, and the authors complaints will fall on deaf ears. \n\nThe article reads less like an actual bug report and more like a “things that make web dev harder on iOS” list. That’s fair, but conflating bugs and platform/engine policy on specifications makes the situation look worse than it actually is.\n\nI do agree that there are some iOS specific bugs (like the flexbox issues the author faced, the CSS propagation, the iPad fullscreen fuckery, the rendering glitches) but a lot of the other issues are simply because the specifications are so badly written and defined that they allow the ambiguity by different browser engines.\n\nIf the spec was actually less ambiguous, WebKit would probably match other browsers more closely. The author should have looked more into the specifications that define the features he talks about and wrote about how badly they’re written (especially in the modern “mobile” era).",

I'm curious to know what methods you all find most effective. Do you prefer using OAuth providers like Google or Facebook for social login, or do you lean towards implementing your own custom authentication systems? Additionally, how do you handle user sessions securely? I’ve been exploring JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication, but I’m also aware of potential pitfalls like token expiration and refresh strategies. What tools or libraries do you recommend for managing authentication flows, and have you encountered any challenges while implementing them? I’m looking forward to hearing your experiences and best practices!",

The security risks and maintenance burden of custom solutions rarely outweigh the benefits.\n\nFor most modern web apps, here is the pragmatic approach:\n\n * OAuth/OIDC: Lean heavily on identity providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub). It reduces friction for users and offloads the security responsibility of password management.\n\n * Session Management: Be careful with JWTs. While popular, they are often misused. Storing long-lived JWTs in localStorage opens you up to XSS attacks. For standard web apps, server-side sessions with HttpOnly, Secure cookies remain the gold standard for security. Use JWTs primarily for service-to-service communication or when you truly need statelessness at scale.\n\n * Tools: Don't build from scratch. Use battle-tested managed services like Auth0, Clerk, Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth. If you need to self-host, libraries like NextAuth (Auth.js) or Keycloak handle the complexity of refresh tokens and flows correctly.\n\nFocus on your app's unique business logic, not the plumbing of user identity.",

This is an important discrepency, because the attack surface of an XSS attack may vary depending on the context. What this means is, if you have an XSS vulnerability, if the vulnerable input/data has some validation, this could limit what attackers are able to inject/do. Whereas if an authorization is stolen, there are no limits.\n\n> CSRF protection\n\nThey're forgetting to mention that if you're using traditional form submits, these do not go through a CORS/pre-flight check. Regardless of your cookie settings, if you're using native form submits you will always need a CSRF token.\n\n> The JWT should only be valid for at most 5 minutes.\n\nThis is a very good recommendation, Auth0/OWASP typically recommend < 15mins, Clerk provides 1 min expiry time on it's tokens. However I believe the guide does not seem to include a lot of nuances to JWT based auth, such as how to properly handle refreshing a token, how to store the JWT vs how to store the refresh token, storage specific considerations (memory, session storage, local storage), where memory is recommended by both Auth0 and OWASP, but then has many limitations.\n\nSession based Auth is generally what most people want and need. JWT has specific use cases, most people don't have those use cases and they're using the wrong tool for the job. I think Lucia could benefit from a bit of a decision tree guide on how to decide whether you should use sessions or JWT. For example, native apps not running in a browser? Use JWT. A web app? Use a session. If you have multiple web based services and you need them to all authenticate through a centralised service, then that central service will use OAuth or JWT, but you'l typically use that to then delegate session based auth to each individual app.\n\n> Session refresh\n\nLucia doesn't seem to detail that a session should be re-generated upon privilege escalation or de-escalation. E.g. on login, logout, sudo access.\n\n> OAuth\n\nTheir OAuth stuff is refreshing to see, code verifier and the like indicates PKCE flow which is good.",

Rolling your own auth in 2025 is like building your own payment processing - technically possible but usually a bad idea.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The real challenge isn't authentication, it's authorization\\*\\*. Who can access what? That's where most bugs happen. Use role-based access control (RBAC) for simple apps, attribute-based (ABAC) if you need granular permissions.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*One often-missed detail\\*\\*: Implement proper session timeout and renewal. Long-lived tokens are a security risk, but aggressive timeouts annoy users. Find the balance.\n\n\n\nAlso: 2FA should be table stakes for any app handling sensitive data. Not as optional premium feature.",

Building your own payment processor has a much higher security standard to adhere to.\n\nAuthentication is, at its lowest level, comparing two strings. Adding in hashing libraries is generally less than 10 lines of code in total.\n\nIf you think a payment processor is that simple, you have no idea what you're talking about.",

That's the \"proven library\" route I'd recommend.\n\n\n\nBut yeah, if someone's literally writing password hashing from scratch or building their own OAuth provider... that's a different story. Use bcrypt/Passport/Auth0 for sure.\n\n\n\nThe analogy I'd use: \n\n\\- Rolling auth = using Stripe API (integration, not reinventing)\n\n\\- Building from scratch = literally building your own payment processor\n\n\n\nThanks for clarifying - totally agree on using battle-tested libraries for the crypto/security layer!",

But when you try to scale it up and change architecture of the code you wrote, it starts to hallucinate fast af. I made up the same app with same model twice and structure, solutions to problems and even commenting style was completely different. You can't depend to words you choose for your prompt, that is not ideal in any circumstances and nobody would like to summarize their performance and vision by LLM outputs I guess. This softwares are lack of creativity, common sense and they are just regular liars. I am an IT specialist, I need quick assists all the time because I have a really comprehensive responsibility field. These models misled me countless times because of their lack of training data. \n\nLet's say there is a new framework on gpt 3/4 era, passthrough stupid models like gpt 3.5 or gpt 4.5 going to make up misinformation about that framework and create their mini-frameworks inside it to make you happy. they're determined for only one objective, make you believe that they're found the perfect solution. It is only possible by your sight, there is no room on engineering side of business for this immature drive.\n\nLet's say I can not use \"ls\" command on PowerShell, if it is a session during in the models dumb moment; it is probably going to create a fucking PowerShell script to make you happy and only say;\n\nYou're absolutely right! Since \"ls\" command is especially designed and used by sh/bash shells, there is no way to use it on Windows PowerShell! So here goes a script for your own custom solution:\n\n\nStupid fuck can't even say that you are not inside Shell, it only uses a really thin line of connection between two information pool, \"bash is used mostly on Linux and user told me he can't use ls; so it is not possible on Windows because Windows is not linux\" this is it, if you use models with that stupid think tags, which is only promotive way to make you burn more tokens, at some point it starts to think exact this way. You can't never trust to LLM to create really enterprise-grade solutions without reviewing it tens of times but nobody doesn't accept it. Stakeholders are happy about the hysteria created by \"Powered by Ai\", \"Ai Assisted\" prefixes and they really don't care if it is productive/effective or not.\n\nI am in hurry so sorry for my wrecked grammar/English.",

It’s really great for surfacing tradeoffs I might miss.\n\nI use it to break big work into a step-by-step checklist (migrations, feature rollouts, refactors, etc) including edge cases and rollback plans.\n\nIf I’m really struggling with figuring out a bug or unexpected error I’ll give it a log snippet + the relevant code + expected behavior and make it generate a short list of likely causes. It isn’t always 100% helpful obviously, but greatly reduces the time to pinpoint issues I’m stuck with and get to a point of a bug being fixed.\n\nI ask it to review PRs for bugs, incorrect assumptions, missing validation, security gaps, and naming clarity. This is honestly one of the most significant use cases for me right now. Considering I’m building things alone, it’s VERY nice to have another “set of eyes” look at a change I’m making and then find and/or point out potential issues early on.\n\nDrafts for README/docs, changelogs, customer-facing copy, etc. I always tweak it to sound more like me and correct hallucinations, but it’s a force multiplier and makes the process of creating docs extremely easy and not so much a drag.\n\nWhen I don’t understand something, I make it explain it like I’m new and link to the relevant documentation, then I ask it to quiz me or give a tiny practice exercise. That’s been huge for filling gaps and getting onboard with new things quickly. RTFM when I want deeper and more specific insight and to verify my understandings in case of hallucinations in its responses.\n\nThe absolute biggest rule I’ve set is that I never ship something I can’t explain or don’t understand.

What really motivated me was public support - when people reacted, commented, and encouraged me. That feeling matters a lot. Later, I decided to build a web app where I could set goals and openly write about how I move toward them. I added goal categories, roadmaps, likes, comments, streaks, and boosts to support other users. Over time, I managed to implement all of this in the product. Of course, someone could say: “Why not just use social networks?” The problem is that on social media your steps get mixed with other posts. Progress becomes blurry, and people don’t really see your journey. In my app, every step you write becomes part of your achievement. It doesn’t get lost or mixed with random content - it stays exactly where it belongs. You can create multiple achievements, work toward different goals every day, and share your progress with your community and other users. So my main goal is simple: to make this application truly useful - something that genuinely helps people stay consistent and reach their goals.",

Here's my checklist for evaluating library maturity vs abandonment:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Check issue response time\\*\\* - Are maintainers actively triaging and responding to new issues? Even mature libraries should acknowledge critical bugs.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Look at dependency updates\\*\\* - If dependencies are severely outdated (especially security patches), that's a red flag.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Review the changelog\\*\\* - Mature libraries still get occasional releases for compatibility updates (new Node versions, etc.). Complete silence for 2+ years is concerning.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Check npm download trends\\*\\* - Declining downloads might indicate the ecosystem is moving away from it.\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Look for alternatives\\*\\* - If the maintainers themselves recommend migrating to a successor, that's your answer.\n\n\n\nFor UI libraries specifically, lack of updates to support latest React/framework versions is usually the telling sign.",

I am a new web dev and as far as my knowledge goes about SPAs is that they are good because when navigating the site you don't have to fetch the pages from the server because they are already on the client. But what I see is the opposite, a reddit post content needs to be fetched from the server and you have to wait for that (plus the hydration), a youtube video also needs to be fetched from the server and a built in loading bar is needed for the ux. So why not just use the browser's?\n\n... And happy new year everyone :D\n\nEdit: Yeah just to clarify when I said SPA, I was thinking about client side navigation not data fetching.",

For all I know, it'll never stop loading, it still might be broken. I'm like a kid on a road trip, wondering over and over, \"Are we there yet?\"\n- If I click something and a progress bar starts filling, then I know my action was registered and I have a sense of how long it'll be until it succeeds. Instead of wondering whether it'll load forever, I can guess when the wait will end. Being able to imagine the end point genuinely makes the time until then feel shorter.\n\nThere's lots to measure and optimize in the development of user interfaces, but never forget that they exist for humans, not machines. Lots of psychology goes into designing excellent interfaces, progress bars are just one example of how a \"technically unnecessary\" feature leads to a better perceived experience.",

Otherwise your conversion for example might have not been tracked. Because of that you had callback to progress to next stage which if request failed was not called. Often you had to wait for multiple callbacks from multiple tools and if you didn't code it well any failure meant no progress.\n\nCurrently that's rarely an issue anymore unless with some weird analytics / affiliate programmes. But then 100s of those tools added are often not updated since before cookie support changes few years ago and they error with Adblock / blocked cookies. I even seen some official WP plugins coded that way.\n\nThen there's the biggest culprit for random bugs on checkout in larger organizations. Goddamn tag manager. Whoever came up with idea that marketing people should be able to add js to site freely should frankly go to prison. Devs generally gonna notice that callbacks from third party weird plugins can be a problem ( mostly because they have Adblock :) ) but goddamn marketing people might be changing stuff weekly without any dev checking it.
