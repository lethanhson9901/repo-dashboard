For set B, it builds another custom filter function and custom format function.\n\nA smart programmer would recognize that if they built a slightly-more-flexible function that handles the filtering AND the formatting with a couple extra lines of code, they can replace those four other functions.\n\nThe example I'm channeling above went from \\~1,200 LOC to \\~800 LOC after we humans cleaned it up.

Mostly because backend dev is very detail oriented so you have to have a very in depth prompt to get the results you want and then often still need massaging afterwards. The biggest pro is I hope this will encourage other devs to write better feature documentation and tickets since you can take all those hours of writing and plug it into your prompt to get 90% done.

It's not that there's an explosion of software. It's roughly the same software with a fraction of the workforce.\n\nI've seen a lot of these threads on reddit and so many comments are clearly speculative and are clearly coming from people who don't understand the way the ecosystem is changing. I lived thru it at my company I am telling you that is what's happening.\n\nThis screenshot of 15k line goal per day is on the egregious side but it reflects the change we are seeing nonetheless.\n\nI spend way more time writing plans and reviewing code than writing (I'm not vibing in the black box sense).

This is how I'm working these days and yeah it's not 15k lines but it's definitely somewhere in the thousands. That's just with open source models and no AI budget so to speak. Imagine if I had actual resources..\n\nThe force multiplication is real but you still have to know what you are doing to get something good out. You get better at working with the whole roulette wheel of it as you go too. \n\nIt's not faster in the incidental sense but there is more happening overall with less. \n\nSome of the layoffs are MBA's jumping the gun but some are not and we are still in the stages where i.t people adopt faster than everyone else. Just wait 5 more years until it has hit every profession in every way. \n\nI already lost my job due to economic forces and that's how I had the time to piss around and retrain for all this nonsense and there is a lot of nonsense! There is also a lot of truth buried amongst it. I hate it all but what the hell else you gunna do. I need to run faster than the next lion about to eat me and this industry has always been that way. The more people taking hard stances against it will be fine, until they aren't. Like that Tyson quote. Everybody got a plan until they get punched in the face. \n\nSo on one hand I'm mad that I had just got my place sorted out after 8 years before they decided I made too much. On the other hand. This break, this gift has me 2 years ahead of many others on the topic. My wife doesn't understand, she just sees me knee deep in .MD docs. My network of i.t friends are starting to ask me if I can make them one off things because I can do it faster.\n\nThe other ones are scared to ask me questions. I try not to talk about it because it upsets a lot of people but at the same time I'm doing more. A lot more and quality is not the issue. I'm a card carrying better offline advocate as well so emotionally it's a turbulent thing to listen and agree with Ed all day long and then open my ide and sell my soul to this. I.t people are going to be seen as no different as people who contribute to oil industry. Business is going to be absolutely addicted to it forever. \n\nAt least when it was Google search back in the dsy. We got to be positive and less cynical about the world. Then spent years lifting people up, educating etc. This is not that. It's the antithesis of that. This is dog eat dog survival unless some unforeseen boom is coming but I don't see it. I just see more enshitification. More broken garbage and a few people who know what they are doing, do a lot more but not be able to easily separate themselves as such.",

I've seen AI generate 3000 lines that could be replaced with 200 lines of well-structured code. The models optimize for 'working output' not 'minimal correct implementation.'\n\nThe actually useful metric for AI-assisted dev is something like 'features shipped per week that survive production for 30 days without a rollback.' That captures both velocity AND quality.\n\nWhat I've noticed in practice: the developers who are most productive with AI tools are the ones who spend 70% of their time *deleting and refactoring* what the AI wrote, not the ones generating the most. -1K LOC days are genuinely the best days.

What's next. Handing our requests over for AI training? Selling our private data to other companies? \n\nWhere exactly is the security of having our login stuff sitting on greed driven servers?",

What’s your thinking on bring your own model? Curious what you’d want there.\n\nAnd yeah, Go was intentional. Concurrent request handling is exactly why. When you’re running hundreds of API calls in a flow, it matters.\n\nThe HAR import with automatic variable mapping is exactly for your use case.

By getting the \"this is what service is signed up with that email address\" before authenticating, you allow strangers to learn two accounts that a person has simply by knowing an often public or at least unguarded piece of information about them.\n\nBest practice is to reveal as little as possible about an account to unauthenticated users. That's why it's also recommended that \"forgot my password\" prompts should say something like \"if that email is registered with the system it'll receive a reset code\" rather than \"we've found that account and will send you a reset code\" and why \"this is the wrong password for that account\" messages should instead say something like \"there is no account with this username and password\".\n\nIs it the end of the world? Often no. But it's the best practice because it avoids you having to decide for a user whether them having an account with you is private information. Only they have enough context to decide that and that's often something that needs to be continuously reevaluated as your service evolves, so it's better to start cautiously because you can't undo people finding out your user lists.",

A few production considerations that often get missed:\n\n**Token refresh strategy**: When the provider token expires, are you refreshing silently in the background or forcing re-auth? Silent refresh is better UX but requires handling edge cases (user revoked your app in provider settings).\n\n**Account linking**: What happens when a user signs up with email/password, then later tries OAuth with the same email? Do you auto-link accounts or create duplicates? Duplicate accounts are a support nightmare.\n\n**Revocation handling**: Test what happens when a user revokes your app's access in their Google/GitHub settings. Your app should handle 401s gracefully and prompt re-auth, not just crash.\n\n**State parameter validation**: I see you're using state for CSRF protection—good! But verify you're also checking it server-side (not just generating it).\n\nThe tricky part isn't the OAuth flow itself, it's all the edge cases around account state.

They had big announcements about how they were overhauling the platform and in spite of them almost certainly thinking half their tech teams could be replaced with LLMs, my guess is the reality of competing in the space became very clearly too expensive very quickly. What an ignoble end. But really it was those years of the free tier than sank them I’m sure /s\n\nNgl DHH quadrupling down on being an untenable, repellent dickhead and the slow motion car crash of Heroku both gave me a bit of a professional midlife crisis last year. I came out a better, happier developer but it didn’t make dealing with those feelings any more pleasant, it’s a real shame when things turn to shit but I thank my lucky stars that I got to come up right before dev bootcamps saturated the market with juniors and sort of broke the sustainability of focused, mentor/apprentice pair programming dynamics.",

No vendor lock-in, you own the servers. Think Heroku-style deploys but to a /mo VPS. Great if you want to understand what's actually happening.\n- **Coolify** — self-hosted PaaS that gives you Heroku-like UI on your own infrastructure.\n\n**If your app is simple enough:**\n- **Hatchbox** for Rails specifically — manages the entire server for you.\n\nThe no-new-enterprise-accounts is the real tell.

A test that checks if a button renders is not protecting me from anything.\n\n  \nAnother one: keeping components \"pure\" and lifting all state up. In theory it sounds clean. In practice you end up with prop drilling hell or reach for a state management library for things that could just be local state. I've gone back to colocating state where it's used and only lifting when there's an actual reason.\n\n  \nCurious what others have quietly dropped.

If the thought of letting a junior loose in a segment of the code makes you shiver, your test coverage is probably lacking.\n\nSounds obvious because it is, but prioritise testing the most important things. Destructive actions, core user flows, anything that if it failed in production would be a real catastrophe.\n\nUsually don't waste time writing tests that boil down to implicitly testing library or framework functionality. If a mature library has to have an undocumented breaking change in order for a test to fail, it's probably not a super useful test, except perhaps in super sensitive mission critical contexts.\n\nOften integration or snapshot tests will implicitly cover a lot of unit test cases - in those scenarios the unit tests probably not  adding much extra value.\n\nFor UI, automated visual regression testing tools can and should replace a lot of \"did X component mount\" type testing, and these days can also do a lot of interaction testing as well.",

It's not a true 100% test coverage, because I don't test everything, but it's 100% with explicit /\\* c8 start ignore \\*/ and /\\* c8 end ignore \\*/ statements for code that is not reasonable to test (eg external services, code tested by types anyway, code where its brokenness would come out immediately upon execution of tests regardless of whether they are explicitly tested, and so on). Also, I prefer mutation testing metrics over test coverage as a \"metric\". Test coverage is not really a good indicator for code stability as probably most people here know. \n\nI prefer working it this way a lot, because I'll know based on coverage where I have \"wonky\" code that may not be thought through sufficiently and I can also be almost certain that the code I have written is doing what I expected it to do. Expectations themselves prove wrong at times regardless, but often I can go for weeks without having any bugs in the code like that. \n\nAs I said earlier, I also expect no survivors in my library code when using mutation testing. I've found that often it helps removing excess code and finds very obscure bugs in advance. It also enforces 100% test coverage although you can also ignore parts of the code like with test coverage. Having no survivors in the mutation tests makes the library code a lot more mature and reliable from the start. I've never regretted time spent there, although I think it'd be excessive for UI or even API code. I use it for business logic and anywhere I can have pure functions.\n\nFor very interactive or time-related code - like HTML template generation or FE interactions, I agree with having less than 100% coverage. It is simply so time consuming to test the details it that usually it's just not worth it writing the tests. ",

Before you know it, you have a single block of code with three or four different and competing ideas shoehorned in and, behold, now none of them work. \n\nThere is a certain boundary where DRY interferes with modularity. The one piece of code that handles 6 different things having a latent bug or catastrophic edge case is much more cataclysmic versus a scenario where the 6th slightly different implementation shits the bed. You don't drag down the 5 working cases trying to bludgeon the 6th one in. \n\nBits and bytes are cheap. I only reuse code if I am doing the exact same thing the original code was designed for. And even then, chances are, I am going to rewrite what I had before and make it slightly better with whatever new tricks I picked up since the first iteration (meaning, I'm not technically doing a repeat in the first place).\n\nWriting some God-level function you can reuse through your entire repo in perpetuity is a fantasy scenario that, even if successful, means you are stagnating on a single idea just because it worked once in a particular context. But the habit of saying 'oh, I shouldn't repeat myself, I wrote a function similar to this back a year or two ago... Let me go dig it up...' isn't always an efficient use of your time and can be counter-peoductive when you finally do locate it and there are slight differences that mean you'll end up rewriting a portion of it, anyway. You could have typically cranked out a tailored solution with your latest skill level during that same period. \n\nObviously YMMV, but I used to be OCD about DRY and it is unhealthy. I've been repeating the same CRUD going on 20+ years now. If I was strictly adhering to DRY, I likely wouldn't have changed much about my process during that time. My own improvement was often hindered in the past by leaning too heavily on custom frameworks and libraries I had concocted. Why write new code when old code does same thing? And the truth is, constantly rewriting the same blocks of code, you get better at it. Not just faster, but more efficient, more secure, prettier code.  \n\nKind of an extreme example, I know, but letting DRY rule your workflow process can be poison to not just your repo but your meta progression as a developer.",

Too many times, I went back, refactored a bit and then \"fixed\" my working code, correcting some obvious mistake in my logic or syntax, only to slowly realize over some time that the original implementation has issues when written \"correctly\", how you'd assume it should be. \n\nPast me already spent two days debugging this same issue before writing the \"bad code\". Sometimes I would be two hours into deja vu land before it would all come flooding back to me, often after a period of frustration. Nothing better than breaking your own working code trying to \"fix\" non-issues, or intentional bastardizations.",

They run against a fully mocked DOM, rely on mocked props and data, and render components in a headless engine that represents only a small fraction of real user environments, while still consuming significant CI resources.\n\n\nThese tests don’t account for the CSSOM at all and can’t validate whether a user can actually interact with the UI—like clicking a button—across real viewports and devices.\n\n\nIn a world with infinite time and resources, sure, write all the unit tests. But in practice, most teams would get better value by saving those resources or investing more heavily in end-to-end testing, which exercises the system in conditions closer to how users actually experience it. \n\n\nEdit: Clarity ",

The way architectural patterns are applied directly shapes how teams are organized and how knowledge is shared.\nWhile Clean Architecture solves real technical problems, in many corporate environments it is applied in a way that encourages team separation by technical layers rather than ownership of complete business flows. This separation reduces end to end visibility, fragments domain knowledge, and increases coordination costs, even when modern approaches like microfrontends are in place.\nI believe this often indicates that bounded contexts are not clearly defined. When a bounded context is well understood, there is usually less need for heavy layering and abstraction, because a single team can own and evolve the business logic coherently.\nFrom a strategic DDD perspective, technical layers should remain internal implementation details, not organizational boundaries. A good architecture is one that supports business understanding, enables end to end ownership, and keeps cognitive complexity manageable for the teams that work with it.",

What's worse is they've never even attempted to write low allocation and performant code to know what the difference is.\n\nEvery single *ism* has some merit, I won't ever deny that, but each one when taken as your whole approach with no exceptions will certainly cause problems in your app.\n\n>DRY exists so you don't fix the same bug in 50 different places six months later while paying people by the hour.\n\nThat's not failing to follow DRY, that's writing terrible code.\n\nI'm not saying you go out of your way to repeat code that's truly repeated, more that all these blanket statements about development are all slide deck slogans about how to write code that have no metric associated with them and worst still do not including what the downsides are or can be to using them.\n\nSaying you follow DRY or SOLID or DDD or anything else means you go into a project and that's what you do no matter what, it's your standard.\n\nIf I had the exact code in two places, I absolutely would not write it twice, that's mad, but I hate DRY.  What I don't do is go out of my way looking for places to do DRY and instead selectively apply what's appropriate.  If both code *and* intent are the same, then it's the same code.\n\nWhat it means is DRY is not a principle anyone should follow religiously.  It's not that you *should* repeat yourself, just it shouldn't be a goal of the application.  Using DRY as a primary goal creates tightly coupled code that is very difficult to debug and change because it's used in too many places to know what the intent of each place is and how one change can affect unrelated portions of the codebase.\n\n>Not every system is mission-critical, low-latency infrastructure, or some optimized embedded software.\n\nPerformance is a feature.  I am not advocating for extreme measures to squeeze very cycle you can but it's outright neglectful to create solutions that make a client pay excessively more for hosting than they otherwise could.  \n\nI write performance tests for all important code on the hot path and check how it performs relative to other implementations.  If I get one that's 80ns vs 60ns I'm going to chose the one that's easiest to understand and maintain if it's not an order of magnitude higher, but if it's ms vs us then I might choose the us - that's one second of CPU time over 1000 request faster in just one place that you gained for free.  \n\nSame with allocations, if I've trimmed JTW middleware to 120b I won't go out of my way to choose the one that's 80b if it's less maintainable, but if it's at 4KB that's wasteful because it sets a standard to not have waste in your app and if you find enough places to trim without it causing readability difficulties then you could find yourself down a hosting plan.  \n\nThen there's the question of do you even know how much a request is allocating and how much each are of code is?  Have you even checked?  Have you checked the idle heap allocations?\n\nIt's also about practice and learning.  *Can you write code that is low allocations and performant.*  Unless you can and have then you have no business judging if something is appropriately performance tuned because you don't know the range it can exist in and how to plan that.  You need to work with the business to find out what is their goal for the app, do they care about hosting cost.  If no one asked and they were just told *surprise, this is what you will pay each month*, that's gross negligence\n\nLet's take a hypothetical dapper query returning a paged list of 25 results at 25MB/1000 requests.  A comparable tuned EF query will allocate about 150MB/1000 requests.  If you don't know how low allocations can be then you can't even ask a client how important is cloud hosting and performance and be able to suggest to them an appropriate solution according to their response.\n\nIf a client tells me that hosting cost isn't high on the list of concerns and they have a big team who needs to greenfields move fast, then sure I'll suggest a solution that fits accordingly, and that might very well be an ORM and SOLID, but it's not the first place I go without first assessing the requirements.\n\n>SOLID isn’t about making software fast. It’s about making software understandable, familiar, changeable, and survivable when more than one human touches it. And yes, for most web apps, it's optional. For long-lived systems with multiple contributors it's often cheaper than the alternative.\n\nThere is so much to unpack here. Every single letter in SOLID is theoretically a good idea but has plenty of cases where you wouldn't do it.\n\nAs an example, Single Responsibility - *Gather together the things that change for the same reasons*.  A controller typically has the full CRUD in it and no one bats an eye lid.  There's more than one reason you might need to change a controller that is full CRUD.  I'm not saying you should have a controller per verb but at the very entry to your backend you have a common violation of SOLID.  \n\nFor long lived systems it's possibly best NOT to use SOLID and DRY as your primary (and again it's not that you don't do the things in it sensibly, it's that you aren't making yourself *only* do that because it's awesome).  Most of the cost of an application happens during brownfields, you make an app in 6 months to 2 years and it lives in prod for 15.  SOLID very much has a top down view of the world, where it makes the most sense from your controller down not you have a bug in prod in PricingHelper line 65 what's causing this.  Written 8 years ago, used by a base service in a virtual method.  Right how do we change this, what happens when I change this, how are implementers using this, etc etc.",

Display it as a new dashboard here via the generic dashboard (which could be a skill as well - how to create new dashboards in the app). Add x, y, and z functionality for the page\". \n\nx10 and you have an app. Bonus points for a skill addressing overall architecture as well as in app styling.\n\nAll of this is for consistency so I don't die from slop and can maintain the code while focusing on the process I want to deploy",

You don't check for errors, don't try to understand the code, and ship it to live without testing it. This is how you get template-like websites, very common variable names, no customization, and generic designs. It's a lot clearer when someone clearly vibe coded a website into existence, no different from using a Wordpress template, Wix, or Weebly of the past, except a lot easier now. It will most definitely be buggy, full of errors, insecure, and lack any understanding from the person who vibe coded it on how it all works.\n\nIt's extremely different from getting an LLM to generate code to accomplish a task that would take hours of Googling to find how to do it because documentation is either vague or non-existent... It's different when you actually taking the time to look at the code and understand how it works so you can use it in more spots in the future. It's basically a teaching tool in this scenario.\n\nI don't think using LLMs to streamline your work flow is considered vibe coding. Because there's no way for someone to know something was LLM assisted in this scenario, as you spend the time to debug, kill errors, secure things, understand the code, custom design, and most importantly, you make the code it generates yours. You change variable names, you remove redundant variables LLMs love creating for one instance, you spend the time to make it better, and just know what it all does.",

Vibe coding platforms are a tool, and the purpose of a tool is to make a product better or faster. Vibe coding can do that, but only if it's used correctly.\n\nTo successfully implement this across an entire project, you would need very extensive knowledge in both prompt engineering and all the development disciplines you want to apply. That would advance the world of development.\n\nTherefore, I do believe that what you're excluding here belongs to Vibe coding and even corresponds exactly to the perfect application of this tool (you're using a relatively simple query for a specific discipline and have the ability to manually check for nonsense code). It's like with \"normal\" use of LLMs: Check your stuff.\n\nThe conclusion is that the goal is to make the difference invisible and that (partially) vibe-coded software is no worse than \"normally\" coded software.",

It doesn't matter how bug-free your product is if your product doesn't solve a problem. There's been way too many times where a company spends months writing PRDs, user stories, design docs, etc, only for the feature to completely flop because it doesn't address the real unspoken need. \n\nIf you're a product manager or other non-technical role, being able to vibe code a prototype, focus group it to users, incorporate the feedback and repeat until you know exactly what you want built is goated. Once you've figured out exactly what needs to be built, then you can toss it over for engineering to build properly. ",

          "text": "Hot take: he’s right, partially. \n\nIt takes exactly the kind of intelligence to design and build software as it does to vibe-code software:\n- debugging skills, theorising what could be going wrong and researching and testing those theories\n- analytical thinking to tell the agent clear requirements, and about edge-cases or future requirements to allow for\n- UX thinking to tell the agent how different workflows should ideally behave\n\nThat doesn’t make vibe coding good. You’ll still end up with an unmaintainable pile of shit if your project gets to any serious level of complexity, and you won’t have even close to the skills to fix it when things inevitably go wrong. You’ve skipped all the fundamentals and ultimately handicapped yourself, if your intention was to learn to build software.\n\nBut sure, it’s its own kind of IQ test, if that’s somehow important to you. ",

Forgive the giant wall of text, but this is a story:\n\nI found a job post for an interesting position that I matched so well it was uncanny. It was an amazing, 100% point-for-point match for my skills and experience, like they'd designed it for me. I sent them an enthusiastic email and my resume, and had a good initial phone screen with the hiring manager.\n\nThen he told me I had to do a take-home before the interview. He gave me a totally unfamiliar proprietary, idiosyncratic platform, which hadn't been mentioned in their job post—which he told me he'd chosen because I'd never seen it before. He told me to author several pieces of sophisticated functionality on it, including complex custom procedures using this platform's idiosyncratic paradigm, integrating an undocumented external API, and scripting live cross-process communication... and use AI to get the finished project back to him in two hours. \n\nHis project intro said the two hour limit was \"recommended, not mandatory\". \n\nWhich is good, because Claude Code then proceeded to hallucinate wildly for two hours, confidently emitting heaps upon heaps of garbage that just plain didn't work as promised. As I closed in on the two hour mark, I nearly called the guy and told him to forget the whole thing. But I plowed on. \n\nFinally in about another 45 minutes I managed to cajole a complete working solution out of Claude Code. Not only that, but this solution accomplished the requirements with two fewer fields and one less script than the hiring manager's own solution had. (He'd told me what he thought it would take.) \n\nThe next morning I got an email complimenting that the solution I turned in was more elegant than his own, and, saying that I wouldn't be proceeding to the interview because \"other people got it in in 2 hours.\"\n\nSo, he tested Claude's programming skills instead of mine, and turned me down for even an interview solely because Claude happened to hallucinate for me for over two hours on that day. The next day? Maybe Claude would have solved it in 15 minutes for me and hallucinated for two hours for someone else. Who knows. Seemed like a stupid reason to decline to even interview an exceptionally well-matched applicant.\n\nLater that week, I saw on LinkedIn the CEO of the company reposting the position and complaining that in a month of looking they still hadn't found a suitable candidate.\n\nI let him know what I thought.\n\nI still don't know what vibe coding even had to do with the position they described in their job post.",

It feels like a growing number of UI designers out there are completely oblivious to how their designs actually translate into working code, and it's making our jobs as developers unnecessarily complicated, frustrating, and often, just plain awful.\n\nI'm talking about designs that are ​overly complicated for no good reason: \n\nLayers upon layers of custom shapes, shadows, and gradients that serve no functional purpose other than to look \"unique\" but take hours or days to implement. Do we really need a custom SVG blob shape for every single background element that shifts position on scroll?\n\nA Nightmare to Maintain & Update: \n\nWhen every button or input field has a \"special\" padding or a slightly different hover effect, building a reusable component library becomes impossible. We end up with thousands of lines of redundant code just to hit \"pixel-perfect\" variations that no end-user will ever notice.\n\nIgnoring Basic Accessibility: \n\nLow contrast text, custom controls that don't have proper focus states, relying solely on color to convey information, or completely custom navigation elements that break screen readers. These aren't just minor annoyances; they actively exclude disabled users and create legal liabilities.\n\nPerformance Killers: Demanding five different custom fonts, massive unoptimized background images, or complex animations and sliders that bring even modern browsers to their knees.\n\n​It feels like many designers are operating in a vacuum, treating tools like Figma or Sketch as purely artistic canvases rather than blueprints for interactive experiences. \n\nMy request is that UI designers should be educated to acknowledge that every asset, every custom font, and every complex animation comes with a cost in terms of load time and user experience. They should be educated to design in a way that is easy to update, maintain, and scale without creating edge cases, while also ensuring accessibility.\n\n​I appreciate good design, truly. But good design, especially for the web, has to be buildable, maintainable, scalable, and accessible. It will save alot of time for both designers and developers. \n\nThere is a place for complex UI designs, but they should be limited to personal projects, fashion showcases, or award competitions, not commercial projects.",

A clever flashy _centerpiece_ effect makes for a definitive moment, but as such it should be a one-off that should be rare enough to be able to be its own thing.\n\nI'd also suspect a case of not enough communication, collaboration, or mutual respect. I've just started a new position with a lot more design-side collaboration involved (the last one was dev on a years'-long running project so it was a lot more \"Keep doin' what you're doin'\" in that respect) and it's definitely worth going over designs in a two-way conversation so the developer can learn the designers \"language\"-- how things like priorities or subtle wants are encoded in mockups and other communications-- and so the designer can get more of an understanding for how a developer looks at a request, to sync up on language and understanding and to gain more of an idea of what's \"expensive\" and what's \"cheap\" so they're spending the developer's effort on the most effect.",

However, I'm also reading a lot of lack of understanding of a designers' role, which is ironically unempathetic. There are a few things in there that are failures of the design folks you're working with. Text contrast, relying solely on color for information are the most egregious that every designer should be taught. Those are basic a11y concerns.\n\nThe maintenance and update concerns are just a big an issue for designers as well. Modern design tools can work great with reusable components and symbols to keep elements consistent and usable within the design toolchain as well. However, designers aren't often given appropriate time to maintain their libraries, or even the ability to update designs as stakeholders have demanded changes to them.\n\nThat last bit is the part where you seem completely unaware. In the vast, vast majority of cases, designers are powerless to pushback on stakeholder demands. They ask the designers to just \"make it like this\" and point to some flashy personal project, fashion showcase, or award competition proof of concept that has zero need for scalability. They're the lowest paid person on your WebDev team, do you think they have the clout to push back when an exec says \"make the button bigger on this page\" or \"that text is too bright, it hurts my eyes\"? \n\nImagine trying to do your job, only execs across the company will want to meet and workshop every single variable name you use. Or asking you why you chose an if/else block instead of an inline ternary. That's the level of exec interference they have when creating these designs.\n\nAll of your complaints are valid, but many of them are where you're shooting the messenger. Find a way to sit in and push back and defend these principals during the design phase and you'll be able to help your designers create more buildable designs.",

Learn as much as you can: frontend, backend, databases, networking, security, DevOps. Put in the time. Lock in those 10k hours. At this stage of your career, don’t rely on AI to do things for you. Use it as a tool, and do not let it do the thinking and coding, use it as a pair programmer or google on steroids.\n\nMy advice: pick a project and build it from scratch. Learn how to take an idea from zero to a real product. That skill is insanely valuable and will separate you from most people.\n\nLet LinkedIn influencers scream about how AI will replace everyone. Just keep grinding and become a genuinely good programmer. You won’t be out of a job. If anything, companies (and new companies) will need strong engineers to build and manage these systems. If you’re in that bucket, you’re golden. If not, yeah, you might lose your job, but that’s true in any field.\n\n\nThis has always happened. Accountants who used paper got replaced by accountants who use software. That’s normal. There’s a ton of hype right now and everyone is panicking.\n\n\nAlso, honestly, use LinkedIn only for job searching. Don’t get influenced by corporate bootlickers and constant yappers doom-posting for engagement.\n\n\nMost important: take care of your health. Don’t burn out. If you have your health, you can survive whatever comes next. Focus on the present.\n\n\nWishing you the best of luck.",

If you continue to keep learning, I think engineers are all going to be expected to know the full stack and probably dev ops too and really know system design and architecture as these tools let us build faster.\n\nCurrently it is just another abstraction, another high order language. There used to be a bunch of assembly language engineers and then C came out and other higher up the stack languages that offloaded a lot of work to the compiler to all SWE to work faster and teams good be smaller and more nimble. This is one of similar, apps will get bigger and more complex.\n\nThat being said if you are just relying AI to do everything and aren’t actually learning what it is doing and reviewing its code and can only do the very basics in terms of understanding what it is producing and do not care at learning more. Your days are probably numbered.\n\nIt’s very different times. Keep grinder and learning as much as you can.",

But, in addition to _yet another dependency layer_, it adds either the complexity of managing another service, or the costs of adding a vendor to run it for you, without the fully integrated advantages of an MVC framework. \n\nI have yet to see the \"SEO factor\" quantified on any level. Google has been able to read React just fine for over a decade, and pre-hydrated content just doesn't meaningfully move the needle on rank. \n\nOr maybe I'm being optimistic about its downfall and that's just my neck of the woods.",

It defaults to being an SPA. But it also has an optional SSR sidecar that runs on H3 through an Nginx proxy (< 5ms latency). I strongly discourage our team from using the SSR sidecar unless the project explicitly requires it. Architecting that sidecar was one of the most illuminating things I've done in recent years. It did NOT give me an appreciation for all the heavy lifting Next.js and Nuxt are doing - it instead solidified in my mind that these hybrid CSR + SSR clusterphucks aren't sustainable.\n\nPeople either need to build a CSR app or build an SSR app with a little HTMX baked into it. Combining CSR with SSR like Next.js and Nuxt are doing is almost always over engineering. Google can index SPAs just fine, and SEO is becoming less relevant anyways because of AI.\n\nReact itself is sadly here to stay despite it being the literal worst of all the major UI libraries/frameworks.

Generally I expect a return to SPA's (with pre-rendering, no live ssr) for actual web apps, way more ergonomic. \n\nNextjs has neglected the static export too much to be a player in that (why can't we have dynamic routes in static export? all other options have it).\n\nAlso dev speed is just horrible, even though they claim improvements. I'm sure it's all user error, but our code base runs so much quicker on vite, both startup and HMR, it's really worlds apart.\n\nAnd to make things worse, they are now introducing serious security flaws left and right. The non-vercel hosting is also still not resolved.\n\nI've used it as a easy choice for multiple years, I would not reach for it again for new projects, actively moved projects away from it.\n\nIt will not go away anytime soon as it's used so much, but unless they get on top of things I think a silent slow decline is coming.

That way they can be mentored and have real human interaction. We aren't meant to be isolated all day.

          "text": "Background: I'm 50. I've been coding since I was 14, and professionally since I was 20 (I never graduated because I left school early to jump into my first coding job). And I am *very* good at it. I'm autistic and have ADHD and I can hold a 30,000-line code base in my head and \"see\" it. I am not the best developer in the world - not even close. But there is a certain special thing that I do well, and at that thing, I'd bet I'm in the top 20.\n\nI'm not tooting my own horn here. I'm just framing the next thing I say: I felt like this **yesterday**. \n\nI've been running my own consulting business since 2007. 99% of my clients are so happy that I've actually gotten thank-you cards at project wrap-ups, and that makes me feel really good. But yesterday I had a client create a lot of trouble, saying bad things about my responsiveness (which is very good despite them not actually contracting for it), code quality (which was independently reviewed/audited, and they \"had nothing but good things to say...\"), and lack of focus (I focus when you pay me to focus, after that I'm reading whatever Andy Weir just published than you very much.)\n\nBut they pay, and I have a mortgage and five kids. So I say \"yes, sir, I understand. I'll work on that\" Who cares what they think of me personally? I know my value, my family knows my value, and nobody else's opinion matters.\n\nFor an industry that likes to think it is some kind of egalitarian meritocracy, software engineering might actually be the most toxic of them all in the end. We're surrounded by people that want a Porsche for the cost of a Kia, they want a 6-month project built in a week, AI tools are gnawing away at the edges and getting hungrier every day, employers lay off staff by the tens of thousands and hire with absolutely no commitment to employee growth or success... and that's just the start of the list.\n\nListen, old guy to young (person? I don't want to mis-gender you). What we do is **hard**. Full stop. It's hard. One of my favorite programming quotes is \"We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they would be easy.\" I personally think success in this space requires at least some base level of self-delusion or nobody would ever bother.\n\nI don't mean to be all doom-and-gloom here. Another quote I like is \"Bad roads lead to good stories.\" (I literally have that on my wall.) Do you want some advice? You should place exactly 0 value on what I'm about to say - I'm just some rando on Reddit commiserating with you. But I do believe this is true:\n\n1. You're fine.\n2. Many jobs suck, programming or otherwise. Stop thinking you're special. 😅\n3. You're going to have to put up with some bullshit.\n\nAt the end of the day, do you love programming in general? Not at your job... just in general. Are you passionate about it? \n\nThey don't pay us because we love what we do Monday morning. \"Get paid to do what you love\" is a fantasy. They pay us because we wouldn't work for them if they didn't. \n\nSo do what they say. Make money. Do your best. Then leave your job at the \"doorstep\" and in the evenings, focus on you, side projects you might care about, hobbies, passions, family, and everything else. They're all that count in this world.",

I've been in my development role for nearly 7 years now and still look up even the basics sometimes as my memory fails me. AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot makes our work considerably easier these days and we'd be crazy not to take advantage of them too.\n\nYou're going through the process that I'd imagine all developers do (I certainly did).

Maybe the team is too small for everyone to be reviewing everyone's code all the time, but it's totally in the interest of the team for everyone to be on the same page about best practices and catching bugs before they hit prod.\n\n\\- Don't take PR feedback personally. It can be hard, but separating the ego from a PR was helpful for me in terms of keeping my emotions and work separate. Easier said than done.\n\n\\- Ask clarifying questions and write down the answers. Keeping an organized set of notes for work has made things much easier\n\nSlightly different but super helpful:\n\n\\- Get out of the house. Go for a walk at lunch. Take a 5 minute break to open the window and breath real air. If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a step back for a sec.\n\n\\- Drink water and look away from your screen regularly.

A senior is there to help you with tasks, answer questions and provide feedback. If that is not something a company does automatically (they should imo) I would think about asking for it. \n\nOver my 15yrs I’ve learned being up front is better than trying to hide something. If you don’t know what you’re doing? Ask someone. Don’t waste time, show people you want to do it right you just need some help. Ask for feedback. If you don’t think you did something right, or a PR is rejected or whatever talk to someone. Ask them to show you what’s wrong and come up with plan to avoid making that same mistake in the future.\n\nSpecifically for misunderstanding tasks, this something I do. Get a notebook write down what you think you need to do, make a sketch or whatever. Review that with the product owner or tech lead. Explain to them what you think needs to be done and let them correct you. Record the meeting, if you can, listen to it again. If you have more questions setup another meeting and go over them until you know exactly what needs to be done.\n\nCommunicate with your manager and team. Ask questions. Write it down.\n\nNo decent person wants you to have a breakdown at work. Most people will try to help you if you let it be known you need help.",

I've found I appear more professional and maintain better accuracy by over-documenting everything in my personal notes. I also have a horrible memory and I have to hide it by over-documenting. I think I also suffer from anxiety and although I can't legally recommend this, I've used OBS to record meetings out of anxiety for forgetting it's so bad. But ironically, just recording the meeting would help me be able to focus more and I could remember better, even if I didn't use the recording. Especially at the beginning your job should be to map out what is going on within the app so you feel less overwhelmed in the future or else the anxiety will keep stacking. Learning the app and the business jargon at each specific business is part of the process (and the stress) of a junior, but you want to avoid being the guy that asks the same questions every week and annoying the other devs. You should at the very least have a note taking app on your computer you're filling up or one at your desk. Even writing things down helps me process and remember things even if I don't read them later.\n\nAnd before someone downvotes me for recording, I was working somewhere where we would have 4-8 hour design meetings weekly with nothing whiteboarded and be expected to remember everything we talked about with no notes or design documents. I was working with people that apparently had no trouble remembering things compared to me, so I was desperate to be competent since it was expected to recall random things.",

          "text": "You're a junior in a role where you aren't getting a lot of support, and being fully remote means you don't have the same opportunities to learn by osmosis as you would in an office.\n\nOne thing you could try is taking a couple of hours to go over the ticket (and relevant bits of the UI and code base), making a more detailed plan of what you think you need to change and what order to tackle it in, and running that by your team lead or manager before you get stuck in.  Most web apps are glorified CRUD so you could probably make yourself a checklist of things to consider, i.e. do you need new forms on the front end and where do they go, what API routes are going to change, what data needs to be stored and where, and what changes do you need to make to existing functionality of the app?  Getting input at this stage means you're clearer about what needs to be delivered, and gives your lead a chance to steer you in the right direction if you're a bit off course.\n\nAnother great practice for juniors is to spend a bit of time each day going through the pull requests that more senior devs are raising.  I have 17yoe and I love to do this when I'm new to a codebase, because it gives me an idea of how different bits of the system hang together, and what the team's agreed conventions are for how they write code.  Try to pick out one thing you've learned from each PR - it could be about the product, about the structure of the system you're working on, or a language or library feature you weren't aware of.\n\nThe lack of review and feedback is not ideal.  However, if you were doing really, really badly then somebody probably would've had a big picture discussion about that with you by now.  This is a job that involves a lot of learning by trial and error (lots and lots and lots of error).  Those \"bad results\" you're getting are learning opportunities - unless you're causing catastrophic production outages, you don't need to beat yourself up about them, just spend a bit of time reflecting on the lessons and deciding what you'll do differently next time.  (and if you are causing catastrophic production outages, the fault for that is at least 90% with whoever put a junior in the position to do that!)",

Most startups are _meant_ to move fast and break things, and this means all hands on deck and focused on tasks, not other team members. They just don’t have the overhead to properly mentor you.\n\nOn the other hand, as a junior _you need mentoring._ You are clearly seeing the cracks you are falling through, and are becoming stressed through this lack of support. This is _quite literally_ traumatizing you, and you desperately need help before it negatively affects your career arc.\n\nWithout more background on the company’s part, I see the company as possibly doing one of two things:\n\n1. They understand this lack of mentorship, and are cutting you a lot of slack in response. You can and will be allowed to fail a lot.\n2. They just don’t care about your lack of skills, as you are just another warm body to throw at the problem set.\n\nThere is a third possibility in that they do fully expect you to succeed under your own grit and effort, totally without mentorship, but this is an exceedingly unrealistic ask of you, and just highlights a toxic work environment that you should bail on ASAP.\n\nIf № 1, try and reach out to senior or even intermediate devs above you, and see if they are willing to help you. Many techs are neurodivergent in that they love to explain things, so this could be a positive for both of you. The key thing here is to build easy communication channels with other co-workers, generate good relationships, and never hesitate to poke any of them if/when you run into what appears to be a developing issue.\n\nIf № 2, you need to not take failure so personally. This will be the most difficult lesson you will ever learn, because so much of people’s egos ride on doing things right and succeeding at tasks. But being able to face failure and learn from it is what makes for success in a lot of careers, including things like Sales.\n\nHell, failure in sales is baked into the pie, as you _want_ to fail customers as fast as possible, to separate the wheat (those who are genuinely interested and ready to buy) from the chaff (those who are just kicking tires). It’s called fail-fast. Chasing after customers who are not immediately enthusiastic is a great way to waste time in sales, and _good_ salespeople build up a small stable of questions that allow them to quickly filter the people they come across so they can ignore those that will never become customers.",

Not a full design doc, just enough to catch the decisions that will paint you into a corner. Refactoring is 10x more expensive than thinking through the structure upfront.\n\n**Small commits**: Break work into the smallest possible pieces. Instead of \"add authentication,\" commit \"add login form UI,\" then \"add API integration,\" then \"add session persistence.\" When something breaks, you know exactly which 20 lines caused it.\n\n**Debugger > console.log**: Learn your debugger (Chrome DevTools, VS Code debugger, whatever). Step through code line by line. Watch variables change. It's slower at first but teaches you *why* code behaves the way it does, not just *what* it's doing.\n\n**Ask for architecture review early**: Before writing code, describe your approach to a senior dev. \"I'm planning to store user state in Redux, fetch on mount, and cache for 5 minutes.\" Get feedback when it's cheap to change direction.\n\nThe breakdowns get less frequent as you build pattern recognition.

I work diligently over my 8 hours, try to get better and follow the seniors' examples and criticisms. But after the 8 hours I'm drained and also have a personal life to take care of. The senior doesn't understand that. To give an example, they push comits and do code reviews in the dead of the night, work almost 24/7 on weekends on new features, pull all nighters almost every day. Lately we've been criticized of being lazy because we also don't do that. That we aren't staying later to perfect our code and that shows that we aren't diligent enough. All that has me in a lot of stress and anxiety because it's constant. Is there any way to deal with it? Am I unreasonable and they right? ",

And he obviously did not receive shit because he was moved.\n\nIt always ends up bad. There are days that crunch is unavoidable. Deadlines are deadlines. But managing them, and creating realistic expectations is a big part of the job. People like this are a nightmare to work with.",

As time goes by, you will be able to smell all the red flags along with the signs of a good company. \n\nFor example, if you go to a company, and they have a pile of meeting rooms, and the meeting rooms have touch screens on the door to manage booking them, you are looking a company run by micromanaging fools.

Complex ranking companies usually have treehouses; you are in the club, or outside. Those inside get the plum assignments and rapid promotions.\n\nOld tech, bad.

You can't do good work after all those hours. Assuming it is language like C++, find the buffer overflow errors, the off by one, the threading errors. And write a pile of integration tests which poke holes in your software. Big dangerous holes. Security breaches, data loss, things which would give your company's lawyers nightmares. \n\nThen, do a presentation showing his crap is dangerous and a huge negligence lawsuit waiting to happen. Say, that you are greatly concerned that it is a result of overwork and loss of focus; and that you don't want to have blood on your hands.\n\nYou will land a brutally satisfying blow, but make sure you have your new job lined up and have accepted their offer. You might be a momentary hero to some of the executive, but this fool will use his years of political capital to take you down hard.

Something else to consider is that yes maybe that action converts at much higher rate, but how much of that conversion is because the people who stuck around and looked around long enough to find it only did so because they were already a more serious prospect.\n\nIt's probably a lot honestly. Even if you make this thing stand out and guide people right to it perfectly, you'll still probably only see about 10% conversion rate within the same time frame\n\nI mean, double the sales is still insane. But don't expect quintouple the sales.\n\nThen once that works you get another issue, there will be another choke point that converts the most users... Back to the drawing board.\n\nThis is why everyone says to make a new user walkthrough. Show everyone all the best features and how to access them right off the bat. The next trickiest part is making sure that stuff is as easy as it can be to access, otherwise you'll convert a ton but then have users dropping like flies when they get frustrated and during that time your support staff will be dying from floods of emails and calls.\n\nThen again, it could be that this feature is what 90% of users are looking for in your app and when they don't find it right away they go to the next competitor in line instead.",

People can give me long detailed explanations, but I will still be blank until I actually get my hands on whatever I need to do.\n\nI was never able to understand the basics of grammar, and the school books were completely useless. The only way I could learn English was to watch tv and read English books so I could see how people spoke to each other.\n\nI have always liked to take machines apart and put them back together to understand how they work. \n\nNow I realized that this is how I code, and while some call it a strenght, I personally struggle because of it. \n\nI have been working as a full stack developer for 5 years despite actually being a UX designer. I was lucky to have a boss who was open to my way of learning. He asked me if I could use Vue, Java Spring and SQL. I said nope and he replied \"Meh. I am sure you will figure it out\", so I did.\n\nSo for years I have been working on large scale applications for a PropTech company, setting up integrations, unit tests, doing debugging with SSH commands, managed complex queries etc. but if you ask me any basic question about Java or how to do something from scratch I have zero clue. I have watched countless of videos and even paid for courses, but my mind simply cannot wrap around any of the concepts.\n\nI need to see the code, take it apart, see which parts does what, and then I can come up with a solution.\n\nThis was all well and good until I lost my job and had to go to interviews. I am still jobless because I simply can't answer any technical questions. It sucks, but there is only so much one can do when the mind is shaped in certain way.\n\nIf anyone else here have this thinking pattern, how did you overcome it / embrace it?",

Do you understand basic web infrastructure and networking? What databases are you familiar with? What cloud providers have you worked with? What are different caching strategies? \n\nThese are random questions I thought of that have nothing to do with code, but most senior engineers would have an answer to or thoughts about.\n\nSo I'd second what other people are saying, you probably have ADHD and should see a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis (don't just start taking some friends pills).\n\nBut I'll also be blunt: You need to figure out a way to learn. You're memorizing, experimenting, and repeating. Getting ritalin is not a magic pill that will fix all of this for you. \n\nIt's super valid that you're more of a hands on learner, but no one is going to give you a job trusting that you'll just figure it out one you get your hands on it. So if you're a hands on learner, you need to learn in a hands on way.\n\nHave you ever built and deployed a fullstack app? If the answer is \"no\" then that's a problem. If I were you I would go through building a fullstack app, with a backend repo, frontend repo, infrastructure as code (use terraform), leverage CI/CD (GH actions is fine), and deploy it to a real url. Going through an exercise like this will clarify a lot, you'll have to google, don't just AI a bunch of shit together.",

          "text": "You're just a pattern learner rather than a conceptual learner, and the tech industry's interview process is brutally biased against your type of intelligence. The real kicker is that your learning style probably makes you better at the actual job than half the people who can recite design patterns and Big O notation in their sleep. You've proven you can build and maintain complex systems for five years, but now you're stuck in this absurd situation where you can't get hired because you can't perform in an artificial quiz show format. The solution isn't to force yourself into a different learning style - it's to find ways to demonstrate your actual abilities during interviews. When they ask theoretical questions, redirect to concrete examples from your work, walk them through actual code you've written, or ask if you can show how you'd approach a problem by working through it in real-time rather than explaining it abstractly.\n\nYour best bet is targeting companies that do practical take-home assignments or pair programming interviews instead of whiteboard theory sessions. Smaller companies and startups are often more flexible about interview formats, and you can sometimes negotiate the structure if you're upfront about your strengths early in the process. Frame it positively - you excel at understanding existing systems, debugging complex issues, and learning on the job, which are incredibly valuable skills that many developers lack. If you're struggling to get past the initial screening, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you prepare responses that bridge the gap between theoretical questions and your practical experience - I built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of interview challenges.",

Go watch videos about the fundamentals, start a project just so you get used to writing code. \nMost important thing to do is from each interview list what don’t go well or don’t know about and stud those topics. You will start seeing there’s a pattern to these interviews and a few topics they usually focus on. But the thing is you got to keep at it.

And, I'd argue, was never that important to begin with.\n\n> I need to see the code, take it apart, see which parts does what, and then I can come up with a solution.\n\nIf this works for you, do this! Then do it again. Then do it more until you can discuss what you're actually building.\n\nIf you can't answer a particular question in an interview, start with \"I don't know,\" then describe how you would go through the above process to find out.\n\nGood luck!",

Yes, AI has made the whole problem worse, because it's so much easier for anyone to create code, even if they have no idea what they're doing. At least back before AI, a junior would need to have _some_ idea about what they were copy/pasting.\n\nAnother issue is that pipelines and tooling have gotten more complicated now. Back in the day, a junior could knock up some HTML with jQuery pretty easily, and push it via FTP. Now there's all kinds of frameworks and libraries with their own complexities, dozens of build tools, and even JS has many extra features which just never existed before.\n\nThe last part is that now managers and team leads _expect_ more and more from developers. If a junior _isn't_ using AI to produce their code, they will be left behind those who do. This further compounds the issue that the juniors are producing things that they don't understand.\n\nI don't think training is much of an issue. I don't recall any kind of training ever happening back in my career, beyond the very rare mandatory things pushed by HR. Now, I'm not saying that training _wouldn't_ help in this new AI era, but in a world where management are using AI to _reduce_ costs, I think this is not likely to happen.\n\nWhen the AI bubble bursts (and it will) then _maybe_ the bad management will finally lower their expectations to a reasonable level. However, I think we will have a gap of experience amongst devs in a year or so.",

No.  If you are not professionally competent in a discipline, you should not expect people to pay you and tolerate your mistakes until you learn.   That's not how apprenticeship works.  The first month on the job as an electrician's apprentice you're basically just sweeping floors - because that's all you're competent to do.  You're not an electrician, you should not expect to get an electrician's job or pay. Same with development.\n\non the hiring side: that you deserve mid-level competence/performance from someone who you pay entry-level wages.  It's not wrong to hire an entry-level worker, but you need to be very realistic about what the extent of their competence is.  The reality is, most jr devs are only actually capable of building a react component, using some sort of pre-built css framework to style it, and managing the local state of that component.  It's ok to expect a jr to be professionally competent at that.  It's not ok to pretend that they should be more competent.",
