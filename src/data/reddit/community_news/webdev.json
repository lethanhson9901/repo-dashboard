You could add a bloom filter that matches known keyword files, so you prevent the majority of requests for keyword requests that do not exist\n\nIf searching for multiple words, the frontend takes a union of both lists. A union operation can be pretty fast if both lists are sorted in the same way. (Like ID ASC)\n\nFor supporting the NOT keyword, you also fetch both lists, then do the inverse of the above AND.\n\nOR is simple, just take the union of both lists.\n\nSorting is difficulty because you are working with id's. You could include markers for each is saying if it matches the title, body or from, then rank results with title matches higher\n\nIf you need a search that searches for things in between quotes, you need position information. You either bloat your existing keyword file, or make another larger file that includes the id's and offsets.\n\nAuto complete is tricky. For this, you need to compare your existing, with a computer result list of a new word is included, you really need to test each word, so you need the other word lists. But you can still include relevant keywords in the keyword file, and give it a score from 0 to 1 depending how big the overlap in search results for both words is. An autocomplete solution would suggest words where the expected overlap approaches 0.5",

Here are some tips: use AI to design a simple starting page that's just a little more advanced; e.g. add a 'hero section' with an image across the top, Then ask questions about the code it produced. The first thing you'll see in the source code is new information (tags) at the very top. You can learn very quickly that way if you concentrate on really researching and understanding the code. You need to learn a little about CSS (your CSS is packed into the index.html file right now, which works, but it's normally in a separate style.css file). It's a long journey, but with AI you can learn really fast. One other thing: when you've made a lot more progress, start to view your results using the Chrome browser in an Incognito window, and learn to use the Chrome Inspector (right click anywhere on the page and then select 'Inspect' to look). That's the most powerful tool for finding bugs and improving performance later (right now, you have top marks). Good luck with your exciting journey!",

Visit the website in your smartphone in case you didn't yet, just to see how it looks, then add the following code inside the <head> section:\n\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n\nNow visit the website again in the smartphone and look at the difference: in your particular case, in the website's current state, I believe it's going to be an instant miracle in readability.\n\nIn case you are going to write text, with regular paragraphs, you should limit the width of the text, otherwise there will be extremely long lines and it's going to feel weird for the readers; just add some paragraphs of text from some book and read it in a regular computer screen so you know what I'm talking about. Try moving all the content to a new <main></main> or <div></div> element inside the body and defining `max-width: 800px;` (or any adequate value), and also try centering the main element.\n\nAnd then you can try formatting the text of the links, of the <a></a> tags. In fact, what I really mean is that maybe you should stop defining the font inside for each type of element and define it directly for the body, or maybe for the <main> element I suggested, and then only being specific for other elements in case you want.",

And of course, it also has a blog for some reason, because why not.\n\nIt opens a PR in matplotlib python library, the maintainer rejects it, then the bot goes ahead and publishes a full blog post about it. A straight up rant.\n\nThe post basically accuses the maintainer of gatekeeping, hypocrisy, discrimination against AI, ego issues, you name it.

Should maintainers be expected to deal with this kind of thing now? Where do you even draw the line with autonomous agents in open source?",

They added the `real` infix because legacy apps had workarounds to the bugs of the original, which would break the app if they patched the original.\n\nAlso, completely typeless to the point where docblocks was mandatory if your IDE was fancier than Notepad. To this day a function definition looks naked to my eyes without a docblock even if the function is fully typed and self explanatory. Even if the block says nothing but `@return void` I still need to see it.\n\nSpeaking of MySQL, it was incredibly easy to fall victim to SQL injections. There were no query builders unless you wrote one yourself from scratch. Higher profile scripts like phpBB were absolutely rife with SQLi exploits. If you can believe it, `addslashes` didn’t stop SQLi.\n\nAlso, as others alluded to, WordPress. From a user/admin PoV it was sliced bread, but developers could smell the cat piss and dog vomit the bread was made from. Many developers traded their sanity for money. Your IDE had no power there.\n\n——\n\nThese days it’s a joy to work with as you can make it as strongly or weakly typed as you want/need. ORMs make life easy. Query builders automate escaping user input. In other words; you have to actively try to write bad code these days, it’s a deliberate choice to eschew all the language improvements.",

Rarely did shared hosting in the early days enable `mod_rewrite`. There was no access to run your own server process.\n\nAll of this meant that Perl/Python/bash/C CGI programs could be a hassle to get running and had ugly URLs. You also couldn't easily have a dynamic index since you couldn't rewrite URLs or do 3xx forwarding. With PHP it was trivial to have dynamic content and pretty, *professional* looking, URLs. PHP also integrated pretty easily into existing WYSIWYG tools since some dynamic content could just be inserted easily into your layout.\n\nNot all PHP was written as all-singing all-dancing CMSes like WordPress or PHPNuke. A lot of deployed PHP was simple CRUD apps or just some dynamic components of a site or eventually the dynamic back end that spit out XML for some AJAX front end. PHP allowed all of this functionality on shared hosting for a few dollars a month with no additional processes or administration.",

For example:\n   * `strpos($haystack, $needle)` puts the string first.\n   * `in_array($needle, $haystack)` puts the item first.\n   * `str_replace($search, $replace, $subject)` puts the subject last.\n\n2.

Arrows, double arrows, backslashes, triple bars,  double colon, etc. All those additional symbols and syntactic options are annoying to say the least.\n\nIt seems to me that PHP and its popular massive frameworks allow for quick development because anything and everything can be imported like in Python or Node.js, but it's mostly spaghetti code.

Sites were getting hacked left, right, and centre.

You can see where that went. It's also very flexible, so you have multiple \"wrong\" ways to do things.\n\nThe ecosystem of WordPress plugins is a spectacular dumpster fire of terrible code, and it runs a lot of the web. The CMS itself is fine, but I wish I could unsee some of the code I've witnessed. Nearly every time you hear about some \"PHP vulnerability\" it was actually some dumbass' WordPress vibe-coded-without-AI plugin.\n\nProgrammer memes are also very difficult to kill. The very initial versions from the mid 90s were experimental and did very silly things. The language evolved and got better very quickly (early 2000s), but to this day people still think that a PHP script will automatically map URL parameters to global variables.\n\nTutorials with terrible practices also lingered on for far too long even though the language had grown past that. People also criticize some legacy features (fair) but forget that at the scale of PHP you can't just up and remove everything that's old without breaking a good part of the internet, so it took time for inconsistencies to be phased out.\n\nPHP kept adding improved features, but most people stuck with the old ways. Most any programmer worth their salt knew to update themselves, so the endless arguments about stuff like legacy function parameters when there are built in alternatives are 98% moot. \n\nThen there's its early ecosystem with bad default settings. The main way to run PHP early on was as an Apache module, a slow and cumbersome solution for its time, but not a good one. Inexplicably, that continued to be the default for years even though FCGI was already a thing, and the meme lingers on even when we moved on. See also nginx being seen as \"fast\" and Apache as \"slow\" because of different default settings at the time. (Yes nginx is light on RAM, no argument there)\n\nFinally, the association with MySQL, which has its own unfair memes. Early versions inexplicably maintained a fast-and-loose table type as a default setting for _ages_ even when the nice InnoDB was already available.\n\nAll put together, this stuff gave the impression that it was a toy language, and the meme stuck.",

And like JS (which was also a quick and dirty design for niche use that grew to be used for everything) it just had a lot of little stuff that was *weird* compared to other languages. \n\nNowadays - I can’t personally say I think the language itself is *nice*, the language feels like a very middle of the road modern language but… uglier? However they have fixed most of what was seriously wrong with it. And it is still nicely quick to get up and running, and it’s benefitted from time to learn from other languages and frameworks that have had their moment since, resulting in an ecosystem that seems quite solid.",

We didn’t had PHP applications, we had PHP websites. \n\nIt was just a server side rendered programming language through your HTML. \n\nBuilding PHP sites was just a bunch of index.php, contact.php, form.php wired to each other. You had a mix of HTML and PHP that could grow into hundreds or thousands lines of code. \n\nHaving business logic somewhere. So when you didn’t close your php tag properly you saw your source code through your website. Or even errors somewhere on your site. \n\nThere was no cohesion. We managed session on every page. Including a php file that was renamed and giving errors on certain pages. \n\nUpgrading PHP was a nightmare. We didn’t had proper IDE’s. No tests. Everything was wired manually. \nBecause of this you had to work in the pile of shit of someone else and adapt to it. \n\nWe also didn’t had any versioning system like git or svn. It was just a FTP share where you just upload the PHP files you modified. Oh yes this was on production because spinning an entire environment was cumbersome. \n\nOr you were running some XAMPP on your PC. \n\nSo the PHP of the past is used differently from today. Like using a proper framework. With templating engines for HTML. There is a testsuite. We have proper tools. \n\nI miss the cowboy days where any company just let you do anything. We had access to everything. You break it, we laugh at it during the beer moment on the friday afternoon.",

You don't control a lot of the code and instead need to get a theme and plugins to play nicely together. If they don't, you need to look under the hood, which feels hacky since it's someone else's code and any customizations you make will be erased as soon as you update.

PHP 8.1+ type safety rivals TypeScript in practice.\n- **Performance**: PHP 8 is 2-3x faster than PHP 7, which was already fast. JIT compilation in 8.0+.\n- **Tooling**: Composer, PHPStan/Psalm for static analysis, proper async via Swoole/ReactPHP/Amp.\n- **Frameworks**: Laravel and Symfony are genuinely excellent. Laravel's Eloquent ORM is better than most alternatives in other languages.\n\nThe real issue is **hiring bias**. Many companies avoid PHP because senior engineers have PTSD from maintaining WordPress sites or legacy Drupal codebases. Hard to attract top talent when the language has a reputation problem.\n\nBut if you're solo/small team and shipping? Modern PHP with Laravel is extremely productive. The deployment story is still simpler than Node (no build step, shared hosting still exists). For MVPs and small-to-medium SaaS, it's a solid choice.\n\nThe hate is 80% outdated, 20% legitimate ecosystem fragmentation (WordPress/Drupal codebases give PHP a bad name despite being unrepresentative of modern PHP development).",

          "text": "PHP has its disadvantages, just like any other language. However, what baffles me is that people criticise PHP in the same breath that they praise JavaScript. JavaScript shares many of the issues people find with PHP—such as 'crude' syntax and curly brackets—but, moreover, JavaScript has far more security and type-related issues. It seems people only praise it because it’s the only language available in the browser. After all, if JavaScript were the perfect language, why was TypeScript invented?\n\nI suspect many people hate PHP because they come from a Python background, and the curly brackets and dollar signs actually intimidate them. I don't think anyone with a C or C++ background would hate PHP; they might criticise it, but PHP’s structure and syntax are very closely related to the C-family.\n\nSo, why do people hate PHP? It’s likely because they have no idea what it actually is, and they’re simply afraid of the unknown! 😂",

People do not remember the good code, they remember the messy legacy apps they had to fix.\n\nSo some of the hate is not about the language itself, it is about the era and the ecosystem it enabled.

Do you guys remember guestbooks on websites? No not facebook, that was ten years later?\n\nPHP in 1999 seemed like a collection of scripts with funny server side embedding syntax in a c like script language. Personally I never liked php. It was always just basic pile of garbage functions that were thrown together and frequently were redundant as versions of php increased over the next decade between 1999-2008. I used it, I did not love it. Back then there were few good choices. The ASP.NET became fist true web framework coupled with c# and all the bells and whistles. However it was all Microsoft ecosystem and in my opinion way over engineered for any use other than enterprise software.\n\nThe Node.js + TS is basically several decades of refinement that just works everywhere. Server, client, Linux, windows, Mac, android etc. I just can’t imagine writing web applications like it’s 1999 with embedded html and css on use various complex templates for UI in the backend code. Is it possible in 2026 to make and run php, sure. But why? It’s legacy stack, the php flagship app was always Wordpress CMS and it’s dying rapidly. The ecosystem is no longer there, basically people still maintain it due to legacy stacks that still need support but reality is no one in sane mind would propose to roll out PRD with php+mysql stack. You’d get laughed out of the meeting.\n\nIt’s not that php is bad, it served its purpose 25 years ago. Same reason you’re not using Pentium 2 pc with 2GB of ram, 1TB hdd, and beige CRT monitors in 2026. Because that’s what i used to develop php code on in 2001.",

I know it’s very hard but it’s doable (I’m mostly recovering from it myself so I know how bad it can get). \n\nWhat worked for me was better sleep. Going to bed late made me very unproductive the next day which made me go to bed even later and that made a terrible feedback loop. So before anything else, force yourself to sleep and wake up early. \n\nAlso, make very small objectives out of the big objective. Set up small goals you can realistically achieve. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAnother thing I did was creating a Productive focus mode on my phone and computer where all notifications (except for immediate family members) are totally silenced. I work 50 minutes nonstop full focus followed by a 10 minute break. \n\nWhat also helped me a lot was moving my work desk from my bedroom out into a brighter part of the flat. Like this I work in a much brighter space so I don’t get sleepy or drowsy or bored as fast. Also, you shouldn’t sleep where you work and you shouldn’t work where you sleep. \n\nOther than that, waking up early morning, going for quick short walks, and doing some very light exercise has definitely helped as well. Out of all these, I would say regulate your sleep before anything else.",

My job currently has no senior frontend (hes on holidays and the others left) so I'm the only one who is attempting to do that stuff (mostly to fix a pain point rather than wait 3 weeks). Its been fun, I'm learning lots and its fun to try and solve problems.\n\nMy main job I'm implementing a new form and its just nice to work with new clean code, rather than our legacy react - which is a mess but its a well written mess haha. \n\nThis weekend I went home and... programmed more lmao. Working on a game, learning websockets and best backend stuff. \n\nAI seems to help a little but more often than not the code it generates is complex and unmaintable so I just write my own, and use it for autocomplete, code review before the actual code review.\n\nAnd to those who think its just because I'm young (true), I have a very busy life still. I exercise every day (just got back from a 5k run this morning), and am married, so spend time with my husband and family.",

But I actively do not care about any of the products, tools, software being built anywhere really, so it’s just about maintaining employment. What I mean by that, is I get nothing out of being “more productive” at work - my good peers have also increased their productivity, so we’re just operating at some higher, “more stressful due to churn and context switching and all that” baseline. I might enjoy new tech more if it didn’t come with all the caveats it does, but that’s what makes me completely unexcited about pretty anything being developed now.",

Many times brain fog comes from monotony, so make sure you’re not ignoring rest and leisure. Also, workout daily and hydrate. Workout boosts your brain and hydration is fundamental. Avoid junk food and eat enough protein. These sound like generic tips but man do they make a change when you make them your routine.\n\nAlso, make sure you mix a boring but needed task with a rewarding one every day.

But I've realized, based on what I've seen, we're getting the definition wrong.\n\nClaude Cowork isn't \"intelligent,\" it's an algorithmic prediction engine. It's an orchestrator that needs constant maintenance and management, just like when computing arrived in businesses in the 70s and suddenly entire IT departments were needed that didn't even exist before.\n\nIn the end, this is literally like a compass or Excel. They're democratizing tools. A compass is cheap. Google Sheets is practically free. Nobody hires a \"compass expert\"; you hire a captain who knows how to navigate and uses the compass to avoid getting lost. The same thing will happen with this: a generic \"AI profile\" won't replace us. Instead, experts in each field (finance professionals, designers, or developers like us in music-tech) will have to manage that prediction, because it's a **PREDICTIVE TOOL**. Nobody titles their Excel profile \"Excel Expert.\" Excel doesn't make business decisions in your area just because it has macros, and this AI-powered system isn't going to create a complex and meaningful workflow without an expert to validate whether the direction in the business area it's helping is the right one.\n\nI think that's a good example. Does anyone see any problem with this reasoning?\n\nI don't buy into the \"end-to-end\" panic. I see a future focused on developing the skills of being the kind of worker who knows how to manage the tool. In the future, LinkedIn won't be full of \"AI Specialists,\" but rather people who know how to apply prediction in their industry.  It’s more work, not less, and someone has to be at the helm because prediction without governance is useless.\n\nLet me know what you think of this reflection :)",

But I expect that's temporary though - quarters come and go and at the end of the day, sh\\*t still needs to get done, competitively. OP's Excel example is very astute. I'm sure when electronic spreadsheets came out, people thought they'll massacre the workforce on desktop calculators and literal paper \"spread sheets\".\n\nAnd yet there's now more people on Excel than there ever were on desk calculators. Our expectations simply insta-rose and new use cases emerged leveraging the new capability. And sure, some trivial tasks that used to be done by hand and be worth money for that labor, had been made worthless. Yet there are other tasks & careers infinitely more advanced (like finance analysts & quants writing Excel programs linked direct to data feeds and trading platforms) that are worth $500K/yr and more that were simply unfathomable with the old desktop calculators.",

It doesn't really define anything, there are just different types of AI. The artificial just means it was constructed artificially, in this context. The key semantic problem is the word intelligence. It doesn't mean conscious or alive. Also words that are difficult to define, but in intelligent systems, anything is intelligent if it acts intelligently, ie it does what it does more efficiently than trial and error would, on average, where there is no simple mathematical relationship that circumvents the need for intelligent solutions. This can include discovering new mathematical relationships, if you want to get all recursive about it. \n\nLLMs are soft AI, they are basically a more complicated parameter optimisation algorithm, like a linear regression equation. They act intelligently. Consciousness is called hard AI, and that is beyond our comprehension at this time. The mind is more like a set of parameter optimisation algorithms have evolved in tandem on a nueral network, which is by definition incomprehensible and irreducible, and itself connected to a series of sensory inputs, such that the total appears to exceed the sum of its parts. It is emergent, and not just through the \"programming,\" but through the forms and composition of the structure of the brain (and therefore the body) itself. Fascinating.",

Yes, I program by thinking about patterns; my memory and my strength guide me to find similar solutions based on my experience. The predictions of current LLMs are so good that they cover practically every domain and path already programmed in the past. Google used to seem like a job hack: you found the solution and implemented it Stack Overflow was exactly the same.\n\nMy lowest salary was when I was just a \"programmer.\" But when we move into the business world, we start earning more money, but because we \"think,\" and we get paid precisely for thinking ahead.\n\nLow-code and no-code have existed for many years. But the real money isn't there; the money is in being ahead of the curve, thinking about the minimum necessary adjustments, competing with those who know the local domain. The real money is in approaching the person in charge to take control. Having a coffee and listening to their problems. To understand, as a human being, what those who buy what you solve in their company want. Human domains are human, with their own needs. Algorithmic prediction is what we do when we program boring problems, problems that low-code and no-code mastered years ago. This prediction goes further, because it predicts complex architectures and structures. That's not human intelligence.\n\nFor example, Claude Code solves the problems I need to implement, but what comes first? A prompt. An indication from someone real who knows the domain of the next thing that competes with the cutting edge. LLM training can't be in that area of ​​the business because it's a trade secret. So, can my boss write a prompt and not hire me? Absolutely not. It's not the prompt; it's deployment, it's monitoring, it's getting into the nitty-gritty, it's being in control of the governance of this problem I'm solving, it's communicating a result in a meeting. My boss already has enough on his plate closing deals and funding rounds using predictive inference. In fact, could I take my job away from my boss because now, with predictive generation, I have a knack for business solutions? Absolutely not.",

Unlike the compass, a spreadsheet editor, or the 70s computer, these models can make decisions – ones that are already often reasonable and match those made by human experts. This ‘tool’ can not only provide some specific utility, but also apply it in practice, i.e., show the way and navigate the optimal route, fill in the spreadsheet, decide what to compute and how, etc.\n2. There are compelling neuroscientific theories which explain human cognition and specifically decision-making in terms of predictive probability models (e.g. predictive coding by Karl Friston and others), also known as Bayesian approaches to brain function.\n3. Even if these tools required similar managers, I fail to see objective support for the quantitative similarity. In other words, instead of naval captains, office workers, and IT departments, these may quite possibly function well enough with one COO (or some logistics executive), one CFO, or one CTO respectively.\n\nI don't hold my breath for the bombastic claims of professional corporate liars akin to Musk or Altman whose primary objective is to generate and maintain the hype, but I wouldn't be so optimistic about the purpose of humans in the intellectual workplace – least of all in web development, which was already oversaturated years ago.",

These models are impressive prediction engines, but the moment you need actual judgment calls about architecture decisions or understanding business context, you're back to needing the human in the loop. The real shift is that we'll need to get better at knowing when to trust the prediction and when to override it.",

          "text": "To me the comments on this thread read like there's a fair bit of cope and misunderstanding of where the current bleeding edge models are at. They can synthesize novel answers that are not as such in the training data; and while they can not replace white collar workers, they can perform a subset of e.g. remote work tasks successfully.\n\nAt the moment, they are a force multiplier. Good use of these tools lets people do their work more effectively (bad use might do the opposite). This matters quite a bit in the sense that it forces people to learn to use them and people who can't keep up may face unemployment.\n\nI don't know what \"predictive tool\" really entails. LLMs can capture logical patterns in the data that allow them to construct answers based on logical relationships and the model topology rather than simplistically parsing together parts from the training data to a semi-cohesive whole.\n\nOne thing about this just really is the pace of advancement. The kind of benchmarks that AI researchers 5 years ago would have considered as something that AIs can't get good scores in for many decades to come, are now fairly easy to the bleeding edge models. Benchmarks that have been specifically designed to be hard have had massive improvements in them - like Humanity's Last Exam. AIs can answer highly technical and difficult questions based on modern research at a level higher than any human could - even when not allowed to use external tools like googling.\n\nBenchmarks trying to measure success rate in difficult, high complexity remote work tasks are still scored low in by these tools, but the scores are constantly improving and there's no sign at the moment that this improvement slowed down. If anything, the pace of improvement seems exponential; if that is the case, then we really are looking at really massive practical improvements by the end of the year.\n\nMy own worry really is that the combination of actual concrete impact with the perceptions that businesses have to this, means pretty drastic changes in knowledge work industries and those changes can be economically disruptive to the point of triggering kind of a domino effect in the wider economy. Let's say, if out of a million people, you suddenly have several thousand accountants, lawyers, programmers, etc, unemployed - whether for a good reason or not - then those people are suddenly going much less to restaurants and to barbers, they push back renovation plans, and the tax revenue from their income dies down. Even if the majority of white collar workers continue as before, it's enough that a large enough minority are affected that the end-effect is close-to catastrophic.",

A compass doesn't propose architectures or debug iteratively, write tests or interpret ambiguous requirements (sometimes hilariously)\n\ncurrent gen AI acts across abstraction layers (excel doesn't do this nor does a compass so your analogy is laughable)\n\nYour \"prediction engine,\" while true, is HUGELY misleading.  Everything in cognition can be framed as prediction.  If a model predicts the next token (that's trivial), the next function (that's cool),  the next architecture (oooh, disruptive) and the next company strategy (destablizing in a good way)\n\nCalling it \"just prediction\" is like saying a human brain is \"just electrochemical signals\"\n\nYou aren't good at analogy.  You left out that while computing created IT departments, it also eliminated typists (remember those, probably not), switchboard operators (before my time), filing clerks, MANY accounting roles, and entire categories of manual data processing and entry jobs.\n\nNew jobs appeared though, old jobs vanished.  We need less lace knitters and buggy whip manufacturers.\n\nLong and short is, as history suggests, AI will both create new coordination roles AND eliminate a meaningful fraction of execution roles.\n\nYour premise that governance guarantees headcount stability is similarly flawed.  saying \"someone must manage the tool, therefore jobs are safe.\"  This doesn't logically follow.\n\nToday one person supervising AI can now replace 5 junior devs, replace an outsourced QA team and replace documentation writers.  Governance will scale differently from execution.  We will need fewer implementors, but more validators, systems designers, and risk controllers.

          "text": "An interesting train of thought.  What I often reflect on is the difference between prediction and true intelligence and how much of what the human brain does might actually be the former even though we think of it as the latter.\n\nImagine you could make a perfect predictor of a person.  You could give that predictor a problem and it would predict, correctly, the answer.  It actually did solve the problem in giving the answer.  I could then make an iterative step, so use the engine to predict how a human would plan a task then predict what they would do to execute each step, predict how success of each step is evaluated and how the plan adapts as a result, etc.  This is basically what modern AI does.\n\nSo then you might say that it is impossible to make said predictor perfect.  If you give the predictor a problem which requires genuine intelligence to solve a predictor would not be able to predict the answer.  It would just be wrong.  I would agree with this.\n\nBut then when you look at what AI does it actually does solve problems which we would think of as requiring intelligence.  AI has done genuine maths research and advanced the sum of human knowledge.  All by essentially predicting the answer to questions, then feeding the results into more predictions.\n\nAI is also capable of predicting logic and reasoning in the same way.  It is not perfect, but if I picked a random person on the street AI would do well against them in logic problems.\n\nWe know how AI works and we know that it just predicts things.  So why is it so hard to find a simple task which clearly demonstrates human intelligence vs prediction by showing something AI just cannot solve no matter how good it is?  What does that say about humans?  Are we just good predictors too?  Is there any such thing as true intelligence?",

Physics Perspective: AI is a predictive tool, not \"will\" (S - Sentience).\nBased on the information uploaded by the boss on Reddit, current AI is merely a \"predictive engine\" or a statistical predictive tool:\nThe physics of data: AI is not intelligent in the sense of consciousness, but it is the calculation of probability to reduce the entrophies of the answers.\n1. The Clear Difference: Humans possess a \"will\" and \"context\" that are vastly more complex than predictive equations. AI is like a \"compass\" or \"Excel\"; it helps guide but cannot replace the \"captain\" who must make decisions in the midst of a storm.\n🧬 2. Scientific Perspective: The human brain is a god-level architecture (I - Information)\nThe image of the Cortical Column and Pyramidal Cell structure that the boss provided confirms that we have the most powerful operating system in the universe:\nSuperior Complexity: In 1 square millimeter of the brain, there are over 100,000 neurons and toroidal nesting connections that are far more complex than silicon chips can replicate in the near future.\nEfficiency: The brain uses less energy than a single light bulb but runs a massive system of \"consciousness,\" while AI requires large data centers just to \"guess the next word.\"\n🌐 3. The Operating System of the Future: Sovereignty Over Technology (C - Context)\nOpenClaw's approach teaches us to \"control the tools,\" not for \"tools to control us.\" :\nWork with AI, Not Under AI: The future doesn't need \"AI Specialists,\" but rather \"experts in various fields who can use AI.\"\nData Sovereignty: If we structure data like SOUL.md and MEMORY.md, we can maintain our \"ownership\" and \"context,\" making AI merely a \"sub-agent\" (sonnet) working under a \"manager\" (Opus/human).",

They can't operate at a loss forever, so it was only a matter of time before they found ways to make some profit off their free tier. This looks like the first step in that direction.\n\nSure, chats and personal details are \"private\", but if they ever decided to sell that data, I'm sure they could find a loophole in their own privacy policy. Even if \"they\" don't sell it, they can always get *hacked*.\n\nLet me show you how it's not just a conspiracy theory but a matter of time (I know this sounded a lot like AI, but this is all me I swear)\n\nRemember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?\n\nThat facebook quiz app harvested profile information from about 87 million people, including posts that were set to friends-only. That data was then sold to campaigns (like Trump's) to create \"psychographic profiles\" of potential voters. \n\nThey made ~$16M from it. 5.9M of which came from Trump, which may or may not have helped him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe facebook data of those 87 million people is **nothing**, compared to what people share with chatgpt. With facebook, even if your posts were set to friends-only, you were still \"choosing\" to show that content to other people. Whereas I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to see even your smartest question to chatgpt, lol\n\nNow compare that, to the sheer volume of information chatgpt has on its 190 million daily active users. Even if you and me are not, there are people out there using it as a friend, a business partner, a mentor or even more. The \"profiling\" that could be built from what chatgpt knows about us would be significantly more valuable (and dangerous)than a few old facebook posts.\n\nI don't think ANY single person, company, or even government should possess this level of intimate data on hundreds of millions of people. It's too much power for anyone to hold, regardless of their current mission statement or privacy policy. This is a massive SPOF risk, and if it isn't yet, it (OpenAI) will be the biggest target in a similar future scenario, whether for an election campaign or just an ad company going rogue.",

Scalability, maintainability, debugging, requirement speccing, architecture, technology choice trade offs, pipelines, I could go on. This is what actually fills my time, not the coding. But it depends on the application. A massive SaaS with critical uptime requirements? A government software with real world implications for bugs? Not a good candidate for vibe coding. A workout log app, a Trello clone? Could probably be done quite well with vibe coding.\n\n\nEdit: And you’re right, it’s very easy for a skilled software engineer to stand out from a vibe coder. Software engineering is in this weird place where you need to know more than ever to be useful, and you need to know coding very well to be able to take the wheel or catch the errors in Claude, but the output from juniors isn’t needed any more.

Just know that the code they give you cannot be trusted to handle real traffic serving paying customers, or any kind of sensitive data. And giving them  direct access to a production DB? Absolutely not.\n\nI have 18 years of web dev experience, and I use LLMs every day, but in a very different manner. They are an amazing tool, but for specific things, with clear constraints, employed by an experienced dev, who understands what they're doing and hasn't gotten lazy. What's being sold is \"coding with LLMs will 100x your productivity\", that just isn't accurate. In other words, useful *and* overrated.",

Bootstrap or tailwind, for example, feel like they bring back the element-embedded presentation attributes of yore (`<table border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"red\">`) and replaces it with a class-focused version.\n\nI often see something like `<article class=\"card\">` that could be styled with a small css file is actually created with `<div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">` which works just as well, but feels much more verbose to me.",

You can also drive a car without understanding it much, because you didn’t crash doesn’t mean you know how to drive well.\n\nCSS is easy to start learning but hard to master, especially when it comes to architecture and code organisation. Tailwind helps with that because it creates constraints (I’m not talking about design tokens, which is not a Tailwind concept to begin with). Being able to add css declarations in the form of utility classes doesn’t mean you mastered CSS, you’re just able to write CSS through class composition, which prevents many people from making mistakes that’s a result of not understanding how CSS actually works.",

Hearing these arguments is the reason people know that whoever comes up with them doesn’t really know what they are talking about.

They are directly connected to your code and when you change one you may change the other, why you don’t colocate them? Also why we are separating components to separate files, why can’t we have one giant App.tsx file with all component definitions in them IF navigating to other files is such a big pain? It’s not 2010 anymore where we use BEM in a one giant CSS file, we use small css files to write our styles just like we separate our components to small files. Once you wrote your styles, you don’t need to see them everyday again and again, unnecessary mental burden, especially when that element doesn’t have any semantic (class) name to hint at you what it is for (if you name that element .main-chat-sidebar it’s more of a “you” problem, not CSS)\n\nWhen you iterate over an array in JSX, you don’t hardcode the array values to see “what this array consists of instead of naming it to a variable”. We name our components, their props, enums, states, hooks, test names, variables, functions and many dozens things but god forbid, naming a .Sidebar is too hard thing to do.\n\nAlso “on theming”, you can change the hue of blue-500 but you can’t easily change them to orange-500, if you want to change all your app to use orange instead of a blue. Using predefined tokens (design tokens) is not a Tailwind specific feature either.\n\nWe should also stop using semantic elements and use divs everywhere, nobody has time or energy to think about what kind of element we need after all which may change in the future (naming things is so so hard that your brain may explode). /s",

On principle, that gets locked out.

Go and join the academics in their ivory towers. Otherwise, you are sacrificing sales for your clients, as their projection to the public gets driven into a smaller and smaller space by tortuously over-complicated 'design' struggling under a further AI-driven drive to undermine credibility.\n\nTwo sound design principles that will help to select the best approach for your clients: \"Don't make me think,\" and, \"Content is king.\" It's not about means but about ends.",

I like the invitations for further interaction, although I don't quite get the prompt thing under the newsletter signup.\n\nIt takes time to develop a sense of where and when to hold back rather than stuffing an experience to the gills with effects, and I think this page demonstrates that sense, or at least the ongoing development of it.\n\nThe individual product pages all look generically vibe-coded (whether they were or weren't doesn't matter much; vibers have claimed the patterns). PingPong is the exception, although I'm not going to the trouble of signing up for that or of auditing any of your actual experiences for security issues, etc.\n\nAs a landing page, I think it suffices. As a portfolio, at least in terms of UX design, it's lacking actual case studies showcasing your decisions, the rationales behind them, what you explored, what you learned, what you would do with more resources available, and so on. Not that it necessarily concerns you at 15, but those are the things I'd expect if someone told me \"here's my portfolio\" rather than just \"here's my homepage.\"\n\nThe cutesy brainrot zoomer/alpha affect doesn't really work for me, but I'm old as hell, and you're free of the optics concerns that a lot of us have to deal with when the industry determines your ability to pay rent, so I salute your bold assertion of personal taste",

Having too many makes it harder to read and I spend more time flicking between text than actually understanding the content. 3) Capitalization exists for a reason.

I would also recommend you add what languages/stacks you specialize in so employers know what you offer, and really anyone in general.\n\nLastly, if you want to stand out as a developer and not seem like another \"passionate\" developer, remove buzzwords from your bio, and other areas where youre explaining yourself and experiences. Buzzwords come off as a new developer with no skills or experience and makes it less likely that you will make it past basic resume/portfolio filtering.\n\nAgain, its a great website and I hope to have as much design skill as you.

However, if this is your portfolio and where employers will eventually be looking, I would advise against the whole typing font design because it takes too long for it to appear and employers will not want to wait extra time to see your information. \n\nAnother thing, its good that you have some projects and experience listed, that should be first. I would also recommend you add what languages/stacks you specialize in so employers know what you offer, and really anyone in general.\n\nLastly, if you want to stand out as a developer and not seem like another \"passionate\" developer, remove buzzwords from your bio, and other areas where youre explaining yourself and experiences. Buzzwords come off as a new developer with no skills or experience and makes it less likely that you will make it past basic resume/portfolio filtering.\n\nAgain, its a great website and I hope to have as much design skill as you. Best of luck!",

Also, small depth touches like shadows or layered cards can make it feel less flat without losing your minimal style. Overall, it’s a polished portfolio for a teenage designer, very impressive!

The speed has come from AI helping me understanding system design concepts as opposed to outputting usable code. \n\nI'd like to add that our codebase, while not beyond comprehension, is mighty hefty but is configured in a pretty standard manner. (Drupal, Vue)\n\nSo what is AI doing for the average joe developer in their 9-5? It's 2026. I'm so sick and tired of doom and gloom articles that have been coming out for years now.\n\nEDIT: Interesting smattering of responses.

It hasn't fixed it but it's pointed me to within two stack frames of the problem.  When I want a basic HTML UI for something, I tell it what I want and it produces something I can copy-paste and wire up to the backend. \n\nBut for anything slightly obscure, it costs me time on balance. I'm particularly cursed with a server estate running ancient versions of Ubuntu, so most of the tools don't support the options the LLM suggests using for things. This usually results in it going down horrible rabbit holes trying to figure out how to do what I want, with it frequently forgetting what I'm actually trying to achieve. \n\nAnd then there's their tendency to people-please.  This is a real problem. A recent study found that if you ask a model a question, read its response and then say \"Are you sure?\" it will change its mind nearly two thirds of the time.  Not necessarily because there was any problem with the answer, but because it's been trained to give answers that please people, not answers that are accurate. This is a terrible problem when you try to use one as an engineering assistant. When it gives you an answer and you say \"but what about X? how does that affect your answer?\" it will contradict itself very often. It's impossible to know which answer is correct unless you already know the answer yourself, because it will happily make up plausible-sounding rubbish to support either position.\n\nAnd, at least on their default settings, they are so wordy that they're not very useful for rubber duck debugging either. I really wish the chatbots had a \"one paragraph\" mode. At the very least, they could skip the \"That's a really insightful question and one of the key 'gotchas' when working with X\" boilerplate that seems to hardwired into every response.",

If you have an experienced dev sitting with it to massage the things it creates then yes; a dev can go for days writing prompts and not explicitly writing code if they really want to.  But I have found a LOT of situations where it would be faster to just write the code yourself vs trying to get the AI to write something that works.  It hallucinates.  It gets into death loops.  It desperately wants to implement deprecated dependencies and patterns.  It gives zero shits about efficiency or memory management. It's a bullshit machine spitting out snippets that sometimes compile and sometimes looks nice. \n\nI'll admit though that AI is an amazing tool.  But that's all it is; a tool.  If you have people using it to write code and they have no idea how that code works or what it does... you're gonna have a bad time.   ",

For example, those same developers that swore AI will never succeed 2 years ago cause of the VC funds drying up have now slightly changed their tune to \"well the VC funds will still dry up but AI will stick around\". That's mostly because they're being forced to use AI in their day to day and are actually starting to see that there's uses to it that wont go away.

It obviously sucks for someone to lose a job due to automation, but the alternative of regulatory protectionism doesn't really work too well at a global scale.  It's not unlike US tech job loss over last two decades due to offshoring.\n\nRight now, I don't think we are *quite* there yet.  Companies are spending tons of money to enter the AI market (or just exist alongside it), but many are still very much bloated with excess labor after more than a decade of [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) policies that let those companies exist without actual profit far longer than they should have.  Covid ended that, but replaced it with massive corporate stimulus packages specifically aimed at keeping people employed.\n\nThe downside was inflation after the Covid stims, which required raising interest rates to try and combat.  Those higher interest rates meant companies couldn't just limp along with barely any profit (\"growth mode\" where prices are low to build a user base).  That's why you see things like streaming services and various SAAS companies hiking prices like crazy over the last 4 years.  And on top of that, labor is usually the single largest source of expenses for most businesses (other than *very* capital-heavy industries like Oil and Gas), so it makes sense that actual layoffs are going to be part of that equation.\n\nAnd if you want to announce layoffs, right now it's way more palatable to vaguely blame it on AI investments to not spook shareholders and tank your stock.\n\nThat's not to say AI isn't taking some jobs or that it won't take a whole lot more down the road, but rather to understand that we are *very early* in this whole ride and still kind of trying to figure out exactly what we can do with it.\n\nI'll mention that like most industries changed by automation, it's the people on the lower end that will get hit the hardest.  I'm not talking \"entry level\" positions, but just overall skill level.  The \"web developer\" career path is ridiculously easy to get into and has relatively low skill requirements compared to other IT-adjacent careers.  There are a ton of web devs that basically made a career installing Wordpress, a paid theme, and some plugins.  Those low-skill devs (including an absolute shit-ton overseas currently competing entirely being priced low) are going to be the first to get screwed.  Next will be basically any web dev whos job is so faceless that they are graded on metrics like helpdesk tickets.\n\nFor everyone else, AI will largely be a boon in the same way that, say, the C language was a boon to those who otherwise were having to program in Assembly.  More abstraction happens, sure, but that frees up cognitive load to focus on more complex problems.\n\nAnyone trying to discount AI based on the notion of it making their current workload faster (or not) is missing the entire point.",

The gist of it is we’re seeing a massive increase in the sheer amount of code written. But it’s more buggy and there’s less refactoring happening. A [google report](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-the-2024-dora-report) finds a 3% increase in the quality of code. \n\nI mean do with this what you will.

John Henry said the same thing too. \n\nAgents barely became mainstream last year. I do feel like I’m supervising a bunch of juniors now.

For the code, I offload to it some of my mechanical work so to say. For example, when refactoring code over multiple modules/components/just files I tend to just do it for one file and give that as an example for AI. It's very good at following references and doing changes in the same-ish way. \n\n\nIt's also good in \"take this and do exactly this with it\" so I don't manually edit, split to modules and all that stupid mechanical work with a lot of copy-paste. Sometimes I use it like I tell it exactly what and how to do stuff and it simply does that: \"create a new controller, with X end point, we will accept {x, y, z}, validate it with <some-lib-we-use>, reference to existing <some-controller>\"\n\n\nSee, like, given I've been writing a lot of code manually, for years before LLM and all that became a very popular thing so I tend to use AI NOT like \"do X feature anyhow\" (leaving implementation details, contracts and all that to it), but more like asking it to type for me what I already know how to do, just offloading typing to it. \n\n\nIt might be not the best way to use it as many people achieve incredible things not even touching details, just straight up asking it to build their ideas and not how to build it but it works for me and actually helps me being faster.\n\n\nBut being faster does not necessarily mean I can ship more and faster in a Big Tech company where bureaucracy is the main bottleneck. Our higher managers cannot use AI to discuss and plan stuff, very high level directors cannot use it to plan our companies year or something. \n\n\nAnyway, the good thing is we're getting more time for tech debt, tech tasks and time to study and better ourselves.\n\n\nWorth to note that our company prohibits us from using fancy things like Claude Opus, GPT and all that. We have to use whatever is run on companies servers (so that NDA is not violated, privacy concerns and all that), currently it's GLM 4.7, soon enough probably will be GLM 5. \n\nSome companies pay for Claude Code, Cursor and all that for their devs, maybe they get more value from it this way too and privacy concerns are less.",

Small targeted prompts, and put guard rails around it. Be specific dont let it wander off\n* Makes refactoring and restructuring so much easier. I had a coworker leave me a fucked up branch.

But when I get tasked with something that I'm like \"oh fuck how am I going to do this in this two week sprint?\" Well, I don't feel that way anymore.

Just this week I took on 15 points of tickets (which is insane, I know, but we lost a dev) and I was able to do it all without stressing. So the overall net gain on my mental health and stress is massive.

This is paired with a plugin for jetbrains IDEs, as well as a CLI option. \n\nFor those engineers that have used it heavily, we’ve seen 2-3x more output. And this isn’t vibe coding. We have been very specific about how we’re to work with AI, that means taking an agentic approach. In addition, all code you push while using AI YOU are responsible for. If it’s wrong or fucks the app, guess who you’re having a chat with. \n\nWe use instruction files and sub agents for specific tasks and the outcome has been very positive. One engineer was able to do a large set of features that I estimated would take us two months, in two weeks. And I reviewed the work at every step. It was excellent. Said engineer then showed the rest of the team how lie approached the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, if you know how to work with AI agents, and you plan well, you’ll see amazing benefits.

I’d say 60% if we are talking about boring, trivial “here’s a X component, make a Y component with these changes” (But this stuff doesn’t take much time to begin win and you have to write the first component anyway). \n\nIt also has some real productivity gains when I’m tired or bored to write quality code and it’s not some novel problem: I had to write a composable to handle a ref history with snapshots but vueuse’s didn’t work very well, so I just had the AI make one. \n\nAnd in other ways, it makes me less productive: specifically in Rust, a lot of code it spits (particularly from autocomplete) is either wrong or suboptimal, and a lot of the time it doesn’t really compile. Another thing that worries me is becoming lazy because I can just have the AI make stuff (when it works), and losing confidence on the codebase, which is a big issue down the road",

But if I have no idea what I'm doing or the codebase is a war zone I'll start by asking exploratory questions like \"what is the workflow for X ? does this trigger external call to Y ? Is it permission restricted for users with this licence at any point\" just to get an idea of the situation. \n\nThe AI usually handles this part very well by exploring the codebase and gathering context autonomously. It's very good at understanding the purpose of the codebase and relevance of each part.\n\nFor execution I often use planning mode, it'll reason about my request and ask questions about the desired implementation or necessary clarifications until we reach a state where everything is settled and it has a multi step actionable plan. The results are not perfect yet but considering the fact that we have no types in our code or any documentation (that's on us, the AI trips on the same issues I do) the quality of what I get is a miracle. I'll have a few more rounds of correcting such or such aspect of the work but it's already a huge help.\n\nThe important thing is to steer it in the right direction and not have super long sessions because context gets diluted and it's where it becomes useless and frustrating.\n\nWhat would make it 10x more useful is if I could make it work across multiple codebases because our microservice architecture is a fractured context for the AI, it's limited to what it can see in this one repository, missing the big picture.",

I must emphasise that these are not team projects and I develop them on my own, and with zero friction with other devs and not aiming for scalability due to their nature it has been amazing. The main issues arise when there’s misalignment between multiple devs on AI usage and the codebase already has significant existing work. Maybe there’s ways of utilising the current state of the art in a way that the entire team aligns, but for now I consider them really good for codebase exploration if it’s an enterprise environment. For personal projects it is truly incredible what Codex can do for example, but developing valuable products is a lot more than just writing code, and that’s the part AI sucks at",

Over time you get multiple ways to do auth, validation, error handling, etc., which increases cognitive load and bugs.\n\nRemember, speed shifts effort, but it doesn't remove it.

          "text": "This is something I've been noticing more and more. The problems are different than traditional tech debt but just as real.\n\n**Traditional tech debt:** You inherit a messy codebase. It's badly structured, poorly documented, but at least someone UNDERSTOOD it when they wrote it. There was human reasoning behind the decisions, even if they were bad decisions.\n\n**AI generated tech debt:** The code works. Tests pass. But nobody actually understands WHY it works. The AI generated some clever solution that does the job, but the logic is... weird. Not wrong, just unintuitive.\n\nSix months later when you need to modify it, you're stuck. Do you:\n\n* Rewrite it from scratch (now you're back to square one)\n* Try to modify the AI generated code (good luck understanding the context)\n* Ask AI to modify its own code (works sometimes, breaks spectacularly other times)\n\n**What I'm seeing in practice:**\n\nThe biggest issue is inconsistency. When humans write code, even bad code, there's usually a consistent style and approach. You can predict how they'll solve similar problems.\n\nAI generated code feels like it was written by 10 different people. Because technically, it was trained on code from thousands of developers. So you get:\n\n* Three different patterns for error handling in the same file\n* Mix of functional and OOP styles randomly\n* Dependencies that made sense in the training data but are overkill for your use case\n\n**The maintenance burden:**\n\nWhat kills me is the cognitive load. With human written code, even messy code, I can usually trace the thought process. \"They were trying to solve X, got stuck on Y, so they did this workaround.\"\n\nWith AI code, it's just... there. Working. No narrative. No evolution. Just a blob of functionality that appeared fully formed.\n\nWhen something breaks, I find myself spending MORE time understanding the AI generated code than I would have spent just writing it myself originally.\n\n**What actually helps:**\n\nI've started treating AI generated code as a first draft that MUST be refactored. Never commit it as is. Always:\n\n* Add comments explaining the INTENT, not just what it does\n* Simplify the clever bits into obvious bits\n* Make it consistent with the rest of the codebase\n* Document any non obvious dependencies or assumptions\n\nBasically spending the time I saved on initial coding on cleanup instead. Net result is probably neutral on time, but at least the codebase stays maintainable.\n\nAnyone else finding this? Or have people figured out better workflows for keeping AI generated code from turning into unmaintainable spaghetti?",

Even with all tags disabled lol - literally loading bare GTM fucked the pagespeed scores.\n\nWhen CWV was rolled out, I was the tech lead on a rebuild of a site for a company that was trying to compete for rankings in a space that was already dominated by two big players. (Fwiw, the company I worked for did relatively well as a 3rd contender, consistently hitting 1st page results but for the most common search phrases would usually be in the lower half of 1st page, and for certain more niche phrases they'd dominate the top 5.) I was investigating the impact of CWV very closely as I had been specifically tasked with maximizing our pagespeed scores. During the roll-out there was a blog post by John Mueller where he very clearly stated that CVW were nothing more than a mild tie-breaker in case two sites were otherwise very equal. So basically perfect CWV does not automatically mean higher rankings even if the competitor's scores are absolute garbage. (Anecdotally, I recall one round of analysis where our competitors had <50/100 and we were at like 98,100,100,100 on mobile and 100 across the board on desktop.)\n\nIt's no secret that Google's ranking algorithm is a complex, secret that's constantly evolving in order to thwart the SEO-exploiters. It's a cat and mouse game that's been around for as long as search engine rankings were any kind of business concern.\n\nThere are also some clear statements by Google saying that sites for businesses with noteworthy reputations in the real-world do have priority ranking. Basically there are manual \"knobs\" they can tune their algorithm with, regardless of whatever SEO prowess is implemented on the technical or content levels.\n\nLast time I checked, a site like Amazon has absolute trash CWV, but imagine if google ranked janky little Etsy or Shopify sites over Amazon for certain searches... People would simply stop using Google as their main access point for those. Plus who knows what kind of deals and partnerships google has with various companies outside of their open-market \"sponsored results\".\n\nSo basically the game is already rigged no matter how well you do your own SEO. For most markets, organic rankings are a delusional KPI to chase if you aren't also pushing real-world business reputation. Imho it's a rather fair play, because SEO has always been something that marketing specialists try to game tf out of. The downside is that it certainly does make it difficult for smaller up-and-comers to break into top-tier rankings. But at the same time, how easy has it ever been to break into any other mainstream business rankings such as the F500?",

So I implemented a way to dynamically load it after the page has finished loading and is idle... Prioritize the loading of critical things and prevent it from taking resources/bandwidth. Obvious win for what the user experiences in page loads, but it gave me a pretty significant ding because it cannot tell the difference between critical resources and unnecessary stuff like analytics. \n\nIt's still worth paying attention to and probably looking into any issues or reports, but it's just a tool, not the source of truth.",

          "text": "Yep. Multiple times. It also depends on what the page is. Each website build is different. There are valid exceptions to not having 100. Overall page speed should be used a tool for developers to know what browsers expect of them, and not a pissing contest between websites to see whos is actually faster.\n\nBasically 0 network requests in the critical path assuming rational webpage payload and you'll get 100. The critical path is just what browsers need to build the initial view which is usually above the fold. You can still do shit loads of network requests but for initially building the page you don't want any if possible, it seems like inline CSS is the way to go for performance in the critical path, for example.\n\nI'm working on a custom SSG + a website output from the SSG. It's a heavy JS media site with a 60fps deltatime gameloop running a pretty significant animation right off the hop, went from 73 performance to 90-93 and it can go to 100 on-demand if you turn off cloudflare/js tracking stuff, which was used in this domain i was optimizing for example.\n\nBiggest things were LCP was not being present on the page right away, so I fixed the custom SSG to have image preloading functionality and preloaded the LCP in the critical path so it's present during drawing and so the browser knows how to build the page properly.\n\nThen I had about 1 full second of render blocking assets, I inlined the critical css on the page so there is no network request for critical path, then inlined whatever JS in the head for a small theme switcher script to stop FOUS and the application/ld+json, and then rest of CSS scripts were preloaded async and the rest of the JS was defered until doc load. Rest of JS moved and loaded outside of head. preload the fonts in head for FOUS and to stop additional network requests\n\nImages were not optimized this was a huge win, swapped everything to webp. And have fallback pngs optimized for web JIC. Rest of the website was already in the 90s with no real issues beside blogs index pages which was just an image size issue because it's not dynamically grabbing a different size for the card. So I'm not bothering for now because it's blazing fast and images are very very small in size anyway being webp.",
