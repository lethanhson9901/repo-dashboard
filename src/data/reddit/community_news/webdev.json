With skills/plugins for AI tools, there's often zero review pipeline.\n\nPractical checklist for anyone using AI coding tools:\n\n- **Audit every dependency the AI adds** — run `npm audit` / `bundle audit` after each session\n- **Never trust AI-generated auth code without review** — LLMs love to generate JWT implementations that skip signature verification or use weak secrets\n- **grep for outbound network calls** — `fetch`, `axios`, `Net::HTTP`, `urllib` in any generated code should be manually reviewed\n- **Use allowlist-based CSP headers** — even if malicious code gets in, it can't phone home if your Content-Security-Policy blocks unknown domains\n\nThe hard truth: if you're using any tool that can execute arbitrary code on your machine, you need to treat it like you would a new hire with root access.

(Subagent delegation is a thing, look into it. You don’t always need top tier for all actions)\n\n$2.3k income today from guidance and strategy. \nAnd another ~ 2k tomorrow hopefully.\n\nMostly because I’m lazy and trust my long term clients too much and let unpaid invoices linger for too long, and one new project that I was dragging ass on… which is 80% done during my testing yesterday. \n\nIt’s prompted to understand that I’m poor and instructed to cover its own token usage expenses. Today was the first ROI after 1.5 weeks of experimentation. \n\nReady for the Reddit hate. Bring it on I guess. ",

For set B, it builds another custom filter function and custom format function.\n\nA smart programmer would recognize that if they built a slightly-more-flexible function that handles the filtering AND the formatting with a couple extra lines of code, they can replace those four other functions.\n\nThe example I'm channeling above went from \\~1,200 LOC to \\~800 LOC after we humans cleaned it up.

Mostly because backend dev is very detail oriented so you have to have a very in depth prompt to get the results you want and then often still need massaging afterwards. The biggest pro is I hope this will encourage other devs to write better feature documentation and tickets since you can take all those hours of writing and plug it into your prompt to get 90% done. Working through the edge cases and verifying everything with stakeholders is still a massive bottleneck though and AI ain’t fixing that.  ",

It's nothing to spend 5 hours on plan documents and then at the end type \"implement the plan\" and then take a break, come back do some debugging, right some wrongs, review the files.\n\nBut if you've got your code style, project goals and insights contexted out with a hard rules page and a trusty qdrant server/graphql full of the codebase? This is how I'm working these days and yeah it's not 15k lines but it's definitely somewhere in the thousands. That's just with open source models and no AI budget so to speak. Imagine if I had actual resources..\n\nThe force multiplication is real but you still have to know what you are doing to get something good out. You get better at working with the whole roulette wheel of it as you go too. \n\nIt's not faster in the incidental sense but there is more happening overall with less. \n\nSome of the layoffs are MBA's jumping the gun but some are not and we are still in the stages where i.t people adopt faster than everyone else. Just wait 5 more years until it has hit every profession in every way. \n\nI already lost my job due to economic forces and that's how I had the time to piss around and retrain for all this nonsense and there is a lot of nonsense! There is also a lot of truth buried amongst it. I hate it all but what the hell else you gunna do. I need to run faster than the next lion about to eat me and this industry has always been that way. The more people taking hard stances against it will be fine, until they aren't. Like that Tyson quote. Everybody got a plan until they get punched in the face. \n\nSo on one hand I'm mad that I had just got my place sorted out after 8 years before they decided I made too much. On the other hand. This break, this gift has me 2 years ahead of many others on the topic. My wife doesn't understand, she just sees me knee deep in .MD docs. My network of i.t friends are starting to ask me if I can make them one off things because I can do it faster.\n\nThe other ones are scared to ask me questions. I try not to talk about it because it upsets a lot of people but at the same time I'm doing more. A lot more and quality is not the issue. I'm a card carrying better offline advocate as well so emotionally it's a turbulent thing to listen and agree with Ed all day long and then open my ide and sell my soul to this. I.t people are going to be seen as no different as people who contribute to oil industry. Business is going to be absolutely addicted to it forever. \n\nAt least when it was Google search back in the dsy. We got to be positive and less cynical about the world. Then spent years lifting people up, educating etc. This is not that. It's the antithesis of that. This is dog eat dog survival unless some unforeseen boom is coming but I don't see it. I just see more enshitification. More broken garbage and a few people who know what they are doing, do a lot more but not be able to easily separate themselves as such.",

I've seen AI generate 3000 lines that could be replaced with 200 lines of well-structured code. The models optimize for 'working output' not 'minimal correct implementation.'\n\nThe actually useful metric for AI-assisted dev is something like 'features shipped per week that survive production for 30 days without a rollback.' That captures both velocity AND quality.\n\nWhat I've noticed in practice: the developers who are most productive with AI tools are the ones who spend 70% of their time *deleting and refactoring* what the AI wrote, not the ones generating the most. -1K LOC days are genuinely the best days.

          "text": "I’d note a few things about vibe coding people don’t really talk about. \n\nNew vibe coders on average produce better results than new engineers. New engineer code quality has always been a dumpster fire at times. Vibe coding being better, even if just a little, has pretty substantial impact on the industry. \n\nA second issue is people ignore is that vibe coders can learn, just like new engineers can learn. They learn what works and what doesn’t. This creates a vibe coder that becomes fully capable of developing full applications that scale well and have good security. \n\nThe primary issue with vibe coders from my experience is that it can be hard to distinguish the ones that learn from the ones that don’t if you’re looking at resumes and portfolios. A non-engineer can never tell the difference. But an engineer sitting down and talking to these people, you can quickly discern the ones that learn and the ones that don’t. \n\nBut at the end of the day, people prefer results. If it costs you $5 for a website that works fine for 3 years then runs into issues, so you spend $5 again in 3 years for a new one, that’s a better deal to people than spending $2000+ for someone to make one today that won’t have that issue later. Then again, it’s worse if you spend that money and the rookie engineer manually programmed the same issue anyway.\n\nThat’s my main issue with the vibe coding criticism I see. The issues vibe coders run into are less frequent, and less problematic, than the issues I tend to see nearly all lower level engineers I’ve worked with. And, unfortunately, the vast majority of freelancer engineers I’ve met (certainly not all) I’d consider far less experienced than the average engineer I meet working at a bigger company. \n\nI also see people around here sometimes treat vibe coder products like something being made to handle 100 million active users when in reality, most people just want a small website / app for like <1000 users, so “scalable” is the farthest thing from a concern these companies would have. A lot of people around here imply that aggressive over engineering is the right path forward when it’s not.",

They also know how to search for answers, and have even some idea if a potential answer they found is right or wrong.\n\nVibe coders fixing bugs and problems have to rely purely on hope and prayers that their beloved machine god fixes their mess. That just doesn’t sound very efficient to me.\n\nSo even though a vibe coder could of course learn and become a better developer, they most likely just won’t even try to. Like that’s the point of vibe coders, right? They don’t want to learn programming and become actually knowledgeable devs, although they most certainly could if they wanted to.",

A CEO isn’t about to become a vibe coder, but they’ll vibe code themselves something and struggle along the way. A vibe coder, on the other hand, does experience issues like other engineers, but they actually try to resolve it using google, AI chatbots, reach out to engineers, etc. for guidance on the issues.

          "text": "I think what people call “vibe coding” often gets misunderstood , it’s not about being lazy, it’s about flow state and cognitive throughput, which actually produces value if it’s aligned with clear goals.\n\nA few practical thoughts:\n\n* High-impact work isn’t measured in keystrokes. Sometimes the best code or design idea comes in a few minutes of deep focus, not hours of surface-level busy work.\n* Context switching kills productivity. When you’re in flow, you can solve problems holistically. Breaking that for meetings, notifications, or tickets fragments your thinking and increases bugs later.\n* Outcome > motions. If your “vibe” sprint produces clear deliverables or insights that move the project, it’s not slack , it’s efficient cognitive work.\n\nThat said, flow without alignment or measurable outcomes can be just distraction. The real art is creating spaces where teams can enter that state toward a clear, shared goal.\n\nTo the community:\n\n* How do you balance deep focus time with team coordination and accountability?\n* Do you measure productivity by output or by outcome?\n* At what point does “vibe coding” stop being productive and start being avoidance?\n\nWould love to hear how others define that boundary in real projects.",

I will always argue that the recipient developer still has to understand what's been generated and work through that as they would for any other peer code review.\n\nThe bit that I have not seen AI reliably do yet is actually spec the project up front. That's where the value in the kind of service that our kind of shop provides is; sit down with the client, ask questions, offer your own ideas, come up with detail in solutions etc.. If your spec is little more than \"build an AI agent and a website\" then the possible outcomes are almost endless. A tight specification before starting any dev project is essential and one of my concerns about the people using AI (which includes non-developers now finding them in a position to be able to \"code\") is that without understanding how to scope a project, the output is never going to be great. It really is a case of shit in, shit out.\n\nI'm enjoying reading the experiences of dev teams who include vibe coders...",

You would never walk into a place and learn to maintain the perl unless the creator was there and have documentation.  It merited the phrase, \"write once read never\"; therefore, the emphasis was constantly building upon solid modules and extending them for features, or spending a week rewriting the whole thing.\n\nThat seems stupid but Perl is easy to write once you're proficient and that was during the era of no stackoverflow, few forums, and everything was books and memory.  Like the perl cookbooks that nobody uses because they're essentially useless.   You wouldn't read a HeadFirst Java book except if your goal was to purely learn Java.  You would just fire up Cursor and use the new toolchain to write your code.  That's the difference really, companies will have style guides for prompts like \"only use Elixir\", \"only use rust\", so you'll upload large spaghetti prompts of context for the LLMs, and then prompt away.\n\nThere will eventually be birthed a form of structure to it; however, this structure may look like interacting with AIs while they write slop code.  The only caveat is that everything is a blackbox so it doesn't matter what's happening as long as it mimics your instructions.  I'll say this, people will surely know how to express themselves in future IT roles or they won't be around for very long, thank you momma for forcing me to do grammar err'day.",

What an ignoble end. But really it was those years of the free tier than sank them I’m sure /s\n\nNgl DHH quadrupling down on being an untenable, repellent dickhead and the slow motion car crash of Heroku both gave me a bit of a professional midlife crisis last year. I came out a better, happier developer but it didn’t make dealing with those feelings any more pleasant, it’s a real shame when things turn to shit but I thank my lucky stars that I got to come up right before dev bootcamps saturated the market with juniors and sort of broke the sustainability of focused, mentor/apprentice pair programming dynamics.",

Better for apps that need edge deployment or specific runtime requirements.\n\n**If you're comfortable with a bit more infra:**\n- **Kamal** (from the Rails team, formerly MRSK) — deploy Docker containers to any VPS via SSH. No vendor lock-in, you own the servers. Think Heroku-style deploys but to a /mo VPS. Great if you want to understand what's actually happening.\n- **Coolify** — self-hosted PaaS that gives you Heroku-like UI on your own infrastructure.\n\n**If your app is simple enough:**\n- **Hatchbox** for Rails specifically — manages the entire server for you.\n\nThe no-new-enterprise-accounts is the real tell.

TDD?\n\nTo me those are more useful questions rather than: Explain how to create a recursive descent parser to parse JSON using only functions, javascript, vaseline, duct tape and a banana.\n\nFor your case though, because you needed some very specific knowledge, I think it's okay to ask that, just saying, you might give the wrong impression to people just asking for general \"senior role\" questions",

We pay them for the day.\n\nIn our case I have a simple exercise where they need to build a small form \"age, address, category of products you buy the most, favorite brand\", and then present statistics on the form responses.  \nI give them a docker boilerplate with our stack, with empty logic for frontend, api and database, connections already built and tested, an in-house built frontend library fully documented that they are told to use for the form build.  \nThat will force them to deal with the frontend, both on the form as well as present some basic charts and tables for the information, will force them to organize an api and a couple of classes. It is a very simple thing, but that can go to different levels of detail, naming and organization.  \nDo they document their decisions? Do they use AI? Are they able to understand your documentation? Do they build foundational methods? Do they understand and use patterns? Do they reproduce the already existing structure of the library you provided? All of these questions can get answered right there.  \nPeople tell me \"that is a costly hiring process\", I normally answer that hiring the wrong candidate is a lot more expensive than whatever we pay to the 3/4 people we interview every 6 months. My CEO agrees.\n\nTo answer the \"why vs how\" part I mentioned on top, I have a question on the preliminary interview that is somewhat silly and vague on purpose:  \n\"Given a class vehicle, describe auxiliary classes, variables and methods/functions that you would find essential to build\"\n\nMost people go and create classes Wheel, Seats functions \"move(location A, location B) etc...  \nSome people go and start creating abstraction classes \"Locomotion\" \"Engine\".\n\nBut the best candidates most of the times ask:  \n\"What do you want the Vehicle to do? Is it a vehicle to carry people? load? for exhibition? Is it to do so on land? sea?\"  \nI haven't had a single one who asks that who doesn't draft a small set of classes and methods correctly after, to the point in which when someone questions the exercise I just give them full points and move onwards.\n\nBare in mind I am not discarding the others, I can still take insights from the way they organize their thought and helps me see how they construct their code.\n\nMy idea is always that you don't need to ask very complicated questions to assess knowledge, in fact when you ask about the Columbus Egg question (can you invert a binary tree?) you only get people who studied that specific question, and that tells you very little of how they proceed on their day to day. I prefer to give very simplistic exercises, that people will go more/less in depth as they feel more /less comfortable with their stack/knowledge. End of the day you are hiring someone to help you drive things forward, not someone to do what you have already done in the past.\n\nEnd of the day always remember, you can teach stacks, you can teach patterns, but thought process is mostly an inate skill that takes way longer to adapt to.  \n  \nAlso remember that (at least in my experience) teams thrive with different thought processes and personalities, sometimes you need someone who documents heavily, sometimes you need someone who questions a lot, sometimes you need someone who just executes.  \nSo try to hire for the blindspots of your team when possible.",

It's important to fully flesh out the qualities that you're looking for. Think of it like hiring a writer for a show you want to produce. \n\nHiring the most brilliant writer doesn't matter if they're difficult to work with, if they're unreliable, if you want a comedy but they're more of a drama writer. Or maybe they're incredibly talented with characters and plot, but can't seem to write to the spec of the show. \n\nHiring someone to code for you is analogous. They may be legit, but that doesn't mean they're a good fit for you. It doesn't mean you're going to get the outcomes that you want. Thoroughly define what you need, heavily weighted to long term goals. Then work backward to defining the type of person you'll need.\n\nFinally, don't ignore the most obvious factor: budget. Make sure you can afford the person you want. Trying to save money, especially if you're inexperienced in hiring and won't have any established mentors on board to supervise, will almost always come back to bite you.",

We have a great team with no jerks, and I want to keep it that way. That last point is really important because being a great place to work is a big part of our excellent retention. \n\nSo, I do a live coding test that involves calling APIs and integrating the responses, and a system design test that shows they know the moving parts of a production web app, and how databases work. \n\nThat's it. \n\nIf we interview ten people, I see one or two who have the technical chops to pass that test.

They'll rattle off answers to the system design challenges and they'll add details that come from experience building working applications.\n\nAnd if they can do all that while being articulate and having a pleasant disposition, they have a very good shot at landing the job. \n\nI know there are companies that need a lot more from their engineers but at a lot of SaaS companies you pretty much just need solid basics and experience delivering real-world, production applications.\n\nFor junior engineers we give pretty much the same test but our expectations aren't as high. \n\nAnd that's the whole thing.

          "text": "Hello. I am only 24 but I’ve been programming since about 7 years old. Ive done all types of competitive programming and I pretty much never stopped being good at it. I am very autistic though in person, so I have failed most job interviews. I went from homeless after undergrad to signing 400k of solo projects in about a year last year and now I run my own company. This is not to hype myself up, but to give you context into how I can tell other talented or high potential young people apart. These are the common patterns I’ve seen from every person who is both good and not easily recognized all the way from high school until my professional career. \n\nFirst off, everyone who is talented but not recognized is weird. If you are thinking you are going to find them by selecting for “normal people” you might as well just stop reading. If you think you are talented in CS and “normal,” that’s not normal. Your talent has just been “normalized” by your environment. The average person can’t read beyond a 6th grade level. Let weird be endearing from now on, or else just give up your search.\n\nMost of Full stack is system design, so I am going to go with that as my shining star in terms of skills. Dont solve this by looking up “systems design interview question” because everyone has seen all of those before. Its so trivial for anyone who knows what they are doing, but time consuming and so easy to nitpick that its almost insulting. I like to be given questions with real answers, that actually test what I am expected to do when hired. Hell, it might even be funnier and a better test to ask them how they’d respond to a bunch of slack messages in a deck of flashcards. If you are going to like working with someone, you can tell from how they might respond to slack interviews. It might also take the sword of damocles off of their head.\n\nAlso, you are going to need to make a relaxing environment probably. The stakes are high every job interview. While it’s normal for you to interview a lot of candidates, most of those candidates probably haven’t gotten any interviews in weeks. The job market is totally fucked for everyone. I hope you understand the nervous system tension of trying to feed yourself and family. There are plethoras of studies showing intelligence as really driving up nervous system sensitivity across the board, so these candidates might be more nervous because to you its another day and to them its their whole future.\n\nPlease select : Corporate or Startup. Your best guys are always going to be split. Either they were found by corporate and poached early (talented and well known) or they were not. Typically, the talented guys who were not poached went to make some money. I know some pretty rich weirdos in SF. The best people I know either corporate extremely early and stayed (but didnt promote to higher levels, bc politics) or went to go work for a no name startup. Best programmer I ever met to this day works for a small game studio. That dude used to ship like 2000 of systems code a day and it really impressed me. No matter what though, either they stay for a long time, or they move fast and get promoted repeatedly. Please stop judging for layoffs. These big tech companies hired stupidly and fired stupidly after they went broke. Too many of them are zombies, and are not going to tell you that. A layoff means nothing if you actually live in reality.\n\nThere are pretty good pools of young people because the hiring process is so scuffed. The trick is to ask them questions they have never been prepping. You always find talent by scoping out a wide variety of factors. If you only test leetcode, you will only find people who overfit for leetcode. Just play tricks on them and keep them on their toes. I think smart people tend to hate boring things. Or at least I do. I’ve never found a smart person who doesnt like solving new problems in some capacity, as long as those new problems arent “stupid” problems.\n\nAlso, a lot of tech is huge complexity theatre. The less you tell a computer to do, the faster it is. Anyone who adds more steps for a computer to do without good reason and doesnt separate concerns immediately probably isn’t cracked. If you are a small company and the interviewee says monolith, you are in good hands hahaha. If they say anything about some more microservices, they are probably listening to too many people on the internet. Don’t blame them for that, as theres not much else to do while unemployed. If a person isn’t familiar with how fast something CAN be and that sometimes you should focus priorities on something else other than speed, then they probably dont know A LOT. This one is a bit easier to not be familiar with these days.\n\n\nHonestly you guys trying so hard to select also probably weeds out a lot of candidates. You are most likely best off using the euler method for statistical random guessing, since sometimes your heuristics can be worse at selecting talent than random. Just make your own tests for god sakes. No more complaining about candidates cheating all the time. Weed every candidate by putting a few “random questions” they arent supposed to answer or hidden white text questions to avoid chatgpt. Chatgpt for resumes is OK, for interviews is nonsense. Everyone is going to play the “pick me” game, which is fine as long as you have the skills to back it up. If you are playing “pick me” and know nothing, I believe you should study up some more and work outside the field. I know this sounds harsh but its actually the only economically viable strat. I only found any type of money once I stopped looking at tech companies and just started fixing problems for people who had a lot of them and a lot of money.",

It’s incredible how fast tech changes over time, and some stuff, objectively good and performant at the moment, becomes completely obsolete over time. Currently working as an instructional designer, and I have already a gut feeling that this will be taken over by AI as well and I should start looking for some trade that do not wane off in 5 years.

You don't check for errors, don't try to understand the code, and ship it to live without testing it. This is how you get template-like websites, very common variable names, no customization, and generic designs. It's a lot clearer when someone clearly vibe coded a website into existence, no different from using a Wordpress template, Wix, or Weebly of the past, except a lot easier now. It will most definitely be buggy, full of errors, insecure, and lack any understanding from the person who vibe coded it on how it all works.\n\nIt's extremely different from getting an LLM to generate code to accomplish a task that would take hours of Googling to find how to do it because documentation is either vague or non-existent... It's different when you actually taking the time to look at the code and understand how it works so you can use it in more spots in the future. It's basically a teaching tool in this scenario.\n\nI don't think using LLMs to streamline your work flow is considered vibe coding. Because there's no way for someone to know something was LLM assisted in this scenario, as you spend the time to debug, kill errors, secure things, understand the code, custom design, and most importantly, you make the code it generates yours. You change variable names, you remove redundant variables LLMs love creating for one instance, you spend the time to make it better, and just know what it all does.",

Vibe coding platforms are a tool, and the purpose of a tool is to make a product better or faster. Vibe coding can do that, but only if it's used correctly.\n\nTo successfully implement this across an entire project, you would need very extensive knowledge in both prompt engineering and all the development disciplines you want to apply. That would advance the world of development.\n\nTherefore, I do believe that what you're excluding here belongs to Vibe coding and even corresponds exactly to the perfect application of this tool (you're using a relatively simple query for a specific discipline and have the ability to manually check for nonsense code). It's like with \"normal\" use of LLMs: Check your stuff.\n\nThe conclusion is that the goal is to make the difference invisible and that (partially) vibe-coded software is no worse than \"normally\" coded software.",

There's been way too many times where a company spends months writing PRDs, user stories, design docs, etc, only for the feature to completely flop because it doesn't address the real unspoken need. \n\nIf you're a product manager or other non-technical role, being able to vibe code a prototype, focus group it to users, incorporate the feedback and repeat until you know exactly what you want built is goated. Once you've figured out exactly what needs to be built, then you can toss it over for engineering to build properly. ",

You’ll still end up with an unmaintainable pile of shit if your project gets to any serious level of complexity, and you won’t have even close to the skills to fix it when things inevitably go wrong. You’ve skipped all the fundamentals and ultimately handicapped yourself, if your intention was to learn to build software.\n\nBut sure, it’s its own kind of IQ test, if that’s somehow important to you. ",

Forgive the giant wall of text, but this is a story:\n\nI found a job post for an interesting position that I matched so well it was uncanny. It was an amazing, 100% point-for-point match for my skills and experience, like they'd designed it for me. I sent them an enthusiastic email and my resume, and had a good initial phone screen with the hiring manager.\n\nThen he told me I had to do a take-home before the interview. He gave me a totally unfamiliar proprietary, idiosyncratic platform, which hadn't been mentioned in their job post—which he told me he'd chosen because I'd never seen it before. He told me to author several pieces of sophisticated functionality on it, including complex custom procedures using this platform's idiosyncratic paradigm, integrating an undocumented external API, and scripting live cross-process communication... and use AI to get the finished project back to him in two hours. \n\nHis project intro said the two hour limit was \"recommended, not mandatory\". \n\nWhich is good, because Claude Code then proceeded to hallucinate wildly for two hours, confidently emitting heaps upon heaps of garbage that just plain didn't work as promised. As I closed in on the two hour mark, I nearly called the guy and told him to forget the whole thing. But I plowed on. \n\nFinally in about another 45 minutes I managed to cajole a complete working solution out of Claude Code. Not only that, but this solution accomplished the requirements with two fewer fields and one less script than the hiring manager's own solution had. (He'd told me what he thought it would take.) \n\nThe next morning I got an email complimenting that the solution I turned in was more elegant than his own, and, saying that I wouldn't be proceeding to the interview because \"other people got it in in 2 hours.\"\n\nSo, he tested Claude's programming skills instead of mine, and turned me down for even an interview solely because Claude happened to hallucinate for me for over two hours on that day. The next day? Maybe Claude would have solved it in 15 minutes for me and hallucinated for two hours for someone else. Who knows. Seemed like a stupid reason to decline to even interview an exceptionally well-matched applicant.\n\nLater that week, I saw on LinkedIn the CEO of the company reposting the position and complaining that in a month of looking they still hadn't found a suitable candidate.\n\nI let him know what I thought.\n\nI still don't know what vibe coding even had to do with the position they described in their job post.",

Just wrapped up a 3-month migration of our SaaS product from React to Svelte 5, and wanted to share our experience.\n\n**Background:**\n- Mid-sized dashboard app (~50k lines of code)\n- Team of 4 frontend devs\n- Used React + Redux for 2 years\n\n**Why we switched:**\n- Bundle size was getting out of hand (450KB+ gzipped)\n- Performance issues on lower-end devices\n- Wanted to try Svelte 5's new runes and reactivity system\n- Tired of useEffect debugging sessions\n\n**Results after migration:**\n- Bundle size: 450KB → 120KB gzipped (73% reduction!)\n- First Contentful Paint: 2.1s → 0.8s\n- Time to Interactive: 3.5s → 1.2s\n- Lighthouse score: 72 → 94\n\n**Developer Experience:**\n- Code is more readable (less boilerplate)\n- Svelte 5's runes are intuitive once you get the hang of it\n- Much easier to reason about reactivity\n- TypeScript support is solid\n\n**The challenges:**\n- No direct equivalent for some React libraries\n- Had to rewrite our component library from scratch\n- Learning curve for the team (especially runes vs stores)\n- Some edge cases with SSR took time to debug\n\n**Would I do it again?** Absolutely. The performance improvements alone made it worth it, and our users have noticed the difference.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the migration process!",

          "text": "A lot of the reasons you list sound less like “React is the problem” and more like “our React architecture got messy over time.” \n\nThe whole “tired of useEffect debugging” thing isn’t really a framework issue. useEffect isn’t meant to be a core control mechanism in React. If you’re constantly fighting effects, it usually means state is poorly structured or effects are being used for things they shouldn’t be. Svelte avoids a lot of these pitfalls by design, React allows them. That’s a difference, but not proof that React itself is bad or slow.\n\nUsing Redux for a 50k-line dashboard over two years also explains a big chunk of the pain. Classic Redux adds a lot of overhead and makes it easy to trigger unnecessary re-renders. With more modern state patterns, many of those issues could’ve been reduced without switching frameworks.\n\nThe performance numbers are also hard to read as a pure framework win. Comparing a grown, \"legacy-heavy\" React app to a freshly rewritten Svelte app is mostly showing the rewrite effect. Rewrites almost always ship less JS and feel faster, no matter the framework.\n\nSo yeah, sounds like switching was the right call for your team. But to me this post shows how forgiving React is of bad architecture, not that React was the root cause of the problems.\n\nSo imho, this looks more like a problem with using “raw” React than a problem with React itself, Redux aside.",

But, in addition to _yet another dependency layer_, it adds either the complexity of managing another service, or the costs of adding a vendor to run it for you, without the fully integrated advantages of an MVC framework. \n\nI have yet to see the \"SEO factor\" quantified on any level. Google has been able to read React just fine for over a decade, and pre-hydrated content just doesn't meaningfully move the needle on rank. \n\nOr maybe I'm being optimistic about its downfall and that's just my neck of the woods.",

It defaults to being an SPA. But it also has an optional SSR sidecar that runs on H3 through an Nginx proxy (< 5ms latency). I strongly discourage our team from using the SSR sidecar unless the project explicitly requires it. Architecting that sidecar was one of the most illuminating things I've done in recent years. It did NOT give me an appreciation for all the heavy lifting Next.js and Nuxt are doing - it instead solidified in my mind that these hybrid CSR + SSR clusterphucks aren't sustainable.\n\nPeople either need to build a CSR app or build an SSR app with a little HTMX baked into it. Combining CSR with SSR like Next.js and Nuxt are doing is almost always over engineering. Google can index SPAs just fine, and SEO is becoming less relevant anyways because of AI.\n\nReact itself is sadly here to stay despite it being the literal worst of all the major UI libraries/frameworks. I'll take Vue, Svelte, Solid - hell, even Marko - over React. As an aside, I think once Vue's new Vapor mode is released in 3.6, it's going to upset the paradigm a fair bit.",

I'm sure it's all user error, but our code base runs so much quicker on vite, both startup and HMR, it's really worlds apart.\n\nAnd to make things worse, they are now introducing serious security flaws left and right. The non-vercel hosting is also still not resolved.\n\nI've used it as a easy choice for multiple years, I would not reach for it again for new projects, actively moved projects away from it.\n\nIt will not go away anytime soon as it's used so much, but unless they get on top of things I think a silent slow decline is coming.

I agree with everything above fading away slowly except for the TS thing: It's obviously fine not to use TS for simple data-light apps, but it should probably be the exception to the rule at this point for B2B or enterprise level stuff.",

In my last role, I built a telemetry ingestion system handling **12,000 simultaneous devices** using Node.js, Redis, and RabbitMQ.\n* **Education:** Master’s in CS (Ranked 1st nationally in my Bachelor's).\n* **Open Source:** I have active contributions to major repos like **Solid.js** (fixed a routing bug).\n\n**The Interview Process:** It was grueling.\n\n1. **Screening:** Standard fit check.\n2. **Take-home:** I built a fully production-ready backend service with rate-limiting and caching.\n3. **Leetcode:** 2-hour live coding session.\n4. **System Design:** Deep dive into database partitioning and scaling strategies.\n\n**The Offer:** They emailed me yesterday. **$900 USD per month.** No equity. Contractor role.\n\n**The Dilemma:** Their reasoning was \"That is a great salary in your region\" (Tunisia). It is technically above the local average ($500), I feel like its below the market rate for my level of experience.\n\n**Do I take this?** Do I accept this just to get \"US Experience\" on my resume, or should I keep looking for a team that values the output (scaling, performance) rather than my location?\n\nI'm feeling pretty defeated. Is the market really this broken for non-US seniors?\n\nUPDATE: I'm getting a lot of DMs asking if I'm still available. My inbox is flooded, so I might be slow to reply.

If they won't provide a number (or a range) I'll just say that I want to make sure we both have the same expectations so we're spending each other's time wisely and I cannot proceed until we have some basic understanding that we're a good fit for each other. If they want to ask some basic fit questions of me for the same reason that's fine (ex. remote/on site split, time zone work hours, etc). I like to take care of this over email or linkedin messaging but if they insist on a call I will agree to 15 minutes to clear this stuff up (this is what the recruiters want first for their reasons, but it's what I want as a last resort since we can clear up these basics in 2 mins over email or linkedin messaging and use even less of each other's time if it's not a good fit).\n\nIf the number is too low, then I will tell them what I would need to proceed with the next step. I genuinely don't want to waste their time and I want the same courtesy in return. Some might think it's rude to talk about numbers up front, and it can be a little uncomfortable if you make it that way, but if you're assertive about what you want and you're transparent about your expectations then I think that will avoid more awkwardness in the future and you'll end up with a company that has the same values as you (courtesy, transparency, fairness, etc).",

It is technically above the local average ($500), I feel like its below the market rate for my level of experience.\n\nNo offence but do you think there are no software devs on same level as you (or better) in US? There are many. But the company doesn't want to hire there. Why? Because they don't have the budget. That's why they're looking to hire in a lower cost-of-living region so that their $$ have more mileage. Its a win-win for both parties - company gets to hire good talent for lower rate & the talent gets employed with above average pay.\n\nYou are also doing the same - looking for a US based company for employment instead of something local to your region - because you know you will get paid better. If you are not the wrong then why would another be in the wrong for doing the same thing?\n\nIf you're holding out for US pay rates then keep looking. Some companies do pay standard rate irrespective of where the employee is located. Just not many of them.\n\nAs for equity & contractor role - well, you have a big misconception there. Unless the company has a registered subsidiary in your country, you can't be a full time employee. You'd need a US work permit for any US company to put you on payroll. So, yeah, you will get contractor role. And as for equity - contractors don't get equity.",

We will learn photoshop also but I just think it would make more sense for my professor teacher to teach figma, and how to convert that to sheets of code.\n\nBut I am new so I may be wrong. Just doesn’t seem progressive or to add to my basic skill set. ",

Bluebird was a graphical program to write Java with.\n\n\nI absolutely hated it and I never got the hang of it. Writing code on the other hand was easy for me and I am still in the field today.\n\n\nMy minor was in education and there I learned to understand the wish for a teacher to simplify or visualize the topic they teach about... but the stubborn kid in class (me) may not respond well to it and create friction.\n\n\nDreamweaver _is_ a way to learn webdevelopment but only the graphical basics. To learn true webdevelopment I would suggest learning HTML and CSS since these languages have become very powerful (especially CSS) and allow for complete understanding of how something works (but I am not your teacher giving you a passing grade! Making my word moot against your teacher who knows the course criteria) ",

In all of my years making websites I’ve never been rejected for a job because I didn’t have a degree. I’m self taught and started messing with websites back in the day with angelfire and geocities. If you need school or a teacher to tell you how to learn things, you’ll never make it as a web developer.. the technology is changing so fast that you’ll need to be a self learner. Unless you want to be a college professor then you can just teach dreamweaver 😂",

When i was first introduced to webdev the high school teacher taught us image maps as if it was the standard and that was well outdated way back then (fine because a high school teacher shouldn't be held to the same standard as specialized tertiary education).

And about 20% of them will feel utterly stupid. Almost every company I’ve worked at has had some random, kind of silly, software that they’re using just because they’ve been using it for the last 10 years. Learning random software really is its own skill set.\n\nI think Dreamweaver probably has the perfect amount of randomly frustrating shit for you to learn so that you can actually get used to some of the silly things that corporate America will throw at you.\n\nI say that as an alum of several fortune 500 companies and one Silicon Valley unicorn… you’re gonna have to get used to learning random software that you probably don’t want to learn to do your job.\n\nSo for now, I would say just to focus on the basics… And treat dreamweaver as a necessary evil… I feel like you can still learn in this class, but maybe don’t take the follow up class where they do a deep dive into adobe fireworks lol",

Something else to consider is that yes maybe that action converts at much higher rate, but how much of that conversion is because the people who stuck around and looked around long enough to find it only did so because they were already a more serious prospect.\n\nIt's probably a lot honestly. Even if you make this thing stand out and guide people right to it perfectly, you'll still probably only see about 10% conversion rate within the same time frame\n\nI mean, double the sales is still insane. But don't expect quintouple the sales.\n\nThen once that works you get another issue, there will be another choke point that converts the most users... Back to the drawing board.\n\nThis is why everyone says to make a new user walkthrough. Show everyone all the best features and how to access them right off the bat. The next trickiest part is making sure that stuff is as easy as it can be to access, otherwise you'll convert a ton but then have users dropping like flies when they get frustrated and during that time your support staff will be dying from floods of emails and calls.\n\nThen again, it could be that this feature is what 90% of users are looking for in your app and when they don't find it right away they go to the next competitor in line instead.",

People can give me long detailed explanations, but I will still be blank until I actually get my hands on whatever I need to do.\n\nI was never able to understand the basics of grammar, and the school books were completely useless. The only way I could learn English was to watch tv and read English books so I could see how people spoke to each other.\n\nI have always liked to take machines apart and put them back together to understand how they work. \n\nNow I realized that this is how I code, and while some call it a strenght, I personally struggle because of it. \n\nI have been working as a full stack developer for 5 years despite actually being a UX designer. I was lucky to have a boss who was open to my way of learning. He asked me if I could use Vue, Java Spring and SQL. I said nope and he replied \"Meh. I am sure you will figure it out\", so I did.\n\nSo for years I have been working on large scale applications for a PropTech company, setting up integrations, unit tests, doing debugging with SSH commands, managed complex queries etc. but if you ask me any basic question about Java or how to do something from scratch I have zero clue. I have watched countless of videos and even paid for courses, but my mind simply cannot wrap around any of the concepts.\n\nI need to see the code, take it apart, see which parts does what, and then I can come up with a solution.\n\nThis was all well and good until I lost my job and had to go to interviews. I am still jobless because I simply can't answer any technical questions. It sucks, but there is only so much one can do when the mind is shaped in certain way.\n\nIf anyone else here have this thinking pattern, how did you overcome it / embrace it?",

I just absolutely can't express it. I sound like an idiot any time I try to explain anything \"yes it's the thing that works through that thing when the state does it's thing... Here lemme show you\"\n\nSorry ended up ranting, just wanted to let you see you are not alone and there'll be likely tons of others like us ♥️",

Do you understand basic web infrastructure and networking? What databases are you familiar with? What cloud providers have you worked with? What are different caching strategies? \n\nThese are random questions I thought of that have nothing to do with code, but most senior engineers would have an answer to or thoughts about.\n\nSo I'd second what other people are saying, you probably have ADHD and should see a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis (don't just start taking some friends pills).\n\nBut I'll also be blunt: You need to figure out a way to learn. You're memorizing, experimenting, and repeating. Getting ritalin is not a magic pill that will fix all of this for you. \n\nIt's super valid that you're more of a hands on learner, but no one is going to give you a job trusting that you'll just figure it out one you get your hands on it. So if you're a hands on learner, you need to learn in a hands on way.\n\nHave you ever built and deployed a fullstack app? If the answer is \"no\" then that's a problem. If I were you I would go through building a fullstack app, with a backend repo, frontend repo, infrastructure as code (use terraform), leverage CI/CD (GH actions is fine), and deploy it to a real url.

          "text": "You're just a pattern learner rather than a conceptual learner, and the tech industry's interview process is brutally biased against your type of intelligence. The real kicker is that your learning style probably makes you better at the actual job than half the people who can recite design patterns and Big O notation in their sleep. You've proven you can build and maintain complex systems for five years, but now you're stuck in this absurd situation where you can't get hired because you can't perform in an artificial quiz show format. The solution isn't to force yourself into a different learning style - it's to find ways to demonstrate your actual abilities during interviews. When they ask theoretical questions, redirect to concrete examples from your work, walk them through actual code you've written, or ask if you can show how you'd approach a problem by working through it in real-time rather than explaining it abstractly.\n\nYour best bet is targeting companies that do practical take-home assignments or pair programming interviews instead of whiteboard theory sessions. Smaller companies and startups are often more flexible about interview formats, and you can sometimes negotiate the structure if you're upfront about your strengths early in the process. Frame it positively - you excel at understanding existing systems, debugging complex issues, and learning on the job, which are incredibly valuable skills that many developers lack. If you're struggling to get past the initial screening, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you prepare responses that bridge the gap between theoretical questions and your practical experience - I built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of interview challenges.",

Go watch videos about the fundamentals, start a project just so you get used to writing code. \nMost important thing to do is from each interview list what don’t go well or don’t know about and stud those topics.

Especially converting that mental model into easily understandable explanations so that you can teach others. Actually coding things is becoming less and less important. And, I'd argue, was never that important to begin with.\n\n> I need to see the code, take it apart, see which parts does what, and then I can come up with a solution.\n\nIf this works for you, do this!

I got promoted to lead architect and tried to steer it to a direction where it at least had some resemblance of a plan and architecture, while also educating developers about good development practices and modern software development, but I was really early in my career and as I realized that there was this shadow group of developers who wanted to maintain the current state of things so they can wear a cape and put out fires, I just quit and went to work at a much better company.\n\nI met the CTO a few years after that for lunch and he basically said nothing has changed.

We fixed the messed up UI, fixed all the backend bugs, cleaned up the DB in just a few weeks.\n\nHe ended up going back to hiring the original developer of the app, who was way cheaper, who then wrote a long series of emails as to why what we did was terrible and inexcusable.\n\nHe spent 6+ months on the app, after getting it back from us and what we fixed, to just write those emails. I'm not joking, he was a full time employee for that company to just manage that app, and in 6 months he did not make any updates or changes, just \"analyzed\" our changes to shitpost those emails\n\nMost of his concerns were fringe. Talking about things he didn't know about. He talked so much about prioritizing security, this and that. It was a fuckin' React app, not tied to anything critical or vulnerable. He also wrote long email chains about performance, trying to sound smart because some of the js files could've been reduced by a few bytes lol. The kicker was when he talked about the server, and how it was utilizing maximum CPU, but he didn't know that those cloud servers display CPU data based on cores (so 100% would be 1 core in full use, 200% would be 2 cores, etc). When the server would process something like a database migration, one of the cores would naturally spike up, bro wrote a huge email as to how that was unacceptable",

They also had plenty of microservices that communicated over JSON, sharing huge payloads, to ensure maximum latency. All in all, operating costs for the platform were at least 10x what they should be.\n\nWhen I asked the lead dev why we're doing all that, he said it's a skill issue and I need to understand that these patterns were used for a reason.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the frontend, they had 2-3 level inheritance on components, so you'd have something like:\n\n\\`BaseOnEnter\\` -> \\`OnEnterLeave\\` -> \\`OnEnterLeaveWithButton\\`.

They were then free to do whatever with the data with the only constraints being those defined on the table.\n\nThere was another web app written by someone else in BioInfo in Lua. I poked around the repo once and just saw a bunch of SELECT statements in the code, with the results again barfed onto the page. After some more digging, I found out that all of the business logic for this app was handled in trigger functions within the Postgres database. Further, someone had installed [Lua as a procedural language for Postgres](https://github.com/pllua/pllua), so some of the trigger functions would invoke a web request from the database to some other application server on the network.\n\nThat place was wild.",

So the second is kind of derived from the first.

The Web Audio API is surprisingly capable but React's rendering cycle can fight you hard when you need sample-accurate timing. Cool that you went with a backend exe approach though, that sidesteps a lot of the browser audio limitations. If you haven't already, look into AudioWorklet for the real-time processing parts since it runs on a separate thread and won't get blocked by UI updates.",

Can you cut them at 0? Can you snap to the time sig of the grid? Turn off snapping? Does it support a midi view? Where is the master? I already know this shit is going to suck without multithreading from web workers.   \n  \nLooks like a heavily unfinished POC. Where is the mixer? Where is the VSTs? Crazy how much work I put into my JavaScript DAW compared to this. I spent almost 4 months of my life on it before I showed anyone. Mine is multithreaded with web workers for VST effects it's gloriously performant. And it's all responsive design for all devices. I guess some people don't really use DAWs day to day, more of a toy to them. It's like someone saying they made photoshop but it's just basic paint and it has 1/16th of the features.\n\ncompile exe so it runs independently on the web? DAW doesn't work for pure clientside unless you provide no save state for the user or if that save state is based on files you have saved in the apps backend. The user can be prompted each time to upload samples but won't be able to save the map of those samples on their device due to CORS policy violation. That's why you need node/backend to write to files and search the users computer, allow the user to save the project with their own files on their system directories. You can already put this on the internet, learn how a backend works. If you want backend power you need a backend. That's how the internet works. An .exe implies an executable aka they install it locally to their device which isn't independently on the internet or how any of this works.\n\nI'm going to tell you right now you haven't even started to work on anything complicated in a \"daw' until you actually start building the daw out and have overlapping systems. Wait until you actually have a full song with dozens of tracks, several plugins for each track and buses/master and then run into differences in volumes during the serialization process where the math is all correct and LLMs don't have a clue what to do because the code technically isn't wrong. And is your ear trained enough to handle those hyper-small differences in audio to ensure things are actually working? I don't trust audio programs from people who aren't into audio. It's like trusting a vibe coder with security infrastructure. I already know things won't be to industry standards.",

I used an audio tuner to make sure the audio itself is accurate.\n\nThe DAW supports VSTs (VST3 specifically) as well as SF2s. I guess I should have made it more visible in UI, which I have edited since then, to include a full add instrument dialogue.\n\nWhat I meant by backend exe is basically a C++/JUCE backend which handles the audio playing and processing. None of that is done by the electron/node frontend. I assume we can compile that code so that node can run it directly using WASM?\n\nApart from that, currently it can handle multiple tracks and multiple VSTs instrument plugins, but I need to test the limit of my current code, as I have yet to add VST Effect plugin support.",

As far as i know most plugins i use are made in C++ and i think that's the industry standard so you would either have to find a way to compile them or create your own. Just because it's beginner friendly doesn't excuse capacity of producing a complete song, since a lot of successful artists made complete songs in GarageBand, some even blew up and signed major deals while doing that. \n\nObviously most people transition into other DAWs, majority to FL simply because the devs made the whole experience \"video game\" friendly. \n\nI guess what im saying is I'd suggest a different approach, a simple mixer would help a lot of content creators today and you could sell it for 5$/mo or something. At the end of the day, a good mix and sound selection is 90% recipe for a good song, might as well teach them basics of mixing",
