      "text": "The founder and my colleague enjoy vibe coding a lot (mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/s/0GX5LK2Uuf)), it's fast, it's \"good\"(according to them)\n\nSo when the first basic version of the project was ready to be deployed, it was handled by the other dev. Well guess what, the AI chose a perfect version number for next — 16.0.0. A week after the deployment, the server got hacked, and while they were shocked, I didn't even have to guess what the exploit could be.\n\nTheir response? The founder asked someone else outside the company for doing the \"architecture\" (a single EC2 instance). Thankfully it was still staging and only less important services were using production credentials. Now they're rotating keys for those services.\n\nThey found about the critical CVEs TODAY, even though I mentioned it a day later when the vulnerability was first reported. Hopefully they'll pay more attention to the other recent node and react vulnerabilities now. How do I tell them \"I told you so\" without actually telling them?? Again, I don't want to put anyone down, but this is just hilarious.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n- A lot of you seem to think this reddit thread is the communication channel in my company, and talking about this ridiculous, basic security failure is somehow demeaning to the people. No, it's not.\n- By vibe coding, I mean the lack of responsibility that comes with it. (I specifically mean *vibe coding* not *AI assisted coding*)\n- I'm not a senior dev, joined a month ago, on probation, struggling to meet my own deadlines. The issue was acknowledged when I raised it, a week after my joining, but it wasn't fixed. I don't have any access to the deployment pipeline.\n- I won't **actually** act smug in front of them, get some common sense. Let me rant in peace.\n \n I don't want to be explaining every little detail because it makes a giant page long post but some people here hallucinate worse than an LLM. Hold your horses, the post is partly ragebait, goodnight.",

      "text": "Would be curious to hear your thoughts both for and against! To be clear, I don't bear any inherent ill will towards Firefox/Mozilla.\n\nI've listened to many podcasts and read many blog posts that advocate for the survival of Firefox (and more specifically, Gecko). The arguments generally distill down to the same idea: \"We do not want to experience IE6 again\" and I agree with the sentiment, I do not want to go through that again.\n\nHowever, as someone who's been building websites since the days of \"best rendered in IE6\", I don't really feel like we're in the same place as back then. Not even close.\n\nIE6 wasn't just dominant by accident, it was far better than any alternatives until Firefox came along (and I was a very early adopter). It was also closed-source and was the default browser on the dominant OS at the time.\n\nToday, we have a variety of platforms (mobile, desktop, etc.) and all of the rendering engines are open-source. Anyone can create a new browser and anyone can influence the rendering engine through the source. There are also several large companies and individuals who are on the standards/recommendations bodies who govern how HTML/CSS/JS develop.\n\nThe current environment doesn't seem conducive to a monopoly even if Firefox and Gecko were to disappear. Conversely, web standard adoption may pick up as Safari and Chrome are often faster to deliver on new features (though kudos on Temporal, Firefox!).\n\nCurious everyone's thoughts. Is it just nostalgia/gratitude that's pushing people to support Firefox or is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: I should've titled this \"Is it bad for the web if Gecko dies?\" as that's the conversation I'm really after.",

Companies want to race so far ahead with features and paradigms that they own from top to bottom, before standardized interoperable protocols get stood up. This is why I think it's important to invest in the success of the activity pub protocol, and support efforts that build out competitors based on it. Loops is a tiktok alternative based on activity pub, which is fascinating and very encouraging.\n\nI also think this cast s an entirely different light on Mozilla's AI efforts. People forget and relearn this lesson over and over and over and over and over, but new paradigms come that you would never have anticipated, features that don't yet exist become the new baseline of normal that users expect. We don't know what is going to be yet, but you don't want to get caught flat-footed, and so investing in that now is important.

You had your vested players -- Internet Explorer -- the upstart challenger in Firefox, Apple with Safari for OSX, and then your minor players doing some interesting things (I Still remember when Opera was a browser that shipped with a dedicated ad bar and it was considered *a feature*).  But in 2004 it felt like IE would always dominate browser traffic, they had a 95%+ foothold, corporate/workplace lock in was complete, and it seemed impossible for any challenger to overtake them.  And then by 2012, IE was basically dead in the mindspace of browsers, and very few people saw mobile browsing as one of the mega trends that would unseat them.  I say maybe the exception of Apple because there is a very clear throughline to developing Safari for X, porting it to iPhone OS just a couple years later, that you figure that Apple was having those internal conversations about it.",

I don't think this is as catastrophic as it sounds, but it does put the web in the uncomfortable spot where standards that don't align with Google's business interest are unlikely to get any traction. Some years ago, Mozilla tried to push a non-advertising standard for monetizing websites (more or less micro-transactions instead of ads). There were some real issues with the proposal (do you also throw up a bit at \"micro-transactions\"?), but that kind of thing is (and will continue to be) essentially dead on arrival so long as implementations of new standards rely on Google. We're already living in The Bad Place - but outside of a few (real and non-trivial!) issues it's not so bad for most of us.\n\nThere's a couple niches that would feel it significantly worse than others. I work with graphics heavy apps that need to use WebGPU, Firefox maintains their Rust implementation (wgpu) and Google a C++ implementation (dawn). I think it's pretty unlikely to have this kind of diversity around reference implementations with only Google in the game, which I don't love looking forward.",

Gecko acts as a critical 'sanity check' for API design. Without it, we lose a primary independent validator. If Chromium becomes the only game in town (or just Chromium + a hardware-locked WebKit), Google’s implementation *becomes* the de facto standard. We’ve already seen this with things like Manifest V3 or certain ad-blocking changes where the ecosystem had to 'react' to Chromium’s decisions rather than shaping them collaboratively.\n\nYou mentioned that anyone can influence the rendering engine because it's open source, but the reality is that the **infrastructure required to maintain** a modern engine is massive. Forking Chromium (like Brave or Vivaldi) doesn't solve the monoculture problem because you're still running 99% Google-steered code. If a bug or a specific architectural decision exists in the core, it's in your fork too.\n\nGecko represents the last major engine not tied to a massive hardware ecosystem (Apple) or an advertising-driven business model (Google).

This was by design, they wanted *their* interpretation of the web to be the one everyone used because it would further fortify their dominance.

Once you depart the positions that appear in books, it starts making illegal moves and blundering relatively quickly, which makes sense from the POV of a model that’s generating a plausible next move, not necessarily a good or even legal one.\n\nIn any case, LLMs are not actually doing the things you listed, at best they’re generating code based on what it’s been trained on. When you say “it fixes bugs” I interpret it as you finding the bug, prompting to fix it, and the model spitting out something that looks like a fix, but may still be incorrect, all while telling you it’s all fixed now. After all, if it can actually investigate, find and fix the bug, why was it wrong in the first place? That’s what you’d expect from a human. When you prompt it to plan a system for you, it’s just generating what looks like a plan, but it may be off.\n\nForgive me if I don’t buy that your solo Claude operation generated such a sophisticated enterprise SaaS product when the current poster project for LLM code is a web browser where the heavy lifting is done by a couple of open source libraries, and it still cost a few millions, IIRC, in tokens and API calls.\n\nEDIT: I guess I missed a pretty obvious question. If the LLMs can actually do all that, why not just add \"make it bug-free and secure\" to the prompt, let it take a couple more hours crunching and have a working, near-bug-free and near-secure product? No need to answer that, the API call for any given prompt takes about the same amount of time as the API call including \"bug free and secure\", which means the model didn't actually do any extra work.",

What's the point of a library? Instead, developers used it as a tool and learned to be better programmers. Swaths of programmers came up this way instead of traditional schooling.\n\nI remember when I was in traditional school and we had to learn C# and ASP.NET for frontend. We could just drag and drop full form elements onto the page and students and teachers alike were like: \"This is the future, eventually programming will be obsolete and everything will be drag and drop. For now though, we still have to connect our logic to it.\" That was like, 15 years ago. Sure, the web has come a long way, and a lot of easy things we can just drag and drop now. Turns out that even the companies and their workers don't want to do this, though. They'd rather hire out a company to do this for them.\n\nNot to mention businesses that need unique functionality that makes sense to them and their business, but may not fit anywhere else. Your boss is not going to want to prompt this, implement it, refine it, and deploy it - I guarantee it. It's the reason they have workers below them to begin with: delegation.\n\nEven the most sophisticated AI isn't going to be able to build a fully functional app if it's not given a full, descriptive picture. AI is a tool just as IDEs are a tool, just as search engines are a tool, just as spell-check is a tool. Like all tools it needs to be understood to be used properly and efficiently.\n\nAnecdotally, I find AI responses to be faster almost 10 fold than trying to search the same thing. If I know of a function or method in a framework, but don't quite remember the name or arguments - AI is wayyy faster than searching the docs for the same thing. It's just computation power. 99% of the time when it comes to actual documented framework it's right too which is helpful to me in my projects.\n\nThere's no \"getting rid\" of AI. Being able to crunch a solid subset of knowledge and algorithmly access it quicker than a search API query is super useful in literally all fields. Major governments around the world are using and integrating some form of it. It's in the Open Source communities where it will be perpetuated by hobbyists and professionals alike. Corporations are pushing it and integrating it.\n\nI don't think AI will lead to full automation of all jobs, but there's certainly a subset. The biggest concerns we should have as a society regarding AI is regulation, energy consumption, and UBI. That's what we should be talking about and pushing for.",

I don't particularly have high aspirations as a career goal, but ive built a small build-in-the-open consulting company.\n\nThis fits into what I do perfectly. \n\nOpen-source software has very high ambitions, but struggles in manpower to challenge establishment companies short of massively successful products.\n\nA common tactic for legacy software companies is to offer smaller companies an on-ramp and then lock them down with vendor lock in. For example, Salesforce or Zoho might start as a simple contact manager, but before you know it, you're spending 5 figures a month. \n\nMigrations are hugely expensive and time consuming. A lot of small companies are running very old code bases as a result.\n\nThis let's me punch way, way above my paygrade.

Software, to me, has always been about software. I give away what I do. It was never about money. I do, of course, need to put food on the table.\n\nI don't think this is going to put me out of work.

However, for enterprising and industrious folks, you will see the total destruction of legacy software vendors and democratization of software and ideas. You'll see a lot better open-source software. You'll see a huge uptick in garbage.\n\nFor the developers who are able to review the code quickly, and understand the big picture, who open-source their software are going to absolutely decimate legacy software like Salesforce, Oracle, parts of Google.\n\nThe whole thing sucks for the industry, but its here.\n\nEdit: ok guys, a nuanced take?!

Most people who worked a nice office job who are suddenly out of work will rush to the trades, because those will be some of the few jobs left that aren't just minimum wage fast food worker and the like. What's going to happen to those jobs when before there were only 3 plumbers in a 100 mile radius, but now there are 30? Will their wages go up, down, or stay the same?\n\nThat's not even counting things like injuries, disabilities, or old age which make it difficult or impossible for some people to do certain physically demanding jobs. I've got back issues and knee issues. They're well-managed now but I'm fucked if I have to be on my feet or do intense physical labor all day, and I'm far from the only one with such issues. We've raised generations of kids with the idea that they should strive for some stable, high paying office job and some of them have paid the price for it physically. Who's going to be able to afford living at that rate? And we haven't even talked about the advances in robotics which could potentially one day make even things like the trades entirely obsolete.\n\nAnd if you're secretly hoping for something like UBI coming along to save your butt from such an outcome, then I hope you don't live in the US. There's nothing that half of this country hates more than the idea of the government paying people to live without doing any work. It's a non-starter for those people. They would sooner burn the country down than let something like that happen.\n\nThe economy simply cannot survive with so many billions of people all doing the same handful of jobs, at least it won't be any kind of survival that grants the average person any modicum of comfort or dignity.

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m working on a new web project and I’m trying to choose a payment processor. I can’t really use Stripe because of their content restrictions, so I’m looking for alternatives and would really appreciate some advice from people who’ve actually integrated these in production. There's similar website/competitors with already implemented payment systems, so it's doable, but the ones I saw do not use normal payment processors like Stripe or so (i guess for this reason of being blocked or going against ToS)\n\n**Context:**\n\n* It’s a web app / site where users can pay or subscribe, but they do not pay for any nsfw content, the nsfw content its just shown on the website.\n* It may be considered NSFW or “high risk”.\n* There will be erotic/sexualized imagery (girls/guys, suggestive/erotic), but no explicit genitals (it could have explicit genitals sometimes but that will be moderated to prevent happening, but could happen), and nothing illegal or extreme.\n* Think “spicy / softcore” but still potentially flagged as adult by most platforms.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* A payment processor that:\n   * Explicitly allows (or at least tolerates) NSFW / adult-adjacent content.\n   * Has a clear policy so I don’t get randomly banned later.\n   * Offers a usable API/SDK for typical web stacks (JS/Node, etc.).\n   * Can handle one-time payments to start, possibly subscriptions later.\n* Bonus points if:\n   * They support EU-based businesses (I have a bit of confusion here, my company is an LLC in USA but the customers in EU). So I need EU-based business payment processor I understand?\n   * Payouts and KYC aren’t a nightmare.\n   * Fees are reasonable and documentation is solid.\n\nI’m not asking for legal advice, just real-world dev experiences and recommendations so I don’t build the whole flow on something that will kill the account as soon as traffic picks up.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers",

          "text": "Ohh i know all about this subject! As i built the same thing over a year ago. (I tried building websites for OF models for them to accept payments) heres what i learned, if youre in the US theres really only 3 payment processors u can use, CCBILL, Epoch, and segpay. (Others are garbage) Ccbill is the best as they take the lowest cut and even give u a percentage of per transaction of sales (sell them on ur idea during phone meeting), heres the kicker, visa and mastercard have a combined $1450 per year fee for “high risk” merchants the payment processors ccbill etc pass this fee to you. So in order to get started and get the api keys that payment is due upfront. They also monitor and vet the website they have moderators that require u give them backdoor access to paywalled content at all times and will periodically check to make sure nothing illegal is being upload or sold. If you are building a platform then YOU have to sign KYB and KYC if youre building this for a creator THEY fill out KYC and u would tell them to pay the fee. You will not beable to get payment processing without doing this for any nsfw content (ive tried trust me). If u want the closest thing with no $1450 fee u need to look for “crypto on ramping” (users pay with credit card its swapped for crypto in background.) this is the most uncensored and frictionless route u can take, but they still need the same kyb and kyc forms but they dont require viewing ur content with moderators after approval. (this is the route i took). \n\n\n\nP.S. you have to have systems in place for CSAM and bots signing up to your platform. You need legal forms for your privacy policy, record keeping, DMCA takedown act, etc. for website that has adult content and if creators are making money you must verify they are 18. Mastercard, visa do this for you when a user pays with a credit card as the info of them and their age is tied to the credit card (if not kyc form pops up for user) But if u have creators on ur platform it’s on YOU to verify they are 18. Failure to do that can get u in big trouble. They will ask you how you store all this info, how you will protect against people possibly uploading illegal content they wont approve you on “i will moderate it” if you don’t have auto safe guards in place at upload u wont get approved.",

U verify creators upfront (18+), require records, and block uploads without them. Dont allow ppl to just sign up and start uploading verify them first. Anything that appears underage even if not don’t allow them on your platform. Its not worth the hassle and all sex nudity content must be put behind a NSFW wall if not a Paywall. Automate this process with ai tools or services at upload. Moderation at scale isn’t one person reviewing images. It’s automated detection plus human review. Cloudflare offers free CSAM detection, and services like “Sightengine” “hivemoderation” can detect CSAM and flag minors, NSFW content and auto categorize before content gets posted to your site at scale. Alot of more loose Platforms use “safe harbor” as their advantage and why you might see them operating while hosting grey area content or even pirated content but youll notice none of them have payment processing only pron ads. Paid platforms have higher obligations than free tube sites, which is why payment processors require age verification, audit trails, and moderation systems before approval. If a verified creator uploads illegal content, they’re liable. If you allow uploads without verification and records, you are. “I’ll moderate” doesn’t scale and doesn’t protect you.",

In adult, things are very different though, and you may be expected to forward a user into a hosted page to make a sale rather than embed payments directly in-page. \n\nI would generally suggest you go with an all-in-one hostedpage solution. You will likely be best served by CCBill, Epoch, or Verotel. Based on your post, if API integration is important, you will likely want to start with CCBill. \n\nIf modern API integration is really important to you, you will need a merchant account, and you will need to onboard with a gateway like RocketGate, PrimeOrange, Segpay, Bill1st, etc. \n\nThe fees are going to be higher than you are likely comfortable with. There will be upfront fees, and there will also be ongoing fees, as well as ongoing compliance requirements. You will absolutely need an industry friendly lawyer.",

And rest assured that if you allow people to upload their content, they will 100% do their best to circumvent the rules in any possible way. As I said before, porn (*as well as crypto and gambling*) attract very bad people. You're playing with fire here. What if Stripe accepts you for a while, and then you get blocked? What will be your backup plan, once the payment processor stops working? It will be painful.\n\n>I'm a bit confused on what Stripe considers or flags as not authorized content on their service.\n\nTheir [policy](https://stripe.com/en-br/legal/restricted-businesses) about porn is pretty clear, in my opinion:\n\n* Pornography **and other mature audience content** (including literature, **imagery**, and other media) designed for the purpose of sexual gratification\n\nWill your site be accessible by minors? If my 11 years old son visits it, is there any form of check/prevention? Will you ask your audience if they're 18+, before accessing the pages?\n\nAlso, you said in your description that\n\n>There will be erotic/sexualized imagery\n\nWhich 100% falls under the \"other mature audience content\". It may or may not be designed for sexual gratification, sure, but how can you prove that? I mean, nowhere on Pornhub you find any \"*welcome to our masturbation platform*\", right? We just know what it is. And we already know that people will not be uploading NSFW images to your website \"for science\". There will be a bunch of pervs / weirdos that will basically upload/watch your stuff for sexual pleasure. As simple as that.\n\n*P.s. Did you consult a lawyer who knows about this stuff? Because going from softcore NSFW to bad/violent/pedo porn is something that can happen, and will most likely happen if the website gains some traction.*",

These are often behind a paid subscription.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like these providers are scraping data they don’t own and reselling it. How is that not illegal? Why hasn’t RapidAPI been sued into oblivion?\n\nI’m confused because I’m often told not to build projects that use third-party site data due to copyright or ToS issues. What am I missing here? I had so many projects i had to scrap because of fear of legal implications.",

But apart from that, if AI were really allowing developers to much more quickly ship at-least-barely-working stuff -- much less allowing non-developers to, as the evangelists keep claiming -- shouldn't we have seen some sort of major acceleration in new products or product features in recent years? \n\nI had the idea of looking up App Store transparency reports, but they haven't done 2025 yet. Looking at [2023](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) to [2024](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2024-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) we see a ~12% increase in the rate of app submissions, but also a ~10% increase in the rate of rejections. This isn't a wide-ranging look at the data, but what we can see hardly sounds like an industry that's becoming crazily more productive, *even at shipping crap*.\n\nApart from statistics, shouldn't we be seeing an insane number of new videogame releases, or social networking sites, or Excel competitors, or just... anything? The only sort of software we're seeing hugely more of is AI being haphazardly bolted onto existing products.",

But when people say it makes coding faster, unless you're not bothering to review and understand it, then it can't be THAT MUCH faster. Not at fast lightning speeds. The AI can do what it does, good or bad, at lightning speeds, but not you. You yourself will always have a slow input and output speed at which you can review and understand all the code.\n\nGiven that any speed gained from this, if any, is it really worth the billions going into these data centres, the amount of power they are consuming, for those tiny gains?\n\nLet's not even get started on the dangerous level of information it provides. I am finding a lot of the time it just really doesn't understand things, even simple things.\n\nSeems crazy to me the amount that is needed for AI, and I for one do not see this as a revolution at all yet. Not even close. My life has not changed at all since AI. I genuinely can't say it has made me more productive in any way shape or form. Even when asking it to explain something, I am constantly having to search up the answers myself to confirm because it can get things wrong so much. So would you call that being more productive? Considering before AI I would just search up the damn answer anyway. Now it seems I have this extra baggage of having to ask it something first and then end up doing the research myself.\n\nAt best, AI is just useful to talk to. If you are bored and want to entertain yourself, it's ok I guess. But for using it for anything that requires attention to detail? I think everyone has massively misjudged what these things are currently capable of doing.",

This way, near tech monopolies with billions of users can still be seen as growing.\n\nRegarding AI specifically, the claim is that it will be able to replace all those expensive workers and increase productivity, at a fraction of the cost. The incentives are aligned to make software engineers into people who just review AI code all day, and take the heat whenever something goes wrong.\n\nHowever, the current AI setup is extremely expensive and propped up almost entirely by investors, with no foreseeable path to make enough revenue to cover their absurd expenses.\n\nFor the near future, I predict it will continue to be an excuse to fire employees in economic downturns, while still keeping shareholders under the illusion that things are great. It will push the engineers with jobs to churn out slop and be responsible when AI breaks everything.

Waking up in the morning and having a virtual project manager plan out my priorities etc. It's been an absolute joy to work with to be honest.\n\nAnd actually as a code developer I've had a lot of good stuff. It helped me do a very painful migration from a legacy system to a bespoke one that I simply would never have done without it's help.\n\nLike all tools it's really about how you use it.

Keep your DNS separate from your web host for better control and resilience.\n\nI'm posting this as a cautionary tale for anyone trusting \"set it and forget it.\" Especially for anyone using Netlify.\n\nI have a small side project (hundreds of unique visitors/month). The app is deployed on Netlify and the domain is registered through Netlify (via Name.com). Auto-renew was enabled for the domain name. **Netlify even emailed me in December saying everything was set and no action was required.**\n\nThen a few days ago the site was unreachable.\n\nNo recent deployments, no DNS changes. Wtf?\n\nThe domain started returning NXDOMAIN everywhere.\n\nI saw the domain was \"auto-renewing\" in Netlify and the DNS changes were \"propagating\". I think, ok maybe there will be some brief downtime -- not something I've experienced with a domain renewal before but maybe not outside the realm of possibility?\n\nThen a day goes by...so I submit a support ticket on Netlify. Nothing.\n\nAnother ticket...Nothing.\n\nDM Netlify on X. Nothing.\n\nI contact Name.com and they say they can't do anything, only Netlify can remove the hold.\n\nFile a 3rd ticket with Netlify, still nothing.\n\nFinally I posted on X and tagged Netlify. Then they intervene (bless the Netlify social media manager).\n\nOnce it was escalated, the fix was literally \"renew domain/clear hold\" but until then, there was nothing I could do.\n\nTotal downtime was almost 3 days. Obviously this isn't a big deal for a little app like mine, but it might have been a big deal for some of you.\n\nThe root cause ended up being a domain renewal edge case:\n\n* auto-renew didn't prevent expiration\n* domain was placed on clientHold at the registry\n* Netlify's UI wouldn't allow me to disable auto-renew (and therefore renew manually)\n* multiple support requests got **no acknowledgment at all (still haven't received anything communication from Netlify)**\n* the issue was only fixed after I publicly tagged Netlify on X\n\n**Takeaways for anyone shipping side projects:**\n\n* domains are production infrastructure\n* auto-renew is not a guarantee!\n* coupling registrar with DNS and hosting is a **single point of failure**\n* monitor WHOIS/NXDOMAIN when renewal is coming up\n\nAlso, I **still** haven't heard back from anyone at Netlify as to why this happened. I think the form on their support page is likely broken. Also their AI support bot is completely useless.\n\n/rant",

I opened up ChatGPT, explained the purpose and expected behavior as best I can, gave it the code for the original and the refactor, and showed it some sample usage and output.\n\nBefore it even had a chance to make a mistake with the technical detail, it gave me;\n\n```ts\n// for reference, `EnterExitPair` here only contains `enter` and `exit`, nothing more\nfunction someTestHelper(\n  traversalFn: TraversalFnType,\n  root: NodeType,\n  cases: EnterExitPair,\n) {\n  const result = traversalFn(root, {\n    ...cases,\n    enter: (node) => /*some tracking stuff*/,\n    exit: (node) => /*some more tracking stuff*/,\n  })\n}\n```\nEffectively guaranteeing that any non-trivial use of `someTestHelper` causes the test to fail because the provided cases will never run.\n\nIt's not like I didn't give it enough information or anything, this is just basic ES6 objects.\n\nThere are people out there building entire apps with this stuff. How on earth do they deal with these beginner mistakes littered throughout their code? Especially the non-developers who use LLMs for programming. Is the development cycle just \"ask for refactors until it works\"?\n\nAnyways, it just reminded me why I don't let LLMs write code.",

I think it’s also important to understand that you are the senior mentoring eng when interacting with llm coding, you are not just saying “here’s some code we have, here’s what we want the output to be” you are also saying “and here’s how to get there” similar to psuedo-code. Some tasks are worth the llm and some are just less time and effort to do yourself without the assistance. But it’s an assistant, not an engineer.",

Therefore, you need to use those tools and such reinforcement-learned models. Also, tasks need to be specifically defined. You need to provide instructions with a highly rigid prompt, much like giving a task to a junior developer. However, note that this is \"how to make an LLM output working code,\" not \"how to make it output excellent code.\" This is because the reinforcement learning primarily considers \"can it write code that solves the task?\" and not \"what is the quality of the code?\" Furthermore, LLMs don't have the ability to \"think.\" This is a theoretical limitation. Therefore, it's better not to give them tasks that require thinking. In the case of difficult tasks like your example, we need to handle the \"thinking\" ourselves and only entrust the subsequent \"work\" to the LLM.",

Using LLMs like that early Copilot as an \"Assistant\" was truly their most appropriate application. But for product marketing, the current \"agent\" or \"automate everything\" approach probably gets a better reaction, unfortunately.\n\nMany people here mention agent tools, and while they certainly write code that solves problems, it's far from excellent code. And unlike the early inline suggestion Copilot, they often edit many lines at once, making the task of reviewing and fixing all of them even more painful. However, it's important to note that this perspective varies from person to person. While we might find such code intrusive, beginners might feel that having \"base code\" makes their work easier.

              "text": "Complex frontend always kind of sucks for these tools, as there's a lot of interactions that need to happen to get to a point where you can test, and then there's layout that LLMs can't verify very well. Giving the agent access to tools to lint and check browser console helps a bit but it won't be perfect. I have found this domain to be some of the hardest to get success with.\n\nHave you considered being very explicit with your context guidance, pointing the agent at what to take inspiration from? e.g. \"Read ./pages/users/admin.ts then create ./pages/articles/admin.ts that provides similar admin management but for pages, using the pages/ endpoint from ./openapi.json. See ./widgets for available frontend widgets\"? this avoids the agent getting stuck on a complex codebase that wastes context size, and helps it stay 'in line's with your codebase and standards. Might not even need large context docs (AGENTS.MD) if the code you point to clearly uses a well-known framework that the underlying LLM is expected to have been trained on.\n\nMaking the agentic problem into a \"do more like this but with new constraints XYZ\" type of problem seems to generalize well, in my experience, even for complex never-before-seen code and tasks (integrating a new JavaScript engine from Fabrice Bellard into a custom private game engine), as long as those tasks are based on a foundation that relies in 'knowledge' (C, JavaScript) that underlying LLMs are trained on.",

Give it an outline, references, etc so it can constantly correct itself. Most likely you use a combo of both. If you're concerned about privacy...most aren't and it is what it is, unfortunately. People tend to run agents on their local machine because it's more effective. The other recommendation is commiting to source control when the AI does well, because the next change could screw up so I am committing much more often even though the commits are less about a coherent unit of work, and more about checkpoints for each baby step or iteration.

Today anyway.\n\nI don't pay for a single one, so it's all with the free tier. I hit the Gemini3 limit, but decided to call it a day before I hit the flash preview limit.\n\nThere was still a fair bit of manual coding/editing.

But to get to where I wanted to be today, it was faster than me doing it manually. And the code was well commented (which I asked for), so I was able to go in and really follow what was/is going on.\n\nThe only reason I went Claude (browser) > GeminiCLI was the free aspect. I was going to throw some dollars at ClaudeCode, but recently I've seen a lot of unhappy usage-related complaints and odd happenings. I also don't want to become too reliant on either platform.

Basically it only works when the only thing that is stopping you from quickly writing it yourself is having memorized the various API's of the packages you use. You have to know the high level concepts, what it should look like, what it should be doing and what it shouldn't be doing. Additionally there's a cost both literally in money and in missed experience. I've more or less decided to specialize in frontend development so I'm not super pressed about learning backend which is good because I don't learn shit using LLM's to generate code which makes sense but is worth calling out because of how often I've seen Jr. devs use AI/how often I see people recommend that they do.

Same patterns, same folder structures, same generic variable names, same suspiciously clean README files that explain nothing useful.\n\nSo over the past few weeks I built a tool that attempts to detect vibecoded/AI-generated boilerplate projects. Here's how it works:\n\nData Collection\n\n* Scrapes post content, comments, and any linked GitHub repos or deployed URLs from this sub\n* For GitHub links, it pulls the full file tree, commit history, and README\n* For deployed apps, it crawls the public-facing pages and extracts any exposed source maps\n\nAnalysis Pipeline\n\n1. Structural fingerprinting - Compares project structure against known AI scaffold patterns (create-react-app + shadcn + prisma is basically a red flag at this point)\n2. Commit entropy analysis - Real projects have messy commit histories. AI projects have like 3 commits: \"initial commit\", \"add features\", \"fix bug\"\n3. Semantic density scoring - Checks if variable/function names are suspiciously \"clean\" and self-documenting in a way humans never actually write\n4. README-to-code ratio - If your README is longer than your actual codebase, we have questions\n5. Comment pattern detection - Looking for that signature ChatGPT \"Here's what this does:\" style\n\nAnyway, I ran it against the last 6 months of this sub. Results are live:\n\n[https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/](https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/)",
