Spend some time setting it up, deal with a few hurdles and ongoing maintenance, and you get extremely cheap operations with almost no cost difference between normal traffic and traffic spikes.\n\nRight now you are paying for your own limitations. That is the tradeoff. You have to weigh the pros and cons. From the outside, it looks like you are hitting the tipping point where managed serverless stops making sense.\n\nIf you are locked into the stack, getting back on your own feet will be painful. But that is the price of an easy start.\n\nYou just blocked one fair bot with robots.txt, but there are millions of unfair bots crawling the web that will slowly and surely drain your wallet. I did my own traffic analysis and found that more than 95% of all traffic on my sites is bots (so take your stats with grain of salt too). Half of them advertise themselves openly, and the rest are cleverly hidden. Official analytics tools report completely different numbers because they simply cannot detect most bot traffic. When I look at them, it feels like huge crowds are visiting my site, but the reality is very different. I had to analyze logs manually, and the true numbers shocked me.\n\nThe good news is I am fully self-sufficient, so I do not care if bots crawl my sites. I actually welcome it because it costs me nothing. It just uses otherwise idle resources on my servers that I would be paying for anyway.\n\nPractical advice: if you want to run your service long-term at low cost, use your own servers. I use Hetzner - this is not an ad, just my experience - and there are many competitors that are equally good or better, so do your research. Meanwhile, put your site behind Cloudflare free tier and enable their anti-bot protection. As someone who scrapes frequently, Cloudflare can be difficult to trick so I can recommend you this service to tame your bot problem and save costs.",

This significantly increased both processing costs and scraping time.\n\nSo yes, when I said it is \"difficult to trick,\" I didn’t mean impossible. It just makes low-effort, fast, and cheap approaches less practical, which is enough to achieve effective bot protection for the purposes of the OP.\n\nBut I agree, if you really care about every bot, for example if your site provides valuable data or your data points are rare and worth the scrapper's extra effort, then Cloudflare alone will not be enough - contrary it will stand in your way as it creates extra layer between you and bot that makes your traps more difficult to implement. In that case, a dedicated service or more advanced anti-bot solution makes sense. Scrapers have become extremely sophisticated. Cloudflare can block the script kiddies and average scrapers, but there is still a significant number of skilled operators who will find ways around basic protections, and those are the ones you need to plan for.\n\nBut in this case OP is worried about mass traffic - common scrappers so my advice stands.",

Seeing how the dynamic data on these pages should be fairly static you could use a fairly long cache or chose to keep it there until invalidated by busting the cache when that set of specific data is updated.\n\nThat’s 30k urls you can cache and any request made to a url that is not valid should not trigger a function. The fact these bots could trigger 29M requests from urls that are already generated tells me its very likely your app is just sensing a request to the function to see if there is something there with the query parameters given, rather than actually validating if the requested parameters are even valid.\n\nIf thats not the case you’re serving up those 30k urls fresh each and every single time which means your caching strategy is insufficient.\n\nIf your other end points are serving up any response that comes from a cloud function even when the url has no business in existing then you need much better validation logic.",

Set aggressive limits for known crawlers.\n\n**Crawler-specific caching headers** - Return `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` for requests from known bot user agents. Many well-behaved crawlers honor these.\n\n**Static pre-rendering for bot traffic** - Detect crawler UA in middleware, serve a static/cached version. Your dynamic SSR is wasted on scrapers anyway.\n\n**Challenge suspicious traffic** - JS challenges filter out crawlers that can't execute JavaScript (most of them).\n\nThe real issue is that serverless pricing assumes human traffic patterns. Crawler traffic is fundamentally different - high volume, low value, no sessions. The defaults punish you for being indexable.\n\nFor ISR specifically: the revalidate period only helps if the *same URL* is hit multiple times within the window. Crawlers hitting unique listing slugs bypass ISR entirely since each URL is a cache miss.\n\nConsider generating a sitemap with your actual important pages and blocking crawlers from deep pagination.

Now I see some of my core ideas being used in slop around the web (including reddit).\n\nI've even seen this in the context of a reddit thread, where bots will reuse other people's comments from the same thread. If you post a link, they'll read the link and use the contents of the link in their reply.\n\nIn the case of software, there's so much slop being generated that even if you solve something in the most amazing way, almost nobody will know, because a billion other people are already trying to make money off of built-this-with-ai code they don't even understand, which claims to solve the same issue you're solving. Why should anyone listen to you specifically?\n\nOn top of that many companies run massive astro-turfing campaigns which prey on our proclivity to trust others.\n\nIt gets worse...\n\nEvery company out there is trying to capture as much search engine traffic as possible, so they're churning out articles on all topics, and many of them have very high domain authority, so they will bury any indie developer that does actual writing and research. His stuff will be on page 100.\n\nThose new to the game do the same thing, so they can get some visibility.\n\nAll of this is littering the web with second-hand information that is often altered to serve the agenda of the new publisher, and even if once in a while we get an article that aggregates all the right information, they're a net negative and a burden on everyone. The worst thing is that it demotivates anyone who might want to share some original thoughts.\n\nHow do we get out of this? I've been thinking about it for quite some time now and short of drawing blood every time you want to go online, I don't know what would work.\n\nIs this the end of the information era?",

It must be a distributed, decentralized source of identity that can remain anonymous yet still be proven to resolve to a real person, like a zero knowledge proof of identity. \n\nAnd there must be some method to unveil the actual identity when necessary, so that people can share controversial, embarrassing, or otherwise revealing information with limited risk, but resolution of human identity is prevented without either just cause or the individual volunteering the data. \n\nLike a Byzantine Generals problem, if enough people agree that anonymity must be resolved to a real person, there needs to be a method for that. Like a digital form of a court ruling. \n\nI propose a new approach where the production of currency is tied to a verified distinct living person (\"proof of life\"), and all interactions are monetized against the proof-of-life derived currency. All new currency production is distributed across the register of known real living persons. \n\nNot \"monetized\" in the sense that they are oppressively costly and some intermediary is making some incredible profit by gating access, but \"monetized\" in the sense that running a horde of bots is prohibitively expensive, while acting as a unique real person has a real but valid and manageable cost attached that can be paid against the distributed currency. \n\nThis answer leaves out more than it explains, but it's the only one I've come up with that seems capable of actively preventing bot hordes, supporting real humans, without preventing real humans to use bots/automation in a rational and productive manner. \n\nI could go on at length but this answer is, in my experience, more than sufficient for vast numbers of people to immediately hate me, so I'll stop here unless someone requests detail.",

I feel like we need some time-blocked, closed spaces for people to opt into a shared activity or project, get together, do something awesome, share, and hangout.\n\nI attended a weekend long game jam where the final couple hours was all of us spinning up our games on our machines and walking around playing each others. You got all the perks of being IRL; seeing other people’s work, talking about it, getting ideas, and just nerding out and having a good time.\n\nSimilarly, I attended a workshop where we all built our own little synthesizers out of scrap parts. The host sort of did all the prep for us and we just dug in there and built it but there was still plenty of room for creativity. Our cohort was great and I learned a ton. If I had done the “self teach on YouTube” route enough times to know I would’ve burnt myself out fast on this one.\n\nBoth of these were IRL and that was a big component of why they were so satisfying, but there’s gotta be a way to bring that community back to the internet. Discords are nice but having the intentional “we’re all here within this specific window of time to do this specific thing” is actually really nice.",

The new challenge, then, is not to pull in information fast, it's to figure out which parts of that information are actually useful, i.e., digging up the valuable stuff from a heap of dogshit.\n\nThat's what the \"information era\" is like. The pioneers of the information age envisioned that just being able to exchange information fast and efficiently would solve all problems, and it kind of did, but they did not anticipate the consequences of being able to send arbitrary amounts of arbitrary information out into the world at practically no cost.",

Well guess what, the AI chose a perfect version number for next — 16.0.0. A week after the deployment, the server got hacked, and while they were shocked, I didn't even have to guess what the exploit could be.\n\nTheir response? The founder asked someone else outside the company for doing the \"architecture\" (a single EC2 instance). Thankfully it was still staging and only less important services were using production credentials. Now they're rotating keys for those services.\n\nThey found about the critical CVEs TODAY, even though I mentioned it a day later when the vulnerability was first reported. Hopefully they'll pay more attention to the other recent node and react vulnerabilities now. How do I tell them \"I told you so\" without actually telling them?? Again, I don't want to put anyone down, but this is just hilarious.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n- A lot of you seem to think this reddit thread is the communication channel in my company, and talking about this ridiculous, basic security failure is somehow demeaning to the people. No, it's not.\n- By vibe coding, I mean the lack of responsibility that comes with it. (I specifically mean *vibe coding* not *AI assisted coding*)\n- I'm not a senior dev, joined a month ago, on probation, struggling to meet my own deadlines. The issue was acknowledged when I raised it, a week after my joining, but it wasn't fixed. I don't have any access to the deployment pipeline.\n- I won't **actually** act smug in front of them, get some common sense. Let me rant in peace.\n \n I don't want to be explaining every little detail because it makes a giant page long post but some people here hallucinate worse than an LLM.

It sucks because I used to really love creating UI’s and products but now I just ask AI to do it and make sure the code it outputs makes sense.\n\nI’m lucky that I have a job at a startup but I still feel anxiety every day that soon I may no longer be of value.

In 2016 these things were still years from entering public awareness, couldn't even attempt to generate an image or walk outside a lab.\n\nIf that rate of progress is typical of what we can expect going forward then its going to improve in abilities in the same way computers did from the 80s until about the 2010s. What now requires a data centre will become the kind of chip that is causally thrown into any device thats far beyond the abilities of any modern model by 2040, 2050.\n\nWhile I don't think jobs are under immediate direct threat, I also don't think the technology needs to improve impossibly far to get into that situation. If you can show it an arbitrary role and just expect high quality reliable results, what is left for Human employment? \n\nEvery existing team can be reduced to a single human lead being actively and intelligently prompted through their high level requirements and reading reports. Even accounting for massive expansion of activity I would still expect Human employment to fall far below 50%, maybe even 20% - its a generic solution that seems to apply everywhere once the models improve and to any activity you come up with keep people employed.",

Biological devs increasingly acting like tech leads to digital devs. Understanding requirements; interacting with project managers/stakeholders; going to meetings; writing prompts; testing; code reviews; feedback; the occasional manual intervention. And it might take AI a decade to reach the next phase after that. Which I imagine to be completely autonomously and reliably working to specifications with no code review necessary. \n\nIf that happens, then the best path for devs gets a bit murky. I think a sideways move towards analysing business problems and specifying solutions might be one way... for a bit. In 10 years AI might be able to autonomously meet with people, read documents, observe a workplace and fully handle that by then. A full robo business analyst digital director. That can identify the entire gamut of a business and by itself manage construction of all the systems required to support it. Which would pretty much make digital agencies obsolete.\n\nBut when you extrapolate that idea, if you can get to that point exactly how many of the rest of the employees in companies are required?

Basically, he has a whole bunch of MCPs including our ticketing software, Shortcut, and our design platform, Figma. And for small bugs, it can just be told, implement Shortcut ticket 12345, and it will go.\n\n  \nThankfully, he's been trying some more difficult challenges for it, and it's tanking them pretty badly. For better or for worse, our app is too complex for it to do 95% of our work. But it is scary to see it bang out a little bug on its own. I'm afraid too. I don't have a backup. I might lean more into design/UX, as the human element is still more valuable there IMO.\n\n  \nIt's just especially crazy to me that when I graduated almost a decade ago, there could not be enough people to fill all the jobs. There was so much demand, and I never once dreamed we'd be afraid of never having opportunities available.",

At one point the code does a “parallel” query on an array and spits out how fast it was compared to a linear search. However, the number it reports is simply the number of queries times 2000, and it claims that’s how much faster it was. Very wrong. \n\nDon’t get me wrong it’s a great autocomplete when it’s not in my way and good for simple projects where I just want a UI over a simple CRUD app on a single object. Nothing too difficult. But then if I want to OCR documents locally and import them to the application, I need to step in because the bot didn’t get it right at all despite a lot of guidance from me.",

One that has game changing implications for certain tasks, and, if used effectively, can dramatically increase your performance for those tasks. \n\nBut “using it effectively” is key, and that’s where the misunderstanding often comes in. For effective use, this means learning effective patterns and prompts, getting your own pace and review cadence right, and who knows what else eventually - it’s a learned skill. It’s a learned skill ON TOP OF the existing skills, sure you’re writing less code, but to use it effectively you need to read and understand the same amount of (or even more) code as before.\n\nFor some low hanging fruit it can do a pretty good job with minimal intervention, but for most real design/engineering/analysis tasks you really need all those foundational skills _and_ the practice at using AI to complement your conventional skills.\n\nSo I think there’s a very real threat to juniors employment, because it’s hard to justify another salary on basic grindy tasks that we can ask AI to do, but I do think most established software guys will actually be _more_ valuable if you learn the new tools effectively.

I've been in projects where using AI accelerated the project, and projects where AI actually slowed down the development time and we had to fix and clean up so much garbage code. Long slow paths are sometimes the way to go to make sure the code is well written, and you can use AI to assist of course. I'm not anti-AI, I use it too.\n\nAs I said, it's just a tool at the end of day. If you write a prompt, press Enter, check the end result and call it a day, then you are in for big surprises.

If you can’t articulate why you’re valuable beyond code generation, then yeah, your anxiety is justified. Product sense, architecture decisions, and stakeholder management are harder to automate than implementation.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is some frontend roles will disappear, especially junior positions focused on translating designs to code. Your survival depends on moving up the value chain into product thinking, technical leadership, or specializations AI struggles with like performance optimization or accessibility.

And yet, I could not help to notice that the work they produced felt very formulaic and predictable. Every time period had their \"it\" theme that everyone imitated. I made a few not very good ones myself as well.\n\nPerhaps, an average UI designer doesn't really know enough about his profession to be AI-proof. Saying you only do UI design feels very narrow. How can one make good UI, if they don't consider UX and conversion performance feedback from actually deployed and maintained products? How many designers actually think about the purpose of the design of their product? It is to satisfy the customer and to make a sale, a conversion, whatever the person hiring you expected. How many of you take enough time to even understand the product and company you are making a design for? Not many, hence the AI scare.\n\nOften these tasks are not covered by the same person and the UI-only person is kind of flying in the dark. What most of you do is you go to dribbble and then rip off one or parts of several existing popular themes and adapt it slightly to the branding and niche of your customer. And that is most certainly something even an average AI can do.\n\nThe more analytical and the less generic copy paste UI patterns your work flow is, the more AI-proof you'll be. Quoting me 5k for a theme that exactly looks like 50 others on dribble is simply not gonna fly anymore. If AI actually gets good at most tasks one day, well then it will all be a race to the bottom and it will completely reshuffle who ends up with the fruits of the labor. But right now, there is no reason to believe that AI will ever get there.",

AI is here, it’s powerful, and it’s going to stick around whether we like it or not. \n\nOne thing I try to remind myself of to prevent me from doom spiraling is that while yes, our jobs are changing, there’s still a large part of being an engineer/developer that isn’t writing code. Claude is an incredible tool for codegen, and there’s not arguing that. The primitives of development are no longer typing syntax into an editor, it’s now describing expected outcomes to an LLM. \n\nI see this as a positive, as I get a lot of my energy back that would be spent on keystrokes of syntactical sugar trivia of a language. I get to solutions faster, and get to focus more on the design and architecture of a problem I’m trying solve rather than spending an hour perfecting a piece of code. I know what I want the code to feel like when I’m working in it, and now we have a fast pass to get there, though with a bit of hand holding.\n\nAnd also, never forget that LLMs don’t own outcomes. As the engineer in the room, you do. So when shit inevitably hits the fan in production, a critical business system starts throwing a fit, or you have to shoehorn in some contractually obligated feature into an ancient legacy application that still runs the business, that’s going to be on us developers. There’s always going to need to be an adult in the room (for now), and that’s where I see the dev role shifting. Wielders of AI to make computers do things faster than before.",

If I use AI to build something cool.. a product that is software, ideally a tool used by other developers/etc, but they are all disappearing.. how exactly am I going to get my own product sold? I asked AI this question.. and the answer was that AI would consume my product.. e.g. a GUI app somehow AI will become the \"user\" consuming the GUI. Clearly it would be API and not GUI.. and I hope that my GUI app will remain relevant for a few more years for end users to use.. but if AI is really replacing a lot of the \"customers\" that my app would be used by.. then that means my app is no longer relevant even though there is almost nothing like it now anyway. \n\nSo.. do APIs become the primary way apps are built in the near future.. so AI can consume them? I mean.. YES.. I know it is to some degree.. but I do wonder if the majority of us that use software products.. like HR apps, desktop apps of various types, etc.. as we disappear from the work force, will things shift to mostly APIs that AI uses and the desktop/web app disappears? \n\nAm I wasting my time with about a year or so out for my product launch (trying to get there sooner of course).. unsure if AI will advance THAT fast that the majority of those that would use my product for many years to come will lose jobs too and make my offering irrelevant?",

That work still matters. But it’s very different from the traditional end-to-end projects we used to get.\n\nIt makes me wonder if the era of full-scope development projects is shrinking, at least for small and mid-sized agencies. Clients seem to want speed first and correctness later, and agencies are brought in once things start breaking.\n\nI am a 100% sure that development work isn't going away, but I definitely need to shift and change with it to keep my business running.\n\nFor those running agencies or working in senior roles: how are you adapting?

          "text": "I liked this take on it by Addi Osmani and Aaron Levie on Twitter/X:\n\nEvery time we've made it easier to write software, we've ended up writing exponentially more of it.\n\nWhen high-level languages replaced assembly, programmers didn't write less code - they wrote orders of magnitude more, tackling problems that would have been economically impossible before. When frameworks abstracted away the plumbing, we didn't reduce our output - we built more ambitious applications. When cloud platforms eliminated infrastructure management, we didn't scale back - we spun up services for use cases that never would have justified a server room.\n\nLevie recently articulated why this pattern is about to repeat itself at a scale we haven't seen before, using Jevons Paradox as the frame. The argument resonates because it's playing out in real-time in our developer tools. The initial question everyone asks is \"will this replace developers?\" but just watch what actually happens. Teams that adopt these tools don't always shrink their engineering headcount - they expand their product surface area. The three-person startup that could only maintain one product now maintains four. The enterprise team that could only experiment with two approaches now tries seven.\n\nThe constraint being removed isn't competence but it's the activation energy required to start something new. Think about that internal tool you've been putting off because \"it would take someone two weeks and we can't spare anyone\"? Now it takes three hours. That refactoring you've been deferring because the risk/reward math didn't work? The math just changed.\n\nThis matters because software engineers are uniquely positioned to understand what's coming. We've seen this movie before, just in smaller domains. Every abstraction layer - from assembly to C to Python to frameworks to low-code - followed the same pattern. Each one was supposed to mean we'd need fewer developers. Each one instead enabled us to build more software.\n\nHere's the part that deserves more attention imo: the barrier being lowered isn't just about writing code faster. It's about the types of problems that become economically viable to solve with software. Think about all the internal tools that don't exist at your company. Not because no one thought of them, but because the ROI calculation never cleared the bar. The custom dashboard that would make one team 10% more efficient but would take a week to build. The data pipeline that would unlock insights but requires specialized knowledge. The integration that would smooth a workflow but touches three different systems.\n\nThese aren't failing the cost-benefit analysis because the benefit is low - they're failing because the cost is high. Lower that cost by \"10x\", and suddenly you have an explosion of viable projects. This is exactly what's happening with AI-assisted development, and it's going to be more dramatic than previous transitions because we're making previously \"impossible\" work possible.\n\nThe second-order effects get really interesting when you consider that every new tool creates demand for more tools. When we made it easier to build web applications, we didn't just get more web applications - we got an entire ecosystem of monitoring tools, deployment platforms, debugging tools, and testing frameworks. Each of these spawned their own ecosystems. The compounding effect is nonlinear.\n\n... had to split into two posts ->",

              "text": "Now apply this logic to every domain where we're lowering the barrier to entry. Every new capability unlocked creates demand for supporting capabilities. Every workflow that becomes tractable creates demand for adjacent workflows. The surface area of what's economically viable expands in all directions.\n\nFor engineers specifically, this changes the calculus of what we choose to work on. Right now, we're trained to be incredibly selective about what we build because our time is the scarce resource. But when the cost of building drops dramatically, the limiting factor becomes imagination, \"taste\" and judgment, not implementation capacity. The skill shifts from \"what can I build given my constraints?\" to \"what should we build given that constraints have in some ways been evaporated?\"\n\nThe meta-point here is that we keep making the same prediction error. Every time we make something more efficient, we predict it will mean less of that thing. But efficiency improvements don't reduce demand - they reveal latent demand that was previously uneconomic to address. Coal. Computing. Cloud infrastructure. And now, knowledge work.\n\nThe pattern is so consistent that the burden of proof should shift. Instead of asking \"will AI agents reduce the need for human knowledge workers?\" we should be asking \"what orders of magnitude increase in knowledge work output are we about to see?\"\n\nFor software engineers it's the same transition we've navigated successfully several times already. The developers who thrived weren't the ones who resisted higher-level abstractions; they were the ones who used those abstractions to build more ambitious systems. The same logic applies now, just at a larger scale.\n\nThe real question is whether we're prepared for a world where the bottleneck shifts from \"can we build this?\" to \"should we build this?\" That's a fundamentally different problem space, and it requires fundamentally different skills.\n\nWe're about to find out what happens when the cost of knowledge work drops by an order of magnitude. History suggests we (perhaps) won't do less work - we'll discover we've been massively under-investing in knowledge work because it was too expensive to do all the things that were actually worth doing.\n\nThe paradox isn't that efficiency creates abundance. The paradox is that we keep being surprised by it.\n\n[https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544](https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544)",

And was in contact with a startup founder. in his team there was another developer who does coding but is addicted to vibe coding using loveable. since he (founder) was in college and I needed some experience for my resume that's why I joined him. I made him a rough design for his landing page using photoshop, and he set the deadline to January end. \n\nLater on in a online meeting  he asked me to share the design to vibe coding dev. He put that into loveable and the it made him the website. I did not have any problem at this stage cause it was increasing the productivity. He checked the inbuilt browser light house for rating and it was showing it as 99 optimised site. But while  meeting was going on he straight up uploaded the code without even checking it to server. When i checked the code it was a mess. \n\nAI did not followed basic semantics of html code, it put everything inside of the divs. when I asked the founder he said its the dev department responsibility to fix this code. So as I made progress code start breaking. I said to him that i could have created the same website with in less time compared to time it is taking to fix the code. Which lead to dispute that i can't accept the AI so I had to leave his startup. And as of now he is still using the same ai generated code on his website.",

AI allows you to generate at scale which is great because it gives you more to work from and ideate off of, but most people don't actually utilize the best thing about AI: scale. Instead of trying to one shot a homepage concept, create 30 homepage concepts, then refine ruthlessly.

Just like photographers moved from film to digital.\n\nThe real issue will arise if (when?) our clients will build their websites 100% on their own, from home or during the spare time. This is nothing new, though, they could do it already with *Squarespace*, *Wix* and so on. Automated and \"one-click\" tools exist since the early 2000's but companies still prefer agencies and freelancers.\n\nWhat the AI is drastically changing is the overall perception of difficulty and time investment. 10 years ago a simple landing page could be sold for a lot of money. Nowadays you can build it with Claude in seconds (kind of). So, in a way, AI will be \"downgrading\" our work by making it look a lot easier and faster (which is not that wrong, in this case).\n\nAI is fantastic for mundane and boring tasks, as well as code snippets and repetitive actions. But if you're not into development/coding, rest assured you're not going to have an easy life if you want to build a new website/app. And companies/owners don't have time to invest into \"coding an app\" in their spare time. That's never going to happen (*in 27+ years I've never met a single client who was on Wix or another one-click thing before hiring me*).\n\nFinal note: AI makes us more productive (true) but it also devalues our time. Years ago you had 1 client who gave you 1K/month to do 10 things. Now the same client will be asking 50 things in the same amount of time, for the same amount of money, \"*because AI\"*. But truth to be told, the AI is really, really, really good for development and mundane tasks.",

You could take your knowledge and experience and build a free \"AI-experience\" that takes the potential customers' requirements, desires, wishes, etc.  Then, knowing standard patterns you've followed before, have it determine which template/standard pattern you've created yourselves.\n\nc. Accept that people will build via no-code, etc. but that they're going to run into problems.  When they do, make use of AI to assess their codebase to summarize the requirements from it - extract that information you need to work out what they want you to build for them.  Pair that with your established standard patterns or templates and then you can at least get back to where they were very quickly, but with a rock solid pattern you can stand over.  If you can that, you can get them in the door.\n\n  \nWith my team, I've been open for people to embrace the tools - which they are, they're tools.  The best people to use them are senior developers I find.  They have the capabilities to guide it well.

Unfortunately, you can't convince everyone.  And perhaps that's a sign that you need to niche down more, or go for higher end projects that require something special.

First agents will drive software applications on behalf of users (we are just about there), then the software application will become an AI agent itself, and then the agents will just talk to each other. What happens from there is anyone’s guess. \n\nFor now, though, enjoy the prospect of never having to write code that you don’t want to write again!",

      "text": "So I just finished repairing my clients website, which involved entirely rebuilding the frontend and the backend and very labour intensive data migration.\n\nIf I could list absolutely everything this previous web dev did wrong, I would need a publisher. But let's go over some of my absolute favourites.\n\nIf you're an aspiring developer, then read through this carefully and make sure you **never** follow in the footsteps of this developer.\n\nFirst, this developer **loved** client side validation. When you would sign in to the platform as an administrator, the only validation happening was on the client side. So if the server responded back that the login was successful, then great! In that case I'll redirect you to the admin panel!\n\nCan you guess what this means? YEP. Admin panel is entirely unrestricted and anyone can freely access it if they want, they just need to *know what the admin panel URL is*. No one is going to be able to find that URL without logging in as the admin though, right?\n\nWell have a guess as to what you think the admin panel URL was. Even if it was `/administrator` it would have a thousand times better than the reality of it. The admin panel URL was `/a`. I am not joking. That is it. So you literally could have just gone to [`domain.com/a`](http://domain.com/a) and you would have been on the admin panel. Not only was that panel unrestricted and being gated behind client-side validation... BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE THE URL EVEN REMOTELY HARD TO GUESS.\n\nWant to hear what makes it even worse? Guess who was a clever one and decided to include that URL in the sitemap so that Google could kindly index it for everyone?\n\nThat has to be by far the worst thing I have ever seen. But there is more.\n\nDo you think he validated anything on the server? Nope. So when you'd log in, he'd just confirm the login endpoint returned successfully (with a 201 status code by the way - he couldn't even get that right), and then he would store the users data inside localStorage to work with the frontend.\n\nSo what do you think he was doing if a user wanted to change their email, or their password? Correct again, those server endpoints were also totally unrestricted. As long as you provided a valid user ID, you could change information for whoever you wanted!\n\nThe guy even returned the users hash in the login request! Why on earth would anyone ever want to do that? He even had a server endpoint... wait for it... named `/users` and that would return all the users in the database, including their hashes. So I had to notify my client that he needs to send an email out to everyone saying their data has been breached, because I spent about 30 minutes cracking those hashes and got about half of them. Yes, no salting or PBKDF2 algorithms either, just plain old SHA512.\n\nWant to hear the cherry on top? He was hashing the passwords on the frontend. So if you logged in, the frontend would hash your password, send that hash to the backend, then the backend would validate \"*do the hashes match?\"* and if so, would log them in... So he's effectively made the **hash** the **password**. Now that on top of the fact he was even returning the users hashes in API responses means you could have just used the damn hash that was returned and used it to log in with 😂🤣 I swear to you I am not making any of this up!\n\nThe damage? My client paid him a total of $40,000 for this absolute garbage. Something like this isn't even worth a little personal hobby project, let alone real money, and especially $40,000!\n\nBased in the US (the developer) and apparently according to his LinkedIn and other socials was an engineer before trying out web development and creating *professional* systems for the last 6 years. Charges $75 an hour.\n\nThis isn't just rookie mistakes. This guy invented his own entire auth logic! Even a junior would search up at the very least on how authentication works. It's like this guy just asked himself how he thinks it would work and went from there.\n\nDon't be like this guy.",

I checked the GitHub repo once he did this, and 10 lines of code in total were changed. I asked my client \"Out of curiosity, how much did he charge you?\". My client told me he charged him $1000 for that job. So apparently this developer was trying to say he had worked more than 10 hours on changing/adding 10 lines of code?\n\nIt was at that point my client started going through the process of getting him off the project.

But to anyone with an ounce of technological knowledge about web development could see the atrocities behind the scenes.\n\nRemember I only came into the picture as the client started to have some doubts. I was already working on another project of his and so he asked me if I could check things out on the other project. I found critical security issues straight away and from that point on I replaced the developer on frontend duties. That was when I started to discover everything and how bad it truly was, leading to him being completely removed from the project.\n\nIt's like saying the customer is also the idiot because they didn't recognise that the computer repair man did a crappy job and overcharged them. You can't always rely on the customer to know these things and I think it's poor judgement to assume that they should and box people in so that only those who would know about how websites work on a technical level should be able to pay for someone to build them a platform. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense and from my experience doesn't check out either.\n\nSure, if they know about how it all works then even better. But I don't think the judgement lies with the client for not knowing. That seems excessively harsh and shifts the blame from the guy who was charging for a skill he didn't have to the person who was paying someone for the skill they needed.",

              "text": "If you are hashing the password on the frontend, you are completely defeating the purpose of what the hash is there for.\n\nThe hashing is meant to be done on the backend. If you hash the password on the frontend, then that means the backend receives the hash instead of the plaintext password.\n\nIf the backend is only receiving the hash and comparing them, then that hash is now effectively the password.\n\nTry to think of it like this. If the backend receives the password in plaintext first, hashes it and **then** compares the hash, then if you were a hacker and had access to the hash, you couldn't use that to log in, as sending it to the backend would result in the backend hashing the hash again, which would result in a different hash, therefore the hashes would no longer match. The hacker would need to know your **password** in order to get around this.\n\nBy hashing the password on the frontend first, you are ensuring that now it is possible to just send the hash to the backend and it will work, you no longer need to know the password.\n\n>When the frontend hashes your password, that doesn't mean you could just enter the hash. Hashing the hash of your password would lead to a different hash... or did I miss something\n\nYes you are misunderstanding a crucial thing. You are thinking that the frontend is the gate-keeper. You're assuming that it is impossible to communicate with the backend without the frontend. Sure, if you put the hash in the login form and submitted it that way, then the frontend would re-hash the hash again. But you don't have to do that. You can just send a POST request directly to the login endpoint on the server and skip the frontend entirely. Or you can use a tool like BurpSuite to intercept the request that the frontend makes and replace the request body with whatever you like, i.e. the hash you stole.\n\nBecause the frontend operates on the clients browser, the frontend can never be used as security! The frontend can be manipulated in a multitude of ways. So by hashing the password on the frontend, you are wrongly assuming that no one will be able to bypass the hashing phase. So if the backend is expecting the hash and you can bypass the frontend hashing process, you can just send the original hash to the backend and it will log you in. That is why hashing must be done on the backend, because then there is no way to bypass that unless you hack the server. The user will always be forced into the flow of whatever they send gets hashed and then compared, and that means the only way for anyone to log in would be to send the original password.\n\nHashing a password is there to protect the password in case the database is leaked. But if you hash the password on the frontend, then the backend treats the hash as the actual password, therefore if those hashes get leaked, they can just be used to log in with because they **are** now the passwords. That was exactly what happened in this scenario too. Hashes were being stupidly leaked by the developer, and the passwords were being stupidly hashed on the frontend, therefore the hash can be used to log in with by sending the hash directly to the backend.",

Thats why on Android it also shows up as a separate App in stuff like the app drawer or settings menus. With almost all other browsers, besides Samsung internet, the browser I think just caches the website's files and creates a shortcut into a fullscreen browser window that than opens the website. This also means that a lot of nieche PWA features don't really work like homescreen shortcuts, intent intercepting on android, ...\n\nIt depends on your brand of phone, but some also display the browser's icon along side the shortcut since its just a \"app shortcut\" basically. Same mechanism is also used for example when you create to a shortcut to a location on Google Maps and add it to your homescreen.\n\nIts explained here : [WebAPKs on Android  |  Articles  |  web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/webapks)",

If a paid user sees that URL-copy notification every single launch, they’ll instantly assume the app is buggy or sketchy, and since it’s browser-side behavior, you can’t really fix it from your code.\n\nFor anything serious/paid, I’d honestly just ship proper Android/iOS builds. For local testing, tunnel your backend with [Pinggy.io](http://Pinggy.io) and point `server.url` to the Pinggy HTTPS endpoint, quick and painless.",

Use C, Zig, Rust, or any other programming language that can access memory directly.  \nAfter that, cut out the pg driver and directly write the pg protocol.\n\nAfter that, you would need to go non-sql to save a little more.\n\nAnd then in-process, e.g. LMDB (many databases are now based on LMDB).\n\nIf you still want to go faster, memory map a file and write to that. If you only want to log a stream of events as it seems, you could really just do append-only on a mmap'd file and open it in a second thread to read it if required. Only limit at that point would be the max mmap size depending on your OS, your free disk space, and in terms of speed, most probably I/O.\n\nFrom that onward, in-memory is the only way to go faster, so basically just a memory area you dump your data to. To keep it usable, it would probably have to be some kind of chunked ring-buffer.\n\nThere you go, your plan for the next few weeks :)\n\nNote: been there, done that, pretty interesting. And actually only really required in VERY special cases.\n\nP.S.: You could implement your own json serializer to improve serialization performance. The biggest issue with json serialization and deserialization is usually that it's a non-linear process - bytes arent read/written 100% sequentially. Also, the size isn't known beforehand usually. Both can be circumvented when you hand code it though.\n\nThe most efficient serialization / deserialization is still \"none\" though. E.g. with C you can just write the memory as is, and mmap it, or, if you prefer, memcopy the whole block over a (carefully engineered, due to padding etc.) struct.",

You can still say if it's vibe coded or not without releasing the source code. The fact that you're reluctant to do so just makes me nearly 100% confident it is vibe coded, and that is the reason you don't want to make it open source (since the reasons you gave for not doing so don't make any sense either).",

Also please just test the performance, it is top notch on my platform as there are no limits of file size, no. of files. you can process any number of files and performance will depend on your system.\n\nThanks for the feedback.😊👍",

I think there’s unpopular opinion at the moment based on LLMs and vibe coding that are tainting the discussion and pushing it away from your initial intent. My honest opinion to your question is that I wouldn’t trust a random website with my sensitive data even if it claims it’s only processed on my device because I’m used to Meta and Google claiming a lot of BS too. It’s hard to gain trust in the current landscape where every corp just wants to steal your data at any cost. But the fact that your vibe coded or AI assisted or whatever has nothing to do with that. It looks really awesome, by the way, but it doesnt change the principle. Personally, for small utility tools, I look for open source apps that I can find the binaries on brew (Mac). If it doesn’t exist, I create one and put it there, not to collect clicks and downloads and fame, just for my future convenience (and others). If it fills a need good, if it doesn’t, well, at least it filled my need. Lastly, it made me think that if you put those tools into a cli (or MCP) that LLM can control, that’d be dope. I’m constantly asking Claude for editing with ImageMagick and ffmpeg. The more “Swiss army knife” tools there are, the more my LLM will be helpful for me. Just my 2c! Good luck, I’m pretty sure you had fun and you learned a ton with that project, don’t let the haters kill your vibe.",

We all have to trust sites, for example, hosted by our governments or Banks etc, whether those are secure is another issue far too big to engage here. For me, it was my photography, specifically photos and videos of my grandchildren.\n\nso:\n\n1. Does anyone care about privacy, or is it just fluff? = Some do.\n2. Am I wasting my time building these tools, as nobody wants them? = Possibly.\n3. Suggestions on how I can promote it without money, as the platform is completely free to use.= not got a clue!\n4. Should I just drop it, as nobody cares?= Keep at whatever you believe in, & plug away.\n\nLike you, I have much the same toughts especially those around social media companies! And the trust associated with them. Anyway, enough said here, I spent and continue to spend many an hour trying to address my fears and create a fix.

You have few choices in my opinion. You can build it out further and invest in a larger team and marketing to draw new users.  You can open source it and hope for community development, possibly somebody buys the code base.  You can keep it as a passion project and it is your hobby, so you’ll never get a lot of users.

          "text": "> 1.\t⁠Does anyone care about privacy or it is just a fluff?\n\nHow often do you think people are using these tools? These are one off things that people do, and certain things are done locally by the OS (PDF merging), and the only guarantee of privacy is you saying you aren’t saving the user’s stuff. That’s not much of a promise when people can’t verify.\n\n> 2.\t⁠Am I wasting my time building these tools as nobody wants them?\n\nYou’re wasting time here - you built something without market validation, thinking people will flock to it. It’s not a high demand service, so you need to dominate the SEO game to get people to find your site when they need to use it. \n\n> 3.\t⁠Suggestions on how I can promote it without money as the platform completely fee to use.\n\nProbably seeking out hashtags and seeking people complaining about what you’re attempting to solve. I don’t think it’s an easy thing to automate.\n\n> 4.\t⁠Should I just drop it as nobody cares?\n\nDepends on why you did this. You want to showcase your work? Do it. \n\nYou want to build a client base? There are better ways to do it. \n\nYou made a free tool. If it’s free, why do you care if millions use it? Especially if it’s not OSS.",

While in mcdonalds case they could have ulterior motives, there is still a good reason to do that, even if in my opinion there are other less annoying solutions. \n\nthere is a whole ass market for people that take database leaks and use those logins to see what apps they can log in to for food, and there are sites where the person with the stolen account will take payment from a person for 50% of the cost of food, so the buyer has incentive to use them instead of ordering it themselves, and the person with the stolen account places the order using the credit card saved in the account, and pockets 50% of the cost of food. So the buyer gets food half off, the thief gets cash for doing it, and the person with the hacked account gets screwed.\n\nLike I said, I can think of better solutions than an annoying email verification, but at the very least I think it's done with solving a problem in mind.\n\nedit: this is maybe the weirdest thing ive ever been downvoted for. all I'm doing is giving a possible explanation for a specific security practice, holy cow.",

Here's why:\n\n  \n1. \\*\\*Security tradeoff works in your favor\\*\\* - Most users reuse passwords, so accepting passwords actually increases YOUR liability if you ever get breached. Email OTP means you're not storing password hashes that could be cracked.\n\n  \n2. \\*\\*UX tip\\*\\*: Consider magic links over OTP codes - clicking a link is easier than copy-pasting a 6-digit code, and you can set a 15-30 min expiry. Services like Supabase Auth make this trivial to implement.\n\n  \n3. \\*\\*Hybrid approach\\*\\*: You could offer \"remember this device\" for 30 days after the first magic link verification. This way users only deal with email auth once a month, reducing friction while maintaining security.\n\n  \nThe key metric to watch is your login completion rate - if you see significant drop-off between \"send code\" and \"code entered,\" consider the magic link approach instead.",

None of my websites have amounted to much of anything, but I must enjoy it. I had about 14 active sites together at the peak over the last few years, now I’ve got just 5 I still have up.\n\nThe domain registrations cost a little bit but other than that since nothing I’ve made is very popular, the cloud costs are very minimal. It’s really just about putting in my time.\n\nWhat about you guys? Are you off building things, and do you similarly find yourself alone amongst your colleagues?",

          "text": "Many of us who \"only\" work 8 hours a day still make time to learn new things. But it doesn't have to be another programming language, another framework, etc. Down that path, burnout and poor health (mental and physical) lurks. It's happened to me.\n\nSome of us prefer to learn a musical instrument, or another language, or how to paint, how to cook, meditation, a martial art, a sport, or working on a (non-computer-related) qualification via distance learning, stuff like that. Something that we're not under any professional pressure to get better at, so we can take it at our own pace and enjoy it. Keep a diary. Write a story from time to time. Read books that aren't about coding. Travel is good - there's a big world out there that you're neglecting if you don't make an effort to get out and see it. And yes, it's OK to watch TV, go for a drink with your friends, play with your kids and your pets. It's even OK to do a bit of coding sometimes. :) \n\nAnd, if you're pacing yourself properly and the people who you're working for are reasonable people who appreciate the need for professional development, there should still be time to learn new stuff during your work day. If that's not the case, your employer is crap and it's time to get out there and get a new job. \n\nDon't just be one thing. Don't just be the developer and let what you do for a living define you. Be the well-rounded human - ChatGPT isn't going to be able to replace that. The fact that I code websites is the least interesting thing about me. And so it should be for most people. \n\nMe - dad, husband, cat lover, movie enthusiast, musician and developer, 53.",

He described how you start on the fun side, but eventually drift off to the more professional side in your personal projects, because they need to run well, they need to scale, be secure, customers demand more and at that point it becomes another job and stops being fun. If you can keep it on the side of fun and not worry about all the things you do in your full time job, then it's really good entertainment for you.\n\nI see juniors do this more than seniors nowadays.

My impression is that most coworkers just treat it as a job, and they might even enjoy it, but then they just have other hobbies they prefer in their personal time, which all the power to them. I certainly do as well, but I dunno I just happen to enjoy dev for its own sake. For anyone else who does have personal projects at work, I typically just never hear about them or maybe people have a side gig but then they're more interested in the money generated than anything technical of course. Again, all the power to them, it just is a little disappointing that I don't feel like I can often talk shop outside of a work context even with coworkers, aside from sufficiently nerdy places like here. \n\nBut on the flip side I remember being called \"the real deal\" by one such coworker who mostly developed side projects for money. I get the sense that regardless of my competency, my organic enthusiasm for development at least gives me an edge over other professionals just seeking their next gig? I mean, it's a double-edged sword. I have to remember in a professional context that code isn't the point, but I burn out when I'm doing too much planning, meetings, ticket writing, reviewing, etc. and not enough coding. I do have a friend who also enjoys personal projects just to help himself or others in his other interests, but he's had difficulties getting hired previously because he came off as too disinterested in professional work and more focused on his personal projects. So I guess it's a balancing act.",

You can `git work tree add ../her-branch` and it will check the code out at that directory, by default with the `her-branch` branch as well. Convenient! You can then cd, (p)npm install, (p)npm test, and take a look. \n\n\nWhen you're done you can `git work tree remove`, and it will tab complete etc. \n\n\nAgain, nothing that you can't do with clone, but more convenient.",

Not for writing entire apps but for the boring stuff like writing tests, generating boilerplate, debugging weird errors, and rubber ducking when I'm stuck. Cursor specifically has basically replaced VS Code for me at this point.\n\nContainer based dev environments are another one. Using Docker or dev containers so my local setup matches production exactly. No more \"works on my machine\" nonsense. Took a while to get comfortable with but now I can't imagine going back.\n\nTypeScript everywhere. I resisted it for a long time because it felt like extra work but once you get used to it, going back to plain JavaScript feels like walking a tightrope without a net. The autocomplete alone is worth it.\n\nTailwind CSS. Hated it at first, thought it was ugly and cluttered. Now I can't stand writing regular CSS files. Being able to style stuff without context switching is just faster.\n\nGitHub Actions for CI/CD on basically everything, even tiny projects. Auto deploy on push to main, run tests, lint checks. Takes like 10 minutes to set up and saves so much mental overhead.\n\nEdge functions and serverless for anything that doesn't need a full backend. Vercel and Cloudflare Workers have made it stupid easy to add API routes without managing servers.\n\nAlso got into the habit of setting up proper error tracking from day one. Sentry or LogRocket or whatever. Flying blind in production is terrifying once you've experienced actually knowing what's breaking.\n\nWhat stack are you working with?",

The *personal* web, *independent* web, *small* web (whatever you want to call it) is still very pleasant to use.\n\nIf you're sick of seeing spam and AI slop everywhere, you need to move beyond centralized social media platforms and traditional search engines for website discovery purposes. Use those big human brains of yours and stop expecting to have an endless stream of \"content\" delivered directly to your eyeballs via a social media recommendation algorithm. Try ... I dunno, something like *kagi dot com forwardslash smallweb*. If you look at the master list for that directory on Github, there are almost 30,000 independent websites represented there. And Kagi's small web directory is but ONE example of several. Another directory you might like (since the websites are categorized to make it easier to find stuff you're interested in) is *blogroll dot org*. You can also join well-moderated forums where people share their independent sites with others (there are plenty out there). Bookmark any independent sites you happen across that are created by humans and relevant to your interests. Add their RSS feeds to an RSS reader and curate your own algorithm-free, slop-free feed.\n\nAs web developers, you are better equipped than anyone to participate in and contribute to the independent web community. Use SSGs to build simple HTML / CSS / JS websites, and fuck all the bloated corporate web frameworks you're expected to use in your day jobs. Have FUN again, and remember why you wanted to build websites in the first place. If you don't think that the existing independent web discovery surfaces work well, build your own better solutions. And if you're worried about your shit being stolen, do what you can to block known scrapers via .htaccess and honeypots.\n\n**tl;dr: fuck all the slop peddlers and marketers of the corporate web. Fuck SEO, and fuck \"GEO.\" The OP of the post I'm responding to asked how we \"get out of\" this mess. We get out of it by refusing to participate in the corporate web for our daily browsing activities. The independent web is what you want if you're tired of this BS.**",

              "text": "I completely agree. One of the biggest consequences of app stores and walled gardens is that they’ve trained people, especially average device users, to think the internet is just a handful of apps. For many, online life now exists inside two or three corporate platforms. They might still visit some websites for school, work, or government needs, but the wider web barely registers anymore.\n\nWhat gets lost is the idea of the internet as an open platform. It’s not the wild west of the late 90s or early 2000s, but the open web still exists. Independent websites, forums, blogs, open-source projects, donation platforms, and grassroots political and social organizations are still out there. They didn’t disappear, they just became harder to see once discovery was funneled through apps and algorithms.\n\nThe real problem is structural. When most people live inside a few applications, those companies become the gatekeepers of speech, culture, and organizing. What you see, what you’re allowed to say, and how far it spreads are shaped by corporate policy rather than public norms.\n\nWe should be reminding younger generations that the internet itself is where real agency still exists. Websites can’t be shut down by a single platform decision, and protocols don’t care about brand safety. If people don’t invest their time and energy in the open web, they’re choosing a future where online life is permanently confined to a few corporate silos.",

One of the things that saddens me the most is when I talk to teenagers and young adults from gen z and beyond and how they play barely any games and touch barely any websites.\n\nFor them, the internet is just social media and a handful of websites but that's about it. I mean, this generation grew up without sites like newgrounds, miniclip games, other (macromedia) flash game sites, game forums and what not which is crazy.
