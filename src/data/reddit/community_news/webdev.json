Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company. I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.\n\nMoreover, with the recent updates from Claude i wonder if developers or going to last. Please note, i’m not naive. I have seen what the new models from Claude can do. It’s scary. So before putting in statements like “engineering is not only coding”, “we’ll get do roles like product or architecture”, “competent developers would always be required” please dont. The current state of these models is already mind blowing, imagine what they’ll achieve in the next 2-3 years. If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nI did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. But now i think all that was a waste, should have just prepared for govt exams like my dad used to insist me for. At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nThis all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists? \n\nI feel betrayed and cheated, i wish these ai companies and ai preachers rot in hell",

Anyone who is just going to bury their head in the sand and pretend it doesn't have to affect them if they don't want it to is just going to get left behind.\n\nIt might not actually affect you, personally, right now, but when you retire they're not going to hire someone to replace you. They're going to use the AI bot you've been using (and teaching) to do that job now. Your children, if you have any, will not have the same opportunities as you no matter what you do or how well you set them up to succeed.\n\n\nEDIT: I just had an interesting thought occur to me. What if you would spend your entire career using a bot to help you do your job, whatever that may be. When you retire, your kid gets your job and uses your bot to help, further refining it. I wonder how long it would take, until the bot developed some sort of \"personality\" that is one part of each of the persons who had been using it before. It'd be like working with your grandpa always being there to answer your questions. I dunno if that would be creepy, if it's good or bad. Certainly interesting to think about though. Would make for a great Black Mirror episode.",

All the rapid development and big gains of generative AI happened already, and we're now well into diminished returns. There will still be improvements, just like how each generation of car is a little bit more efficient.\n\nAs for the generations of humans working on a bot, that's a fun sci-fi thought. If you persisted tokens over a long period of time, that would be kind of like what you're talking about. But, every additional token that needs to be consumed for a prompt increases cpu and memory usage. And crucially, gen AI doesn't actually remember anything; it simply takes in previous tokens to give it some level of guidance for the next thing it spits out, which mimics having a context about previous input and output. When you're talking to a chat bot, the reason it *seems* like it remembers what you had said is because the previous chat history (or a tokenized, summarized version of it) is fed into it for each prompt. It would be like having a conversion with someone, but every response you say (or they say) all the previous conversation must be repeated up to that point. And it gets longer and longer each response.",

Sure, it will become easier to run them, or it eventually takes less resources to train them (but now all the training data is trashed since its all AI slop). It *won't* develop a personality or become sentient. I really believe that it would be just another thing that fades into the everyday noise of IT once the bubble blows up and people can see it for what it really is. At the end of the day, miracle solutions in IT that promise to solve all your problems with little effort from you don't usually end up panning out. No-code and website builders were around for a long time and took care of the usual \"if it works it works\" problems, which I guess now LLMs will eat their lunch.",

They have been promising for years now that 100% is coming soon but continue to fail to get there. Right now, the entire ai industry is heavily subsidized and is eating the cost of expensive queries. At some point they will have to significantly raise the prices and that point ceos are going to start questioning if they want to pay exorbitant fees for something that only does about 80% of what it promised at most. Use ai as a tool for now but don't become dependent on it.\n\nEdit: some of y'all really drank the Kool aid... Their current plan to scale for profitability involves consuming most of the power we produce and while everyone keeps saying the cost of inference will go down, Nvidia's chips keep getting more and more expensive while the data centers they are going to live in are behind schedule. They lose money on every premium subscription sold and they will have to make up for years of unprofitability if they ever decide to become anywhere close to a sustainable industry.",

But, as a counter-argument, the real problem is not convincing yourself that you're worth more, it is convincing our particularly impressionable bosses that get their business tips from psychopaths that lead them into these bubbles thanks to heavy dosages of FOMO and unverifiable claims. At least I had at least 3 such cases in my career.\n\nI'm having some difficulties with my current ones, for instance. They constantly push this crap and just copy-paste responses from Claude instead of telling me themselves. I told them exactly this, that apart from the technical and security concerns (there's data leaks constantly in the field and they still have to assure me they're being strict enough with how they process our customer's sensible data through their agents), it's almost certain they're trying their best to make us dependant on their infrastructure and then steeply raise prices once monopoly's been estabilished. They just... shrugged and said it is the future and we must walk the walk.\n\nI'm not actually looking for a new job because of this, but, since that conversation, I'm seriously considering what my plan B should be. I'm considering English teacher but, I dunno, with DeepLy or even normal LLMs... the problem is the same - how do I convince my students they need to know it? I can tell them innumerable practical cases for knowing English yourself, but will they just shrug as well and say 'who cares'?",

              "text": "Prices won't go up that much, because that'd be counter-productive. Instead we'll see quality go down as companies realize you can do good enough, and start to use more limited, specialized AIs (or even just straightforward non-AI tools) instead of generic and expensive LLMs for more and more tasks. This limits what can be achieved, but again good enough is good enough. Companies will realize that if AI can do 60% (down from 80%) of what a junior engineer does it's still a great gain, but it would mean engineers would have to do more work.\n\nThe thing is, if AIs were really improving efficiency that much we'd see an explosion of little side projects in companies. Because why not: just throw a new agent to work on the little thing and then show it off. Yet we are not seeing this, engineers are busy while their productivity isn't that much higher.\n\nWhat will change is that a lot of jobs that we handed off will now not be handed off as much. When tickets they'll be split into three buckets: AI handles it (for trivial bugs), hand off to junior/mid (for bugs that are not trivial, but also don't require a large volume of knowledge, allowing developers to gain a deep or wide understanding without getting overwhelmed) and the problems that go to seniors+ (problems that require a deep and wide understanding of the issue, and are non-trivial, problems that have strong political weight or challenge to them such as bugs in the interaction of code belonging to multiple teams, and systemic issues). The automated tool itself only goes as far as it can, it can collect pertinent logs and data, identify the potential commits at fault, create a repro test, offer potential solutions, not all done by AI, all of these to help close the ticket, only when it basically does all the job and only needs a review is it considered \"handled by AI\". Also this shifts certain responsibilities, we'd expect juniors and mid engineers to review code a lot more, and trust them to handle more things, to balance this mentorship will be a bigger issue on senior+ engs because we need junior/mid to be able to increase in skill faster.\n\nSo it will transform our jobs, how exactly isn't sure now, and it's going to be a transition. The problem is that right now leadership thinks it has a clear idea and it's pushing it blindly with the engineers on the ground not seeing how it could work out. This is eating away at morale. Leadership is acting really blindly here, and it will result in companies getting stuck in their own mire, as it has happened before.",

I'm guessing it'll be a matter of years before all webdev is phased out, so yeah, prep for that lol\n\nTwo hundred years ago, you'd call us insanely stupid for wanting to be able to talk to anyone across the world in milliseconds, now it's a basic thing that just sort of exists in developed countries. The same thing is happening now with the big ai shift, you can hate it all you want, but it's literally just better ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEdit: This isn't to say I've figured it all out, either. I taught myself how to use a frontend webdev tool, made my own personal site and found it fun, joined this sub. I still haven't made a penny with webdev, don't know if I ever will, but it's a fun skill for now for sure. I still work a crappy job that I don't truly enjoy and isn't paying me enough, so I'm very much still looking for my \"thing\", the ai onslaught isn't helping me either lmao",

Because no-code tools that \"anyone can use\" have been around for decades, and managers still want to be telling developers what to build even if they technically could be doing the work with those no-code tools themselves. \n\nAnd the same will happen here. Developers will continue to be specialists wrangling all of the code. Really trivial \"plumbing\" category code tasks and simple UI will mostly be done by AI, but there will still need to be an expert involved for the foreseeable future.\n\nFrankly, most managers don't want to be coding or prompting. They are done with being an IC and want to keep track of higher level details. And there is no universe where some rando untrained minimum wage employee can replace a software engineer as the prompter.\n\nThe tools are pretty good, but they still make really bad mistakes with algorithm and architecture. They're useful to save some time at first, but if you're not a competent software engineer, you'll be spending 100x as much effort trying to iterate to fix errors you don't understand. And as the architecture gets further off the rails, the multiplier keeps going up.\n\nFinally, the way a lot of corporate management works, there's more prestige the larger your team is. It's rare that any manager will want to lose members of their team, so instead of cutting jobs (assuming AI is effective at increasing productivity) they will tighten schedules and add features.\n\nThere are always more features to add. Unless you're maintaining something like a web site for a restaurant that only needs a new menu update every couple of months, the backlog is usually enormous. If not the backlog, then the feature wish list. I'm skeptical that AI will result in more than a 10-20% productivity boost over the long term, but even if it does, they'll just ask for more work to be done.",

But give it another 3 years right?\n\nEvery time i hear someone fellating AI this pops into my head and i smile 😌\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUQwhlvgIvH/\n\n> If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nPffft no you're just retarded.\n\nI'll give you a parallel. Cloud providers (AWS / GCP). At the beginning it was great right? I was around for those days, companies just offloading entire in house IT departments and hardware on prem into the cloud. And you could horizontally scale pretty easy...\n\nFast forward a decade or more, now that they've upped the ingress egress fees, enshitified everything with a gazillion microservices, and made it extremely hard to migrate away (since you're using their bespoke API) it's flipped back. It's actually cheaper to host your own data and stick it behind some caching, then use those services.\n\nIt's going to be the same with AI.\n\nStarts out nice and roses. But eventually they're going to have to put up the $prices to hand off cost. As for vibe coding, i can imagine it inserting random code that spawns ads. If devs aren't in control / no ones doing PR reviews and they're just AI-ing all the stuff. You'll get ads in your software where there should be none, and with the wrong tracker the profits would go elsewhere.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nUhuh, because it's not like they made generative AI that's churning out slop images, and videos' targeting basically everyone in the content industry... animators, artists. They didn't train it on all legal documents and test it against lawyers...\n\nAI stands for artificial inflation, as that's mostly what it's done so far.",

Your skills and logic are still critically important, it's just now part of utilising those skills and logic is how well you can convey your intent to the AI, and how well you can track what the AI is doing.\n\n> At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary.

You're just on the leading wave. You have the unique opportunity to surf this wave into the new age at it's crest, and your complaint seems to be that it's not fun anymore. Well, then try to use AI for something more fun, maybe something you've been putting off because it seemed way too hard to tackle. By the time AI comes for the government it's going to be late enough that they are likely to struggle far more than you will as you learn the new styles of working with AI.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nAI companies are focus on software because there's an infinite need for software, and that need is ever changing and evolving. Instead of bemoaning it, embrace the super-power your understanding of software gives you. You can talk to the AI on the same level, and direct it in ways people without that experience can't even hope to replicate.",

This is not the end, it's only a stark shift in the way of things at this point in time. In the early 20th century, there was no such thing as a software engineer, or even software for that matter.

It had added tooltips which in our app are spans that form blue circles with a white i, but it added purple circles with a white *i* (cursive here to emphasize the i’s looked different). So after thinking a bit it realized it had added tooltips using the `info` class instead of `normal`. So it happily changed those and finished, but upon rendering the i’s looked different still. Turns out that the font difference for the i’s depended on using the `text-normal` class, and Claude rendered the tooltips using `text-info` and **in the same line where the info class was!** So of course I had to change that myself and be done with it.

I like it and I'm not scrounging around in the same docs over and over. \n\nWhat AI can't replace is experience and intuitive problem solving. When something goes wrong I know how to fix it because I either wrote it or reviewed and committed it. I don't let AI write without explicit permission and I'm still cautious. I don't entirely trust it to stay in scope and have heard too many horror stories. This is a skill issue, but it's hard to keep up.\n\nUpdates are the same way. Terrible to automate and I've been burnt too many times. I'll be happy to look them over myself, it's kinda my job.\n\nI'm aware of my skill issues and know I'm not using AI to the fullest, but I need to determine just how much time and money to invest. This is a moving target and if I spent my time learning the models I wouldn't be working much at all. \n\nIt's a hard balance to find and I sympathize with anyone starting out.

I tend to sort waffle between two trains of thought on this subject. \n\nDespair: I feel very similarly to you, and it upsets me that AI is basically here to stay. I write code because I enjoy it, and the admin work of managing an AI agent is cool, but not what I want to do with my time. I’m fortunate that my job only wants us to use it as much as we want to use it. So I mostly use it for tedious work that I don’t want to do or when I get stuck. However, it’s important that any of us in that boat recognize that this will likely change over time. As everyone gets used to the speed of AI, they will get less patient with project timelines and expect quicker turnaround.\n\nOptimism: I’m optimistic about my career in two ways. \n\nPart 1) AI can write code better than me, but it doesn’t have the context to understand what my specific job/app/company needs without my input. That is to say, it needs my guidance and I don’t foresee a time when that stops being true. I’ve give it jira stories and watched it do exactly what I would have done. I’ve also seen it miss really subtle details than would have been incredibly frustrating bugs to figure out because it just doesn’t understand complex legacy business rules the way that I do.\n \nPart 2) You mentioned that this is a merit based career. I feel similarly and I don’t think that’s changing. I choose to see this as an opportunity to think about what I can do on a much grander scale than I could have before. Human creativity is essential to using this tool to solve problems that we might not have been able to tackle before, and our individual knowledge and skills will still be what separates each of us from each other. Now we get to think about what problems we want to solve that we might have never dared to approach before. Personally I’m working on finding ways of fixing a broken spine without having to drill into our vertebrae. The current standard approach is spinal fusion which comes with a lot of problems. I’m going to need that surgery myself so I figure why not use these tools to try to find a new solution to my problem?",

          "text": "I agree that this AI stuff is leading to people just shutting off their brain. I wouldn't say it's \"targeted\" at Developers, it's just their main job tasks were some of the ones \"easily automated\" so it affected them first and foremost. But this AI craze is having wide-reaching effects across many industries. It's going to (actually already has) led to software quality going way down and now customers are expected to be the QA. So it's a terrible user experience but companies don't care because it's cheaper to do that and deal with the customer complaints than it is to pay actual people to actually develop and QA software manually and release a solid product like they used to. I know that's like a totally foreign concept now. Business leaders have convinced themselves its OK to do this to the customer (despite the customer feedback worldwide that clearly says otherwise) because of all the BS that Dev leaders have relayed to them - buzzwords like \"agile\" and \"feedback loops\" which lead to \"better products\".....BS. But yet it seems like that's where we're at (it actually started well before AI but AI has just accelerated that process tenfold).\n\nBut the bigger concern to me, outside of just software development, with this AI stuff is the fact that it's leading to a society where people quite literally are learning **not** to use their brain. In the past, being smart, sharp, witty, etc. were all positive traits that we admired in people. Now it seems people are happy to let AI solve problems for them, write emails for them, do everything for them. And just like physical muscle, where if you don't use them, over time you start to lose them - critical thinking and mental skills are very much the same.\n\nAI is - or should be - *just a tool* and treated as such. But that is not the way society is treating it - we're treating it as a replacement for humans which is absolutely the wrong approach. Why? Many reasons, but if the thought of our own race's mental capacity declining isn't depressing enough to get people to pay attention, then maybe they should think about what happens when AI becomes so good it decides it doesn't want to listen to you anymore. We're already seeing real-life examples of this happen and the real-life effects it can cause. People assume we can always just \"pull the plug\" if that happens before any real damage is done.... really? You sure about that? I'm certainly not.\n\nBut yeah, it's honestly just more depressing than anything thinking about the direction the world is going and such a vast majority are so blissfully happy with it because they just can't get over the stuff they see AI do. It's just so amazing to them it's fooled them into thinking it's a silver bullet that will be a solution for all problems. Talk about having the wool pulled over your eyes. I was taught at a very young age - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. And that advice has served me very well through my life. I firmly believe AI is one of those cases - there are unseen costs that we will ultimately pay but nobody knows quite exactly what those are yet. But unless something changes drastically I don't know that there's any way to \"put the genie back in the bottle\". The next few months and years will be very interesting.",

Why did I have to suffer and sacrifice my free time/life? I remember spending 3 months over the summer figuring out a feature/new tech stack and how to implement it (At that time I only knew Frontend and some basic backend concepts). Out of curiosity, I asked AI to create my site idea for me, and it got a semi-working, fully styled and responsive/adaptive version in a single prompt. Something tells me if I had prompted it more, it would've corrected the mistakes. Yet, I always get people saying that if you can get \"replaced by AI\", you aren't a good developer. Like, come on... When I was first learning full stack, I almost gave up due to how difficult some of the concepts I had to learn were as a frontend dev. However, I pushed through to get it right, and then I went back to college, and my juniors who were asking me to debug spaghetti AI-generated CSS last semester had full-blown website prototypes with CRUD and login/signup using PHP and some SQL. The only thing I'd say I had over them is understanding the security stuff and knowing the concepts in and out as well as the architecture and the sheer speed at which I can work without Google or AI. And the fact that now people don't care about stuff like proper ci/cd or testing; they just want to ship features, while I had to sit and learn that stuff.\n\nThe bright side is my degree is B.Ed so I can teach professionally anywhere though I dread teaching ATM.",

It was local extraction of data.\n\nThe other thing that is muddying the results is that the overarching recommendation was \"Update systems with modern cryptography\" which is great an all, except the ultimate point of passwords is to use them, so at some point they will be on your local system unencrypted. All the cryptography in the world doesn't eliminate the fact that at some point, you have to tell a website what your password is, in plain text.

People still pay the subscriptions for those other services, which is why they continue to go up frequently (because they get away with it) while very little changes in them - the UI largely stays the same, the content on them is the same (and in some cases the quantity lessened due to other streaming services getting rights), they’re just as buggy, etc., and always claim “innovation” as their reason for the price increase.\n\n1Password can’t be compared to some of that as it’s not a streaming platform, but they address their bugs (usually in a reasonably timely fashion), and have to constantly stay on top of cyber threats to prevent unauthorized access to credentials housed in their product - which, I’m sure becomes increasingly difficult given some of the tools available today, and trying to weave in some other new things to help users.\n\nSo, to me, if any of the services legitimately justify a price increase (let alone one so little - especially in comparison to what streaming platforms usually increment by) it’s a password manager.\n\nNot going to get into a political debate for the rest.",

When you do that it uses windows hello to fill in a password which can be very unsafe imo.\n\nNext it doesn’t have an application for Linux. So if you ever want to move from windows to Linux you will be missing out on the password manager.\n\nAnother downside as a European is that my data now is with an American company which has me worried about privacy. I think 1Password is Canadian which tracks a lot better imo\n\nBright side is that my not so techy wife uses it because it’s pre-installed. Sharing passwords is easy with another user.

Maybe I am not that “coder” (?), I always feel anxious to deal with JSON with code. bassanite.dev is my new favorite for complex structures. This one is a visual schema builder with a live content editor, meaning you can tweak fields and data on the fly. It handles conversions between JSON, JS Objects, Yup/Zod, TS, and Prisma perfectly. Plus, it’s privacy-first (all local) and shares via URL hash.\n\n[bgvault.tech](https://bgvault.tech): A fantastic resource for code snippet backgrounds. It had so many great options, though it seems down recently and not sure if it will come back soon (or anyone else knows what’s happening?)…but the GitHub is still there: [github.com/WabweniBrian/bgvault](https://github.com/WabweniBrian/bgvault) and there’s the code for the snippets still.\n\n[starting.app](https://www.starting.app) : One of the cleanest boilerplates/launchpads out there.

We tried scaling VPS's but there is no clear pattern to when the platform might pick up and the scaling takes too long to react. Using a worker to handle the uploaded audio transmission blocks practically gets rid of the irregular scaling issues we had at the start. \n\nOnce the upload is received, the worker records it in the database and sends it to a Kafka stream which is how it is stored instead of traditional file storage. \n\nThe downside to workers is they are targets for abuse. You have to implement bot protection and build in authentication for each request. We use WAF to block repeated requests that fail auth (and also all countries that are not North America since our platform is specific to this region) alongside rate limiting requests as an added measure to prevent flooding. When your paying for every request a flood event that goes unchecked can cost you a ton of money. \n\n",

The number of total URLs is reasonable. And of course it is also served very fast. \n\nIt's a pity because a potentially useful feature has to be taken away. But I'm finding my customers don't object strenuously when I remove it because they are more concerned about the bots. \n\nOther workarounds are possible, of course, like hiding the multi-filter links behind JavaScript, depending on whether the bots are simple or going to the trouble to actually jockey a web browser.",

Among other things, it allows you to make smaller DOMs.\n\nI talk about a modern CSS technique that does that here:\n\nhttps://op111.net/posts/2023/08/lean-html-markup-with-modern-css/\n\nIt is an idea I started playing with when custom properties landed in browsers, around 2016 or 2017? Around 2021 I started using the technique in client sites too.\n\nNow I want to write a 2026 version of the post that talks about container queries too. The technique becomes more powerful if you can rely on container queries and on the cqw unit. (You cannot always. That stuff is still new.)\n\nFor an example of the convenience cqw offers if you can rely on it, see the snippets I have in this:\n\nhttps://omnicarousel.dev/docs/css-tips-know-your-width/",

Now they're pushing agentic AI that hires other AI to scale the work. \n\nI don't understand this greed-driven need to replace humans. It doesn't work for me. \n\nEven if the OPs post said that Lovable did the work that five developers could do singlehandedly without failure, we're discarding the opportunity to build deep long-lasting business relationships and innovate to create new and interesting solutions. The best work I've ever done has come from rubber-ducking with like-minded people. \n\nA single knowledgeable person with experience could build a great application on their own, but in order to actually scale the thing, you really gotta have other hands on board! Share the load and all that. \n\nIn one of the subreddits dedicated to SaaS, I saw a post about how the future would be a single CEO in charge of literally every role with the help of AI.

But eventually they want an experienced full stack developer who can built their application or at least a production grade MVP for Free. \n\nI got curious seeing this kind of post and even approached one person. My God the person had some tantrum. He was already thinking of himself as Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page. He gave me Do's and Don't for building the application ( He is a non technical person Btw) \nHe gave me timeline, I can give feedback about changes, I can't have any opinion on the product. But funny enough I am the co founder. \n\nIt made me laugh so hard. Like seriously you want a production ready application. With 3-4 premium core features. Payment gateway integration. API integration. And in return you are giving me 10% of your business which doesn't even exist without me? \n\nPlease give me your thoughts on this. ",

          "text": "I see this like some stranger asking me \"Let's you buy us a lottery ticket, with your money, and if it wins, I will portion out you a 'fair' amount of the winnings.\"\n\nThe reality is that I've seen this scenario over and over and over; mostly it entirely fails, but sometimes with the 50/50, the business does make profits; at which time:\n\n* Business (ideas) guy is the one who dealt with the lawyers, the accountants, and any investors. Thus, tech half is entirely in the dark. \n* The business guy often just throws things in front of tech guy to sign saying, \"The investors/lawyers/accountants/client needs this signed, this is normal business practice.\" Sometimes these documents are legit, as in an NDA or something, but other times, it is a reworking of the shareholder's agreement because it had clauses giving the tech half \"too much power\"\n* Money starts coming in, and the business guy will be cagey as to how much, and where it si going.\n* Business guy realizes that tech guy having 50% sucks. He now has the money to hire tech people who don't get any share.\n* Business guy will bring in someone to be CTO COO or something because the tech guy needs \"adult supervision\". \n* If tech guy balks, business guy will have probably raised some money by selling off 5-10% of the company. There is a shareholder's vote, and tech guy gets demoted. \n* These lopsided votes happen one after another until tech guy quits, or is fired.\n* Some magical way, tech guy leaving triggers the loss of most, if not all of his equity.\n* Any lawsuits against business guy will have business guy using company funds to pay for his defense.\n\nIf, in the remote case you are tech guy and are stupid enough to do such a deal make sure there are a few things in your contract (get a lawyer who you picked):\n\n* Shotgun clause. You need to be able to force business guy out. \n* If you are 50/50 keep it exactly that. Have voting shares, and non voting shares. You and business guy keep 50% each, and your agreement to sell these requires, well, your agreement. \n* Everything you sign which isn't fantastically routine like an NDA goes to your lawyer. You don't want some family friend lawyer, but someone who is a pitbull. Looking over a contract for landmines isn't very expensive at all.\n* Be prepared to walk away. If business guy ever just presents you with a wildly unfair contract and you are early into the business. Don't negotiate, but walk away. Even if they back down this time, they will just take another run at you in the future. \n* Don't let them ever talk to the accountants, lawyers, investors without you in the room. Never, not once, zero. \n* All, and I mean ever penny, of spending has to be approved by both parties. Have it in the contract that any unapproved spending or signed contracts are to be covered by the single signing party. You can have this go to an arbitrator, where the losing party has to also pay for the arbitrator.\n\nThis last one was where a friend of mine used it as a nuclear option to annihilate his business partner post shotgun clause. This business MBA d-bag hired some friends, took some business trips, and signed some other contracts. Post, breakup from the shotgun clause, the d-bag now had the personal obligations of the severance of those employments, their salaries to date, etc. This came out of his shotgun clause payment; which was tiny.\n\nWhat the tech half did was to convince the business half that he was in financial distress. The MBA d-bag tried to take advantage of this and super lowballed him with a shotgun clause. The tech guy returned with the company lawyer, a few goons from a security company, and a bank draft for the matching shotgun clause. He and his fratboy recent hires were all out the door 5 minutes later. Except, the bank draft didn't go to the d-bag, it went to the lawyer, who was then going to deduct all the expenses that an arbitrator would say were owing. This pretty much eliminated the bulk of the money. \n\nOne extra bonus, was that in their contract, they had an extra bit that if certain clauses were contested in court, that not only would court costs be covered, but there was an additional penalty to the losing party. Around 100k or something.\n\nThe moral of the story is that I've seen very few tech/business partnerships work. The simple reality is that business people are a dime a dozen. But business capable tech people working in small teams are killer. Later on, they can hire all the business talent they might need. \n\nMost business people will argue they have domain experience and a network. Often this network only exists because they were fired from an industry job. Most people in this \"network\" are of the attitude, \"My connection to you was your position, not your person; so could you lose my number.\"\n\nWhere business people can bring value to the table, is if they literally bring value to the table. Some people have magical abilities to sell and/or raise money. Thus, far beyond \"an idea\" a real business person will show up with the company ready to hit the ground running. Clients who are willing to prepay for a product which doesn't exist, or invest in the business to the point where salaries can be paid. Often, these people can sell/raise money for anything. Thus, they are usually less enamored with a specific idea, but prefer ones which check those two simple boxes; easy to sell, easy to raise money with.\n\nThis last is a real business person; in which case, get the best contract you can, and then try to learn some of their magic along the way.",

A Google Doc?\n\nBuilding a product isn’t just “coding an app.” It’s months (sometimes years) of stress, bugs, architecture decisions, rewrites, edge cases, scaling problems. \n\nEngineers know how hard it actually is and we also know how much we don’t know and that’s why we stay humble and these folks take it as a weakness and really believe \ntheir “vision” is equal to the person actually creating the thing.\n\n\nIf you’re not Sam Altman or not bringing capital, traction, or a serious track record, why would an engineer work for free?\n\n\nEquity in an idea-stage startup with no users and no funding is basically Monopoly money.\n\n\nAnd don’t even tell yourself, “I hate talking, I just want to build. I need a cofounder to do the client stuff.”\n\nNo. No no no.\n\n\nPlenty of products were built by introverts who just emailed customers. You don’t need to be a LinkedIn influencer. You don’t need to love pitching on stages. You can literally send cold emails, hop on a few awkward Zoom calls, and figure it out.\n\n\nBeing “antisocial” or “just love to code” is not a reason to give away half your leverage to someone whose main skill is talking confidently.\n\nGood non-technical founders exist, 100%. The good ones bring real distribution, real customers, real money, or deep domain expertise. They don’t just bring vibes and a Canva deck.\n\n\nEngineers: please do not sell yourself for cheap.. your ability to build is rare. Don’t let someone convince you it’s just “execution.” Execution is the whole game.\n\nIdeas are cheap. Builders aren’t.",

They were technically \"technical\" people who were looking for someone to join a team and contribute. Cool, I was interested in such an environment. I get into calls with these people and it turns out they their technical input and expertise was basically being a TPO. They had all the ideas for features but accepted no input or critique for their business plan they've been baking for 3-5 years. Neither party wanted to pay anything and offered \"full time work\" as a possible reward for when funding started to trickle in.\n\nI tested the waters by adding my critiques and seeing how they'd respond. Sometimes it was a mix of \"idk yet\" and pushback. No enthusiasm for my interest in engaging ideas nor recognition that I knew my stuff—signs they just wanted a tech printer to just print off their ideas for free. Both individuals failed. I pulled away interest because I refuse to work full stack LEAD dev for free. It required a steep learning curve on my end as a frontend dev with zero pay or incentives other than \"trust me bro, you'll have a job\". There is a reason these people can't build teams around their generic products. I saw their proofs of concepts. Both ended up trying to vibe code their solution. Person one had most things built vibe coded and was loosely and indirectly asking me to either rebuild it all from scratch or fix their current vibe. Person two created a very skeletal poc, admitted they were in over their head, and wanted me to take over from the mess they had with a bunch of UI/UX failures.\n\nLong story short, I will never work for these people for free no matter how much I want projects to bolster my portfolio to return to the industry as a dev. It's so messy and my time isn't free. I work many hours to pay my bills.",

I started programming around the year 2000. I learned PHP before it supported OOP. I went from LAMP to every stack.\n\nSome software I wrote as a teenager is still live in prod as companies all these years later - I wish I was joking.\n\nI have two projects live in prod now - both have raked in millions and millions of dollars for the company I work for. I am probably coming up on $10 million.\n\nI was in federal prison for a long time for import chemicals from China. I used to manage strip clubs and before that I was a DJ for a living. I produce music and videos for free.\n\nIf you pirated music between 2007-2010, I probably helped you out. I launched one of the largest privatized music sharing communities in the world (as the lead developer).\n\nI have servers all over the world and a ton of domains.\n\nIf I like an idea - I just do it for free.\n\nNobody can stop me - I'm all the way up.\n\nI got everything I ever wanted in life times a hundred.\n\nWhile most of the people reading this are human, I am something else. \n\nYou may find this hard to digest - but I live this life and many others. The real me is floating somewhere, far away. I use some kind of device to be here... Not just here, but many other places. Even if I did tomorrow, in my reality, I will rewind the events until I am alive again. I will still be living multiple other lives.\n\nI am here to slay the dragon. \n\nSometimes I lose my path... I wander away. But never have you met somebody like me. A year in my life is a thousand years for most humans. \n\nIf you want me to help or not, I am always available for a free consultation. I have worked in many industries. All things are the same to me: tables of columns and rows.\n\nA real person like me doesn't ever do things for the money. That is why I crush my contemporaries. Money is but a material motive. How many lifetimes does it take to seek something more?\n\nI need for nothing. I want for nothing.\n\nTo entertain my mind is all I seek. \n\nAnybody reading this, doubt me now. But in the future, even a moment from now... You can reach out to me. And I will be there for you. Whatever resources I have, I will share with you. My knowledge, my skills, my dedication. \n\nPitch me your ideas and your projects. I have too many of my own to ever bother stealing yours. I can pitch you mine, if you are of a similar mind. \n\nMy cost is $0 and I will provide more value in this post than you may get out of any other human for the next year or more.\n\nIf you want to get an idea off the ground - let me know. Most people will never even taste the kind of success I have feasted upon my entire life. Almost everything I try to do (outside a few strange things), I am wildly successful at, beyond even my own wildest dreams. I can help you achieve these same levels of success and it doesn't cost you anything.\n\nMost other people don't even bring much to the table. I am the table. I am the house in which the table rests. \n\nIf I was tooting my own horn, the walls of Jericho would crumble.\n\nYou have nothing to lose.\n\n\"But I am not OP!\", okay.\n\n'but my idea isn't even done yet!\", okay.\n\nNothing should be a barrier.\n\nEvery single thing in life I wanted, I have achieved. \n\nI believe all people are created equal. I just invested more time in certain skills than some people may have done. That is why I am willing to share and consult and even work for free.\n\nWhoever else says they can help you? I will beat their price. I will beat their deadline. I will slaughter their skills. \n\nI do this for fun. I do this because I enjoy it. Some of my jobs pay me over $100 USD per hour. Others pay me $0. I give the same amount of effort to both. \n\nIf you want a worldly person with otherworldly experience, please, reach out. I will show you what I can do without you spending a penny.\n\nTell me, have you read somebody who has typed like me? I doubt it. If you have, you are blessed. I am always willing to network. Always willing to meet new people.\n\nYou can have no money and no skills and no ideas - but if you reach out to me, I still may be able to help you. What I am seeking in this life, I was born with.  Don't hesitate. I will always be there for you, even when nobody else is. As long as you know me, you will always have a friend.\n\n:)",

I had a scroll progress indicator using IntersectionObserver with a bunch of threshold math. Replaced it with `animation-timeline: scroll()` and about 15 lines of CSS. No JS at all.\n\nContainer queries are the big one though. I used to have a ResizeObserver wrapper that would toggle classes based on container width. That entire package is gone now.\n\nStill keeping JS for anything that needs actual state management or data fetching obviously. But for visual/layout stuff?

          "text": "Same experience here. The tipping point for me was `:has()` — it eliminated so many \"parent needs to know about child state\" situations where I'd previously reach for JS.\n\nSome concrete replacements I've made this year:\n\n- **Scroll-to-top button visibility**: Used to use IntersectionObserver + state. Now it's `position: sticky` with `animation-timeline: scroll()` and a visibility toggle — zero JS.\n- **Accordion/collapsible sections**: The `<details>` element + CSS transitions on grid-template-rows. No library needed.\n- **Dark mode toggle persistence**: Still need JS for localStorage, but the actual theme switching is pure CSS custom properties + `:has(input:checked)` on a hidden toggle.\n- **Responsive layout switching**: Container queries completely replaced my resize observers. This alone probably saved 3-4KB of JS in one project.\n\nThe one area where I still reach for JS: **scroll-driven animations with precise waypoints**. The CSS scroll timeline API is powerful but the syntax is verbose and debugging is painful compared to something like GSAP's ScrollTrigger. For anything beyond simple parallax, JS is still more maintainable IMO.\n\nBiggest win though? Fewer hydration mismatches in SSR apps. CSS-only interactions don't care about the client/server boundary.",

CSS behavior mostly gets visual regression tested, if it gets tested at all. When you move validation logic into CSS selectors, you're often trading testable code for untestable markup. That's probably fine for most cases, but worth being deliberate about — especially for anything that touches form validation or accessibility state.\n\n\n\nThe \\`<dialog>\\` element is the one I keep going back to.

              "text": "Yeah, I can confirm. It *is* indeed a problem. And not a small one. This is why human reviews are still extremely important. When vibe coding, you may still have control about *what*, to some extent about *how*, and in a way also about *why.* But you entirely lose control about the interconnection between these aspects. The *what* have I implemented *how* and *why* have I implemented it that way? This is what's lost when you vibe code. I am in the same situation, luckily my colleague is a very thorough and picky reviewer. He reviews code that I overlooked. The sheer amount of code that is generated in a very short amount of time is too much for one person and too much to keep in-depth knowledge about. It's almost like in school where, when you just take a photo of the chalkbord, you're not gonna learn a thing. You need to read it and actively write it down to move it into your long term memory. \n\nIt is indeed a problem. And yes, I must say, I haven't written that much actual code in the past year myself (also about 20 years of coding experience). \n\nOr is it? \n\nI do not know if this is going to be the way we all are going to develop software in the future. I suppose it is, because the models will become better and better, and are probably also going to overtake us humans in code elegance and resilience to the point where we do not even need reviews anymore. But we're not there yet. Far from it. \n\nThe codebase I am vibe-coding in uses all sorts of quality gates independent of AI. The usual stuff from before LLMs. Pre-commit hooks that do linting and beautifying, a unit test coverage that I'd never reached before, same about documentation. Static code analysis for security, vulnerability scanners, automatic pentests, all sorts of non-AI things that I usually let loose on my human coded projects too. \n\nI also regularly switch the model in order to avoid some sort of AI tunnel vision too (which may be an illusion, but well...), and have a comprehensive review of the entire code base autogenerated. I let multi-agent systems hunt for code smells, bugs, flaws, dead code, deprecated libs, suggest simplifications and improvements. It helps a lot. But! The one thing that all of this, regardless of the actual quality of the outcome, can't give me is in-depth knowledge about the code base. The question is, if I really need it, since I do have an LLM that I can ask questions about it. The question is, do I still have it about my other, older, non-vibe coded projects? Aren't they the same now? Or other people's human-written code? I would have to read into that code as well in the case of a problem. LLMs now can help me with that too. \n\nI remember a time when I had to look into the code base of another team because we were acceed the duty to maintain it for them. Without LLMs it took me weeks, months and a constant back and forth to get into it. Some of the code was so... spaghetti that I simply couldn't get my head around it, even with the effort of giving explanations by the people who wrote it. I bet if I'd had a LLM of today's standards, I'd have been able to explain or even refactor the code into something that would have been much simpler and much more comprehensible. \n\nSo, conclusion: it's a double-edged sword. The question is whether we really need the in-depth knowledge about the code base, considering the fact that we're gonna lose the details anyway after a couple weeks or months not working with it. As long as we have a thorough understanding and documentation of the concepts that are used, not why line 104 does exactly what it does, it should - in my humble opinion - be enough. For everything deeper we already have the necessary tools and processes that help us keep the quality at a level that we're fine with. ",

(pre-llm).  They're one of the few rust people that has been especially interested in 'agent' coding.  (And so they're a useful example for me -- I know they can make good things.  Their opinion holds weight.).\n\nOne of the things Armin mentioned recently \\[heavily paraphrased by me\\] was that people who have the ai-coding fire lit in them (of which he is one): one of the things that they're excited about is the roughness of the landscape.  The layers upon layers of obfuscating abstraction weighed on serious work.  Part of what feels so productive is that ... a lot of the llm coders \\*aren't\\* yet doing serious work.  They're doing rough work.  \\[And that feels okay, because we're in an exploratory phase.\\]\n\nSo it's not clear to me that the claims of productivity and excitement are quite apples to apples right now.\n\nRelated, I was just talking to someone who's all about vibe coding.  And they were excitedly describing the systems they're setting up and outlining how, eventually it's going to just do everything on its own and create great code.  Their excitement comes from their partially built pipeline and exploratory outings.  Not from having made anything that they like.\n\nThere's also examples like this from \\[Jon Gjengset\\]([https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT](https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT)): it's a 3 hour coding stream.  In it they try to port a library, with test suite, from one language to another.  There's a lot of redirection and fixing and insight required.  But they claim that the task would be almost undoable by hand.  I don't know how to feel yet.  But it's *interesting.*",

I paid more until I was able to show my employer how valuable it was.\n\nIf $200 a month MAX plan isn't enough for you, you are working too hard or doing something wrong. \n\nI finally lot of my own projects also but try to avoid burnout. I genuinely love programming, for the last 25+ years now. Developed proprietary software my whole life. I no longer have to be a syntax money and a slave to the keyboard. \n\nMy role as a full stack dev shifted more to planning and design of the systems, as well as being the tester I always needed that I never had before. Much more testing, much more planning, much more refactoring.\n\nThe total cost, I say, really, if a $100 MAX plan doesn't last you the whole week, your employer is working you too hard. $200 gives me some buffer during the 5 hours.\n\nIf you have a proper CI/CD, you can do almost anything. Having a proper dev, staging and prod environment should make it so it doesn't matter if your AI wipes the database of leaks the test keys or deleted the whole drive. Your repo is backed up, your princess is in another castle.\n\nPeople just don't have the domain knowledge to use AI safely and they think programming the syntax is the hard part, but AI can do that. The difficult part is planning and utilizing with the right technologies and process. There isn't money you can pay to buy that and while maybe an AI can give you hints on how to pull it off, it isn't going to greenfield your repo with the proper precautions and envelope encryption and multitudes of backups, etc. - if you don't know you need caching and how to cache what, where... Then the AI, current models, ain't just do it for you. \n\nMoney can buy everything in life... *Almost*. Common sense somehow is surprisingly expensive.",

The initial HTTP handshake → 101 Switching Protocols → full-duplex flow is something a lot of devs use daily (via Socket.io or similar) but never actually understand at the protocol level. It would fit perfectly with your existing format.\n\nAlso, the HTTPS section could benefit from showing the 0-RTT resumption failure case — what happens when the server rejects the early data and falls back to a full handshake. That's the part that catches people off guard in production when they're debugging intermittent TLS issues.\n\nReally nice work overall.

The protection comes from that binding layer, not from raw SQL itself; so you still need to be disciplined.",

At some point, you have to turn results into objects to do work, and whether or not that's using pre-built conventions or rolling your own mappers it's not something you can escape.\n\nThat said, I would divide the spectrum of ORMs into four rough groups:\n\n1. Tools that use SQL as the exchange language (e.g. raw JDBC or pg_query).\n2. Tools that use languages like SQL, but not SQL itself (e.g. Hibernate HQL).\n3. Tools that build queries in a way dissimilar to normal collections (e.g. Knex, SeaORM, Hibernate).\n4. Tools that build queries in a way similar to normal collections (e.g. Entity Framework).\n\nEach of these has their pitfalls, but generally as you go down the list safety and discoverability of the API increase, and as you go up the list transparency increases (what you write is more similar to what the database executes). Since I value safety more than transparency (much like how I prefer garbage collection to manual memory management), I lean toward the bottom end of the list and tools that more tightly integrate model definitions, migrations, and queries/statements with the language I'm actually doing work in; it's a much better experience to have a compiler catch most potential problems than to let them happen at runtime.\n\nThe best experience comes from mixing #1 and #4 like is possible in Entity Framework: most of your simple queries and updates can be handled as if you were just handling lists and objects in-memory, but the escape hatch is there to skip generation go directly to SQL when necessary for things like stored procedures and features not yet supported by the rest of the ORM.",

Some types of image resources are even entirely public (public S3 bucket) as these can also be included in emails, though most are access constrained. How are we as a relatively small startup supposed to protect ourselves from malicious users using this ability to host child porn or even become used as a sharing site? Normally before you have access to a project and thus upload ability, you would be under a paid plan, but it’s probably relatively simple to get invited by someone in a paid plan (like with spoofed emails pretending to be colleague) and then gain access to the ability to upload files. Is this even a realistic risk or would this kind of malicious actor have much easier ways to achieve the same? I am pretty sure we could be held liable if we host this kind of content even without being aware.",

That makes sense now in hindsight because I was learning fundamentals, syntax, control-flow, looping, etc.\n\nSo when I got to my first startup i was frustrated because I couldn't use by then you could pretty much just do the same thing in vanilla js.

It represents a simpler time when you didn't have to F\\*%@ing build a scripting language.  If you are building CRUD apps that don't require complex interactions its goated.  Sure, you can just use fetch and es6, but you're missing out on some real gold.  Here are some highlights taken from the docs.\n\n* **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.\n* **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.\n* **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.\n* **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).\n* **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.\n* **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.\n* **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(\"slow\")`.\n* **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.\n* **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.\n* **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.\n* **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.\n* **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(\"ready\", ...)` or similar will not be triggered.\n* **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.\n* **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.\n* **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.\n\n  \nAlso you can use jQuery with htmx.\n\n",

So people start chanting \"jQuery is bad\".\n\nFurthermore, jQuery can't do what React can. At least not easily. It isn't designed for complex state management. The people also started chanting \"just use React\". React became ubiquitous is almost all kinds of web projects, small and large. It's vast ecosystem also makes it attractive. You can show off \"mad skills\" in animation, 3d graphics or large data management very easily with the help of a few React libraries.\n\nHowever, I don't really get why the people behind it love it so much since it also makes your website/app much more complex and you lock in into React for the future. I got it when it was a small framework, but now it tries to cater to all edge cases most devs never encounter. Thus, smaller libraries came up that provide a thin layer of the reactivity React also offers. Especially those who respected the vanilla, so they will never be \"out of fashion\", such as Alpine. The og, Preact.\n\nMost modern front-end JS frameworks are React wannabes that learned their lessons. I'd suggest you adopt progressive enhancement, maybe with a small js library (especially for existing code), and off the races.\n\nReact should die off just like jQuery.",

          "text": "They solve different problems.\n\njQuery's main added value was providing the \"missing\" bits of the DOM API, and brushing over the myriad of implementation differences between browsers. This used to be a big deal back then, but the missing bits have been added since, and web standards have taken care of practically all platform differences. E.g., dynamically attaching a click event listener to arbitrary DOM elements used to be difficult, but these days, you just go `elem.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`, which is pretty much the same as `$(elem).click(function () {...})`. Likewise, back in the days, finding an element in the DOM through anything more complicated than an ID or a simple \"first child of that element with this class name\" would have been extremely verbose, so you would reach for jQuery and say something like `$('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, but now you can go `document.querySelector('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, and it'll do the same thing.\n\nSo all that's left is slightly more compact syntax and familiarity, but pulling in an entire dependency just for that is not worth it in most cases.\n\nAlpine.js and HTMX offer a completely different approach to DOM manipulations - with jQuery and vanilla JS, things are mostly imperative: do this, then do that, insert this element into that element, set this attribute on that node, etc. These libraries, by contrast, allow you to mostly skip the JS part entirely, defining most of the behavior declaratively as part of the DOM itself. You can, in fact, build entire interactive web apps with these libraries without writing a single line of JS yourself. They also take care of some of the trickier bits, such as dealing with error responses, delaying DOM manipulations to allow some time for transitions, blocking or cancelling requests when they start superseding one another, displaying spinners to indicate ongoing requests, etc. None of these are super hard, but getting them right can be annoying and gets old quick.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong; there is a lot of criticism on both Alpine and HTMX; one valid concern, especially with HTMX, is that it discourages client-side rendering, which can lead to unnecessary network traffic and server load. E.g., if you want to paginate your content, the way you would do that with HTMX is render the first page on the server, serve that up as HTML, and hook up the \"next page\" button to request the next page, which then gets rendered to HTML on the server and sent up to the client. With a more client-centric framework, you would instead serve the entire dataset as JSON, in one go, along with the initial request, and then chop it up into pages and rendering the right one on the client, without any further network traffic or server load required to flip through those pages.",

Declarative libraries don't require you do do all these steps, instead you have a central state variable, and and when a user interaction changes that value, all those elements x, y, z that use that variable are updated automatically by the library's internal reactivity system.\n\nImperative libraries are more likely to lead to \"spaghetti code\" as a page grows more complex, as you have to remember and manually code for all the downstream updates when anything changes. You either just write this code haphazardly as needed by a page, or you start creating design patterns for app-level implementation, an example being the publish-subscribe pattern (\"pub/sub\"). You can see some of these patterns in older library examples in \"Learning JavaScript Design Patterns\" by Addy Osmani. Some of these patterns are now internal to these frameworks/libraries, and these abstractions allowed devs to approach coding with a declarative style.

          "text": "I will echo what others said (it was really really good 15+ years ago) but give some extra context as  to why it was so good back then and why those things that made it good don't matter today.\n\nI first used it in around 2009, when we needed to support IE6/7/8 and firefox and chrome. They all used js (and css but not relevant here) slightly differently and the options we had were \n\n1. Make different js files for each browser\n2. Memorise the differences and do a check for browser inside each method and adding the different code in a bunch of ifs\n3. Use Jquery\n\nDoing some things (like ajax requests or animations) were incredibly difficult and it was so hard to find a working solution. Stack overflow wasn't anywhere near as big as it is now - people were still in the phase of finding answers on random blogs, or even buying physical books on coding.\n\nAlong comes jQuery, and let you write the code once and it works in all browsers, and everything that is hard to accomplish is wrapped in a one liner. Everyone rejoiced and we all jumped on board. It got even more useful for a few more years as we had to add support for IE9 and 10 and some companies wouldn't drop support for IE6 for far too long.\n\nThe trade off was performance. We didn't like that the user had to download an extra file (these were the days before fibre connections so that file could add an extra second to first open time) and everything was 100x slower using JQ. A lot of things were so fast that 100x slower was still 0.01 seconds so it didn't matter, but for the things that would take 1 second in vanilla js it could take 30s+ in JQ. It made systems more easily maintainable, so brought value in the eyes of the managers for a slight trade off of certain things being really slow. These were the days when everything was slow anyway, and you didn't lose customers for a page taking 5 seconds to load. Overall it was worth it for the saved development time.\n\nToday's benefits are very different. You can do things in 1 line instead of 2 like your example `$('.button').click(function...)` instead of `var button = document.getElementById` then `button.onclick = function...` That is literally the only benefit I can think of. Most browsers are based on chrome, and the ones that aren't still follow the JS specifications properly so you don't need to maintain different versions of code. Things that used to be difficult are now easier to do, and really easy to find a working example online of how to do it.\n\nThe trade off is still performance - last year I rewrote a jquery function that was replacing all td within a table using a vanillajs function and brought the execution time down from 30+ seconds to under 1 second. The performance that was previously worth it for saving hundreds of hours of developer time and increasing maintainability is now a performance hit just so that a developer can write things in 1 line instead of 2. It just isn't worth it any more.",
