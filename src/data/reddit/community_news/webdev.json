      "text": "I worked for a boutique e-commerce platform. CEO just fired webdev team except for the most senior backend engineer. Our team of 5 was laid off because the CEO had discovered just vibe coding and thought she could basically have one engineer take care of everything (???). Good luck with a11y requirements, iterating on customer feedbacks, scaling for traffic, qa'ing responsive designs with just one engineer and an AI. \n\nBut the CEO doesn't know this and thinks AI can replace 5 engineers. As one of ex-colleagues said in a group chat, \"I give her 2 weeks before she's begging us to come back.\" \n\nBut still, the point remains: company leaderships think AI can replace us, because they're far enough from technology where all they see is just the bells and whistles, and don't know what it takes to maintain a platform.",

FE dev by training, but did _everything_. Front end, Shopify backend, product management, seo optimization, ADA compliance, discounts and promotions, 3rd party app management, etc. Basically anything that touched the website was my responsibility.\n\nThe Director of Marketing thought she could handle that stuff (mainly because of the Shopify custom development I had set up), so I was laid off.\n\nFrom what I heard, she lasted 3 months before she either quit or was fired. Unsure which.\n\nI was out of work for 7 months.\n\nFortunately, I landed in a position which is 1000% better. Part of a team working for a well known company. I only build front end components now. I don't have to wear 12 hats anymore. Work life balance again.\n\nGood luck to you!",

It’s not for everyone, but sometimes, like here, you get this opportunity anyway. I had a strong tendency to be „loyal” to my employer. It doesn’t work like this in capitalism.

When hundreds of billions of dollars flow into an industry and CEOs are selling big promises and shiny demos, the people raising funds benefit first, not the teams doing the real work.\n\nThat narrative makes non-technical leadership believe complex products can run with very few engineers, ignoring everything that goes into accessibility, maintenance, iteration, and scale. AI can help, but it does not replace engineering judgment or ownership.\n\nJust one reference that explains this gap well:  \n“There is enormous pressure on companies to show that they are able to replace employees with AI tools.

Obviously, it was not a good idea to fire all of the fronted developers en masse, but I feel too many of you have your heads buried in the sand. AI can (and will) successfully replace many developers. I have been a web developer since ‘95 and was a client (web and mobile) architect for a Fortune 20 company for the past 9 years. \n\nJust because this person in charge was obtuse about her decision making doesn’t mean your days are not numbered. We had 10,000 web developers in our organization, and wouldn’t be surprised to see more than half of them (probably 2/3) reduced by 2030. \n\nWhen you take capable devs and pair them with Opus 4.5 you can remove a junior or mid-level developer from the team. Sorry, but that is reality. If this CEO was smart, she would have given each developer the proper training and access to Claude Code and in three months she could have reduced her frontend team to 2-3 developers. This sounds like a very small shop, but of there were product owners, they would be able to take the place of some developers as well. \n\nLearn to use the agentic coders, qa, devops, and product assistants. Bend them to your will using systems like AgentOS from Builder Methods or other similar PROCESS-driven approaches to age tic development. You might be surprised by how capable they are right now. \n\nRemember, developer capabilities are a bell curve. This technology has the potential to remove the lower tail of that curve today. By 2030, we will be left with the upper tertile.\n\nEdit: I expect to be downvoted into oblivion, because Reddit, and the level of complacency and insouciance in this forum. I’ll wear every downvote as a badge of honor because those that do are the first ones who are going to find themselves retraining for that barista job. (No shade to baristas)",

          "text": "Years ago I was replaced as an FTE freelance developer on retainer with a set of outsourced developers from very far away. It was pretty abrupt. The cost reductions were significant. I think those developers charged maybe 1/10th what I was asking, and I was already underpaid given my education and experience. \n\nAbout a month or so later I was contacted by the CTO asking how much I would charge for on-demand consultation to help these developers understand the codebase, requirements, and local culture. I asked for 2x, and was promptly ghosted. Apparently, urgent matters are not urgent if they cost money. Developers are constantly pushed to be more productive, efficient, and available, but that isn't a two-way street. If you're running a business, you can go without a functioning system for weeks if it means saving a little money. \n\nIn my example these developers were not unskilled. They were good developers. Good developers can learn any language, principle, system, or technique, if you pay them to do so. It wasn't about the language barrier. They spoke English perfectly. But there is a cultural difference that causes friction. What incentive did they have to adapt to the local culture? To understand the needs of users? To adapt and anticipate issues from demographics they were totally detached from? Were they even ever in a position to do so? Lots of friction. \n\nWe're witnessing a new cycle of outsourcing developers overseas, but this time with AI. Companies will absolutely choose AI slop if it saves on costs, even if it destroys the business in the process. They can go without a functioning system for as long as it takes to save on money, even if that means the business closes. There's always another company to consume later. \n\nYour CEO probably isn't going to come back 2 weeks later and beg you to come back. If they do, it will only be for so long as they can get the AI slop machine working at a bare minimum. A decision has been made to undervalue developers, and no amount of reality will change that decision. We like to believe that companies will learn the hard way their mistakes. They won't. It's best to put your energy into finding your next role.",

It's very good at writing things that have already been written, or taking half-formed ideas and correcting the syntax and looking up usage. But it's not creative and the wild tangents it can go on are often a big time suck. Managers need to hear that AI is a great set of tools for devs to use, but for any nontrivial codebase, nobody's agent-moding out major changes who didn't have the skill to write them in the first place (and it's often slower).",

Which is what I would advise to everybody who is now looking for work: go for something that you know will need people in the next 20 years. Which means more specialized jobs and assignments and getting the knowledge to take them on. Because sure, AI can't do much on its own now, but eventually the tools get better and people who don't know better, will be fine with what it can come up with. Most people don't need anything fancy. They just need it to work and to get found and/or sell stuff online. Thats not where the fun of this profession is going to be at.",

I say this as someone that was laid off from Java development all the way back in late 2023 (along with 75 others on the same day), and that was EARLY.

I feel even worse for the ones in it now with a year left and already see their prospects drain away before they even have the degree in their hands. Must be how a gender studies student feels normally! (I'll let everyone decide whether this is in jest or not for themselves.)\n\nJust remember, human labor for web dev and coding in the AI revolution are the white collar equivalent of wanting to use a shovel to dig, a scythe to cut, and an oar to row after the industrial revolution. The tech for machinery and steam at first is not as common and primitive with questionable success rates for replacement. But it shortly became the case that anyone in 1940 (and certainly way earlier than that) using a scythe to collect crops or a shovel to dig a ditch is just a luddite, stubborn, and frankly not a farmer/constuction manager to take seriously moving forward. No one in their right mind would hire a human to do what a machine can do in literally 1/16 of the time at cost. It's not even ethically questionable anymore - you yourself would never expect them to, and rightly so.   \n  \nWe are early in the AI revolution, but it IS here, and you can't stop it. This all just gets worse, and I HIGHLY suggest some of the more stubborn and smug I see in this comment section to take that more seriously. Because by the end of 2026, the CEO of this company won't be the laughing stock, she'll be the one laughing. But take solace in the fact that it will come for her too. In the Industrial revolution, new jobs were created for reskilled workers. But what are we to do when the new jobs created can ALSO be taken by the tech that made them obsolete? I don't know. Crazy, SCARY times we live in.",

However, this has been the growing trend for decades. However, now it’s exponential and non-tech people are impressed by what they can see. This excludes the wild Covid hiring boom with crazy low interest rates. Terrible time to be a junior and companies aren’t figuring out what’s next \n\n(B) Also hard for the frontend devs as not all frontends are equal. Outside of highly specialized marketed projects, backend developers might have to shift more to full stack for the same pay \n\n(C) the bottom 473 companies of the S&P 500 are growing slower than inflation. AI is a great excuse to lay people off in mass…and undue the mass hiring of boot camp grads from the pandemic. Obviously, some self-taught devs are amazing, but it’s easier for companies to eliminate entire departments than make nuanced decisions on individual basis. Mass punishment on employees for their mistakes. This economy is a facade being held up by the AI buzz. \n\nDeeply knowledgeable developers with business domain knowledge will remain vital and probably have to rewrite slop",

On top of that, when new versions of Catalyst components were released with bug fixes or improved functionality, I had a hell of a time having to recustomize them again.

I really liked it to get inspiration because they had clever interfaces for common UI challenges and I wanted to support them creating more. But then they just stopped updating it and did some pretty basic templates I wasn‘t interested in. Their HeadlessUI and HeroIcons projects also had potential, but never quite hit the same mark as Shadcn and Lucide Icons. Then they tried to challenge the Shadcn/Radix success again with Catalyst, but didn’t move fast enough and to this day don’t have close to the amount of components Shadcn offers. All in all it feels like it lacked a clear direction to build a solid ecosystem and in the end they had a wide range of projects that were worse compared to the commonly used solutions. \n\nBut I think that‘s just the fate of UI Kits in general unfortunately. Instead of focusing on the core of creating elegant variants of UI elements, everything gets bloated up into templates, libraries, paradigms etc. Similar thing happened with OriginUI (https://coss.com/origin) Started off as a really nice and structured list of UI elements and now it‘s part of some convoluted system. If people went to you for the basics, this is your core product - don‘t use it as a hook to reel people into something „bigger and better“ and abandon what they came for.\n\nI just hope this doesn‘t affect the future of Tailwind itself, as I don’t want to go back to writing SCSS 🥲",

Catalyst was a total disaster IMO.\n\nHis best hope now is sponsorships because the whole ui kit thing is a dead end, as are the templates.

The need to be profitable and to have to provide a livelihood is a serious hindrance to progress now. Think about it, what good incentive is there for people to put nice open source or at least free tools and frameworks out for people? The people doing this now are literally doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts. Things like Tailwind and even Postman etc. that we all take for granted all had to come from somewhere.\n\nAdd to that the complete betrayal from the likes of stackexchange and even Reddit and the rampant theft from AI companies, what benefit or incentive is there for you now to put out articles how to use a framework, how to build a site using this and that package, or a backend and the like? They are all scraped by AI companies to shove it into Claude and Cursor to give you a shitter version of it that you have to babysit to get to work anyway. But you are paying Microsoft or OpenAI money, not the person who wrote an article on how to make custom Tailwind classes or whatever. The people writing these articles do it for clout of course so that maybe someone will hire them based on the vast amount of demonstrated knowledge, but also just because they want to. Now they have even less reason to do it, I can fully understand that a lot will grow really bitter and spiteful over it and why should they write articles only for it to be stolen so that 4 corporations make all the money?\n\nUltimately this leads to a shitter industry because the people making these nice tools stop making them, because they too are having to find more jobs just to live, they make them paid and sell them to shit companies that will make these tools more and more shit over time. And we then don't have nice free frameworks to choose from but a very regimented, overmonetised, fraudulent marketplace where everyone claims to be the best and tool interoperability is solely based on commercial agreements not actual programming.",

I learned a lot from playing around with Tailwindcss when I first started getting into webdev and bought his original design book and ui blocks back in the day.\n\nI'm listening to his actual podcast right now and he lightly talks about AI, but I'm looking at the current Tailwind plus paid product line right now and at a glance I can't really tell whats significantly different from when I bought it years ago.\n\nIts easy to say in hindsight and as an outside observer, but I think the other vibecode tools like Lovable, Bolt, v0, etc. kind of gobbled up the Tailwind paid products, along with all of the foundation models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini all outputting artifacts and components that were usually styled in tailwind.  \n  \nIt feels like over the last year tailwind was pretty slow to adapt and innovate in the current AI landscape overall and kind of played it safe just releasing similar pure design products and templates.  If you look at both the regular and pro sites there is no mention of AI related components, blocks, or templates, so they are already missing out on users who want to build AI and chat style products.  Just as an example, NuxtUI already has a template built for chat applications:  [https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/chat](https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/chat)   \n  \nI was always expecting them to release their own AI powered design tool similar to v0 but maybe something like that wasn't really on their roadmap.\n\nAnyways... thats kind of my rant/thoughts on AI and wish the best to the team and I'm sure they will find some new cool products to work on going forward.",

More often than not too much imo. Yes, I have seen good websites and technologies go. But I also seen good ones come in return.\n\nWhat used to and still does attract me to web development is the fact there is so much to do. So many ways to be creative, so many ways to reach people. For example, I never ever could imagine that one day we would have fully [3d](https://threejs.org) websites, apps and games all running in the browser. Stylesheets evolved from basic markup to animations and JS evolved to an entire OOP language with a lot of possibilities.\n\nHaving worked in multiple languages and with multiple frameworks, web to this day is still my favorite. Nodejs has become my tool of choice and being able to setup a web server for example so quickly is wild. And while I do sometimes miss the good ol' days of PHP4 websites I also feel pretty excited with all the opportunities we have today.",

While everyone's obsessed with the latest framework, the real pain point for most businesses is still connecting their tools. We're drowning in 800+ integrations across different platforms, and nobody's really solved the \"make it just work\" problem.\n\nThe irony is that AI could actually help here - not by writing more boilerplate code, but by handling the mundane plumbing work. True AI automation for everyone would mean less time configuring webhooks and more time solving actual business problems.\n\nWhat specific wheel are you finding yourself reinventing most often?

We’ve spent the last 15 years optimizing the hell out of the TCP handshake, shaving milliseconds off TLS, and putting edge caches everywhere.\nBut fundamentally? We’re still just polishing the same blocking paradigm: Ask for data -> Wait -> Get data.\nThat works fine for a generic SaaS dashboard. It falls apart completely if you’re trying to build anything \"deep tech\"—think massive IoT swarms, high-frequency trading, or systems that need to work over high-latency links (or even just flaky 5G).\nI’ve been toying with an architecture I’m calling Holographic State, and I want to see if anyone here has tried building this in production (probably in Rust or C++).\nThe idea is to completely ditch the \"database as destination\" model.\nThe Stack:\n * Local-First / CRDTs: You don't await db.save(). You write to a local ledger. The \"truth\" is local first, consistent later.\n * UDP Transport (No TCP): TCP is garbage for high throughput because of the ACK loop. If you’re waiting for a confirmation packet from a receiver that’s 500ms away (or light minutes away), your throughput tanks.\n * Fountain Codes (RaptorQ): This is the missing piece. Instead of retrying dropped packets, you just spray the data stream with mathematical redundancy. If I send you 15 packets and you catch any 10, you reconstruct the message perfectly.\nWhy do this?\nBecause physics.\nIn this model, you don't care about latency. You don't care about dropped packets. You just \"emit\" facts about the state of the world, and any node listening on the frequency catches up mathematically. It’s effectively a 10M QPS firehose that doesn't break when the network gets noisy.\nIt feels like the industry is scared of UDP because it's \"unreliable,\" but if you layer Fountain codes on top, isn't it actually more reliable than a fragile TCP connection that hangs on a timeout?\nHas anyone here implemented a pure UDP+RaptorQ transport for event sourcing? What were the pain points? I’m assuming the CRDT tombstone bloat gets nasty after a while, but looking for war stories.\nLet's argue about it.",

Been building a desktop application to improve my software development skills and off course I host my custom built family share web application on a VPS. But yep every idea has been repeated to the point its all just noise; a fart amongst a tornado.  AI is a useful tool if you already know what your doing; but I agree there is too much vibecoding slop. Where it all goes from here is anyone's guess... Personally i think most vibecoded projects will fail miserably or need experienced devs to rewrite half or all of it.  But Lets not pretend there wasn't and isn't plenty of slop out there before AI -- now its just be increased 10 fold. \n\nthe core of the problem to me seems to be the mentality that web development is easy/cheap and every little operation seems to think they can be the next Amazon or have Amazon level features on a shoe string budget. Maybe i am just bitter because i work at a cut rate place that's hardly hanging on. I dont see much of a future.",

I believe the thing people want most in this annoying digital economy is a return to simple products which don't cost a fortune and don't become faulty after two years. \n\nIt sounds like you're someone who's really dedicated to progress and wanting to make a meaningful influence on the industry you work in ... Pls be one of those coders who focuses on trying to make the industry better for everyone 🙏- the people who put their time into personal projects to help make something which everyone needs more affordable. There's nothing I love more than seeing a new product which is 50% cheaper than it's biggest competitor, and better quality too. \n\nThe best kind of innovation I can see in the tech industry right now is a fight back against the larger companies who keep exploiting lazy ways of marketing and customer retention like forcing subscription payment models, using our metadata to target adds and prey on our impulse to buy shit we don't need. \n\n... I think we've done enough innovation as far as actual usable products go for now. What I believe needs to happen now is some balance in the market, the larger companies who have the most capital have way too much leverage over people starting from the bottom in their garage, and they keep normalising predatory payment models, along with bad quality tech, over engineered tech we don't need, I could list examples for hours. \n\nI just think we're in a situation where the tech industry is so intertwined with our economy, the companies who have the most leverage in the industry can literally dictate how the market works. And the more this continues the more economic power will consolidate in the big businesses, and it'll eventually become almost impossible for someone to be successful with a startup. \n\nThis new 'digital economy' doesn't allow for fair competition in the market, and it's also almost completely impossible for the government to regulate ... So I think the best thing we can hope for is people collectively voting the right way with their wallet, and also counting on the very dedicated engineers who want to make services which are more accessible and affordable for everyone.",

It was great when it was WFH, but then after just 3-4 months the RTO mandate hit.\n\nGoing to the office, sitting 9-6, coming back to an empty room far from my hometown, I felt like a machine. I was spiraling into depression. It wasn't burnout from coding; it was burnout from the lifestyle and environment.\n\nSo, I did what everyone says to do: \"Follow your dreams.\" I resigned. I chose my mental health over the money. I decided to build my own SaaS products and freelance.\n\nHere is the reality check 3 months later:  \nI have built a website to help developers (not going to promote it here). In my opinion, the code is clean, the design is solid, and the functionality is there. but even after that  \n**Users? Zero.**  \n**Freelance clients? Zero.**\n\nI realized too late that I love building, but I absolutely hate selling. I have zero marketing skills. I can spend 12 hours debugging a complex issue, but the thought of cold emailing a client or making a TikTok to promote my website makes me very uncomfortable. I created some posts on LinkedIn and Reddit, they even got some impressions but nearly no website visits.\n\nMy brother told me yesterday, \"**You’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a developer.** Go join any startup.\"  \n  \nI’m sitting here burning through savings, wondering if I traded depression for anxiety. It feels like the system is designed to crush people like me. You either submit to the soul-crushing office culture, or you starve trying to make it on your own. **Has anyone here successfully transitioned from a quiet, introverted dev to a founder?** Or should I just accept that I’m meant to be an employee and find a remote job?",

The later is harder and requires your product to be really good which you should be aiming at. \n\nMany people miss the SEO pieces and think it’s just about content marketing after the product is built. It’s not, It’s apart of the product! How can your product, in a sensible way have a bunch of pages that don’t feel out of place? Category pages is always a good start. \n\nInitially you need to be looking for product market fit. Do people want to buy what you are building? How do they feel about it? What do they like about? Not like? What would they like to see? What problem does it solve? Is it a band aid or a vitamin? \n\nAll of this can be answered very cheap, it’s user research, so whatever you can to get it in front of other people.\n\nAlso, this isn’t about your friend circle, step outside of it, find a meetup, co-working space with other startup people, even online if you don’t live somewhere where it’s convenient. \n\nTake a look at the book the cold start problem.

Your brother isn't entirely wrong but he's missing something important - you don't have to choose between being purely a developer or forcing yourself into uncomfortable sales tactics. There's a middle ground that works really well for introverted devs. Instead of cold emails or social media promotion, focus on solving problems in communities where your target users already hang out. Answer questions on Stack Overflow, contribute to discussions in relevant subreddits, maybe write some technical blog posts about challenges you've solved. The key is building genuine relationships first rather than pitching. At Twine we see loads of successful freelance developers who've built their entire client base through word of mouth and community involvement rather than traditional marketing. It takes longer but it's much more sustainable for people who prefer authentic connections over sales pitches. Your technical skills are valuable, you just need to find the right way to connect them with people who need them.",

Most likely, you will be able to get them to list several things.\n\nAt that point, pick a couple of the easier needs and tell them those areas would be no problem for you to improve, and you would love to show them solutions next week. Plus, that you  MIGHT be interested in looking at more of their needs, too, but that you want to show them how easy it is for you to help with their goals before, giving a broader overview. \n\nThen you best be as good as you elude, because you need to impress with the simple \"foot in the door\"...low cost solution.

I gained moderate success from being myself in its extreme.  which ended up being unique in that sector. In my case, everyone is mostly shills and self-promoting and I was telling the truth and unique. and it really did work precisely because I never cared if it worked. And that taught me something. That you don't have to conform to have success and actually its the opposite, if i did conform or try to be like  others I wouldn't have had success. Because of the dissonance and how it doesn't fit me. What you think you're lacking is actually what sets you  apart. use your weakness as your strength\n\nso for example, with sales, figure out what feels most comfortable for you. I think the reason people shy  away from things is that the way it's normally done doesn't feel right with them personally. but if you do it in your way you may even love it and surprised by it. So it's not that you're 'not a marketing guy', it's that you aren't those marketing guys\n\nI guess what I'm saying is it's actually a fallacy this concept that there are certain types of people who do something because it's often the  case the people who are unnatural that become exceptional.

          "text": "Hey, buddy. Bear with me, this is gonna be a longer message.\n\nSo, here’s the deal… you’re only 3 months in. That’s honestly still very early. Finances aside (I know, hard to ignore) I wouldn’t fret too much about degree of success/failure just yet. The first year or two is always the hardest for the majority of “entrepreneurs.” I put that word in quotations because even though I started my own business this year, I don’t like attributing a term like that to myself. I just call myself a designer & front-end developer.\n\nAnyway, one important thing to remember is that “everyone moves at different speeds.” I was told that by a friend/roommate when I was lamenting over the fact that I’d be graduating college later than everyone else in my class because I needed to take a year off for my mental health (yes, there’s some irony there). Although I felt like the world’s limpest noodle, those words struck a chord in me that allowed me to forgive myself, both then and in all endeavors onward.\n\nNow, moving onto more practical things… much like you, I consider(ed) myself highly introverted. Similarly, I’m not even comfortable sharing my work/business on social channels. Cold calling was definitely out of the picture; and even though I tried a total of 7 calls, it was paralyzing. I think it took me 4 hours and A LOT of cigarettes to muster up courage between calls. They yielded nothing. Eventually I made my one and only post on a Facebook group which resulted in a competitor seeing my portfolio and inviting me to coffee. He explained to me that networking was his jam.\n\nEven though the idea had been pitched to me by friends, it wasn’t until I had that direct dialogue with someone who had a “tried and true” method did I even really consider it. As you might anticipate, it (networking) sucked simply because I was trash at it… which really just meant I had a learning opportunity in front of me. However, I didn’t sit down and read on how to network/sell/etc. I know that I’m a kinesthetic learner, someone who learns by doing. And so, I just kept going and going and going until I fumbled enough but eventually got better at it. You could also say I practiced gradual exposure therapy, because my tendency to sit inside my car for 30 minutes before just driving away without even entering the venue lessened over time.\n\nAs I came to find out, networking is actually really straightforward once you understand how it and people work. People will likely give or refer you business if they “know, like, and trust you.” Now every time I chat it up with someone, I just probe them with questions about their non-work-related interests, show enthusiasm, and talk about my own. Now I have ample work, with many new clients queued up for the next few months. I started this year in early April and didn’t get my first gig until August, but it has been full speed ahead since then.\n\nPoint being… I encourage you to see this as a learning experience and step into a tolerable degree of discomfort. Once that eventually becomes less daunting, move onto the next threshold and then the next, so on and so forth. After all, you’re learning (hint hint), so cut yourself some slack. This isn’t stuff they teach everyone in school.\n\nWith all of that said, you can always fall back on finding another full-time, salaried role if you either don’t feel ready yet or don’t think this world is for you at all. Another nugget of wisdom I heard recently is that “there are so many ways to make money,” as long as you don’t let ego get in the way. Part-time at a grocery store, full-time with a startup, reselling, working behind the desk at a gym, etc. I guess that’s a slight tangent, but it was a comfort for me to hear, so I thought I’d share.\n\nI’ll stop myself here. But feel to DM me if you’d like. Happy to do whatever I can to help you out, even if it’s just as a sounding board or someone to lean on. Regardless though, you’re more capable than you believe. You just haven’t necessarily found the right business avenues, positioning, or strategies yet.\n\nCheers!",

Seek employment that has a strong culture with good mentorship and utilize resources like life coaches to set personal goals and help deal with any anxiety when you feel like you are out of your depth when it comes to building your interpersonal skills at work. Some companies may even subsidize or cover costs for sessions with life coaches. Oftentimes they are through apps like Lyra Health so you don't even have to do it in person. If you want to be more entrepreneurial the skill that you will need to hone the most is influencing/motivating stakeholders towards a common goal and making them feel involved in the process so that you can design, build, and market a product.

In the interim, as I built up a client base I found some freelance gigs in data annotation (there are a few platforms out there, but DA is the one that took care of me the best) to make ends meet.\n\nEnded up taking advice from u/Citrous_Oyster and instead of trying to make big sales up front, I got people on subscription plans for about $200/month which includes a static brochure site (price doesn't include artwork, which they have to provide, or complicated things beyond a static site like e-commerce setups, which are a one time fee to design and setup). Targeted small businesses and companies that were just opening up (I get a list of business names registered in my county once a month directly from the county). Turns out people are willing to pay $200/mo for a website if it includes hosting, basic SEO, updates, and better performance than a Wordpress/Squarespace site as part of the package. \n\nBut I still have to make those cold calls, and I've got to do it over the phone or in person, because nobody reads cold calls in their email. Luckily with word of mouth I don't have to do it as much as when I started.\n\nI've got about 10 clients right now, so that's bringing in about $2000 a month for no more than 15 hours of work a week across the board for all ten clients (besides the initial site design and launch, which only takes a day or two). My only overhead is my hosting plan on Knownhost. It's been a gateway into freelance software development jobs and weird Salesforce programming gigs. The best part though is that it's allowed me to find gigs for my freelancer buddies who hate also selling (a graphic designer, a photographer, a software engineer, and a data analyst). My business is really just five freelancers in a trenchcoat.\n\nIf I had stayed in the corporate world it would have killed me. I'm much happier now, but it was a long road to get there, and getting way out of my comfort zone is the price I had to pay to get here.",

          "text": "Similar story here. I had 8+ years of dev experience and finally decided I wanted to do it on my own. I had an idea that came from a real-life need. Being “locked” in the back office, I got disgusted with dealing face-to-face with the general public lol. I knew it would be difficult, and I knew I needed to do much more than just have a “good” product. I knew development was just the tip of the iceberg. For instance, I hated speaking on the phone with all those dumb end users who obviously had no clue how great the software was.\n\nSo what did I do? I decided that if I couldn’t overcome it, I’d be stuck building someone else’s wealth forever. So I forced myself to answer all incoming calls. After a few months, it turned out I actually started enjoying it. Same with preparing for face‑to‑face selling. For fun, when I was in a specific environment (because of the nature of the software), I was promoting the company’s product. No pressure — just for fun and experience. I noticed that if you relax and don’t force yourself to sell at any cost, it starts coming naturally. Just be open, relaxed, and promote your work while keeping in mind that you don’t have to sell — just plant a seed. If they need it, they’ll come to you.\n\nJust remember what Darwin said — the ones who survive are those who can adapt.\nAlso remember the story behind Angry Birds: the company made about 20 other apps before they finally lifted off.\n\nOne more reality check: I work from home, I do dev work, I call customers, and if I want to get up, I go and target potential customers face‑to‑face. My aunt told me when I started this endeavour: “Remember that working from home and self‑discipline isn’t for everyone.”\nOh boy, how right she was lol — I had to learn that too. Now I see that my office days were basically constant holidays.\n\nDon’t give up on your dreams , and best of luck.",

          "text": "> You either submit to the soul-crushing office culture, or you starve trying to make it on your own.\n\nA less dramatic way to say this is: you either do something somebody tells you they value or you convince people what you're doing has value. The only alternative to that choice is to do something nobody thinks has value which is obviously problematic.\n\nPersonally, I have tried both. Working for myself was fun for a time, but it's extremely stressful. You don't get to go home when the clock says so because all problems end with you. You have to fill any shoes or have the premium to pay others to do it for you. There is no \"good performance review\" that gives you comfort that you're doing fine... you could always be doing more or doing less and need to find the confidence in what you're doing. There is constant uncertainty. Nobody else is supporting you and you could be losing money seemingly overnight. Not only is nobody supporting you, but you don't even have a coworker or boss or employee to bounce ideas off of or talk through stressful situations with. So, even though I loved the challenge of working on technical, marketing, legal, financial, etc. aspects, the amount of stress that came from the responsibility and uncertainty was too much for me. My plan is to hopefully at some point do that kind of thing on the side again so I don't have to feel my life depends on it, but to live off of the more reliable and lower stress employee work.\n\nFWIW though, not all cases of being \"an employee\" are the same and \"office culture\" is not some singular thing. I've generally worked on teams where I'm the dev, but everybody else has different specialties (e.g. art, writing, marketing, video). As a result, the culture of my workplaces has been very different from a lot of people who work in tech oriented organizations where there are tons of meetings about storypoints where argue about GIT conventions and code reviews. Instead, because I'm the guy in my team who has this skillset, I'm basically entrusted to be self-directed. I can go a couple of weeks without talking to anybody if I wanted to, but I have some regular meetings that I myself set up with certain people just to stay in the loop on things. My previous job was similar but I was at a lower level and the team was more integrated but it was the same kind of thing: we'd meet once a week to talk about our aspects of the project with each other, but otherwise it was self-directed. The rest of \"office culture\" was just optional choices to chat throughout the day. I think if you find a smaller organization or an organization where, like I am, you are kind of a unique role there, then you might find the office dynamic is different and lends itself better to independent work. The culture of working at a web dev company vs working at a university is going to be very different.\n\nIt's also a matter of getting to know your manager in your interview. I had one manager who just said \"I trust you because I see the results\" and met with me a couple times a year to talk about project for 10 minutes. I had another manager who also trusted me but met with me twice weekly to chat about how things were going, why they were going how they were, etc. The culture of the office depends a lot on how you work. But don't make the mistake of thinking that a fellow introvert will best handle you. You want somebody with social awareness so they can pick up on your needs and help you integrate in your own way with the team. An extrovert might balance you out by enjoying doing the talking you don't want to do. The difference between an extroverted boss and an introverted boss might be \"I'll mention that to [other manager] so you can get what you need for the bottleneck\" vs \"you can call [other manager] and ask if they can have their team work on that\".\n\n> My brother told me yesterday, \"You’re not an entrepreneur, you’re a developer. Go join any startup.\"\n\nBased on your description, that sounds fair. It's not just about being introverted or not. Even if you magically solved the salesperson part of it, being an entrepreneur means you need to be comfortable changing gears to whatever the bottleneck at the moment is... accounting, taxes, contracts, law, art, customer service, distribution, market research, etc. If you have any sense of wanting to just stay in your lane, it doesn't really matter what your lane is, it just doesn't work when you're the only one. Also, the marketing aspect of running your own business doesn't just mean talking to people: it means that you need to figure out the market and make the product the market wants, so there is plenty of room left for it to be \"soul-crushing\" if the market paints you into a corner.\n\n> Should I just accept that I’m meant to be an employee and find a remote job?\n\nI think you need to recognize that isn't not as black and white as you say. As an dev employee, I was once the tech lead on a huge project. I was in charge and needed to accomplish it and coordinate it, but I didn't have managerial control over all of the stakeholders. So, I basically spent 2 years being a \"salesperson\" within my own company convincing various stakeholders to prioritize my project and coordinate with me even though I was technically a dev. As a freelancer, there were times I was very beholden to the whims of very specific major clients and felt less free than when I worked a 9-5. The \"office culture\" various a lot based on who is there, the role of your work within the broader company, your industry, etc. And even the split... like I said, I've done both at once at times rather than putting my all into just one path or the other. So, while I do agree with your brother that it sounds like maybe you're not really interested in being an entrepreneur and are doing it for other reasons, I think you have a lot more choices than the two extremes you seem to be defining.",

At the end of the day you need users and to make money, so if you are too shy to ever ask for that, it's gonna be tough. However these days there are lots of GTM strategies (think - sales) that are more catered to less outgoing founders. \n\nFocusing on building a community around your open source software or discords based on whatever problem you're solving are dev-centric and technically driven sales environments that you can leverage your skillset with. Obviously they don't work in all cases though so you'll need to do some of your own work trying to figure out which are the best for you & your business. I made a little tool for myself to help track some of the primary channels & rank them that might help you find a few that align with your interests - [https://debugg.ai/tools/founders/gtm-channels](https://debugg.ai/tools/founders/gtm-channels) . Just beware, this isn't school. You don't get credit for how much work you do, so if you pick a channel that's unlikely to work for your business just because you think you'll enjoy it, that's destined to fail.\n\nUltimately you need to get good at determining if what you 'believe' is really something you've convinced yourself because you are avoiding the harder option like doing more sales. Listen to advice but internalize it with caution. \n\nGood luck!",

Here is the hard truth about the transition you are trying to make:\n\n**1. The 'Full Stack' Lie** We tell ourselves we are 'Full Stack,' but we usually mean Database to Frontend. Real 'Business Full Stack' includes **Distribution**. You built the Product (Backend), but you have no Gateway (Marketing) to let traffic in. A server without a public IP address gets zero requests, no matter how clean the code is.\n\n**2. Stop trying to 'Sell' (It crashes your OS)** You mentioned TikTok and Cold Emailing. Those are 'High-Social-Friction' protocols. As an introvert, these will drain your battery in 20 minutes. Stop doing them.\n\n**3. Switch to 'Engineering as Marketing'** You are a dev. Use *that* weapon. Don't write LinkedIn thought leadership; write **Documentation**. Don't make TikToks; build **Free Tools**.\n\n* Create a free, mini-version of your tool (a calculator, a validator, a specific script) and host it.\n* Write a technical deep-dive on a hard problem you solved while building your SaaS.\n* Post *that* in dev communities.\n\n**4. The API Handshake (Co-Founding)** If you are the Wozniak, stop beating yourself up for not being the Jobs. You might not need to 'get a job,' but you might need to 'open an endpoint' for a non-technical co-founder who *loves* selling but can't code to save their life.\n\nDon't go back to the soul-crushing office yet.

I’m a full stack dev s as well (MERN/MEAN/?AMP) and it’s actually kind of rare for a “client” especially small businesses to think they have the need or budget for your skills. You may be better off building your own platform, application, or SAAS instead of seeking clients. I can tell you from experience. If it’s a really small business, one or few people operation they’re not going to understand just how far ahead you could set them. Usually they want a barebones, low value, “I just want a website so my friends think I’m legit” website. Usually contracts are available with our skillset but then you don’t feel like an entrepreneur, you’re a worker but aren’t an employee. \n\nOne thing I’ve found is don’t listen to people who don’t do what we do. You already deal with some jealousy because we’re 6 figure earners and may not have to leave our homes to do so. So becoming your own boss with this freedom is jarring for people that have to commute into an office or job site to get paid. \n\nThe reality is once you’re a full stack dev you’re either already an entrepreneur or well on your way. The only difference is are you building your dream or someone else’s. Are you patient enough to own something, provide value and build equity. Or will you get the comfort of a steady paycheck that can sustain me for the time being but provides nothing residual. It’s a choice we all have to make multiple times during this journey. Trust me, dev jobs come and go and you’ll feel the pull of entrepreneurship between each one and definitely during each job. Good luck, God bless, and I’m rooting for you. 💯💯💯",

It's horrible. We live on the relative paradise. \n\nSecondly try to consider the possibility that your work doesn't have to be a source of meaning but, rather, a source of resources to find that meaning. I don't **LOVE** my job, but I do love the financial stability it gives me to pursue the things I actually love. That gives me time and resources to spend with my family. That is something I love and I'm thankful to my job for it. \n\nI think you need to do some soul searching and perhaps establish some priorities. Maybe things aren't such a dichotomy as they seem. Perhaps you can have a rewarding job at a startup, an NGO or perhaps some coold field like aerospace, robotics or AI. Something that feels rewarding to you even if the pay isn't as good. And then look for meaning outside of work and try to view work more as means to an end rather than as an end in it of itself.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Though not generically right, but right \"for now.\"\n\nYou clearly went and decided to start a business without knowing what it means to start a business. You mentioned 3 months later you have a product, but no clients. That sounds to me like you spent 3 months building a product without doing much research, planning, and market analysis.\n\nImagine if you sat down to write a webpage, but turns out you don't know JS or CSS, and you've only heard of HTML once. That's basically where you are in terms of your understanding of business, and the process of starting and operating it. Now imagine someone like that comes to you and asks you for help. Would you waste your time on them? \n\nMy suggest is NOT to find a partner with complementary skills, at least not right away. In practice, such a partner is likely to just sideline you once they understand that you can only offer dev help. Nobody else is likely to take you seriously until you an exhibit more understanding of the skills you appear to be lacking. Instead, take some time to learn about what it means to run a business, the types of planning you need to do, and the things that need to be true in order to more onto further steps, as compared to the things that must be true for you to dump a project as lost. This means you're going to need to practice speaking, presenting, and selling things.\n\nOnce you get to at least a basic level of familiarity, and once you have a few project ideas planned out (and I do mean a full business plan, not just words in your head) that seem like they might go somewhere, that's when you should try to find people to help. Ideally someone that you can speak to easily, and who will genuinely try to see you as an eyeal.",

The anxiety is not a thing to try to escape, rather, to work with. It is ever present in human life. I visualize a musician going on stage with a severe case of stage fright. You see the anxiety. You tell yourself, “good, I’m taking this seriously.”  Then you don’t tip toe out on stage timidly, you walk out there and own the thing. This can be practiced and improved over time.

Coding all day felt fine, but the moment it turned into pitching, cold emails, or trying to hype myself online, I’d shut down.\n\nWhat ended up working for me wasn’t forcing myself to become a salesperson, but finding people who genuinely like selling. I partnered with folks who enjoy talking to clients and closing deals, and my team and I focus on the actual work. We basically work together under a white-label setup.\n\nThat was a big mental shift for me. You don’t actually have to be both the builder and the seller to make this work. A lot of people push the solo founder narrative, but in real life, complementary skills matter way more.\n\nIf you love building but hate selling, I don’t think that means you’re meant to fail or go back to corporate. It might just mean you haven’t found the right setup yet.",

So you do, only to find out that thing you were so good at isn’t even 10% of what your job is now. Totally different skillset. I always recommend for most people find a good home or track and stick with it, you’ll be much happier. A different kind of person starts a small business (not better or worse, just different). If it’s for you, you already know it. If you’re not sure, then it isn’t for you. Most executives in fortune five hundred companies don’t even have what it takes.

A lot of people grind for months or even years before anything properly clicks.\n\nOne thing I’d seriously think about though is pivoting away from building for developers and towards non technical businesses. Devs are a hard audience. They’re opinionated, price sensitive, and often just build their own thing anyway.\n\nYou might have more luck solving a very boring, very specific problem for brick and mortar or physical service businesses. Stuff that saves them time or hassle. Keep it focused and simple. Local businesses especially get overlooked, but they actually pay, stick around, and care more about results than how “clean” the tech is.\n\nI think a lot of devs feel they need to build something huge or global. In reality, small to medium businesses can be more than enough to make a decent living if you solve a real problem well.\n\nAnd honestly, there’s no shame at all in going back to a remote job if that’s what keeps you sane. Forcing yourself into founder mode when you hate selling can be just as rough mentally as a bad office job.",

But I am trying to get out of it and this post is one of those steps.👍  \nIf you are interested in my portfolio you can find it here: [https://pushp.dev/](https://pushp.dev/)  \nPortfolio not updated recently as I was busy working on  projects.  \nfor recent projects you can check: [https://www.uilib.co/](https://www.uilib.co/) and [https://securetoolbox.vercel.app/](https://securetoolbox.vercel.app/)",

Go and watch the free Startup School videos from YCombinator to get an idea of how to reset your expectations on what is required. The videos will mention \"founder market fit\". You will likely need to do some iterations to find your market, which is fine because many founders have to do this.\n\nSales doesn't require a suave personality. Some of the best performing sales people practice what is called consultative selling. This involves learning what a customer needs and recommending the right solution regardless of whether it is your product or not. With this honest approach people will remember you and refer their friends who have the type of problem you can solve. If the referrals don't happen you at least gather data to know what the real problems are and what motivates buyers.\n\nThe cash flow is a different issue. When you started this hopefully you should have had one year in reserves. If that wasn't the case you need to bring in cash or reduce your burn rate. Options include reducing expenses, getting a part time or full time job, taking on consultant work, securing grants or startup funds, adjusting your price (price discovery), putting dollars into marketing what you have, pairing with a sales oriented person, or what ever else you can do to stay afloat. Hunger, anxiety and need will force you do what is needed to survive. Follow where the money is and adjust your expectations from there.",

          "text": "Entrepreneur and product builder here. So I git laid off during the crypto winter working as a UI/UX Engineer. I decided not to go back to a job and went on a sabbatical. What I've done differently was that I started contracting. It gave me a stable income to rebuild myself, and only last year did I decide to go all in on my business. I'm ambiverted (51% introverted 😂) and I realized quickly that I have to be comfortable with the uncomfortable otherwise I'll go homeless and starve. \n\nI love the entrepreneurial drive because I'm a builder at heart, so I stuck it because a job wouldn't give me that fuel. So I started throwing all my chips in on learning sales and started mastering networking. I'd say for an introverted person, try to join a small business network where they meet regularly - even if it's just for a seminar. One sentence can change the trajectory of your business. Or you could partner with a sales person, and do a cash percentage agreement. I currently have 4 freelancers nkw that work for me who I just share income from my invoices with as they bill me per hour and I bill with a markup to my client - I needed to do that because I quickly became an employee in my business and it was draining the life out of me as I was no longer making room to dream and build on new things.\n\nSo what I'm doing different this year is I've hired my mom for a 6-month percentage based agreement and she is damn good with admin and paperwork and writing stuff. So the plan is to put her on drafting proposals, grants and tender documents. My strong suite is relationship building, dreaming with clients, business development etc. Then she get a small percentage on the awarded projects she drafted for. Less risk for me. After 6 months we'll possibly look at a salary.",

The best code in the world does nothing if nobody uses it.  Being a good engineer means being able to communicate the value that you're creating.  If you can't clearly articulate that and have mental blocks even beginning to do it, then you need to realize you are not a good coder.\n\nMaking a polished short video is not always quick or easy, but if you can't take one step out of your comfort zone to unlock any value from your work, then you will always fail.  This is not a \"zero marketing skills\" issue, this is \"my attitude towards marketing leads to skill issues\".\n\nThe alternative is that your product doesn't have a value proposition, nobody would buy even the best demo, and you never found out if you have product/market fit.  This is the scarier one, but you didn't take any steps to derisk the past 3 months, so time to look this possibility in the face.\n\nExecuting a marketing plan isn't \"hard\" in the same way calculus is, you might suck at marketing, but it is necessary step, a minor hurdle required to be jumped in order for you to progress.  Sucking at a skill  is the first step to being kind of alright at a skill and you have forgotten that.",

Years ago.\n\nBut we all fell for “move fast, break things” and “government sucks” (now that I see the alternative I feel so differently now) and “some benevolent corporation or billionaire will support it if it is worthy enough.”\n\nDepartment of Stack Overflow - not because it is warm and fuzzy, but because it makes us better and stronger, no matter how much we complain about it.",

On Stack Overflow you voted to close the question and went on with your life. You knew that either the OP of those questions had to provide the information, or eventually end up question-banned. So incomplete questions happened a lot less over there in my opinion.\n\nOr the amount of repeating questions on here is also quite crazy.

I built things I cared about, experimented, and actually understood what I was making.\n\nWorking as a programmer feels completely different. Real-world projects are rarely about clean design or interesting problems. Most of the time it’s legacy code, bad architecture, rushed deadlines, and fixing bugs in systems no one fully understands.\n\nInstead of building something meaningful, you’re gluing together hacks to keep a business running. Over time, this killed my motivation to code for fun at all.\nHas anyone else felt that professional development drained the joy out of programming?",

Plus the salaries and job security were abysmal.\n\nProgramming had been a hobby of mine from an early age too; I enjoyed it and was good at it, but wasn't passionate about it.  Which turned out to be fortuitous because I switched to software development as a career 25 years ago.  It's been decades since I stopped coding as a hobby but I don't miss that at all because it was never a passion of mine.  It's now just a decent way to make a living that I don't mind doing for 40 hrs/week.  And on weekends/vacations I get to enjoy my real passions: hiking, camping, or canoeing in the wilderness.",

I often take on challenging worm no one else wants to or fears because it's a huge opportunity to learn. Earlier this year, I migrated my entire team of this all in one monorepo, dependency management platform we'd wrappe source own custom spaghetti around. Most knew it was a problem, but didn't want the headache, didn't feel confident, or didn't beliwve in it enough to try to try the buy in. So, I just accepted the challenge. Now we're more than 6 months ths past, running strong and it's barely a thought in our day to day.

Those two paths lead to very different outcomes, money-/promotion-wise and joy-wise. \n\nIf you work *for* the mgmt., you'll see them as emptyheads that don't know shit about fuck (and many times, they don't, but looking at them as that, makes you one of them). If you work *with* the mgmt., you will see them probably more as ignorant rather than stupid and that's fairer, as ignorance is worked out in teams, while stupidity is a trait only stupids think they lack. Make yourself a strategic partner, as cringe as it feels or sounds for us techheads. It's the only way to work your dream job, and trust me, it's easier than job hopping into the next illusion. Still, you might have to change jobs for better paychecks, but at least you'll develop the often-forgotten soft-skills-hard-skills bundle of actually producing business and career value at the same time, and that, makes interviewing like a ride in the park the more senior you become.",

The worst outcome is your user's data gets exposed because you didn't use constant time operations or whatever.\n\nHaving said that, it is a bit of an oversimplified slogan.

It took me so much longer than I would have liked that I decided to rewrite it in TS + React when I came back to it again after another few months.

TypeScript helps ensure you don't accidentally treat a \"string number\" as a float and lose money due to floating-point math errors.\n* The \"C# Feel\": Since you have a background in C#, TypeScript probably feels like \"coming home.\" It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (the same guy who created C#), which is why the syntax for Interfaces, Generics, and Enums feels so familiar to .NET developers.",

I’d probably start by saying that **DataGrip isn’t entirely free**, at least not for people who work with it professionally or generate revenue from the products they build. Most developers using it day-to-day are doing so via a paid JetBrains licence, whether that’s personal or through work.\n\nBeyond pricing, the bigger difference is philosophy.\n\nDataGrip is essentially a database *IDE*. It’s extremely powerful, but that power comes with weight: lots of panels, configuration, background indexing, and a fairly steep cognitive load. That’s great if you want everything under the sun in one place.\n\nDB Pro is intentionally different. It’s built to be fast, focused, and pleasant to use.\n\nI also want to add Dashboards, a team-sync, Workflows (think automating things you do every day), an acceptable AI integration with guardrails, and other features that DataGrip doesn't have.",

The cookies came out chewy in the center and crisp at the edges, and they tasted like being known.\n\nThen came the “Bits n Brownie Bytes,” which sounds like a tech start-up but is basically emotional sabotage in dessert form. Little brownie chunks tucked into cookie dough, like tiny pockets of joy. I brought them to a backyard hang and suddenly people were laughing like they actually meant it. That’s when I realized these cookies weren’t just treats, they were a way of making life softer and keeping people close.",

I know there's still the \"Request desktop website\" option in iOS Safari but I never use it and just tried in when I happened to be on Reddit in Safari and it did nothing. (Second page I tried was Google and that one does load differently.)",

It's not a big loss if the mobile versions of sites are getting just as much thought and attention as the desktop ones, but still a departure from what was then seen as progress.

Companies now have entire departments, or hire PR firms that do the same thing, dedicated to injecting their sales pitches disguised as unassociated contributions into places people thought of as discussion forums. \n\nThe same way people dont give a shit about google any more, reddit will also lose its relevance as it just becomes a medium for companies to shill their garbage. Social media is such garbage now that if someone wanted to create a twitter/facebook/reddit that had competent anti spam/bot measures and took the arms race that occurs between corporations advertising and organic discussion happening seriously they would probably find success as all the other platforms let their product go to shit and just coast on their market share.",

It will take your vague context free request, assume it makes perfect sense, and do its best by grepping through the project to gather the info it needs, it will eventually get tired of this and then it will just take a stab.\n\n\nThe way to use it is to assume you have an extremely talented developer who doesn't know the project at all but can hit the ground running if you give them the right info.

As for time spent, I see no radical improvement that does not also come with garbage code.\n\nI guess the biggest change is that *more* people are *more* inclined to approve *more* garbage. Not a very positive change, but also not devastating.\n\nAs for the personal projects, let me tell you, these colleagues ship nothing.

In a couple of years we'll know more.\n\nShort term projects/prototypes, I get what they're saying but I steer clear.

Because people don’t understand the limitations yet, they feel they’re being victimized or bypassed by this technology, so they’re having a paradoxical feeling of awe or even worship for the thing they think is oppressing them.  They attribute all sorts of qualities to it beyond what it actually has.\n\nIt’s somewhat understandable. Just a few years ago a fairly smoothly functional, fairly unlimited natural language interface to computing was science fiction. I think people are dazzled by the fact that it works at all, so a lot of people haven’t yet noticed the details where it’s still incredibly rough, not just around the edges, but at its core. It really is the perfect tool to tickle people’s confirmation bias and get them to think they’re seeing something that isn’t really there. \n\nI think eventually it’ll pass. I think it’s never going to go away as a tool, it’s too good at the things that actually can do not to use it. I rely on it all the time myself nowadays. But, all the hype will eventually die down. Someday. I hope. Fingers crossed.",

          "text": "As much as I would like to say these are all shill post, I think you will find the opinions on AI usage amongst devs runs the gamut.  It depends on what tool they use, what stack they are in, how much MCP coding they have done, and what their personal bent towards the tools are.\n\nIn the name of objectivity, I like to find unendorsed senior's (both in person and out in the blogosphere) who are pushing the limits of what these tools can do.  Simon Willison is a great example (Django founder), and he's been extremely open about his use, the tool's pitfalls, and the impact they're having on the broader community.\n\nIt's a paradoxical conversation right now, because the bottom line is, we are all finding value in them in some shape or form.  I think the more sobering part of the conversation is the simple fact it's outsourcing something a lot of us have put thousands of hours in mastering... that hurts, no matter how you slice it.\n\nI have a few personal friends who messed with LLMs when they first launched (GPT 3.5), and have just recently got back into them (specifically with MCPs like codex 5.2 high and CC).  To put it bluntly, the jump frightened them a bit.  Those are the little signals I use to build into my own \"how useful are they truly\", because I, like a lot of us, still doubt my near 10k+ hours of coding accrued over 8 years.\n\nDo they need strict oversight?  Do only bad devs use them?  Can seniors use them to a greater degree?  Do they incur tech debt?  Are they only good for MVPs?  Can they be good in production?    Should you review every line of code?  Do they actually produce good code when guided in modular fashion?  Do they produce bad code when the context window expands beyond their capabilities?  Do they speed you up if used correctly?  Do they slow you down when used incorrectly?\n\n\"Yes\", is the paradoxical catch-all answer to most of these, and I think that makes the conversation really hard to navigate.  It's natural to tear them apart, and dissect them to the utmost degree, especially when your life's work, and the skill that feeds your family, is on the line.",

          "text": "I have the same problem with Codex. I think a big part of the issue is that these agents can write not necessarily “good” code but “convincingly good” code. It’s a huge problem. People already struggled to write good, maintainable code before AI exploded. Now, developers are too tempted to just spew AI garbage everywhere and not actually learn what good code looks like. I often have to remind myself to actually dive into docs to understand how something should work, or come back later if I’m im a time crunch. Codex isn’t bad and can boost productivity but you have to know how to use it. It can’t write full fledged complex features with nuanced architecture, it isn’t a silver bullet for refactoring, and it often produces overly complex code for a problem that has a much simpler solution. Ultimately, the agents work best when the developer has a good understanding of the underlying technologies and can provide that needed guidance. Then it becomes a force for good. Otherwise, it’s just a slop machine feigning productivity while it quietly destroys your codebase by making it impossible to maintain.",

It's a different skillset. Just like when I give a shitty \"prompt\" to one of my meat based dev I usually get a bad output.\n\nAnd honestly, most devs overestimate their own skill when they review what the LLM has done or other people's code for that matter. And most importantly it doesn't match up to the average quality of their own PR.\n\nWhat amuses me nowadays is that the first review of every MR is done in CI by the LLM and it has a lot to say about the dev's code quality 😂\n\nAs for my team, it's split, some love it, some absolutely hate it. But the pattern I see is that the one who makes the effort to learn how to use it without putting any emotion into it seems to get a moderate boost in productivity. \n\nIt's not going to replace them anytime soon, because there are still a ton more things to do other than just \"write code\" but imho devs who don't know how to leverage that new category of tool will eventually get left behind.",

It's just silly for them not to expect some dialog lol. They should be expecting a confirmation or refusal from you!\n\nAlso, interviews work both ways, you have had absolutely no info on what you'll be working on/with to give you any say in the matter. I view it as a huge red flag they've not even contacted you etc.",

If they grossly exceed, use one of the nice ways to tell them this doesn't match your expectations when you started.  \nAnother alternative, as someone else suggested, is to offer to do it is a short-term contract position, with you receiving compensation appropriate for the deliverable (deliver these basic functions for this price, then negotiate additional functionality for additional fees.  \nRegardless, letting them know very early that this didn't match up with what you were thinking is good for both of you. They can resume looking, perhaps realizing a full web site has a greater value than they thought.  \nFinal thought: ask the CEO for a coffee or lunch meeting and discuss what they're asking, providing a bit of education on the market as needed.",

I could've written a Node script with Playwright in like 3 hours.

Also, don't rule out any JS dependencies as they can very well do that too.\n\nFor an exact approach on how to find the root cause I can't really help, it really depends if you can set up a test-environment and remove dependencies one by one. You can also quickly rule out if it's from PHP or JS by using curl from a terminal to get the websites content without JS interfering. If it doesn't show up, in the terminal it could mean that it's injected by some JS dependency.\n\nEdit: you even mentioned in the body text that you have an idea which JS dependency causes that, my apologies. Next step would be to research this dependency in the context of the number and maybe open an issue with them, add a couple example links. I assume the element that holds the number should be rendered off screen and is used for the same thing BESbewy is used for, but either you overwrote the CSS (unspecifically and accidentally) or the team behind the dependency did that.",

I wanted something simple, visual + little fun. A tool where you can quickly create, tweak, and export borders without setting up a full GIS workflow or writing throwaway scripts.\n\nBorderly lets you generate and visualize GeoJSON with support for many boundary types and composite maps, so you can layer, combine, and experiment with shapes instead of fighting tooling. It’s intentionally focused and fast to use.\n\nIt’s been live for a bit now, and people are using it in real projects. I’m going to start sharing it more and iterating in public.\n\nIf you work with GeoJSON, maps, or boundaries and want something lightweight, I’d love feedback.\n\n[**interactive playground**](http://borderly.dev/docs)",

That couldn’t then just be an SVG anymore, so maybe it could be a premium feature where the map can be imported as a some kind of zoomable component or library.\n\nOne other thing that would improve the landing page is having a bit more options in the live example. In my case, I tried it and thought, “Oh, really nice, but the border is too thick for smaller states.” I checked back and couldn’t change the stroke width (even though it was actually in the example URL as a query param). I then checked the Explorer, thinking it might be there. The only reason I eventually went to the docs and found out there are a lot more options (and that the playground there is great) was because the landing page is so well done and I was curious about the structure of the documentation. Making the landing page example more like the playground would be beneficial I think.",

So it just that people didn't use it.\n\nSo, if you’re wondering whether adding a passkey is worth it or not, in terms of demand it is almost nonexistent. People prefer other options if available. I think site with higher passkey usage is because they shove it to their users, not equally presented as an option among others.   \n  \nDoesn't mean passkey is a bad auth method, it just that very few people want to use it. We need to instruct / guide them if we want any meaningful usage. \n\n\nBtw about passkey, I thought it would be difficult to implement because of complicated way to decode COSE from attestationObject to obtain Public Key. I mean, reading this makes me want to pull my hair out [https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-attested-credential-data](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-attested-credential-data)\n\nBut then i discover there is getPublicKey() method in the response object, to skip all of that. So it actually very simple to implement even without any webauthn library.",

I have serious concerns about privacy (passkey support and registration can be used to fingerprint devices even if you say no to the popups), and even privacy-minded browsers like Brave have annoying UX flows where e.g. every time you visit [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) you'll get a popup nagging you for it even if you don't want to use it there.\n\nAnd they're almost \"too automatic\". With passwords and TOTP as MFA you had a pretty solid combo that wasn't impossible to hack, but certainly very hard, and you also had the assurance that if you stepped away from your computer and made the age-old mistake of not locking your screen, somebody seizing the opportunity might get into a few things you'd recently logged into, but the MFA is going to stop someone getting into your bank account (probably). The trend now seems to be \"just the passkey is enough\" and while most password managers offer some features like requiring you to add a biometric element (like a TouchID check), the defaults for many managers and sites don't leave me feeling like somebody like my mother would instinctively make good choices here.\n\nI could rant for probably another 20 minutes and I'm sure I'll get some downvotes, but if I was a user of your site, you can definitely count \"people like me\" as in that \"offered the option and declined for reasons\" group.",

IMO \"phishing\" is a very broad term that has been applied to a lot of abuse vectors, and we probably have the media at least partially to blame for that because it's such a great sound bite. From the perspective of a phishing attack that attempts to emulate a target domain (like my banking site) I do 100% agree that passkeys can stop those dead. But that's just one subclass of this category of attack vector.\n\nBecause \"phishing attacks\" can also be things like convincing me to DO something, not just share my user/pass with a site so they can hijack my session. Lately we're seeing a rise of criminals using AI and other tools to really step up the sophistication of their attempts. They're not just becoming better-written and harder to detect (no more \"we bank details need fast fast fast or bad things happen you\"). They're doing things like asking users to do some of the dirty work themselves. If a user can be convinced to do something wrong, passkeys don't change anything to prevent that. One I saw recently myself tried to get a user to add a Webhook to their Github settings, which is pretty insane if you think about it. And I don't personally have evidence to support this, but I have heard anecdotally about attempts to get accounting folks to process fraudulent invoices, HR folks to share sensitive files, etc.\n\nI suppose it's fair to argue we need a new term for them, but they're still technically \"phishing\" and passkeys would not have stopped any of them from happening because they weren't attempts by attackers to hijack a session, they just wanted users to do things that would eventually give the attackers elevated access by other means. IMO, \"please install this Wordpress plugin update (that has a trojan I want to leverage)\" isn't something passkeys could prevent no matter how widely they were adopted.",

In our experience, if passkeys show up next to passwords or social logins, most users will pick the thing they already know. “Passkey” is still a confusing label and \"no email” can also raise fears in people’s heads (they'rre just not familiar with the concpet yet). A few thoughts / ideas if you want to push usage:\n\n* Make passkeys the default when they provide an email address (all other options only after). This way it doesn't make them think and you can immediately start passkey creation (I also wouldn't use the word \"passkeys on the sign-up page. That's for later).\n* For existing users, let them log in with their existing method and then try to upsell them to a passkey for subseuqent usage (something like “Want faster login next time? Enable Face ID / Touch ID”). That’s usually the highest-conversion moment.\n* On login, make passkeys the default CTA when the device is eligible, with clean fallback.\n* Use Conditional Create / Conditional UI patterns where supported to upgrade users at the right time.\n* Also: your “Google” bucket might already effectively be passkeys (to their Google account), so the “passkeys are losing” narrative can be misleading.\n\nIf you need more details, we've produced a ton of content (maybe something is helpful for you):\n\n* Creation/adoption best practices: [https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-creation-best-practices](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-creation-best-practices)\n* Login/adoption best practices: [https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-login-best-practices](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-login-best-practices)\n* Conditional Create: [https://www.corbado.com/blog/conditional-create-passkeys](https://www.corbado.com/blog/conditional-create-passkeys)\n* Conditional UI / autofill: [https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-conditional-ui-passkeys-autofill](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-conditional-ui-passkeys-autofill)\n* UI flow examples (screens): [https://docs.corbado.com/passkey-ui-flows/overview](https://docs.corbado.com/passkey-ui-flows/overview)",

Okay, jump through all these hoops to get Bitwarden to work and also every time you want to use one from BW? You need to get passed the Google prompt and be sure not to disable Google as a password manager.\n- Bad client implementation: Insert a Yubikey using a OTG on Samsung? Yeah good luck with the million of the same prompt opening up when trying to do the login process.\n\n\nThe protocol itself isn't shit, the implementation usually is.\n\n\nThe only place I feel passkeys have been working the best is in Windows Hello. ",

I believe this is the same for the brain, like other organs, and  there may be some studies to support this.\n\nI’ve started a few exercises to try and combat this, in my spare time I try to spend a few minutes a day on chess, Duolingo.\n\nIs anyone else concerned about this?

(We become worse at our actual job, and *they* become better?)\n\nIt's just a feel though, can't prove it much. I still feel more in control working w code iteratively via chat (it's slower, but I feel like it's more of a learning process that won't make my brain as mush; though I can't deny how the aforementioned tools make coding like magic vs this \"slow way\")...\n\nBut is always being dependent on Santa Claus (the LLM) the way?

But I see two clear failure modes.\n\n1 - Ask for too much (or too vaguely), and you become a hapless sorcerer's apprentice, drowning in code you can't really understand, much less command.\n\n2 - Ask for too little, and you're like an aspiring architect who can't stop molding bricks. Bike shedding is just procrastination, dressed up as engineering. (This was my personal roadblock.)\n\nThe idea of AI as a delegation factory, with knobs you can tune to your level of understanding and project's needs, is a great mental model.\n\nIt's not \"just\" a higher level of abstraction.\n\nToggling between the four Rs appropriately, engaging at a level commensurate with your understanding, *that's* what makes for \"good\" AI use.\n\nI find myself drafting ideas, plans, and questions long before I go to Claude now. I take my role as the \"senior manager\" seriously. And it's work! AI isn't permission to be passive and lazy.\n\nBut I am hopeful.

That’s why I’ve resisted using AI all this time. It’s getting harder though, recently I was told in a meeting that I *have* to use AI because we’re going to start many new projects this year and they want me to be “faster” instead of hiring more people.\n\nI don’t like the direction the industry is heading in at all.

They are trying to reach /wp-admin, .env and all sorts of sensible paths for different tech stacks. Looking at the requests there wasn't enough distint info but they seemed at first to come from random countries and IP ranges but then I started noticing they shared similar accept language headers. Cloudflare didn't seem to block this traffic by default but after I added a rule to target such request with a challenge all of the sudden the traffic dropped, less gcp billing so hurray!\n\nTo be more specific my site is in Spanish and I'm targeting zh-cn lang (Mandarin I suppose).\n\nDo you think this would be reliable In the long term?

A site that blocks you based on that is actually doing you a favor: they don't have any Chinese content, so you don't want to scrape them anyway, and once they block you, you can just carry on and scrape something else, rather than spending resources on figuring out whether there's any Chinese content there or not.\n\nIf your plan is to find websites to compromise so you can use them to spread Chinese propaganda, host Chinese malware targeting Chinese dissidents, launch spam campaigns targeted at Chinese people, break into foreign social media accounts Chinese people may be using, etc., then again you want to primarily target websites in Chinese, and the Accept-Language header serves the same purpose.\n\nOTOH, if your goal is to just compromise as many servers as you can to sell on the black market or use for whatever nefarious purposes, then you wouldn't use such a language header to begin with - you don't care about the language, you just want a target you can compromise, and the language it serves matters exactly not at all. It's possible that an attacker uses whatever Accept-Language header their HTTP client defaults to (and if the attacker operates from China, that might very well be zh-cn), and in those cases, blocking based on that header would actually work (and since you're not serving anything in Chinese, it's not going to hurt either), but it's trivially easy to change that header to impersonate a hacker in the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, or literally anywhere else, because Accept-Language is 100% an honor system. You can block the lazy ones here, and as long as there's enough other low hanging fruit out there, this is going to be effective, but it does absolutely nothing against targeted attacks.\n\nIn other words, the people who do this are either smart enough to *not* bypass your blocks (because they are actually helping them), or smart enough to bypass them (if that's actually helping them), or it doesn't matter because there are enough other targets out there (in which case the block is effective in the same sense as a pair of running shoes when you're attacked by a tiger, as per that popular joke: you won't be able to outrun the tiger, but you'll be able to outrun your peers).",

              "text": "I feel like this is only half true. Yes, those things still exist, but in genuinely far smaller quantities than they used to. If you know what you're looking at, you can recognize patterns in the way many people share \"free\" information in a way that they're actually gaining something from the system. For example, short-form videos that show you a solution but ask you to comment to receive a DM with the actual how-to--just to boost their engagement score. And there are MANY more subtle angles than this.\n\nIn terms of art, it's genuinely more difficult to find things of the same caliber as 15-20 years ago. Back then, you had many people with individual creative visions informed by centuries of classic works. Now, things have become so homogenized and algorithm-driven, creators aren't rooted in the classics and they're not thinking as independently or critically. It's not just that the volume of creators and output has gone up, we've also lost many legends and there aren't successors stepping in like there used to be.\n\nIt is now very difficult to operate in a creative space without this kind of thought pollution dumbing down your work. There is always a bit of internet meta tugging at your brain to make things differently than you naturally would, and it shows in the results.\n\nOn the positive side, though, people's *values* don't seem to have fundamentally changed. When something really good does come along, it typically gets way bigger recognition than its peers (who all immediately resort to copying it). So I still have hope that we can outgrow this phase and reach a period of history where there's a bit more equilibrium and people will draw on the right inspirations again.",

This lets you determine what a specific user has done. If they change their mind, you can either amend that row with an upsert, or perform a soft delete and add a new row. The soft delete option allows you a log of sorts.\n* Each post also has a total number of likes/dislikes, and when you are creating a new row in the previous step, you also amend the posts own total.\n* When you display the total number of likes/dislikes on a post, use the value in the post row itself, not the separate table. If you use the separate table, over time, there will be a performance impact, and you want to avoid that.\n* For the individual user, you can also fetch from that separate table to see if they've made a specific action on the post they're viewing. With the right indexes, this will have no performance issues.\n\nWhile this redundancy in data does violate the single source of truth paradigm, the performance benefits are not to be ignored. Also, if you're ever concerned that something went wrong, you _could_ reconstruct values from the separate table. Essentially, what you're trying to do is avoid repeating the same calculation over and over, which would happen if you _only_ used a separate table to calculate the values.

If I was concerned about the api endpoint getting slammed with junk, I'd ensure the client can debounce, queue and normalize the requests. On an interval, periodically flush the queue by sending everything as a batch updates. If someone slams that like button a million times in a second, the front-end would toggle back and forth but only 1 reaction gets recorded in the queue. The queue could be implemented with client-side persistent storage (localStorage) so things don't get \"lost\" if user leaves, assuming they come back you'll get it eventually. The api would accept {user_id, post_id[]} \n\nRegarding data model, {post_id, user_id, date_liked} unique constraint on {user_id, post_id} the API endpoint does an insert always and on conflict, and toggles date_liked to null (if set) or now (if null). You can have filtered index on {post_id; date_liked is not null} for pulling all likes for a post. Such a thing should be for showing likes on the UI. If you needed to do counts as well, it would work, but with enough rows (millions+) even an index only scan to count rows isn't going to be fast, especially when multiplied by number of posts you need to render - you'll need some kind of cache to avoid excessive counts if you hit that scale. A filtered index on {user_id ; date_liked is not null} to find what a user likes. That index would more be used for showing a list of a user's likes back to them.\n\nIt's also possible to do DELETE instead of upserts with nullable date_liked I suppose? Probably equivalent, I rarely use DELETE statements ,  usually preferring to keep records with `date_deleted` ... a null date_liked serves that same purpose.",

If you know about the Esc key you probably know about the standard exit application shortcut. \n\nAnd it will only work on websites that have implemented it. The other shortcut works on any application. In the few seconds you have to hide the page, you don’t want to mess around thinking “does Esc work on this website or not?”\n\nI guess more options are better.

There is a lot to gain when micro-interaction feels like it clicks, drags, and snaps the same way the pixels do. The whole UI suddenly becomes more satisfying and *real*.\n\nMy new MX Master 4 mouse features a haptic motor, so I created a simple [WebSocket bridge plugin](https://github.com/fallstop/HapticWebPlugin) to enable any website to send haptic events. Playing with it, I've found that any [basic-ass slider](https://haptics.jmw.nz/playground) feels satisfying to use when you can feel the bumps from each tick. Still, the mouse only provides 15 baked waveforms for you to use, with no control over intensity.\n\nThere's always the flip side, though. Remember what happened when we got push notifications: every site instantly weaponised them. Pop-up windows were so abused that every browser had to kill them with fire. If a real Haptics API ships with actual support, how long before an ad network starts serving \"feel this deal!\" vibrations on every load to harvest 2% extra attention?\n\nLong-term view: will we look back at haptic-everything the way we now view 2020 neumorphic blob-buttons, or is tactile feedback the inevitable final layer of UX?\n\nSo, do we start pushing for a proper permission-gated Haptics API tomorrow, or is the web better off staying numb forever?\n\n  \nEDIT: I guess we won't be getting haptics anytime soon.",

It’s the same reason for a lot of limitations on the web platform. \n\nFor example, a few years ago I was building a video platform, and really struggled with autoplaying videos. This frustrated me because I was building in good faith to make a good product. But as I read up on it, I began to understand there are lots of very well thought-out, purposeful limitations; else we’d end up with a bunch of webpages autoplaying adverts with sound as soon as they’re loaded. As frustrating as it is as a developer with only good intentions, I appreciate the effort and thought put in as a user of the platform.  \n\nThe same goes for haptics. I love haptics. I think they elevate an app to an incredible degree, and I’d _love_ to add them to my web apps. But I fully appreciate the day I can do that, is the day my grandma’s phone starts vibrating and telling her she has 278 viruses that need immediate attention. \n\nI’d hope we might one day see support for haptics in PWAs the user has opted to install/add, or perhaps some form of intent system similar to autoplaying videos, but it’s probably not a high-priority unfortunately.\n\nFuck scammers, and fuck scummy marketers.\n\nEdit: to add, I don’t think a permission based system for haptics would be a good idea, as websites already have enough pop-ups for permissions (notifications, location, cookies etc), so adding another pop-up for something 90% of web users don’t care about wouldn’t be ideal - especially as they’d primarily be on mobile platforms, so likely an overlay pop-up rather than a little dialog like chrome has on desktop.",

Postman crossed the line for me once login + sync became non-optional for basic local work.\n\nBruno has stuck the longest in my workflow for one reason: it feels like it was designed for *developers*, not product managers. Git-native collections + no background services is a big win.\n\nThat said, you’re right about docs, Bruno is intentionally minimal, so if you rely heavily on request-level documentation or onboarding other devs, it can feel bare.\n\nApidog is solid feature-wise, but once collections get large it starts to feel closer to “Postman-lite” than truly local-first. Not terrible, just more overhead than I want for day-to-day localhost work.\n\nMy current setup is Bruno for active dev + a lightweight markdown README for docs when needed. Keeps things fast and predictable.\n\nCurious, is this mostly solo dev work or shared with a team via repo?",

Since the domain expired on Nov 21, it stayed in a \"Grace Period\" for about 30 days (which is why it worked until Christmas). Now it has moved into the Redemption Phase.\n\n* **The Status:** \"redemptionPeriod\" means it’s not yet deleted, but \"pendingDelete\" indicates it's in the final stage before being released.\n* **The Provider:** Key-Systems LLC is likely just the upstream technical provider for TPP Wholesale. \n* **The Problem:** A \"Restore\" during this phase is usually very expensive (often $100 - $250+ depending on the registrar).\n\n**My recommendation:** Unless this domain is absolutely mission-critical and worth the high restore fee, **don't pay for the restore and wait it out**.\n\nFor **.dev** domains, the cycle is often longer than for .com (sometimes up to 60+ days total). Since it's already in \"pendingDelete\", your best bet is to wait it out. Start checking the availability daily. Once the status clears, it will become available for regular registration at the normal price again. Just be ready to grab it fast before a bot does!",

Ask your registrar right now if a restore is even still technically possible.\n\n**Solution 2:** Let it go and move to a new domain. It might not be worth the stress if your registrar isn't answering and the clock is ticking.\n\n**One warning:** The \"pendingDelete\" status often attracts automated registration bots (drop-catchers).

But I don't really want to get into that point right now. I saw a meme a few months ago of ChatGPT pro being able to perfectly solve a CAPTCHA, and it got me thinking, I never really saw a lot of people discuss this before. But is AI a threat to CAPTCHAs too? \n\n\n\nThe reason we invented CAPTCHAs is because bots were limited at the time and only a person could look at the image and read the letters, but as AI gets more powerful, it can theoretically reach the threshold where it can solve any CAPTCHA just as well as the average human, making a CAPTCHA seem completely pointless at that point. What does the WebDev world think about the future of bots on the internet, especially after bots have the ability to solve any CAPTCHA. Is there any way to prevent bots at that point? \n\n  \nWe all know how how many bots flooded X (Twitter) lately, and Elon seems to be unable to control it too.\n\nHere's a link to a post about the bot influx. https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1m82ca3/til_in_2024_bots_made_up_a_bigger_proportion_of/ Lol.",

Things like mouse movement, typing rate variability, and other 'human' aspects are analyzed while you interact with the page. There is an idea that Google keeps the games because it helps them train their Waymo self-driving cars, although that's been denied. \n\nAnother captcha method is called proof-of-work. Basically elements like buttons are disabled until your browser runs through some javascript calculations that take a little bit of time -- ideally not enough to affect the user's experience, but enough to make a bot inefficient. PoW has been around since the 90s, and it's the same concept used in mining cryptocurrencies.\n\nCloudflare's Turnstile is a great example of this. When implementing it on your site, you have the option to require clicking a box, just display the widget doing its thing, or not display it at all. I think that reCaptcha also has options like this, but I haven't used them personally.\n\nI do agree that captchas are definitely a cat-and-mouse game, and future tech like quantum computing present huge security challenges. That said, we are far beyond selecting images with bridges to prove your humanity.",

          "text": "If solving captchas were limited to only solving the puzzles on a page then yes I would agree with you that AI could eventually resolve that issue. However Web Scraping is so much more.\n\nTo effectively scrape multiple sites an AI would need to:  \n\\- Be able to control a botnet or swarm of different IP's that are not actively being blocked by a blocked IP list.  \n\\- Be able to effectively change the browser fingerprint of every browser it uses in order to look like a real human.  \n\\- Ensure that it's ability to correctly create a believable TCP fingerprint is top notch.  \n\\- Be able to solve invisible captchas which don't make you solve a puzzle but make your browser solve a puzzle without your knowledge.\n\nAnd there are sure more things but companies are constantly updating their software to confuse scrapers. I think that Captchas as we commonly know them - images that need to be solved - may become obsolete if the cost of AI Captcha solving does not cost too much money, but the real way that websites will keep scrapers at bay will be the very minute ways that security companies use to study the differences between real users.\n\nThe stuff anti-bot providers can read is huge. For an example the site [https://amiunique.org/](https://amiunique.org/) shows a lot of stuff that a browser can read about your system and use to tell you apart from a bot.",

Code doesn't ship without tests proving it works. If you have a good team, that rule can be relaxed a little but given your situation you need to get everyone learning the test framework and adding tests for new work or bug fixes.\n- Work on fleshing out your unit test and integration test layers, save E2E for critical path or user journey testing.

You push them to your repo. This is the \"golden/master\" reference. Then let's say, you have a ticket to refactor divs to semantic lists with all the styling etc. Ticket says it should look the same as before. You run your tests locally (start the app in docker so that rendering issues between Linux (CI), Mac and windows computers do not produce different pixels). See playwright docs. And then, if your component looks exactly the same as before with all colors margins etc, tests will pass green, there will be no new screenshot produced. If there are changes, let's say the background is now black instead of white, test will fail and you see 2 screenshots next to each other and a third one with in red highlights all pixels on the page that differ from the \"golden\" image, that changed. You can then say: oh, my bad, black is totally wrong and fix your css until everything looks like before the ticket. Or you say ok well I want it to be black now, then you run the test again with the option to \"renew/overwrite\" the screenshot.png. this is your new golden. And then you push that to your repository over the old one for that test. On ci, it will also run and notify you every time screenshots do not match (current and golden). This is SO helpful because you recognize errors in components you did not intended to touch but they somehow inherited changes. \n\nYou can advance this by masking some ever changing elements like texts, dates and so on with a pink box. And taking screenshots e.g. when you have an overlay open while typing into it, because it is annoying to tests some things with selectors and colors all manually when it's not that important, it's all in the screenshot.\n\nYou can even compare complete snapshots of the Dom elements, make videos etc. \n\nBut for a start, when no one has time writing tests, just doing some screenshots of the most important things and user events are a big leap forward to mitigate bugs and have trust in your code. \n\nPs: vitest can also make screenshots in between unit tests if you want to combine ... But idk",

          "text": "Testing can be amazing, it doesn't have to be shit.\n\nI work for a big company in big tech, we acquired one of our products, the original company that owned it built out a framework built on top of Cypress. When I joined the company, it was Cypress v10.\n\nI had to do a ridiculous amount of work to upgrade it to v13 as they got rid of a key cookie API that our entire testing framework was dependent on. They also introduced `cy.session` and had it natively hooked into `cy.request`, meanwhile we had this massively hack XHR based request API we were using, in some cases with basic Auth (only in dev / test environments), but also with our own session cookie tracking. This was hideous.\n\nI got it there eventually, and just recently I've updated it again to the latest v13, and now also onto 14.5.4. I've done a lot of work to stabilise our test flakes, we also have our own visual regression framework where we take screenshots (for all themes) throughout our E2E (built on top of / around cy.screenshot).\n\nPlaywright is a solid option / alternative to Cypress, we'd migrate to that if it wasn't for the sheer volume of tests (literally thousands). This is a massive company and a huge product, we're talking > $500k of CI cost a year just for this one team/product (in a company with tens of thousands of employees).\n\nI'd recommend Playwright if you're still early in your development, but Cypress is still a good alternative, as long as you understand how it works, you really need to understand how Cypress queues it's commands, that they aren't promises, and that synchronous code between chained commands will be executed before the commands start executing. You need to strive to follow it's best practices and keep things stable and non-flakey, you need to write your tests smartly, you need your assertions to help you know what fails when something does.\n\n> I write selectors that work, ship them, then two weeks later they're broken and I have no idea why\n\nYour selectors should primarily be `role` based as this will also be testing your accessibility. Make sure you're using `should` assertions before interacting with elements. If you need to click something, do `should('be.visible')` first. If you need to hackily click something whether it is visible or not, you can do `.click({ force: true });` however your tests are best when they accurately interact with things as a user. So don't just force click something that isn't visible but is in the DOM, make sure you make it appear first, avoid `force` as much as you can.\n\nThe thing about `should` assertions in Cypress is, they retry until they are true, up until a timeout (default 30s?) you can configure it in the options. For example:\n\n    cy.get('some element selector').should('be.visible', { timeout: 60000 });\n\nThis will retry the assertion for up to a minute, if it hasn't returned true by then, then it will fail the test. You want to make assertions on your elements to ensure they are in the correct state you expect them to be in before interacting with them. If something needs to exist in the DOM, but it won't necessarily be visible, use `should('exist')`, use `scrollIntoView` where necessary, followed by `should('be.visible')` on a new command chain.\n\nThe next thing I'd note is not to chain dangerous commands that require the same subject. This is documented in the Cypress docs, but for an example:\n\n    cy.get('some element selector').focus().type('some text');\n\nNever do this. Do this instead:\n\n    cy.get('some element selector').focus();\n    cy.get('some element selector').type('some text');\n\nIf you have a case where you need to do a lot of things use an alias like this:\n\n    cy.get('some element selector').as('someElement').focus();\n    cy.get('@someElement').type('some text');\n\nCypress can be good, but it has a lot of niche things you need to learn and be aware of and familiar with. Playwright has a nicer learning curve in this regard.",

Been there with performance optimization on chimii - became \"the guy\" who cares about it, so now it's my problem.\n\n**Practical suggestions:**\n\n1. **Stabilize selectors first**\n   - Use data-testid attributes specifically for tests (yes, it's extra work upfront but saves hours later)\n   - Avoid CSS classes that might change with redesigns\n   - Document WHY you chose each selector\n\n2. **Make tests resilient**\n   - Add wait conditions that actually wait for the right thing (not just arbitrary timeouts)\n   - Test against realistic slow connections\n   - Retry flaky assertions once (not forever, just once)\n\n3. **Make failure investigation easier**\n   - Screenshot on every failure automatically\n   - Log network requests during test runs\n   - Keep a \"known flaky tests\" doc and timebox fixing them\n\n4. **Protect your time**\n   - Block 2 hours weekly for test maintenance (put it on calendar)\n   - When CI breaks Friday 5pm, fix Monday unless it's blocking production\n   - Document everything so you're not the single point of failure\n\nThe worst part? You'll get good at this, which means more of it. Set boundaries now before it eats your life.\n\nBut honestly? Having solid tests is a superpower most teams don't have.

You could ask the company to give you a week to do a training course or something. There is a lot of nuance and best practices to writing Cypress tests and there’s a lot of good courses out there and their documentation is quite good. Once you write good tests and have the CICD set up properly I find it usually makes reviews and any other development go way faster since you can merge stuff pretty confidently without testing too much.\n\nAlso QA engineers rarely write these test just FYI. At most companies QA “engineers” are often just people who manual test apps but really they don’t exist very often. It should really be up to each developer or team to write tests. We had a rule too if someone else broke your code but you didn’t have a test, it was your fault generally.\n\nI’ll also just say with AI becoming popular I find testing more important than ever due to the sometimes huge AI slop PRs we get causing review bottlenecks.

Make the test run three times before it's truly declared a failure. That way when a test fails on a Saturday you can be confident it's actually a problem with the code, not just a flaky test. Therefore the on-call person should be called, not the test guy.\n\nSecond - bring it up. If there's no QA team then everyone's the QA team. Say it's a huge team liability if you're the only person who understands these tests, so maybe y'all dedicate one story per sprint to refactoring or improving the test suite. You're happy to pair program on it but you shouldn't be the one in charge of that story.\n\nThat's what I did. Worked pretty well.",

Some things you might not even realize AI was involved with at all. Those bad projects will die and fade to memory. The projects that provide value will continue to endure, and it's always been that way. Any business that provides relevant work will stay relevant; any developer that builds relevant and useful apps (regardless of how they were built) will stay relevant.\n\nIt's like a high school shop class that recently acquired a new bench saw. A hundred new birdhouses will get built, most of them suck and fall apart. A few will be amazing, and maybe one kid will become a master woodworker.\n\nThere will still be some amazing and beautiful things made in the future. The gold rush will turn into something else.

Most people were already tired of the flood of advertisements, self-promotions and the amounts of posts saying \"hey, I found this website\", but it then being obvious that it's the website creator themselves who made this post. Most people will never see that one post you make on Reddit that one time to show off your actually good website, and most of the people who do see that post will ignore it, because for them it's just another ad.\n\nBack then, there were about **2 posts per month** of people introducing their Sudoku apps in the Sudoku Subreddit. That isn't so much and even that was too much for people to be interested. Maybe a couple dozen people scrolled by such a post, and maybe 5 people actually responded to it.\n\nNow with AI, there is roughly **1 new app posted every day** there! And most of them are pure and utter slop. The regulars on that Subreddit stopped responding *at all* to those kinds of posts because we're all drowning in that shit.\n\nI was lucky to have started *before* all this slop made people care even less than before about new web products.\n\nYes there could be great things in the future with the contribution of AI, but people will not see those things if they are drowning in more and more shit each and every day.\n\nEdit: I still want to say that I like your post, because we really need that tiny bit of hope. :)",

          "text": "So I’ve been equating LLMs utility to that of databases being used for web 2. I think the actual web 3 is more of a chat centric user experience where instead of deep link structured sites you’ll be able to refine ai conversations to a particular topic. That’s not something I think Google, OpenAI, or Meta will just capture I authentically believe it’ll be a combination of the llm models and open source ones being used on paper project basis. That’s where the utility for web based developers will be and the industry will shift paradigms to a point where everyone will have to upskill. If you complain about having to upskill it’s probably because you haven’t been in this long enough to see all of the different things on the web. \n\nWhat I do believe will happen is the actual need for your typical CRUD based developers will pretty much be moved overseas. The complexity of those apps isn’t enough to justify high incomes. Again chat bots, along with another thing that I’ll speak about in a sec, will take over the current experience of the web. The need for those apps will be less. Especially frontend side like react, angular, vue. \n\nThat said, I’m seeing a lot of html canvas based applications these days that displays information differently. I think this will be where a lot of the more talented frontend devs will land. Backend devs will more more towards IoT, real time apps, and create agentic rag systems with LLMs. If AI falls flat on its ass; which it won’t the current bubble is a speculative bubble, you’ll probably see things like phone companies come out with Chromebook like phones that run on cloud based Saas models - given if ai flops there’ll be computer everywhere. \n\nSo imo, you should worry if you’re not willing to upskill. There’s a lot of devs from the 2010s “I’m not learning unless I’m getting paid for it” well they’ll get crushed. Tech will always be cruel to those who refuse to keep up with it.",

There could be some potential there, to go for a more volume/quanitity approach, where you could essential setup and manage there sites (still using wix, wordpress, etc) along with there socials etc, and charge a small overhead fee.

You can modify my starter template that I use for all my projects. You never need forums for small businesses. Dont waste your time. For stores, you use Shopify embed tool to embed a store into an existing website. Keep things simple. \n\nI clone that kit and edit the html and css files to what I need for the new design I have. 11ty handles all the templating and makes working alot cleaner and easier \n\nhttps://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Website-Kit-LESS\n\nIt’s got a working blog system already. For booking you use calendly or square or any other third party software. \n\nNext is the sales part. That’s the stuff most developers fail at because it’s something they never had to do before. You need a unique selling point, and be able to identify problems in a website and explain why they’re problems and sell them the solutions and why you’re uniquely able to solve them for them. If you can solve problems for them, doesn’t matter how nice of a website you make them, they have no reason to buy from you. You need to be able to sell against Wix and other builders and fiver developers. If you don’t have the answers as to why you’re better than them then you aren’t ready to start selling. \n\nJust because anyone can get a site up within 5 minutes doesn’t mean it’s a GOOD website. They have their pain points and drawbacks. I sell 10-15 websites a month despite that. They come to me for my quality work, experience, and service and support. \n\nIt’s possible to make this work. I’m 100% self employed doing it. You start out as an LLC and once you make enough to afford a reasonable salary like $100k a year, and have leftover money for expenses and operations, you elect as an S-Corp to save money on self employment taxes and setup a payroll software like gusto to take out taxes for you an deposit your paycheck into your bank account. You can also get insurance from them through regence health for single member corporations. That’s how I set it up. I’m a w2 employee of my own business and I pay myself biweekly with automatic deposits. I don’t have to do anything. Business currently generates about $35k a month and growing.

Lots of emails, lots of little changes, mostly content and very little code.\n\nIf you like *programming*, then this kind of business model will be a bit of a drag, but if you're good at sales and customer service and you build a decent network and become really successful, you could always be programming more advanced applications for yourself on the side.\n\n**Source:** I run a similar business, but B2B.

Even when they have Wordpress, they will still bug you for edits. \n\nYou don’t need plugins or admin dashboards. Booking is done via third party services like Calendly where you add their link to the site to click on and go to their site to complete the action. E-commerce is done via Shopify embed where you embed a store in an existing static site. Contact forms are handled by an attribute on the form tag that connects to Netlify and they route your emails for you. No plugin needed. And what’s nice about not having Wordpress is you don’t need to constantly update plugins or Wordpress versions and worry about hacking or whatever beef matt mullinwag has with a vital plugin you use and crippled your clients sites. By leaving Wordpress you’re gaining more control over your code, what goes into it, better security, less reliant on external companies to run your business, they can load faster, and be future proof. I have sites that have been online for over 7 years and never touched them. They’re still online and as good as the day I left them. And it’s FREE to host them on netlfiy. I don’t need to set up blue host or anything. \n\nBottom line is there hasn’t been much that Wordpress does that I haven’t been able to do and do better. If a client wants to edit their whole site, I’m not the developer for them. They’re gonna be more work to deal with because what that says about them as a person is they are very hands on and need to control everything. Which means the design and development process will be a lot more work because they have opinions on everything. \n\nWhen it’s just a static brochure website, you don’t NEED Wordpress when the client doesn’t actually want to edit the site themselves. We’re developers. It’s easier for us to edit code so why do we need a cms an extra layer on complexity on the site just to edit it? I get everything and more by doing it myself in my own setup where I have the most control and flexibility. That’s why I don’t use Wordpress.  And my Clients prefer i don’t. They just came from a shitty Wordpress site. Why would they want another one? It’s like buying a shitty car and being offered the same car when it breaks down. It’s just gonna break down again. They want something different. And by providing custom coded options, I’m doing just that and addressing a lot of pain points they didn’t know were pain points that were holding them back.",

Try and find businesses that will find value in what you will provide; website management, design, hosting, email setup, etc. What will you solve for them? Will they never have to worry about their website again, you take care of everything; content updates, etc. Tools like wix, wordpress and ai are just tools. Not everyone knows how to operate a specific tool very good. I'd say those tools are more for DIY. Usually these clients just want it done for as cheap as possible.",

His model basically competes with platforms like Wix and SquareSpace as an independent alternative, and that's great.\n\nIf you are looking to create more complex sites, then your bet is to market to agencies; there's still a HUGE market for custom websites that agencies need, and they don't want to use site builders. That's my niche, and I absolutely love it, as it often dovetails with application development, as well. The extra great part of working B2B is you don't get caught up in the individual client minutia, which can be very taxing. Agencies have teams of more technically inclined people that \"get\" the web better than a small business owner does.\n\nOh, and if you are creating something like WordPress sites, you generate recurring revenue through service and maintenance plans, which is where my ARR comes from between the project work.",

I get asked for apps from time to time and I just pass them off to my friends to do for me. I don’t wanna do apps. Too complicated, too time consuming, and too much work. My time is better spent building and selling subscriptions. \n\nMaking partnerships is crucial. I have designers, others developers, social media, ads, and SEO partners I use for my agency they touch on every aspect of a website and its growth strategies. The idea of an agency is it’s not just you doing everything. It’s a group of people using their unique skills as needed. No developer should be doing SEO, design work, ads, and social media on top of support and sales and development. I always tell People to partner up as soon as you can and find good people to add value to your work and services. Like for large scale apps I just send them to my guy in Canada and take a 10% referral commission. Or I have two other guys on my team that can make smaller custom apps or features and I just charge the client for it and have them do it with a markup. \n\nBy focusing on simpler sites with a recurring subscription I can make more money for my time spent on a project. It’s a shift in priority. I don’t want to make $20k apps. I’d rather spend that time selling subscriptions that will make me more money in the long term and just take commissions and Markups paying other people to do the bigger stuff. Finding app clients or agency work in that high ticket enterprise space is difficult. And if you rely on one agency for your work, you’re not protected from market shifts. What if they close down? Down size? Find cheaper alternatives and cut you out? Now your income stream is gone. I suggest building something you control first and add partnerships as you go. I have many white label partnerships where I build websites first other agencies. But they aren’t my main source of revenue and sales. They’re supplemental. My business carries on with or without them. That’s more secure.",

Since my client base is largely other marketing agencies, the sites tend to be significant in size and a CMS is needed. WP is usually requested, for obvious reasons, although we've been known to dabble with others.\n\nFor example, we're working on the site for [Everett Community College](https://www.everettcc.edu/) (in your neck of the woods, actually! This is the *old* site, btw. New site is not live yet!). \n\nFor all intents and purposes, its a \"brochure-ware\" site, but its absolutely massive. 1500+ pages, individual department microsites, hundreds of editors with unique permissions/roles per department, Code Fusion application integrations, CRM integration, multiple API syncs for their different data providers (e.g. Events and Directory)...the list goes on and on. WordPress was an absolute must-have (are currently on Drupal and can't get away from it fast enough). It's nearing the end but its been almost a year-long project. Once completed, we'll be entering a long term commitment for management (which goes well beyond just content and updates).\n\nAs far as relying on agency work; every business has an achilles heel. I've had many agencies come and go, but we're always doing outreach and have a high rotation. In fact, we just had that happen last year, decent sized agency we worked with went south. It created an opening for another that was waiting in the wings, and we had our best year yet!\n\nBut, you are right about divesting the product offering, which is why I have a [Celebration Platform](https://wallabie.me/) that I've created that's gaining ground, and am working on an education course that I'll be selling with a unique approach to learning technical skills (with a focus on coding/development).",

Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, and now AI have completely flattened that part of the market. If the value proposition is “I’ll build you a homepage, contact page, and maybe a blog”, you’re competing with tools that are cheaper, faster, and good enough.\n\nWhere it is still worth it is when you stop selling websites and start selling solutions. Things like integrations with existing systems, custom workflows, performance, security, compliance, data ownership, or features that don’t fit neatly into a template. Local businesses that grow past a certain point often hit the ceiling of no-code tools and need something bespoke.\n\nThe people still making good money aren’t winning because of Angular vs Laravel or Node vs PHP. They’re winning because they understand the client’s problem deeply and can translate it into a system that actually supports the business.\n\nAI doesn’t really change that dynamic. It just accelerates the build phase. The hard parts are still scoping, architecture, maintenance, and trust.\n\nIf you enjoy programming, building your own generator/tool is still a great learning exercise. Just don’t expect it to compete with Wix on speed or price. Compete on things Wix can’t do well.",
