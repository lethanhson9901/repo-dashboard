Now I see some of my core ideas being used in slop around the web (including reddit).\n\nI've even seen this in the context of a reddit thread, where bots will reuse other people's comments from the same thread. If you post a link, they'll read the link and use the contents of the link in their reply.\n\nIn the case of software, there's so much slop being generated that even if you solve something in the most amazing way, almost nobody will know, because a billion other people are already trying to make money off of built-this-with-ai code they don't even understand, which claims to solve the same issue you're solving. Why should anyone listen to you specifically?\n\nOn top of that many companies run massive astro-turfing campaigns which prey on our proclivity to trust others.\n\nIt gets worse...\n\nEvery company out there is trying to capture as much search engine traffic as possible, so they're churning out articles on all topics, and many of them have very high domain authority, so they will bury any indie developer that does actual writing and research. His stuff will be on page 100.\n\nThose new to the game do the same thing, so they can get some visibility.\n\nAll of this is littering the web with second-hand information that is often altered to serve the agenda of the new publisher, and even if once in a while we get an article that aggregates all the right information, they're a net negative and a burden on everyone. The worst thing is that it demotivates anyone who might want to share some original thoughts.\n\nHow do we get out of this? I've been thinking about it for quite some time now and short of drawing blood every time you want to go online, I don't know what would work.\n\nIs this the end of the information era?",

It must be a distributed, decentralized source of identity that can remain anonymous yet still be proven to resolve to a real person, like a zero knowledge proof of identity. \n\nAnd there must be some method to unveil the actual identity when necessary, so that people can share controversial, embarrassing, or otherwise revealing information with limited risk, but resolution of human identity is prevented without either just cause or the individual volunteering the data. \n\nLike a Byzantine Generals problem, if enough people agree that anonymity must be resolved to a real person, there needs to be a method for that. Like a digital form of a court ruling. \n\nI propose a new approach where the production of currency is tied to a verified distinct living person (\"proof of life\"), and all interactions are monetized against the proof-of-life derived currency. All new currency production is distributed across the register of known real living persons. \n\nNot \"monetized\" in the sense that they are oppressively costly and some intermediary is making some incredible profit by gating access, but \"monetized\" in the sense that running a horde of bots is prohibitively expensive, while acting as a unique real person has a real but valid and manageable cost attached that can be paid against the distributed currency. \n\nThis answer leaves out more than it explains, but it's the only one I've come up with that seems capable of actively preventing bot hordes, supporting real humans, without preventing real humans to use bots/automation in a rational and productive manner. \n\nI could go on at length but this answer is, in my experience, more than sufficient for vast numbers of people to immediately hate me, so I'll stop here unless someone requests detail.",

I feel like we need some time-blocked, closed spaces for people to opt into a shared activity or project, get together, do something awesome, share, and hangout.\n\nI attended a weekend long game jam where the final couple hours was all of us spinning up our games on our machines and walking around playing each others. You got all the perks of being IRL; seeing other people’s work, talking about it, getting ideas, and just nerding out and having a good time.\n\nSimilarly, I attended a workshop where we all built our own little synthesizers out of scrap parts. The host sort of did all the prep for us and we just dug in there and built it but there was still plenty of room for creativity. Our cohort was great and I learned a ton. If I had done the “self teach on YouTube” route enough times to know I would’ve burnt myself out fast on this one.\n\nBoth of these were IRL and that was a big component of why they were so satisfying, but there’s gotta be a way to bring that community back to the internet. Discords are nice but having the intentional “we’re all here within this specific window of time to do this specific thing” is actually really nice.",

In order to keep the 'real' internet 'real' and not just another 'public' internet you gotta first know where to look and then know the password. \n\nI make it sound a lot more cloak and dagger/nefarious than I meant to but my point is yea, there really is no going back from the current state but the ability to re-create the 'wild west' feeling of the 90s and 00s is not gone. Yet. You're just going to have to search it out now instead of just stumbling across it while you were trying to figure out how to do this thing on your MySpace account or goecities page.",

The new challenge, then, is not to pull in information fast, it's to figure out which parts of that information are actually useful, i.e., digging up the valuable stuff from a heap of dogshit.\n\nThat's what the \"information era\" is like. The pioneers of the information age envisioned that just being able to exchange information fast and efficiently would solve all problems, and it kind of did, but they did not anticipate the consequences of being able to send arbitrary amounts of arbitrary information out into the world at practically no cost.",

Even sillier to me is that at least from what I've seen, you have to install sikka onto a system to use any app made in it.  \n\nI have worked on software that we are losing clients to simply because these sikka apps charge less, but increasingly after a few months they come back because the apps are almost always riddled with bugs.",

          "text": "I’d note a few things about vibe coding people don’t really talk about. \n\nNew vibe coders on average produce better results than new engineers. New engineer code quality has always been a dumpster fire at times. Vibe coding being better, even if just a little, has pretty substantial impact on the industry. \n\nA second issue is people ignore is that vibe coders can learn, just like new engineers can learn. They learn what works and what doesn’t. This creates a vibe coder that becomes fully capable of developing full applications that scale well and have good security. \n\nThe primary issue with vibe coders from my experience is that it can be hard to distinguish the ones that learn from the ones that don’t if you’re looking at resumes and portfolios. A non-engineer can never tell the difference. But an engineer sitting down and talking to these people, you can quickly discern the ones that learn and the ones that don’t. \n\nBut at the end of the day, people prefer results. If it costs you $5 for a website that works fine for 3 years then runs into issues, so you spend $5 again in 3 years for a new one, that’s a better deal to people than spending $2000+ for someone to make one today that won’t have that issue later. Then again, it’s worse if you spend that money and the rookie engineer manually programmed the same issue anyway.\n\nThat’s my main issue with the vibe coding criticism I see. The issues vibe coders run into are less frequent, and less problematic, than the issues I tend to see nearly all lower level engineers I’ve worked with. And, unfortunately, the vast majority of freelancer engineers I’ve met (certainly not all) I’d consider far less experienced than the average engineer I meet working at a bigger company. \n\nI also see people around here sometimes treat vibe coder products like something being made to handle 100 million active users when in reality, most people just want a small website / app for like <1000 users, so “scalable” is the farthest thing from a concern these companies would have. A lot of people around here imply that aggressive over engineering is the right path forward when it’s not.",

They also know how to search for answers, and have even some idea if a potential answer they found is right or wrong.\n\nVibe coders fixing bugs and problems have to rely purely on hope and prayers that their beloved machine god fixes their mess. That just doesn’t sound very efficient to me.\n\nSo even though a vibe coder could of course learn and become a better developer, they most likely just won’t even try to. Like that’s the point of vibe coders, right? They don’t want to learn programming and become actually knowledgeable devs, although they most certainly could if they wanted to.",

A CEO isn’t about to become a vibe coder, but they’ll vibe code themselves something and struggle along the way. A vibe coder, on the other hand, does experience issues like other engineers, but they actually try to resolve it using google, AI chatbots, reach out to engineers, etc. for guidance on the issues.

Sometimes the best code or design idea comes in a few minutes of deep focus, not hours of surface-level busy work.\n* Context switching kills productivity. When you’re in flow, you can solve problems holistically. Breaking that for meetings, notifications, or tickets fragments your thinking and increases bugs later.\n* Outcome > motions. If your “vibe” sprint produces clear deliverables or insights that move the project, it’s not slack , it’s efficient cognitive work.\n\nThat said, flow without alignment or measurable outcomes can be just distraction. The real art is creating spaces where teams can enter that state toward a clear, shared goal.\n\nTo the community:\n\n* How do you balance deep focus time with team coordination and accountability?\n* Do you measure productivity by output or by outcome?\n* At what point does “vibe coding” stop being productive and start being avoidance?\n\nWould love to hear how others define that boundary in real projects.",

That's where the value in the kind of service that our kind of shop provides is; sit down with the client, ask questions, offer your own ideas, come up with detail in solutions etc.. If your spec is little more than \"build an AI agent and a website\" then the possible outcomes are almost endless. A tight specification before starting any dev project is essential and one of my concerns about the people using AI (which includes non-developers now finding them in a position to be able to \"code\") is that without understanding how to scope a project, the output is never going to be great. It really is a case of shit in, shit out.\n\nI'm enjoying reading the experiences of dev teams who include vibe coders...",

You would never walk into a place and learn to maintain the perl unless the creator was there and have documentation.  It merited the phrase, \"write once read never\"; therefore, the emphasis was constantly building upon solid modules and extending them for features, or spending a week rewriting the whole thing.\n\nThat seems stupid but Perl is easy to write once you're proficient and that was during the era of no stackoverflow, few forums, and everything was books and memory.  Like the perl cookbooks that nobody uses because they're essentially useless.   You wouldn't read a HeadFirst Java book except if your goal was to purely learn Java.  You would just fire up Cursor and use the new toolchain to write your code.  That's the difference really, companies will have style guides for prompts like \"only use Elixir\", \"only use rust\", so you'll upload large spaghetti prompts of context for the LLMs, and then prompt away.\n\nThere will eventually be birthed a form of structure to it; however, this structure may look like interacting with AIs while they write slop code.  The only caveat is that everything is a blackbox so it doesn't matter what's happening as long as it mimics your instructions.  I'll say this, people will surely know how to express themselves in future IT roles or they won't be around for very long, thank you momma for forcing me to do grammar err'day.",

      "text": "So I just finished repairing my clients website, which involved entirely rebuilding the frontend and the backend and very labour intensive data migration.\n\nIf I could list absolutely everything this previous web dev did wrong, I would need a publisher. But let's go over some of my absolute favourites.\n\nIf you're an aspiring developer, then read through this carefully and make sure you **never** follow in the footsteps of this developer.\n\nFirst, this developer **loved** client side validation. When you would sign in to the platform as an administrator, the only validation happening was on the client side. So if the server responded back that the login was successful, then great! In that case I'll redirect you to the admin panel!\n\nCan you guess what this means? YEP. Admin panel is entirely unrestricted and anyone can freely access it if they want, they just need to *know what the admin panel URL is*. No one is going to be able to find that URL without logging in as the admin though, right?\n\nWell have a guess as to what you think the admin panel URL was. Even if it was `/administrator` it would have a thousand times better than the reality of it. The admin panel URL was `/a`. I am not joking. That is it. So you literally could have just gone to [`domain.com/a`](http://domain.com/a) and you would have been on the admin panel. Not only was that panel unrestricted and being gated behind client-side validation... BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE THE URL EVEN REMOTELY HARD TO GUESS.\n\nWant to hear what makes it even worse? Guess who was a clever one and decided to include that URL in the sitemap so that Google could kindly index it for everyone?\n\nThat has to be by far the worst thing I have ever seen. But there is more.\n\nDo you think he validated anything on the server? Nope. So when you'd log in, he'd just confirm the login endpoint returned successfully (with a 201 status code by the way - he couldn't even get that right), and then he would store the users data inside localStorage to work with the frontend.\n\nSo what do you think he was doing if a user wanted to change their email, or their password? Correct again, those server endpoints were also totally unrestricted. As long as you provided a valid user ID, you could change information for whoever you wanted!\n\nThe guy even returned the users hash in the login request! Why on earth would anyone ever want to do that? He even had a server endpoint... wait for it... named `/users` and that would return all the users in the database, including their hashes. So I had to notify my client that he needs to send an email out to everyone saying their data has been breached, because I spent about 30 minutes cracking those hashes and got about half of them. Yes, no salting or PBKDF2 algorithms either, just plain old SHA512.\n\nWant to hear the cherry on top? He was hashing the passwords on the frontend. So if you logged in, the frontend would hash your password, send that hash to the backend, then the backend would validate \"*do the hashes match?\"* and if so, would log them in... So he's effectively made the **hash** the **password**. Now that on top of the fact he was even returning the users hashes in API responses means you could have just used the damn hash that was returned and used it to log in with 😂🤣 I swear to you I am not making any of this up!\n\nThe damage? My client paid him a total of $40,000 for this absolute garbage. Something like this isn't even worth a little personal hobby project, let alone real money, and especially $40,000!\n\nBased in the US (the developer) and apparently according to his LinkedIn and other socials was an engineer before trying out web development and creating *professional* systems for the last 6 years. Charges $75 an hour.\n\nThis isn't just rookie mistakes. This guy invented his own entire auth logic! Even a junior would search up at the very least on how authentication works. It's like this guy just asked himself how he thinks it would work and went from there.\n\nDon't be like this guy.",

I checked the GitHub repo once he did this, and 10 lines of code in total were changed. I asked my client \"Out of curiosity, how much did he charge you?\".

But to anyone with an ounce of technological knowledge about web development could see the atrocities behind the scenes.\n\nRemember I only came into the picture as the client started to have some doubts. I was already working on another project of his and so he asked me if I could check things out on the other project. I found critical security issues straight away and from that point on I replaced the developer on frontend duties. That was when I started to discover everything and how bad it truly was, leading to him being completely removed from the project.\n\nIt's like saying the customer is also the idiot because they didn't recognise that the computer repair man did a crappy job and overcharged them. You can't always rely on the customer to know these things and I think it's poor judgement to assume that they should and box people in so that only those who would know about how websites work on a technical level should be able to pay for someone to build them a platform. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense and from my experience doesn't check out either.\n\nSure, if they know about how it all works then even better. But I don't think the judgement lies with the client for not knowing. That seems excessively harsh and shifts the blame from the guy who was charging for a skill he didn't have to the person who was paying someone for the skill they needed.",

              "text": "If you are hashing the password on the frontend, you are completely defeating the purpose of what the hash is there for.\n\nThe hashing is meant to be done on the backend. If you hash the password on the frontend, then that means the backend receives the hash instead of the plaintext password.\n\nIf the backend is only receiving the hash and comparing them, then that hash is now effectively the password.\n\nTry to think of it like this. If the backend receives the password in plaintext first, hashes it and **then** compares the hash, then if you were a hacker and had access to the hash, you couldn't use that to log in, as sending it to the backend would result in the backend hashing the hash again, which would result in a different hash, therefore the hashes would no longer match. The hacker would need to know your **password** in order to get around this.\n\nBy hashing the password on the frontend first, you are ensuring that now it is possible to just send the hash to the backend and it will work, you no longer need to know the password.\n\n>When the frontend hashes your password, that doesn't mean you could just enter the hash. Hashing the hash of your password would lead to a different hash... or did I miss something\n\nYes you are misunderstanding a crucial thing. You are thinking that the frontend is the gate-keeper. You're assuming that it is impossible to communicate with the backend without the frontend. Sure, if you put the hash in the login form and submitted it that way, then the frontend would re-hash the hash again. But you don't have to do that. You can just send a POST request directly to the login endpoint on the server and skip the frontend entirely. Or you can use a tool like BurpSuite to intercept the request that the frontend makes and replace the request body with whatever you like, i.e. the hash you stole.\n\nBecause the frontend operates on the clients browser, the frontend can never be used as security! The frontend can be manipulated in a multitude of ways. So by hashing the password on the frontend, you are wrongly assuming that no one will be able to bypass the hashing phase. So if the backend is expecting the hash and you can bypass the frontend hashing process, you can just send the original hash to the backend and it will log you in. That is why hashing must be done on the backend, because then there is no way to bypass that unless you hack the server. The user will always be forced into the flow of whatever they send gets hashed and then compared, and that means the only way for anyone to log in would be to send the original password.\n\nHashing a password is there to protect the password in case the database is leaked. But if you hash the password on the frontend, then the backend treats the hash as the actual password, therefore if those hashes get leaked, they can just be used to log in with because they **are** now the passwords. That was exactly what happened in this scenario too. Hashes were being stupidly leaked by the developer, and the passwords were being stupidly hashed on the frontend, therefore the hash can be used to log in with by sending the hash directly to the backend.",

The only software that could have produced vector-based animations that were 20-50kb, and you could do it relatively easy compared to what you had to do using html5, svg or whatever at the time. It’s incredible how fast tech changes over time, and some stuff, objectively good and performant at the moment, becomes completely obsolete over time. Currently working as an instructional designer, and I have already a gut feeling that this will be taken over by AI as well and I should start looking for some trade that do not wane off in 5 years. I hope that UBI will be implemented soon, otherwise many people who aren’t geniuses of marketing and sales, will just go mad or homeless (or both).",

Adobe animate will still remain in CC and avalible for purchase and sales.\n\n>To be clear, ***we are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate and it will continue to be available to both existing and new customers***.\n\nI think adobe hastly released this change after all the backlash from the sheer amount of industries and people that rely on Adobe Animate, i think even the Anime industry heavily relies on Adobe animate too, for why they aren't releasing features for a very supported and very sought after software? who knows.\n\n[https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/update-on-the-status-of-adobe-animate-1548459](https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/update-on-the-status-of-adobe-animate-1548459)\n\n(P.S I am not someone who uses Adobe Animate nor have i ever touched it in my life nor am i even someone in the creative industry however my jaw dropped at this announcement and frankly it didnt make sense but now it does)",

For example:\n\n- What technologies did you use in your latest projects and why (be able to discuss and explain each one, advantages and disadvantages, etc) This includes databases, caches, servers, deployment, languages, frameworks, etc\n- What are some of the most common design patterns you used in your last projects? \n- Have you used a particular architecture in any of your last projects (Clean/Event-Driven/Microservices/DDD/etc)\n- What is your philosophy for testing? BDD? TDD?\n\nTo me those are more useful questions rather than: Explain how to create a recursive descent parser to parse JSON using only functions, javascript, vaseline, duct tape and a banana.\n\nFor your case though, because you needed some very specific knowledge, I think it's okay to ask that, just saying, you might give the wrong impression to people just asking for general \"senior role\" questions",

Lol.    \n    \nAs a dude who has hired more devs than I could even recall, my answer is: Time.    \n    \nIt's rare that I'm impressed during tests or interviews, and even when I am, that candidate is usually just great at testing or great at interviewing. Many of the best devs I've worked with over the years were neither. To me, the difference between good devs and great devs is their consistency over many years. That's not something you see in one place, or in one project, or at one time. It's many places, many projects, many times. It also helps if they're at least tolerable to be around.",

We pay them for the day.\n\nIn our case I have a simple exercise where they need to build a small form \"age, address, category of products you buy the most, favorite brand\", and then present statistics on the form responses.  \nI give them a docker boilerplate with our stack, with empty logic for frontend, api and database, connections already built and tested, an in-house built frontend library fully documented that they are told to use for the form build.  \nThat will force them to deal with the frontend, both on the form as well as present some basic charts and tables for the information, will force them to organize an api and a couple of classes. It is a very simple thing, but that can go to different levels of detail, naming and organization.  \nDo they document their decisions? Do they use AI? Are they able to understand your documentation? Do they build foundational methods? Do they understand and use patterns? Do they reproduce the already existing structure of the library you provided? All of these questions can get answered right there.  \nPeople tell me \"that is a costly hiring process\", I normally answer that hiring the wrong candidate is a lot more expensive than whatever we pay to the 3/4 people we interview every 6 months. My CEO agrees.\n\nTo answer the \"why vs how\" part I mentioned on top, I have a question on the preliminary interview that is somewhat silly and vague on purpose:  \n\"Given a class vehicle, describe auxiliary classes, variables and methods/functions that you would find essential to build\"\n\nMost people go and create classes Wheel, Seats functions \"move(location A, location B) etc...  \nSome people go and start creating abstraction classes \"Locomotion\" \"Engine\".\n\nBut the best candidates most of the times ask:  \n\"What do you want the Vehicle to do? Is it a vehicle to carry people? load? for exhibition? Is it to do so on land? sea?\"  \nI haven't had a single one who asks that who doesn't draft a small set of classes and methods correctly after, to the point in which when someone questions the exercise I just give them full points and move onwards.\n\nBare in mind I am not discarding the others, I can still take insights from the way they organize their thought and helps me see how they construct their code.\n\nMy idea is always that you don't need to ask very complicated questions to assess knowledge, in fact when you ask about the Columbus Egg question (can you invert a binary tree?) you only get people who studied that specific question, and that tells you very little of how they proceed on their day to day. I prefer to give very simplistic exercises, that people will go more/less in depth as they feel more /less comfortable with their stack/knowledge. End of the day you are hiring someone to help you drive things forward, not someone to do what you have already done in the past.\n\nEnd of the day always remember, you can teach stacks, you can teach patterns, but thought process is mostly an inate skill that takes way longer to adapt to.  \n  \nAlso remember that (at least in my experience) teams thrive with different thought processes and personalities, sometimes you need someone who documents heavily, sometimes you need someone who questions a lot, sometimes you need someone who just executes.  \nSo try to hire for the blindspots of your team when possible.",

Hiring is hard.\n\n> what specific moment or behavior made you think “okay, this person is legit?\n\nI think \"legit\" needs some clarity here. I'm not being pedantic. It's important to fully flesh out the qualities that you're looking for. Think of it like hiring a writer for a show you want to produce. \n\nHiring the most brilliant writer doesn't matter if they're difficult to work with, if they're unreliable, if you want a comedy but they're more of a drama writer. Or maybe they're incredibly talented with characters and plot, but can't seem to write to the spec of the show. \n\nHiring someone to code for you is analogous. They may be legit, but that doesn't mean they're a good fit for you. It doesn't mean you're going to get the outcomes that you want. Thoroughly define what you need, heavily weighted to long term goals. Then work backward to defining the type of person you'll need.\n\nFinally, don't ignore the most obvious factor: budget. Make sure you can afford the person you want. Trying to save money, especially if you're inexperienced in hiring and won't have any established mentors on board to supervise, will almost always come back to bite you.",

The hardest thing we have to deal with is the legacy parts of our codebase, which we're currently migrating away from.\n\nBut we do have tens of thousands of users and our software is mission critical for our clients, so we have to deal with a constant pressure to produce new features and feature improvements and balance that with the necessity of a stable platform and our security requirements. \n\nSo, when I interview new developers I want to ensure they know the basics of code and systems design, and figure out if they will be good to work with. We have a great team with no jerks, and I want to keep it that way. That last point is really important because being a great place to work is a big part of our excellent retention. \n\nSo, I do a live coding test that involves calling APIs and integrating the responses, and a system design test that shows they know the moving parts of a production web app, and how databases work. \n\nThat's it. \n\nIf we interview ten people, I see one or two who have the technical chops to pass that test. And it isn't just about passing it. A good senior developer will fly through it. Their code will be clean and well organized, and they'll grasp the subtle challenges of it immediately. They'll rattle off answers to the system design challenges and they'll add details that come from experience building working applications.\n\nAnd if they can do all that while being articulate and having a pleasant disposition, they have a very good shot at landing the job. \n\nI know there are companies that need a lot more from their engineers but at a lot of SaaS companies you pretty much just need solid basics and experience delivering real-world, production applications.\n\nFor junior engineers we give pretty much the same test but our expectations aren't as high. \n\nAnd that's the whole thing.

For juniors, make sure you have experience building non-trivial apps and actually deploying them.",

Your talent has just been “normalized” by your environment. The average person can’t read beyond a 6th grade level. Let weird be endearing from now on, or else just give up your search.\n\nMost of Full stack is system design, so I am going to go with that as my shining star in terms of skills. Dont solve this by looking up “systems design interview question” because everyone has seen all of those before. Its so trivial for anyone who knows what they are doing, but time consuming and so easy to nitpick that its almost insulting. I like to be given questions with real answers, that actually test what I am expected to do when hired. Hell, it might even be funnier and a better test to ask them how they’d respond to a bunch of slack messages in a deck of flashcards. If you are going to like working with someone, you can tell from how they might respond to slack interviews. It might also take the sword of damocles off of their head.\n\nAlso, you are going to need to make a relaxing environment probably. The stakes are high every job interview. While it’s normal for you to interview a lot of candidates, most of those candidates probably haven’t gotten any interviews in weeks. The job market is totally fucked for everyone. I hope you understand the nervous system tension of trying to feed yourself and family. There are plethoras of studies showing intelligence as really driving up nervous system sensitivity across the board, so these candidates might be more nervous because to you its another day and to them its their whole future.\n\nPlease select : Corporate or Startup. Your best guys are always going to be split. Either they were found by corporate and poached early (talented and well known) or they were not. Typically, the talented guys who were not poached went to make some money. I know some pretty rich weirdos in SF. The best people I know either corporate extremely early and stayed (but didnt promote to higher levels, bc politics) or went to go work for a no name startup. Best programmer I ever met to this day works for a small game studio. That dude used to ship like 2000 of systems code a day and it really impressed me. No matter what though, either they stay for a long time, or they move fast and get promoted repeatedly. Please stop judging for layoffs. These big tech companies hired stupidly and fired stupidly after they went broke. Too many of them are zombies, and are not going to tell you that. A layoff means nothing if you actually live in reality.\n\nThere are pretty good pools of young people because the hiring process is so scuffed. The trick is to ask them questions they have never been prepping. You always find talent by scoping out a wide variety of factors. If you only test leetcode, you will only find people who overfit for leetcode. Just play tricks on them and keep them on their toes. I think smart people tend to hate boring things. Or at least I do. I’ve never found a smart person who doesnt like solving new problems in some capacity, as long as those new problems arent “stupid” problems.\n\nAlso, a lot of tech is huge complexity theatre. The less you tell a computer to do, the faster it is. Anyone who adds more steps for a computer to do without good reason and doesnt separate concerns immediately probably isn’t cracked. If you are a small company and the interviewee says monolith, you are in good hands hahaha. If they say anything about some more microservices, they are probably listening to too many people on the internet. Don’t blame them for that, as theres not much else to do while unemployed. If a person isn’t familiar with how fast something CAN be and that sometimes you should focus priorities on something else other than speed, then they probably dont know A LOT. This one is a bit easier to not be familiar with these days.\n\n\nHonestly you guys trying so hard to select also probably weeds out a lot of candidates. You are most likely best off using the euler method for statistical random guessing, since sometimes your heuristics can be worse at selecting talent than random. Just make your own tests for god sakes. No more complaining about candidates cheating all the time. Weed every candidate by putting a few “random questions” they arent supposed to answer or hidden white text questions to avoid chatgpt. Chatgpt for resumes is OK, for interviews is nonsense. Everyone is going to play the “pick me” game, which is fine as long as you have the skills to back it up. If you are playing “pick me” and know nothing, I believe you should study up some more and work outside the field. I know this sounds harsh but its actually the only economically viable strat. I only found any type of money once I stopped looking at tech companies and just started fixing problems for people who had a lot of them and a lot of money.",

The performance improvements alone made it worth it, and our users have noticed the difference.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the migration process!",

          "text": "A lot of the reasons you list sound less like “React is the problem” and more like “our React architecture got messy over time.” \n\nThe whole “tired of useEffect debugging” thing isn’t really a framework issue. useEffect isn’t meant to be a core control mechanism in React. If you’re constantly fighting effects, it usually means state is poorly structured or effects are being used for things they shouldn’t be. Svelte avoids a lot of these pitfalls by design, React allows them. That’s a difference, but not proof that React itself is bad or slow.\n\nUsing Redux for a 50k-line dashboard over two years also explains a big chunk of the pain. Classic Redux adds a lot of overhead and makes it easy to trigger unnecessary re-renders. With more modern state patterns, many of those issues could’ve been reduced without switching frameworks.\n\nThe performance numbers are also hard to read as a pure framework win. Comparing a grown, \"legacy-heavy\" React app to a freshly rewritten Svelte app is mostly showing the rewrite effect. Rewrites almost always ship less JS and feel faster, no matter the framework.\n\nSo yeah, sounds like switching was the right call for your team. But to me this post shows how forgiving React is of bad architecture, not that React was the root cause of the problems.\n\nSo imho, this looks more like a problem with using “raw” React than a problem with React itself, Redux aside.",

That is usually the part that kills framework migrations in practice. Did you do it incrementally or rip the band aid off and rewrite everything at once?\n\nAlso curious about the Redux to Svelte stores (or runes) transition. Most of the complexity in big React apps lives in the state management layer, not the component rendering. Going from Redux boilerplate to Svelte runes must have felt like going from writing assembly to writing Python.\n\nThe one thing I would push back on is the \"no direct equivalent for some React libraries\" point. The React ecosystem is genuinely massive and that library gap can bite you hard when you need something niche 6 months down the road. Worth keeping an eye on.",

My advice is to treat the class as a fundamentals course, learn the core ideas behind layout and structure, then mentally translate those skills into modern tools on your own.

To learn true webdevelopment I would suggest learning HTML and CSS since these languages have become very powerful (especially CSS) and allow for complete understanding of how something works (but I am not your teacher giving you a passing grade!

His webapps forced you to use a specific resolution because it wasn't responsive at all in 2022. Fine if it was legacy software but this was brand new projects. He was very good at getting stuff done but just never updated the way he did things to meet industry standards. Thankfully i never had to work on the code he worked on but he would have been an incredible dev if he just kept up with industry standards which are easier than what he was doing.\n\nSome people just really don't keep up with well established industry standards and its especially prevalent in education. When i was first introduced to webdev the high school teacher taught us image maps as if it was the standard and that was well outdated way back then (fine because a high school teacher shouldn't be held to the same standard as specialized tertiary education). Then i had a uni class where they taught the foundation framework which i criticized that they should have at least been using bootstrap since it was overwhelmingly the \"industry standard\" for that style of UI framework at the time.",

And I think you should focus on that. I can also say that being a software engineer for so long, there are so many random pieces of software that you’re going to need to learn. And about 20% of them will feel utterly stupid. Almost every company I’ve worked at has had some random, kind of silly, software that they’re using just because they’ve been using it for the last 10 years. Learning random software really is its own skill set.\n\nI think Dreamweaver probably has the perfect amount of randomly frustrating shit for you to learn so that you can actually get used to some of the silly things that corporate America will throw at you.\n\nI say that as an alum of several fortune 500 companies and one Silicon Valley unicorn… you’re gonna have to get used to learning random software that you probably don’t want to learn to do your job.\n\nSo for now, I would say just to focus on the basics… And treat dreamweaver as a necessary evil… I feel like you can still learn in this class, but maybe don’t take the follow up class where they do a deep dive into adobe fireworks lol",

Ultimately your teacher is gonna teach what they’re gonna teach. This is a good life lesson. You should developer suggest Figma and something like VSCode or Notepad++. But if they don’t wanna do those things, not much you can do. In the real world, those above you often force you to do stuff that’s not the best/most correct/most relevant.\n\nLearn Figma and a newer IDE on your own anyways. I use Figma all the time to reference things. Good tool to be aware of as a student cause you can add that to the ol resume after college. Obviously time will be valuable as a student but if you can find time to do extra learning of relevant tools it’ll pay off.\n\nLastly, you’ll likely still learn the basics of web dev through Dreamweaver even if it’s outdated.

Is this some rinky dink college in bum fuck Idahoe or something, where the teacher makes up their own plan to teach? Seems like if you're in a group of classes for design, etc.. there would be updated curriculum the teacher would have to follow?",

I dust off my box model notes, look at the differences between class and ID again and jump back into DW.  It took me stumbling across Stack Overflow and W3Schools to realize just how many people couldn't recommend DW, they all recommended just straight up code editors, so that's what I ended up doing about 10 years ago.\n\nDW seemed cool, but I guess it still doesn't compare with a Visual Studio Code or Brackets or other current code editors?",

Contractor role.\n\n**The Dilemma:** Their reasoning was \"That is a great salary in your region\" (Tunisia). It is technically above the local average ($500), I feel like its below the market rate for my level of experience.\n\n**Do I take this?** Do I accept this just to get \"US Experience\" on my resume, or should I keep looking for a team that values the output (scaling, performance) rather than my location?\n\nI'm feeling pretty defeated. Is the market really this broken for non-US seniors?\n\nUPDATE: I'm getting a lot of DMs asking if I'm still available. My inbox is flooded, so I might be slow to reply.

If they won't provide a number (or a range) I'll just say that I want to make sure we both have the same expectations so we're spending each other's time wisely and I cannot proceed until we have some basic understanding that we're a good fit for each other. If they want to ask some basic fit questions of me for the same reason that's fine (ex. remote/on site split, time zone work hours, etc). I like to take care of this over email or linkedin messaging but if they insist on a call I will agree to 15 minutes to clear this stuff up (this is what the recruiters want first for their reasons, but it's what I want as a last resort since we can clear up these basics in 2 mins over email or linkedin messaging and use even less of each other's time if it's not a good fit).\n\nIf the number is too low, then I will tell them what I would need to proceed with the next step. I genuinely don't want to waste their time and I want the same courtesy in return. Some might think it's rude to talk about numbers up front, and it can be a little uncomfortable if you make it that way, but if you're assertive about what you want and you're transparent about your expectations then I think that will avoid more awkwardness in the future and you'll end up with a company that has the same values as you (courtesy, transparency, fairness, etc).",

Imagine working with US colleagues which will get few times more for week than you would get for month.\n\nAnd no, US experience will not help you in anything as its not about location but company. So no-name startup from US will be in CV not worth more than other companies.",

There are many. But the company doesn't want to hire there. Why? Because they don't have the budget. That's why they're looking to hire in a lower cost-of-living region so that their $$ have more mileage. Its a win-win for both parties - company gets to hire good talent for lower rate & the talent gets employed with above average pay.\n\nYou are also doing the same - looking for a US based company for employment instead of something local to your region - because you know you will get paid better. If you are not the wrong then why would another be in the wrong for doing the same thing?\n\nIf you're holding out for US pay rates then keep looking. Some companies do pay standard rate irrespective of where the employee is located. Just not many of them.\n\nAs for equity & contractor role - well, you have a big misconception there. Unless the company has a registered subsidiary in your country, you can't be a full time employee. You'd need a US work permit for any US company to put you on payroll. So, yeah, you will get contractor role. And as for equity - contractors don't get equity.",

You don't bring anything new to the market - a spin maybe, maybe even a good one, but people already have tools for this.

You can still say if it's vibe coded or not without releasing the source code. The fact that you're reluctant to do so just makes me nearly 100% confident it is vibe coded, and that is the reason you don't want to make it open source (since the reasons you gave for not doing so don't make any sense either).",

          "text": "Sorry op for all the downvotes you’re getting. I think there’s unpopular opinion at the moment based on LLMs and vibe coding that are tainting the discussion and pushing it away from your initial intent. My honest opinion to your question is that I wouldn’t trust a random website with my sensitive data even if it claims it’s only processed on my device because I’m used to Meta and Google claiming a lot of BS too. It’s hard to gain trust in the current landscape where every corp just wants to steal your data at any cost. But the fact that your vibe coded or AI assisted or whatever has nothing to do with that. It looks really awesome, by the way, but it doesnt change the principle. Personally, for small utility tools, I look for open source apps that I can find the binaries on brew (Mac). If it doesn’t exist, I create one and put it there, not to collect clicks and downloads and fame, just for my future convenience (and others). If it fills a need good, if it doesn’t, well, at least it filled my need. Lastly, it made me think that if you put those tools into a cli (or MCP) that LLM can control, that’d be dope. I’m constantly asking Claude for editing with ImageMagick and ffmpeg. The more “Swiss army knife” tools there are, the more my LLM will be helpful for me. Just my 2c! Good luck, I’m pretty sure you had fun and you learned a ton with that project, don’t let the haters kill your vibe.",

We all have to trust sites, for example, hosted by our governments or Banks etc, whether those are secure is another issue far too big to engage here. For me, it was my photography, specifically photos and videos of my grandchildren.\n\nso:\n\n1. Does anyone care about privacy, or is it just fluff? = Some do.\n2. Am I wasting my time building these tools, as nobody wants them? = Possibly.\n3. Suggestions on how I can promote it without money, as the platform is completely free to use.= not got a clue!\n4. Should I just drop it, as nobody cares?= Keep at whatever you believe in, & plug away.\n\nLike you, I have much the same toughts especially those around social media companies!

But for something that \"privacy sensitive\", you're asking a lot from people who don't \"know, like, OR trust\" you. Do you have a \"community\" other than reddit? Have you built up any credibility? \n\nSince you've asked, here are my answers to your 4 questions:\n\n1. Now more than ever people care about privacy, but we care more about credibility and proof that we can trust our data to new unvetted sources.\n2. No, you are not waisting your time, you're building an asset that has promise. Do you use it yourself? Have you worked out all the bugs? Can you produce a case study?\n3. If you're promoting it without money then getting the word out over 10-15 days is too short a time to expect much. Organic reach to earn the trust level you're assuming takes months, not days or even weeks. \n4. \"Should I just drop it as nobody cares?\" You're finding out right now -- on Showoff Saturday -- that we DO care about privacy. But we also need to trust you and your software. \n\nHere's a thought: have you researched what other apps like yours do for promotion? Not just paid, but with reviews, walk-through videos, and case studies. It may be worth the time to research and regroup before you pull the plug on your creation.\n\nGood luck!

Even if it can be vibe coded in 20 mins most people don't have the knowhow or won't bother, they would rather just throw their data anywhere to get the job done, if this came up on Google I would use it over other websites.\n\nTbh I think it's a great idea, no heavy server workloads as all the processing happens locally in the browser. If you could steal some of the market from the other tools and throw a few ads on the site I think you are on to a winner albeit maybe a small one, but you can deploy this for free on something like cloudflare pages so it's no cost to you. If you enjoy making it then why not continue?\n\nFair enough on it not being open source but if OP intends to make money then open sourcing would make it much easier for others to launch competing websites... They probably still will but why make it easier? OP could open source later once there is traction and they have good search engine rankings otherwise someone with a marketing budget could come in and gain market share much faster.\n\nWhy isn't it a desktop app? No one these days looks for a desktop app for simple things, they will Google first and if a website comes up that can do the job they will use that, it's a much more frictionless experience. Also with web apps there is no need for compiling the app for different architectures, hosting different binaries etc. (given the small caveat of browser differences) I think it's a much better approach.",

The entire point of React, practically, was to provide a state management system that can be run entirely in the client. That was why we begrudgingly accepted rethinking the entire app development structure with immutable state. \n\nRe-introducing SSR back into the mix is the worst of both worlds, with the only notable argument being that we can still -sort of- take advantage of React components and not be coupled to a specific framework. But, in addition to _yet another dependency layer_, it adds either the complexity of managing another service, or the costs of adding a vendor to run it for you, without the fully integrated advantages of an MVC framework. \n\nI have yet to see the \"SEO factor\" quantified on any level. Google has been able to read React just fine for over a decade, and pre-hydrated content just doesn't meaningfully move the needle on rank. \n\nOr maybe I'm being optimistic about its downfall and that's just my neck of the woods.",

It defaults to being an SPA. But it also has an optional SSR sidecar that runs on H3 through an Nginx proxy (< 5ms latency). I strongly discourage our team from using the SSR sidecar unless the project explicitly requires it. Architecting that sidecar was one of the most illuminating things I've done in recent years. It did NOT give me an appreciation for all the heavy lifting Next.js and Nuxt are doing - it instead solidified in my mind that these hybrid CSR + SSR clusterphucks aren't sustainable.\n\nPeople either need to build a CSR app or build an SSR app with a little HTMX baked into it. Combining CSR with SSR like Next.js and Nuxt are doing is almost always over engineering. Google can index SPAs just fine, and SEO is becoming less relevant anyways because of AI.\n\nReact itself is sadly here to stay despite it being the literal worst of all the major UI libraries/frameworks. I'll take Vue, Svelte, Solid - hell, even Marko - over React. As an aside, I think once Vue's new Vapor mode is released in 3.6, it's going to upset the paradigm a fair bit.",

The *personal* web, *independent* web, *small* web (whatever you want to call it) is still very pleasant to use.\n\nIf you're sick of seeing spam and AI slop everywhere, you need to move beyond centralized social media platforms and traditional search engines for website discovery purposes. Use those big human brains of yours and stop expecting to have an endless stream of \"content\" delivered directly to your eyeballs via a social media recommendation algorithm. Try ... I dunno, something like *kagi dot com forwardslash smallweb*. If you look at the master list for that directory on Github, there are almost 30,000 independent websites represented there. And Kagi's small web directory is but ONE example of several. Another directory you might like (since the websites are categorized to make it easier to find stuff you're interested in) is *blogroll dot org*. You can also join well-moderated forums where people share their independent sites with others (there are plenty out there). Bookmark any independent sites you happen across that are created by humans and relevant to your interests. Add their RSS feeds to an RSS reader and curate your own algorithm-free, slop-free feed.\n\nAs web developers, you are better equipped than anyone to participate in and contribute to the independent web community. Use SSGs to build simple HTML / CSS / JS websites, and fuck all the bloated corporate web frameworks you're expected to use in your day jobs. Have FUN again, and remember why you wanted to build websites in the first place. If you don't think that the existing independent web discovery surfaces work well, build your own better solutions. And if you're worried about your shit being stolen, do what you can to block known scrapers via .htaccess and honeypots.\n\n**tl;dr: fuck all the slop peddlers and marketers of the corporate web. Fuck SEO, and fuck \"GEO.\" The OP of the post I'm responding to asked how we \"get out of\" this mess. We get out of it by refusing to participate in the corporate web for our daily browsing activities. The independent web is what you want if you're tired of this BS.**",

              "text": "I completely agree. One of the biggest consequences of app stores and walled gardens is that they’ve trained people, especially average device users, to think the internet is just a handful of apps. For many, online life now exists inside two or three corporate platforms. They might still visit some websites for school, work, or government needs, but the wider web barely registers anymore.\n\nWhat gets lost is the idea of the internet as an open platform. It’s not the wild west of the late 90s or early 2000s, but the open web still exists. Independent websites, forums, blogs, open-source projects, donation platforms, and grassroots political and social organizations are still out there. They didn’t disappear, they just became harder to see once discovery was funneled through apps and algorithms.\n\nThe real problem is structural. When most people live inside a few applications, those companies become the gatekeepers of speech, culture, and organizing. What you see, what you’re allowed to say, and how far it spreads are shaped by corporate policy rather than public norms.\n\nWe should be reminding younger generations that the internet itself is where real agency still exists. Websites can’t be shut down by a single platform decision, and protocols don’t care about brand safety. If people don’t invest their time and energy in the open web, they’re choosing a future where online life is permanently confined to a few corporate silos.",

One of the things that saddens me the most is when I talk to teenagers and young adults from gen z and beyond and how they play barely any games and touch barely any websites.\n\nFor them, the internet is just social media and a handful of websites but that's about it.

Instead of whining on Reddit about how \"the internet\" (the whole freaking internet) is \"dead\" or \"unusable,\" we can actively make a difference. For everyone who uses the internet? Maybe not, but we can at least help those people out there who are sick of seeing slop everywhere and are ready for a change. Increasing numbers of \"normal\" people are leaving social media and WANT somewhere else to go online. We can help guide them to independent online communities, and we can help to build those independent online communities.\n\nEven if the independent web becomes more popular over the next several years and the corporate web tries to infiltrate it, they'll fail; the minute you see slop on some corporate website pretending to be \"independent\" is the minute you blacklist that domain. This is the beauty of the internet and tried and true systems like RSS.

Email OTP means you're not storing password hashes that could be cracked.\n\n  \n2. \\*\\*UX tip\\*\\*: Consider magic links over OTP codes - clicking a link is easier than copy-pasting a 6-digit code, and you can set a 15-30 min expiry. Services like Supabase Auth make this trivial to implement.\n\n  \n3. \\*\\*Hybrid approach\\*\\*: You could offer \"remember this device\" for 30 days after the first magic link verification. This way users only deal with email auth once a month, reducing friction while maintaining security.\n\n  \nThe key metric to watch is your login completion rate - if you see significant drop-off between \"send code\" and \"code entered,\" consider the magic link approach instead.",

You can `git work tree add ../her-branch` and it will check the code out at that directory, by default with the `her-branch` branch as well. Convenient! You can then cd, (p)npm install, (p)npm test, and take a look. \n\n\nWhen you're done you can `git work tree remove`, and it will tab complete etc. \n\n\nAgain, nothing that you can't do with clone, but more convenient.",

Not for writing entire apps but for the boring stuff like writing tests, generating boilerplate, debugging weird errors, and rubber ducking when I'm stuck. Cursor specifically has basically replaced VS Code for me at this point.\n\nContainer based dev environments are another one. Using Docker or dev containers so my local setup matches production exactly. No more \"works on my machine\" nonsense. Took a while to get comfortable with but now I can't imagine going back.\n\nTypeScript everywhere. I resisted it for a long time because it felt like extra work but once you get used to it, going back to plain JavaScript feels like walking a tightrope without a net. The autocomplete alone is worth it.\n\nTailwind CSS. Hated it at first, thought it was ugly and cluttered. Now I can't stand writing regular CSS files. Being able to style stuff without context switching is just faster.\n\nGitHub Actions for CI/CD on basically everything, even tiny projects. Auto deploy on push to main, run tests, lint checks. Takes like 10 minutes to set up and saves so much mental overhead.\n\nEdge functions and serverless for anything that doesn't need a full backend. Vercel and Cloudflare Workers have made it stupid easy to add API routes without managing servers.\n\nAlso got into the habit of setting up proper error tracking from day one. Sentry or LogRocket or whatever. Flying blind in production is terrifying once you've experienced actually knowing what's breaking.\n\nWhat stack are you working with?",

Everything was glued together, it had no namespace, no proper autoloader (there were a couple that were completely messed up, and an app should only have one!), no use of a package manager (composer), no real concept of inheritance or composition for classes, files spanning over 50k lines (one file was 1MB in size), developers who didn't have an understanding of things like design patterns or architecture. I got promoted to lead architect and tried to steer it to a direction where it at least had some resemblance of a plan and architecture, while also educating developers about good development practices and modern software development, but I was really early in my career and as I realized that there was this shadow group of developers who wanted to maintain the current state of things so they can wear a cape and put out fires, I just quit and went to work at a much better company.\n\nI met the CTO a few years after that for lunch and he basically said nothing has changed. Same application, same problems, same devs.",

Comments like 'fixed bug' with no explanation of what bug.\n- Database migrations that did `execute 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users'` followed by recreating it with a different schema. In production. On a Friday.\n- A file called `helpers/do_not_touch.rb` that was 2000 lines of metaprogramming that dynamically defined every route in the application.\n\nThe survival strategy that actually works: pick one boundary and make it clean. Don't try to refactor the whole thing. Find the one integration point that causes the most pain, wrap it in a clean interface, and write tests for just that boundary.

Me and a colleague said ok to a quite nice pay day to debug and fix it so it would stop crashing.\n\nWhen we got the code base, every single file was a clone of a single template the dev had made. All variables were named to a, b, c, d, e etc, clearly on purpose. When we realized that, we just sighed. \n\nThen we opened the next set of folders,  which were all named ”folder”, in the code base. All files had the same rage induced variable names: but in these files all variables shared the only common denominator that they were either offensive and/or racist, disgusting or porn-references. Some files would only have one variable name, but add a number.\n\nSo:\n\n```\nvar cock = 0\nvar cock2 = 0\nvar cock3 = [cock, cock2]\ncock3.forEach(cock => doCock(cock))\n```\n\nWe had to go through each route on the entire site to be able to identify which files were served when the website was visited. And explain to our customer what was going on, while at the same time putting in hour after hour to turn cocks into response and data. ",

We fixed the messed up UI, fixed all the backend bugs, cleaned up the DB in just a few weeks.\n\nHe ended up going back to hiring the original developer of the app, who was way cheaper, who then wrote a long series of emails as to why what we did was terrible and inexcusable.\n\nHe spent 6+ months on the app, after getting it back from us and what we fixed, to just write those emails. I'm not joking, he was a full time employee for that company to just manage that app, and in 6 months he did not make any updates or changes, just \"analyzed\" our changes to shitpost those emails\n\nMost of his concerns were fringe. Talking about things he didn't know about. He talked so much about prioritizing security, this and that. It was a fuckin' React app, not tied to anything critical or vulnerable. He also wrote long email chains about performance, trying to sound smart because some of the js files could've been reduced by a few bytes lol. The kicker was when he talked about the server, and how it was utilizing maximum CPU, but he didn't know that those cloud servers display CPU data based on cores (so 100% would be 1 core in full use, 200% would be 2 cores, etc). When the server would process something like a database migration, one of the cores would naturally spike up, bro wrote a huge email as to how that was unacceptable",

All in all, operating costs for the platform were at least 10x what they should be.\n\nWhen I asked the lead dev why we're doing all that, he said it's a skill issue and I need to understand that these patterns were used for a reason.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the frontend, they had 2-3 level inheritance on components, so you'd have something like:\n\n\\`BaseOnEnter\\` -> \\`OnEnterLeave\\` -> \\`OnEnterLeaveWithButton\\`. Yes, the third component would extend the second which extended the first.\n\nTo this day I am 100% sure the engineering department drove the company into the ground.

No frameworks, just PHP querying a MySQL database and barfing the query results out onto the page. If one team's app needed data from another team's app there was no API or data model, someone in operations would just configure iptables to allow their app server to access the MySQL port, and then configure MySQL to allow them access to whatever table. They were then free to do whatever with the data with the only constraints being those defined on the table.\n\nThere was another web app written by someone else in BioInfo in Lua. I poked around the repo once and just saw a bunch of SELECT statements in the code, with the results again barfed onto the page. After some more digging, I found out that all of the business logic for this app was handled in trigger functions within the Postgres database. Further, someone had installed [Lua as a procedural language for Postgres](https://github.com/pllua/pllua), so some of the trigger functions would invoke a web request from the database to some other application server on the network.\n\nThat place was wild.",
