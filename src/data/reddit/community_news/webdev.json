Made a simple app for uploading and displaying charts and data with filters and such. \n\nIt worked, sort of. I went back and inspected the code it had written and dear god it looked like something I had written when I first started coding:\n\nThe view functions were massive, like 800+ lines of code for a single function, and while many shared the same logic, it had duplicated it instead of refactoring it out into helper functions. All the js and css was scattered throughout the html, and again duplicate logic with functions sometimes doing the same thing but named slightly differently.\n\nI think I spent more time trying to debug and refactor it into something that was halfway decent and maintainable than if I would have built it from scratch. \n\nThese people live in a bubble, and can’t see the forest through the trees. Anyone can build an app, but building is only part of the process. I will admit that it has boosted my productivity, but maybe 10%? 15% max, not even close to the claims I’ve seen made.\n\nI fear that we are going to see more and more apps like the one described above built by people who have no idea how they work.

Went to look what the agent suggested - sure, the code was fixed in backend, but the frontend app would be broken in some cases because of the arbitrary choices Claude made and he didn't fact-check. I spent literally 10 minutes to make a fix that can solve the test and show all the data in frontend.

The general feeling in the comments seems to be that \"oh it's all just hype... claude code isn't really that good\". I suggest that most of us thinking like this are lying to ourselves\n\nAI is here and it will continue to expand. All the issues you mentioned are there and I agree with their seriousness. But this doesn't change the fact that most people will continue to use it and it will continue to get better",

Yes, there will probably be technical drivers still. The solution oriented mindset will still be useful, but only the best of the best will actually be getting paid for it\n\nOn code quality... I have always insisted on readable code for maintainability of any project. But with where things are heading, I believe it won't matter much\n\nOf course software quality will still be paramount, as well as security. But these will be solved too. The main lacking point is security right now, in my opinion.\n\nAny domain expert can easily build a simple software application which would be considered good quality software from an end user perspective (which is what actually matters). But security would still be lacking without specific focus towards it\n\n.....\n\nA bit all over the place but the tldr is that I'm just telling people not to assume our jobs are safe.

When you do that it uses windows hello to fill in a password which can be very unsafe imo.\n\nNext it doesn’t have an application for Linux. So if you ever want to move from windows to Linux you will be missing out on the password manager.\n\nAnother downside as a European is that my data now is with an American company which has me worried about privacy. I think 1Password is Canadian which tracks a lot better imo\n\nBright side is that my not so techy wife uses it because it’s pre-installed. Sharing passwords is easy with another user.

You have to first add the account in the vault, and then you can use that while logging in, which is a huge deal-breaker, especially when you are working with a lot of accounts.

In the last year alone, the platform I developed generated over $15k in revenue for him. It’s stable, fast, and it clearly converts.\n\nAnnual renewal for hosting and maintenance (just a few hundred bucks) came up, and he asked for a quote for a full rebranding. His exact words were:\n\"I only need to change texts. If you charge me too much, I’m going back to Wix.\". Clearly it is not only a text change but a complete renewal keeping only the same colors ignoring the UX adjustments, SEO migration, and the actual value of a rebranding.\n\nHonestly, the stress has accumulated to the point where I just want to let him go. If he thinks Wix is so great, let him deal with it. But here’s my dilemma: I don't want to just \"hand over\" all the custom logic and hard work I put into this platform for pennies, especially after this level of disrespect.\n\nWhat should I do? Just hand over the keys and walk away for my own mental health? Do I \"strip\" the custom proprietary logic before he migrates (since he only paid for the service, not the full IP of my custom code)? How do I protect my work without being \"the bad guy,\" while making sure he realizes that moving to Wix means losing everything I built for him?\n\nI’m tired.\n\nEDIT: There is no written contract, only an invoice for \"site development\"\n\nEDIT2: I clarified that my work generated revenue to point out that the funds to pay me are definitely there, my intention wasn't to reproach him or ask for more money",

HTML is a standard markup language used in the design of websites. The Copyright Office will not register HTML as a computer program, because HTML does not constitute source code. Source code is typically written by a human being using a computer programming language, such as Java, C, or C++. By contrast, HTML is frequently generated by automated website design software. You can register HTML as a literary work if it was created by a human being, not a website design program, and if it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression. To register HTML, you must submit a complete copy of the entire code; you cannot submit an isolated portion of the code using the options discussed below. For more information about registering HTML and website content generally, see Copyright Registration of Websites and Website Content (Circular 66).  \n\nand\n\n> Hypertext markup language (HTML) is a standard markup language used in the design of websites. It is frequently generated by automated website design software. HTML establishes the format and layout of the content that appears on a particular web page by instructing the user’s browser to \r\npresent that content in a specified manner. If you want to register content that has been posted on a website, you should submit the content in the form in which it appears on the actual website. There is no reason to submit the HTML code for that site unless you specifically want to register the human-written portions of the HTML itself and any website text that is embedded within the HTML. A registration for HTML will not cover any formatting and layout that may be dictated by the HTML or style sheets. Nor will it cover any audio, visual, or audiovisual content that may appear on a website and is not perceptible in the HTML. HTML may be registered as a literary work only if it was created by a human being and it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.  \n\n(copyright.gov)\n\nSo even if OP were to claim copyright, they would have to claim the _whole_ code, not just parts or their \"custom code\", and also have to prove the written HTML contains sufficient amount of creative expression.

Unless you are a true employee, by default programming code copywrite belongs to whomever wrote it.\n\nThe client possibly has a claim to the 'visual' portion of the website but not the underlying code.  Which would allow the client to rewrite the website in WIX.\n\nThat is why it is so critical that if you ever contract out to someone to write code for you that your contract includes a transfer of copywrite.\n\nA non-coding example.

This is more frequently a concern for an MSP or someone else that has \"keys to the kingdom\" type admin access to actual business data (admin logins, DNS, etc) needed to function, but it's not often hard for a website with potential privileged information or revenue generation (like client contact info, user logins, e-store, etc) to get lumped into that.\n\nThat doesn't mean you are obligated to host their site, but you can't really deny them access to it while also taking it offline without a really strong contract or legal advice in place.  \n\nIn your case, I would suggest handing over whatever the original deliverable was (website you developed), including the most recent copy of whatever data is currently live.  Basically, provide them with the data they need to set the site up on their own hosting service.  Feel free to offer to help migrate it at your normal hourly rate if you'd like.\n\nDefinitely don't act like a jilted ex trying to claim ownership over some random shit (site source code) simply because you're upset.",

That part is genuinely broken and OpenAI should fix it. But everyone in here celebrating blocking GPTBot entirely is making a bet that AI search won't matter. That bet is going to look terrible in 18 months.\n\nThe real solution is rate limiting, not blocking. Set up a robots.txt crawl-delay, put a CDN in front with bot rate limits, and cache aggressively. If Vercel can't handle that natively, that's a Vercel problem, not an AI problem.\n\nAlso worth noting: if your open-source docs show up in ChatGPT answers, that's free distribution to millions of developers. The ROI on that traffic is probably higher than organic Google at this point.",

We tried scaling VPS's but there is no clear pattern to when the platform might pick up and the scaling takes too long to react. Using a worker to handle the uploaded audio transmission blocks practically gets rid of the irregular scaling issues we had at the start. \n\nOnce the upload is received, the worker records it in the database and sends it to a Kafka stream which is how it is stored instead of traditional file storage. \n\nThe downside to workers is they are targets for abuse. You have to implement bot protection and build in authentication for each request. We use WAF to block repeated requests that fail auth (and also all countries that are not North America since our platform is specific to this region) alongside rate limiting requests as an added measure to prevent flooding. When your paying for every request a flood event that goes unchecked can cost you a ton of money. \n\n",

          "text": "*This is a long post, but it's a master class in client relations, I promise you'll get something out of this.*\n\nOkay, most people in here are approaching this from a combative perspective or fear-inducing perspective \"What if it breaks?\" \"How will you update it?\". \n\nSome of y'all have never worked with clients and it shows. Neither of those approaches will ever actually land you clients.\n\nThis is an obvious client education opportunity. The idea is to educate them and reveal what the real process is and do it as humbly and tactfully as possible so they don't feel dumb.\n\nFrom the client's perspective they are thinking \"I can just jump in ChatGPT for an hour or two and bang out a website\". Our goal in the response is to acknowledge that they can indeed use AI to build a website, but subtly explain that it's more than just running a few prompts in ChatGPT.\n\nThis serves a couple purposes: it makes them realize \"Oh this is actually much more of a process and involves more work than I realized\" and it also makes them realize \"Wow these guys know their stuff\". You're essentially educating and selling them at the same time without them realizing it.\n\nOkay, all that sounds cool, but what does it look like in practice, here's an email you can modify to fit your agency:\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\],\n\nTotally fair question and honestly, you're right. You can use AI to build a website. We use AI in our process too, so I'm not here to tell you it's smoke and mirrors.\n\nBut I think it's worth being real about what \"using AI to build a website\" actually looks like in practice, because it's pretty different from how it gets talked about.\n\nHere's what actually goes into it:\n\nBefore you ever open an AI tool, someone has to figure out who the site is for, what it needs to say, and what it needs to do. That means understanding your customers, your positioning, and what makes you different from everyone else in your space. AI can help you execute on that, but it can't figure it out for you.\n\nThen there's the copy. AI can write, but it writes generically unless it's given strong direction. Someone still has to know what story your business is telling, what tone matches your brand, and whether the output is actually good or just grammatically correct.\n\nThen design. Then development. Then making sure it loads fast, shows up in search, works on every device, and doesn't break when someone actually tries to use it.\n\nAnd once it's live, a website isn't really done. It needs to be updated, monitored, and adjusted based on how people are actually using it.\n\nNone of that is impossible to do yourself, but it's not a couple of prompts and a launch either. The people getting real results with AI are the ones who know enough about strategy, design, and development to direct it well and catch it when it's wrong.\n\nThere's also something that tends to get overlooked: when you're deep in the day-to-day of running your business, it's really hard to see it from the outside. One of the most valuable things we do early in a project is sit down with clients and just ask questions, the kind a business consultant might ask. And almost every time, that process surfaces things the client hadn't thought to put on their website, messaging angles they'd never considered, or assumptions about their customers that turn out to be wrong. You know your business better than anyone, but that familiarity can also create blind spots. A fresh set of eyes with the right framework tends to find things you can't see from the inside.\n\nI think about it this way: you're probably great at what you do because you've spent years getting good at it. You've built up knowledge, instincts, and judgment that someone couldn't just pick up in an afternoon. We're the same way about web design and development. We're going to be more rigorous, more strategic, and bring ideas to the table that wouldn't come from a few hours with an AI tool, not because the tools aren't powerful, but because knowing how to use them well is its own skill set built over years of doing this work.\n\nThat's really what you're paying for when you work with an agency, not the tools, but the judgment behind them.\n\nHappy to chat more about what that could look like for your project if it's useful.\n\nBest,\n\n\\[Your name\\]\"\n\nThis does a few things: gracefully gives them an opportunity to reach out to you to learn more after all of that education. It reveals what is actually involved in the process of web design and the value of each part of the process. It shows that you know EXACTLY what you are doing. You relate it to their business and expertise and explain you have the same expertise in this field without outright saying \"I have experience doing this and you don't\". You're also talking to them like a human, you're not corporate BSing them, you're being real with them but in a tactful and tasteful way.\n\nTelling clients they are wrong is an absolute art that very few know how to pull off where it turns into the client trusting you MORE not less.",

You don't get paid for educating people, and by the time you've convinced 1 person of your value, you could have pitched 5 who are stretched for time and ready to cut a check.\n\nA business owner who says they'll do something themselves is someone who has more time than money, and those do not make profitable customers. Even when they sign they are often bad to work with - micro-managing and tight with their funds.\n\nLook for businesses who are stretched for time and desperate for what you're selling. Your clients should not be spending their own money, they should be employees at a company with the authority to spend a budget to solve a problem, and for which there are consequences if they do not solve it. Successful or fast growing businesses make much better clients as they have more money than time and will pay well to solve problems.\n\nIf you talk to 100 prospects and nobody wants what you're selling, change up what you're offering. Take a few for coffee and ask what their biggest problem in business is. Focus on the benefits not the features (\"10 new leads a month\" vs \"a great looking website\"). Are you a \"vitamin\" or a \"painkiller\"? That is, if you stop taking a vitamin pill there are no immediate consequences, but skipping a painkiller is something you'll feel right away.\n\nIn my business we sell subscriptions to companies that are in the 5-6 figure range, where we solve a very specific problem. The more specific we have gotten about the problem we are solving, the easier it has been to sell, and the more people will pay. It has taken a number of years to find that problem, and we can still refine it further. We do not speak to companies with less than 50 employees.\n\nI often speak to people who aren't at the point they need us or they don't see the value yet, to which the answer is \"thank you for your time, here's a problem I think you might run into as you scale... when you need help solving it, you know where to find us.\" Treat them with respect, leave them with a clear value prop, and sometimes they'll come back - maybe a year or two later - or more often we get people they refer to us.",

Well, I'd bought the cheap package, but google hadn't told me I'd need a bigger one, so I upgraded, then I tried to install WordPress and I got stuck! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, more reading, more trying stuff and messing it up, a week passes! HOW DISAPPOINTING! In the end I got WordPress installed, then I tried making a site. So you know how things like iPhones are easy to use because Steve Jobs used to walk around offices shouting THIS ISN'T EASY ENOUGH well nobody did that with WordPress and.. well.. I nearly LOST MY MIND! Then I installed elementor, and things got a bit easier, so I managed to get a site together... 6 WEEKS SO FAR.... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I get my site up and running thinking I'll GET LOADS OF VISITORS.... but I don't! I get NONE... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, and I found out that there's this thing called PageSpeed Insights, which gives an idea of how good your site is for visitors, so I run my site and... tell you what... it was LIKE A KICK IN THE NUTS! EVERYTHING WAS RED and I had this HUGE LIST OF \"OPPORTUNITIES\"... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I start fixing them, but there's some things I can't fix, and I'm going \"Why's this still really bad? What am I doing wrong\" so more googling more working out, then I FIND OUT IT'S ELEMENTOR! HOW DISAPPOINTING! That thing that made it easy, that's gone and screwed me downstream!!! So I find out to move away from elementor I've got to redo EVERY PAGE ON MY WEBSITE! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I do that, I pass my core web vitals, I think \"BRING ON THE VISITORS!\"... and all I hear is the sound of crickets chirping and STILL NO VISITORS, HOW DISAPPOINTING! Then I find out about SEO, and like some of it's OK, it involves me doing things to my site, so I'll do that first (because I can) see how it goes. So I REWORK ALL MY SITE'S PAGES. AGAIN. This time optimising titles and meta and doing a bit of schema (don't get me started on that, that was a WHOLE WORLD OF PAIN!), and I check to see if it's made any difference to like ACTUALLY GETTING VISITORS. I DON'T!!! AGAIN!!! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!! So then I find out about backlinks and I need some, right, for SEO, so I do a load of backlinky stuff like what's said on the forums and that... did it work? IT DID NOT! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!! See it turns out there's backlinks and there's BACKLINKS and the ones that work are like, well, pretty hard to get and you need to be able to tell the difference between the backlinks and the BACKLINKS because there are these people on fiverr that will sell you backlinks THAT DO NOTHING for a LOAD OF MONEY! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I find out it's really hard to get the GOOD BACKLINKS so I end up getting an SEO agency to do that. Then... when NOTHING HAPPENS AGAIN I find out there are a lot of crooks in SEO world so I have to make like 50ish phone calls just to FIND SOMEONE NORMAL THAT DOES ACTUALLY DO SEO. The good news is, I now get visitors. The difference between that, and what happens now with AI, is that you get to speak to some robot that talks down to you says things you then need to go off and google anyway (so you might as well be doing that in the first place) completely breaks everything and when you ask it \"why did you tell met to do that it broke everything?\" It says \"You're right, that will break everything\".... (wait for it)... HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!!\n\nDon't be repeatedly disappointed, let me make your website, and I'll be disappointed on your behalf and cut to the \"you get visitors part\" in a couple of weeks instead of a couple of YEARS!",

It's unbelievable, but 2 out of 5 clients have a cousin or a brother-in-law (it's always cousins and brothers-in-law, never a brother or a friend) who are \"experts\" in the field and will do it for the client for free.\n\nI always focus on what I can do that their relative can't. In the case of AI, you could drop something like: \"Well, if you want a generic website, to be dependent on a platform that might raise its prices tomorrow, and to be left completely on your own when a problem arises, then sure, use AI.\"\n\nIn my services, I offer website redesigns (because I usually focus on fixing crappy websites for businesses making over €300,000 a year), including the Figma UI kit so others can maintain it, and the HTML/CSS/JS code. I no longer offer backend because I'm focusing on edge computing with Cloudflare Workers, plus hosting, always trying to find the simplest and cheapest solution for the client to maintain.\n\nDepending on what you offer and what the client currently has (if they already have a website and it's a disaster, if the design is super outdated, or if technically they could save money or stop using prehistoric tech, and yes, I'm looking at you, jQuery), you hit them with the second part: \"I am offering you this, this, and this, which is something no AI or brother-in-law is ever going to give you.\"\n\nI don't have the best conversion rates in these situations, because at the end of the day, clients in Spain tend to be stubborn. They believe AI will do everything even if I tell them otherwise, or they go to another professional because they get offended when you tell it to them straight. But hey, at least you get it off your chest.\n\n\\---   \nI'm leaving the original message in Spanish here so you can verify that I'm not a bot, which has been believed more than once on r/copypasta:\n\nYo trabajo en España (y soy español, estoy traduciendo este mensaje al inglés con IA, que nadie me mate por favor), y más que la de la IA, te encuentras la de \"mi familiar lo hace más barato\". Es increíble, pero 2 de cada 5 clientes tiene un primo o cuñado (solo son primos y cuñados, nunca es un hermano o amigo) que son expertos en el tema y se lo hacen gratis al cliente.\n\nYo siempre me enfoco en lo que hago, y lo que su familiar no. En el caso de la IA, podrías soltarte algo como; \"bueno, si quieres una web genérica, tener dependencia de una plataforma que puede subir los precios mañana, y estar solo cuando te surja un problema, entonces si, usa IA.\"\n\nYo en mis servicios ofrezco el rediseño de web (porque usualmente me enfoco en arreglar las webs pestosas con negocios que facturan +300,000€ al año), con el ui kit en figma para que puedan mantenerlo otros, el código en html/css/js, ya no ofrezco backend porque me estoy enfocando en el edge computing \\[no se si he escrito bien ek termino\\] con los workers de cloudflare, y hosting, intentando buscar la solución más sencilla y barata de mantener para el cliente.\n\nDepende de lo que ofrezcas y lo que tengas del cliente (si ya tiene una web y es un destrozo, si el diseño es muy antiguo, o si técnicamente podría ahorrar dinero o dejar de utilizar tecnologías del prehistórico, y si, estoy mirando a jquery), ya le contestas la segunda parte tal que: \"yo te ofrezco esto esto y esto, cosa que ninguna IA/cuñado te va a dar.\"\n\nNo presento los mejores ratios de conversión en estas situaciones, porque al final en España el cliente suele ser un cabezón que cree que la IA lo va a hacer todo aunque yo le diga que no, o que se va a otro profesional porque le da coraje que se lo digas tal cual, pero bueno, por lo menos te quedas agusto.",

          "text": "Sales guy here. This is very much a sales question, so I'll give you a quick rundown of the situation. \n\nI'll keep it light on the lingo, but in sales terms \"I'll just have AI do it\" is a very classic \"objection\" (stated reason for not buying your goods or services)) - just a newer, shinier version of the ever-present \"Let's just build it in-house\". \n\nThe best way to meet an objection is with knowledge - both of the customer and of the competition. Let's start with the customer. There are 3 levels of things you should be seeking to understand when you engage in these discussions (this process is known as \"discovery\" in sales): \n\n1. Surface level - what's the project? Who's involved? What's the timeline? What's the budget? etc. You should get this stuff down as quickly as possible and move on to the meatier stuff.\n2. Business case - why are they doing the project? Is it revenue-generating? What happens if the deadline pushes? etc. These are at some fundamental level measured in $$$, but your client may be measuring using emotions, relations / promises to others in the company - it's best to speak their language, but seek to understand the math. \n3. Personal - what is personally motivating your contact? Excitement about a new project? A mandate to use AI services  already purchased?  Frustration over out-of-control consulting costs (sorry to bring it up, but you REALLY better know if this is the case)? These will primarily be measured in emotions. \n\nYou need to fully understand what is driving the project and the people pulling it together so that you know how to respond appropriately to the question. \n\nNext - the competition. How well do you know these tools? Do you know how to respond if a customer tells you that they are copy / pasting code out of Grok vs they have purchased Claude Code subs for the whole team? Do you know to quickly hide your smirk when they say Lovable? Do you have a feel for the difference between Haiku in VS Code and Opus in Cursor? If not, you'd better start learning these fast, because they will have very different implications for how the conversation is going to go. \n\nOk, back to your to objection \"I'll just have AI do it\". Now that you're doing the above, multiple paths are open to you based on what you've learned. Let's start with some FUD (fear, uncertainly, doubt) about the competition:  \n\n* \"Oh, great. Your product launch is in a month, right? Who's going to be doing the work?\" \\[aka: you just told me how important this project is - remember that hope is not a strategy\\] \n* \"Yeah, you mentioned you're trying out Lovable. Do you have anyone who's going to be checking the SEO for you?\" \\[classic move - you already know they are making a mistake and they're just starting to learn it\\]\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned that your intern is really excited about vibe coding?

I'm actually helping a lot of my customers project manage that work, because these projects work best when kept within a strict framework\" \n\nThere are a number of ways to align yourself with the customer's vision by making it clear that you are well ahead of them in terms of this new trend. (Heck, have a standardized AI consulting package!)\n\nAnyway, the key here is that when you are met with an objection, you should take a step back and ask questions, rather than trying to meet it head on. Make sure you 1) acknowledge the object 2) seek to understand the question / concern / challenge and get yourself properly positioned before 3) to dispassionately help your customer discuss what is best for them. \n\nThat got longer than I thought, but hopefully it's helpful!

The AI does it eating up a huge amount of your time and effort; having to deal with all it's problems, mistakes, wrong turns, and needing to know what to ask. \n\nIf they ask that, ask them what they think their hourly rate would be, and how many hours it would take them to do it. If they give a ridiculous rate act all surprised, and tell them that if they can really work that fast then you should work together on a web business because there's a ton of money to be made.\n\nThat might also be a good time to point out that they would need to learn all these things about web design, and a good place to bring up a anecdote like this one:\n\n> After Ford's engineers failed to fix a broken generator, Steinmetz was called in, studied it, and precisely marked a spot for repair, fixing it immediately. When Ford questioned the high invoice, Steinmetz itemized it: $1 for marking the spot and $9,999 for knowing where to mark it.\n\nYou're not charging money for writing a website. You're charging money for being someone that knows what a good website is, and how to build it, be it on your own and with an AI. It's the same reason they haven't actually gotten their nephew to built their site. Shit's kinda hard, and the nephew might be good with computers, but probably not good enough yet to design, build, release, and maintain a professional and discoverable website. (And, you know, go to school and such). That sort of knowledge takes experience and an understanding of the world, and of computers. You just happen to be a person that's put in the time to get good at both.\n\nSo really, best you can do is stay professional, lay out the financial reasons, and hopefully you started with a high enough initial offer that they can \"talk you down\" to something you can both agree on. That, or maybe you need to look into better expired boner pill investment opportunities. Some weirdo on craiglist just bought out my entire stock, so maybe the market's turning up",

          "text": "I’ll give you an anecdote. Maybe 7 years ago I called a business that had what looked like an early 2000s html website. Most of the service pages lead to an “under maintenance” page. I called the company and was talking to the owner who told me, “I’ve got a buddy who can do it for a 6 pack of beer why should I pay you?”. At the time I didn’t really know how to respond because hey if you can get your website made for a 6 pack of beer then why not just do it? I just checked the website, it hasn’t changed. \n\nThere’s a disconnect between what people “think” they can do or will do, and what will actually get done. They think AI is a magic solution that will do for them what would have cost $$$, and get the same result. The crux of it is, they don’t know how to make a website that converts. They won’t know good from bad, when something doesn’t work they will just say “fix it” to the magic chatbot then be confused when it doesn’t. \n\nYou’re not selling just website development or marketing. You’re selling your experience creating successful websites that convert. You’re selling someone to fix problems before they occur, and make changes when they are needed. It’s peace of mind and profitability. Will they sleep better at night by making their own website with AI, or if they don’t have to worry about their website and try to figure out why it’s not getting them sales?",

And, my estimates reflect that.** But the skills to plan and manage the project, the skills to ensure your site isn't identical to everyone else's, and the skills to keep it reliable and secure for years to come require careful human attention. Without it, you soon have a mess. And at that point, it's often easier to start from scratch.\"\n\nI bolded a statement that might be unpopular because it could require to reconsider how much you charge for a given task. But as a developer with 40 years of experience, I have to tell you that I have barely touched code in the last month. I've been directing Claude Code instead, with close attention to the results. And that does make a difference, or I wouldn't do it.\n\nSo my advice is to master the technology, put it to work, deliver more work faster, and get ahead that way, accepting that you might have to change your rate for some kinds of work. If there are types of work you do that **can't** be done well by guiding AI (I listed some possibilities above), then of course you can take that into account. But overall, you will be one of the winners if you don't do the \"deer in the headlights\" thing.\n\n(P.S. Yes, I'm paying for Claude Max. Pro also includes some access to Claude Code with advanced models. There's plenty of good advice out there about how to use Claude Code successfully and it should be followed.

That part isn’t hype anymore.\n\nWhere it usually falls apart isn’t the code, it’s the thinking behind it.\n\nAI can generate a page. But it won’t automatically decide what to cut, what to emphasize, how to frame your value for a specific audience, or how to guide someone toward a real action.\n\nThat’s not a knock on AI - it’s just the difference between output and intention. The way I see it: AI can get you to 70–80% much faster than before.\n\nThe real leverage is in what you do with the remaining 20%.\n\nThat’s where strategy, positioning, and experience still matter.\n\n**AI doesn’t replace that, it just changes where the work starts.**",

We tend to treat it as purely negative, but what if you flip the framing?\n\nIf coding models keep getting exponentially better, the technical debt you take on today becomes cheaper to pay off tomorrow. You ship fast now, accumulate some mess, and in six months the tools to clean it up are dramatically better than they are today. I'm not saying this is definitely the right approach, you can obviously go too far with it. But it's worth considering that the cost of paying down AI-generated tech debt might drop fast enough that taking it on aggressively today is actually a reasonable bet.",

Personally, I think it was great for it's time. `$('.thing').click(function() {...})` to me was much more intuitive than `document.getElementById`\n\nThat said, how is Alpine.js, HTMX, etc. etc any different? They're all front-end libraries that manipulate the DOM as opposed to Vanilla JS, but don't get any of the same hate as jQuery.\n\nEdit: spelling",

It was an excellent library designed to implement features that JavaScript was lacking 15 years ago, but now, in general, with querySelectorAll and fetch and so on, you can just use JavaScript without it and have much the same experience.\n\nIt's not that jQuery is rubbish, it's just not really necessary any more. Alpine, HTMX etc are more limited in scope and designed to do one thing - add reactivity to HTML elements - rather than trying to act as a library of missing functions for the whole of JavaScript.",

That makes sense now in hindsight because I was learning fundamentals, syntax, control-flow, looping, etc.\n\nSo when I got to my first startup i was frustrated because I couldn't use by then you could pretty much just do the same thing in vanilla js.

So people start chanting \"jQuery is bad\".\n\nFurthermore, jQuery can't do what React can. At least not easily. It isn't designed for complex state management. The people also started chanting \"just use React\". React became ubiquitous is almost all kinds of web projects, small and large. It's vast ecosystem also makes it attractive. You can show off \"mad skills\" in animation, 3d graphics or large data management very easily with the help of a few React libraries.\n\nHowever, I don't really get why the people behind it love it so much since it also makes your website/app much more complex and you lock in into React for the future. I got it when it was a small framework, but now it tries to cater to all edge cases most devs never encounter. Thus, smaller libraries came up that provide a thin layer of the reactivity React also offers. Especially those who respected the vanilla, so they will never be \"out of fashion\", such as Alpine. The og, Preact.\n\nMost modern front-end JS frameworks are React wannabes that learned their lessons. I'd suggest you adopt progressive enhancement, maybe with a small js library (especially for existing code), and off the races.\n\nReact should die off just like jQuery.",

They're doing this by introducing entirely different tooling (in fact, just as jQuery became defunct as J's caught up -- that's slowly happening with these frameworks too; I can foresee a time a decade or so in the future that everything is handled with native js).",

          "text": "They solve different problems.\n\njQuery's main added value was providing the \"missing\" bits of the DOM API, and brushing over the myriad of implementation differences between browsers. This used to be a big deal back then, but the missing bits have been added since, and web standards have taken care of practically all platform differences. E.g., dynamically attaching a click event listener to arbitrary DOM elements used to be difficult, but these days, you just go `elem.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`, which is pretty much the same as `$(elem).click(function () {...})`. Likewise, back in the days, finding an element in the DOM through anything more complicated than an ID or a simple \"first child of that element with this class name\" would have been extremely verbose, so you would reach for jQuery and say something like `$('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, but now you can go `document.querySelector('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, and it'll do the same thing.\n\nSo all that's left is slightly more compact syntax and familiarity, but pulling in an entire dependency just for that is not worth it in most cases.\n\nAlpine.js and HTMX offer a completely different approach to DOM manipulations - with jQuery and vanilla JS, things are mostly imperative: do this, then do that, insert this element into that element, set this attribute on that node, etc. These libraries, by contrast, allow you to mostly skip the JS part entirely, defining most of the behavior declaratively as part of the DOM itself. You can, in fact, build entire interactive web apps with these libraries without writing a single line of JS yourself. They also take care of some of the trickier bits, such as dealing with error responses, delaying DOM manipulations to allow some time for transitions, blocking or cancelling requests when they start superseding one another, displaying spinners to indicate ongoing requests, etc. None of these are super hard, but getting them right can be annoying and gets old quick.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong; there is a lot of criticism on both Alpine and HTMX; one valid concern, especially with HTMX, is that it discourages client-side rendering, which can lead to unnecessary network traffic and server load. E.g., if you want to paginate your content, the way you would do that with HTMX is render the first page on the server, serve that up as HTML, and hook up the \"next page\" button to request the next page, which then gets rendered to HTML on the server and sent up to the client. With a more client-centric framework, you would instead serve the entire dataset as JSON, in one go, along with the initial request, and then chop it up into pages and rendering the right one on the client, without any further network traffic or server load required to flip through those pages.",

This means using jQuery you tell the browser what do to and how to do it: when this is clicked, do something, then manually update the value in elements x, y, z. Declarative libraries don't require you do do all these steps, instead you have a central state variable, and and when a user interaction changes that value, all those elements x, y, z that use that variable are updated automatically by the library's internal reactivity system.\n\nImperative libraries are more likely to lead to \"spaghetti code\" as a page grows more complex, as you have to remember and manually code for all the downstream updates when anything changes. You either just write this code haphazardly as needed by a page, or you start creating design patterns for app-level implementation, an example being the publish-subscribe pattern (\"pub/sub\"). You can see some of these patterns in older library examples in \"Learning JavaScript Design Patterns\" by Addy Osmani. Some of these patterns are now internal to these frameworks/libraries, and these abstractions allowed devs to approach coding with a declarative style. You could say the \"reactivity\" systems of React and Vue were basically pub/sub implementations at heart.",

They all used js (and css but not relevant here) slightly differently and the options we had were \n\n1. Make different js files for each browser\n2. Memorise the differences and do a check for browser inside each method and adding the different code in a bunch of ifs\n3. Use Jquery\n\nDoing some things (like ajax requests or animations) were incredibly difficult and it was so hard to find a working solution. Stack overflow wasn't anywhere near as big as it is now - people were still in the phase of finding answers on random blogs, or even buying physical books on coding.\n\nAlong comes jQuery, and let you write the code once and it works in all browsers, and everything that is hard to accomplish is wrapped in a one liner. Everyone rejoiced and we all jumped on board. It got even more useful for a few more years as we had to add support for IE9 and 10 and some companies wouldn't drop support for IE6 for far too long.\n\nThe trade off was performance. We didn't like that the user had to download an extra file (these were the days before fibre connections so that file could add an extra second to first open time) and everything was 100x slower using JQ. A lot of things were so fast that 100x slower was still 0.01 seconds so it didn't matter, but for the things that would take 1 second in vanilla js it could take 30s+ in JQ. It made systems more easily maintainable, so brought value in the eyes of the managers for a slight trade off of certain things being really slow. These were the days when everything was slow anyway, and you didn't lose customers for a page taking 5 seconds to load. Overall it was worth it for the saved development time.\n\nToday's benefits are very different. You can do things in 1 line instead of 2 like your example `$('.button').click(function...)` instead of `var button = document.getElementById` then `button.onclick = function...` That is literally the only benefit I can think of. Most browsers are based on chrome, and the ones that aren't still follow the JS specifications properly so you don't need to maintain different versions of code. Things that used to be difficult are now easier to do, and really easy to find a working example online of how to do it.\n\nThe trade off is still performance - last year I rewrote a jquery function that was replacing all td within a table using a vanillajs function and brought the execution time down from 30+ seconds to under 1 second. The performance that was previously worth it for saving hundreds of hours of developer time and increasing maintainability is now a performance hit just so that a developer can write things in 1 line instead of 2. It just isn't worth it any more.",

          "text": "There is no good way to say those things, and being a professional means you don't say them.\n\n\"Sorry, I don't have the bandwidth to pick this project up but I appreciate you reaching out.  If you have a new project in the future I'd be happy to chat with you about it, thanks!\"\n\nIf they push or prod you, you can explain that taking over a project that is in-progress, even a project that seems almost complete to the client, can be more work & cost than building it the right way from the start.  \n\nThat is certainly true for me.  There was an e-commerce WordPress project that someone reached out to me to take over, they had a bad experience with their first developer, both technical issues but also interpersonnel issues between the owner of the company and the developer ... some rumblings about legal action from both sides.  I agreed to take a look at it, started to consult with them, but pretty quickly jumped off the project, I didn't accept any pay for it despite spending \\~20 or so hours working on various parts of it.  There was a \"technical lead\" (the owner's brother in law) who I worked with primarily, he's the guy who hired me, and I was frank with him, told him that it's much harder to jump into a project and \"get it over the finish line\" than it is to build it the way that I built projects from the start.  I would have been making up for the technical debt of this developer, but also that the original developer did not have the experience to push back against the owner's vision and promised things that just couldn't be done for the budget expectations that she had set.\n\nI liken it to plumbing.  A plumber quotes $10,000 for a job, but someone else quotes $1,000 for the same job.  The home owner hires the person who quoted $1,000, but after weeks and weeks the work isn't complete, they're not around, there's water leaking.  You're brought in to \"finish their work,\" but your quote now isn't $10,000, it's $15,000, because it requires un-doing the shoddily done inexperienced work that isn't to code.",

It is also possible the other way around, albeit much less likely: LH may report 100 points, but if real visitors use dialup connection on 8 years old low-end devices your RUM data will be all red...\n\nI think at the end of the day SERP positions are only affected by the RUM data, LH is just an assistive tool for developers, it is not a source of truth for Google.",

Pretty clear line between frontend and backend.\n\nNow I'm writing server components, setting up edge functions, configuring middleware, dealing with database queries in my \"frontend\" framework, thinking about caching strategies, and recently even having to consider how AI agents will interact with the sites I build. Half of what I do would have been called \"backend work\" not that long ago.\n\nI'm not complaining, it's genuinely more interesting. But I'm curious if other people are experiencing this same shift.

It’s still about state management, rendering performance, UX constraints, and translating product requirements into reliable interfaces.\n\nWhat did change for me is that I now have to understand the entire request lifecycle.

I can prototype an entire API layer with Claude in an hour now, so there's even less reason to wait for a dedicated backend developer to pick up the work. The role isn't quietly becoming fullstack.

Nothing sensitive but really no reason to be sitting in an Angular app when we had dedicated Java BFFs.\n\nWe've started rewriting some of our older apps and have been a lot stricter around business logic sitting in the backend and letting the frontend focus on UI presentation and UX logic. The angular apps feel a lot more focused and leaner for it.\n\nMy company has an SRE team dealing with a lot of the infrastructure and dev ops. This can be both a blessing and a curse as a developer.",

Doing CTE, joins, and grouping things ruin that mapping.\n\nMost of the time, I write raw SQL and transform them to query builders, because dynamic where conditions with raw SQL sucks. I am not willing to manually concatenate raw SQL strings. However, it's a little harder to read. I usually put an example raw query as a comment for readability, if the query itself is extremely complex.\n\nIf the filter requirement is simple, I use raw SQL, without query builders.",

At some point, you have to turn results into objects to do work, and whether or not that's using pre-built conventions or rolling your own mappers it's not something you can escape.\n\nThat said, I would divide the spectrum of ORMs into four rough groups:\n\n1. Tools that use SQL as the exchange language (e.g. raw JDBC or pg_query).\n2. Tools that use languages like SQL, but not SQL itself (e.g. Hibernate HQL).\n3. Tools that build queries in a way dissimilar to normal collections (e.g. Knex, SeaORM, Hibernate).\n4. Tools that build queries in a way similar to normal collections (e.g. Entity Framework).\n\nEach of these has their pitfalls, but generally as you go down the list safety and discoverability of the API increase, and as you go up the list transparency increases (what you write is more similar to what the database executes). Since I value safety more than transparency (much like how I prefer garbage collection to manual memory management), I lean toward the bottom end of the list and tools that more tightly integrate model definitions, migrations, and queries/statements with the language I'm actually doing work in; it's a much better experience to have a compiler catch most potential problems than to let them happen at runtime.\n\nThe best experience comes from mixing #1 and #4 like is possible in Entity Framework: most of your simple queries and updates can be handled as if you were just handling lists and objects in-memory, but the escape hatch is there to skip generation go directly to SQL when necessary for things like stored procedures and features not yet supported by the rest of the ORM.",
