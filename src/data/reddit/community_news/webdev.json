Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company. I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.\n\nMoreover, with the recent updates from Claude i wonder if developers or going to last. Please note, i’m not naive. I have seen what the new models from Claude can do. It’s scary. So before putting in statements like “engineering is not only coding”, “we’ll get do roles like product or architecture”, “competent developers would always be required” please dont. The current state of these models is already mind blowing, imagine what they’ll achieve in the next 2-3 years. If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nI did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. But now i think all that was a waste, should have just prepared for govt exams like my dad used to insist me for. At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nThis all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists? \n\nI feel betrayed and cheated, i wish these ai companies and ai preachers rot in hell",

If you persisted tokens over a long period of time, that would be kind of like what you're talking about. But, every additional token that needs to be consumed for a prompt increases cpu and memory usage. And crucially, gen AI doesn't actually remember anything; it simply takes in previous tokens to give it some level of guidance for the next thing it spits out, which mimics having a context about previous input and output. When you're talking to a chat bot, the reason it *seems* like it remembers what you had said is because the previous chat history (or a tokenized, summarized version of it) is fed into it for each prompt. It would be like having a conversion with someone, but every response you say (or they say) all the previous conversation must be repeated up to that point.

They constantly push this crap and just copy-paste responses from Claude instead of telling me themselves. I told them exactly this, that apart from the technical and security concerns (there's data leaks constantly in the field and they still have to assure me they're being strict enough with how they process our customer's sensible data through their agents), it's almost certain they're trying their best to make us dependant on their infrastructure and then steeply raise prices once monopoly's been estabilished. They just... shrugged and said it is the future and we must walk the walk.\n\nI'm not actually looking for a new job because of this, but, since that conversation, I'm seriously considering what my plan B should be. I'm considering English teacher but, I dunno, with DeepLy or even normal LLMs... the problem is the same - how do I convince my students they need to know it? I can tell them innumerable practical cases for knowing English yourself, but will they just shrug as well and say 'who cares'?",

              "text": "Prices won't go up that much, because that'd be counter-productive. Instead we'll see quality go down as companies realize you can do good enough, and start to use more limited, specialized AIs (or even just straightforward non-AI tools) instead of generic and expensive LLMs for more and more tasks. This limits what can be achieved, but again good enough is good enough. Companies will realize that if AI can do 60% (down from 80%) of what a junior engineer does it's still a great gain, but it would mean engineers would have to do more work.\n\nThe thing is, if AIs were really improving efficiency that much we'd see an explosion of little side projects in companies. Because why not: just throw a new agent to work on the little thing and then show it off. Yet we are not seeing this, engineers are busy while their productivity isn't that much higher.\n\nWhat will change is that a lot of jobs that we handed off will now not be handed off as much. When tickets they'll be split into three buckets: AI handles it (for trivial bugs), hand off to junior/mid (for bugs that are not trivial, but also don't require a large volume of knowledge, allowing developers to gain a deep or wide understanding without getting overwhelmed) and the problems that go to seniors+ (problems that require a deep and wide understanding of the issue, and are non-trivial, problems that have strong political weight or challenge to them such as bugs in the interaction of code belonging to multiple teams, and systemic issues). The automated tool itself only goes as far as it can, it can collect pertinent logs and data, identify the potential commits at fault, create a repro test, offer potential solutions, not all done by AI, all of these to help close the ticket, only when it basically does all the job and only needs a review is it considered \"handled by AI\". Also this shifts certain responsibilities, we'd expect juniors and mid engineers to review code a lot more, and trust them to handle more things, to balance this mentorship will be a bigger issue on senior+ engs because we need junior/mid to be able to increase in skill faster.\n\nSo it will transform our jobs, how exactly isn't sure now, and it's going to be a transition. The problem is that right now leadership thinks it has a clear idea and it's pushing it blindly with the engineers on the ground not seeing how it could work out. This is eating away at morale. Leadership is acting really blindly here, and it will result in companies getting stuck in their own mire, as it has happened before.",

The answer is that you'll learn a new skill that can't be filled by the new technology, just like the telephone operators, telegram operators, horseshit shovelers (when cars became popular), hand-copiers of books (printing press) of the past, etc etc etc...\n\nHuman wants and ambition will always change and increase. We will always have needs to fill. I predict AI *WILL* be able to do *anything* you or I can do with a computer, someone will take advantage of that, unfortunately we do not have a choice in this matter. I'm guessing it'll be a matter of years before all webdev is phased out, so yeah, prep for that lol\n\nTwo hundred years ago, you'd call us insanely stupid for wanting to be able to talk to anyone across the world in milliseconds, now it's a basic thing that just sort of exists in developed countries. The same thing is happening now with the big ai shift, you can hate it all you want, but it's literally just better ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEdit: This isn't to say I've figured it all out, either. I taught myself how to use a frontend webdev tool, made my own personal site and found it fun, joined this sub. I still haven't made a penny with webdev, don't know if I ever will, but it's a fun skill for now for sure. I still work a crappy job that I don't truly enjoy and isn't paying me enough, so I'm very much still looking for my \"thing\", the ai onslaught isn't helping me either lmao",

Because no-code tools that \"anyone can use\" have been around for decades, and managers still want to be telling developers what to build even if they technically could be doing the work with those no-code tools themselves. \n\nAnd the same will happen here. Developers will continue to be specialists wrangling all of the code. Really trivial \"plumbing\" category code tasks and simple UI will mostly be done by AI, but there will still need to be an expert involved for the foreseeable future.\n\nFrankly, most managers don't want to be coding or prompting. They are done with being an IC and want to keep track of higher level details. And there is no universe where some rando untrained minimum wage employee can replace a software engineer as the prompter.\n\nThe tools are pretty good, but they still make really bad mistakes with algorithm and architecture. They're useful to save some time at first, but if you're not a competent software engineer, you'll be spending 100x as much effort trying to iterate to fix errors you don't understand. And as the architecture gets further off the rails, the multiplier keeps going up.\n\nFinally, the way a lot of corporate management works, there's more prestige the larger your team is. It's rare that any manager will want to lose members of their team, so instead of cutting jobs (assuming AI is effective at increasing productivity) they will tighten schedules and add features.\n\nThere are always more features to add. Unless you're maintaining something like a web site for a restaurant that only needs a new menu update every couple of months, the backlog is usually enormous. If not the backlog, then the feature wish list. I'm skeptical that AI will result in more than a 10-20% productivity boost over the long term, but even if it does, they'll just ask for more work to be done.",

And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nPffft no you're just retarded.\n\nI'll give you a parallel. Cloud providers (AWS / GCP). At the beginning it was great right? I was around for those days, companies just offloading entire in house IT departments and hardware on prem into the cloud. And you could horizontally scale pretty easy...\n\nFast forward a decade or more, now that they've upped the ingress egress fees, enshitified everything with a gazillion microservices, and made it extremely hard to migrate away (since you're using their bespoke API) it's flipped back. It's actually cheaper to host your own data and stick it behind some caching, then use those services.\n\nIt's going to be the same with AI.\n\nStarts out nice and roses. But eventually they're going to have to put up the $prices to hand off cost. As for vibe coding, i can imagine it inserting random code that spawns ads. If devs aren't in control / no ones doing PR reviews and they're just AI-ing all the stuff. You'll get ads in your software where there should be none, and with the wrong tracker the profits would go elsewhere.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nUhuh, because it's not like they made generative AI that's churning out slop images, and videos' targeting basically everyone in the content industry... animators, artists. They didn't train it on all legal documents and test it against lawyers...\n\nAI stands for artificial inflation, as that's mostly what it's done so far.",

It's not really meant to be fun. It's great that you found it fun for a while, but that runs out for most people at some point.\n\nEventually you realise that you're not doing new and exciting things. You're just doing the internet's plumbing, and then it's not really quite as fun anymore.\n\n> If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. \n\nWhat is this full scale people keep talking about? I try keep up with all the latest research, I run a home lab, I try out various products, I watch podcasts, I follow announcements, and I just keep missing this \"full scale use\" that you describe. If anything, one think keeps being abundantly clear, AI does a great job at multiplying and magnifying human effort, and does a mediocre job of simulating human effort with periodic horrible mistakes that can set you back a ton if you miss them. \n\n> I did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. \n\nIt is. Getting good at AI, and understanding how you can leverage your life of experience in combination with AI is the next step you have to embrace if you want to be a good developer going forward. It's not like your skills are pointless. Sure you don't have to type out all that code yourself, but you still have to read it and think about it and discuss it and decide how to evolve it. Your skills and logic are still critically important, it's just now part of utilising those skills and logic is how well you can convey your intent to the AI, and how well you can track what the AI is doing.\n\n> At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nYou really think government employees are going to escape the AI revolution? You're just on the leading wave. You have the unique opportunity to surf this wave into the new age at it's crest, and your complaint seems to be that it's not fun anymore. Well, then try to use AI for something more fun, maybe something you've been putting off because it seemed way too hard to tackle. By the time AI comes for the government it's going to be late enough that they are likely to struggle far more than you will as you learn the new styles of working with AI.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nAI companies are focus on software because there's an infinite need for software, and that need is ever changing and evolving. Instead of bemoaning it, embrace the super-power your understanding of software gives you. You can talk to the AI on the same level, and direct it in ways people without that experience can't even hope to replicate.",

It had added tooltips which in our app are spans that form blue circles with a white i, but it added purple circles with a white *i* (cursive here to emphasize the i’s looked different). So after thinking a bit it realized it had added tooltips using the `info` class instead of `normal`. So it happily changed those and finished, but upon rendering the i’s looked different still. Turns out that the font difference for the i’s depended on using the `text-normal` class, and Claude rendered the tooltips using `text-info` and **in the same line where the info class was!** So of course I had to change that myself and be done with it. So if it could happen that Claude or Opus or others are able to eliminate software engineering jobs, either new jobs will open to fill in what they can’t do, or it would happen after a good long time yet.",

It's all mature and well documented and my IDE's have been churning this stuff out for years, I don't really care if it's an AI doing it. I like it and I'm not scrounging around in the same docs over and over. \n\nWhat AI can't replace is experience and intuitive problem solving. When something goes wrong I know how to fix it because I either wrote it or reviewed and committed it. I don't let AI write without explicit permission and I'm still cautious. I don't entirely trust it to stay in scope and have heard too many horror stories. This is a skill issue, but it's hard to keep up.\n\nUpdates are the same way. Terrible to automate and I've been burnt too many times. I'll be happy to look them over myself, it's kinda my job.\n\nI'm aware of my skill issues and know I'm not using AI to the fullest, but I need to determine just how much time and money to invest. This is a moving target and if I spent my time learning the models I wouldn't be working much at all. \n\nIt's a hard balance to find and I sympathize with anyone starting out.

I tend to sort waffle between two trains of thought on this subject. \n\nDespair: I feel very similarly to you, and it upsets me that AI is basically here to stay. I write code because I enjoy it, and the admin work of managing an AI agent is cool, but not what I want to do with my time. I’m fortunate that my job only wants us to use it as much as we want to use it. So I mostly use it for tedious work that I don’t want to do or when I get stuck. However, it’s important that any of us in that boat recognize that this will likely change over time. As everyone gets used to the speed of AI, they will get less patient with project timelines and expect quicker turnaround.\n\nOptimism: I’m optimistic about my career in two ways. \n\nPart 1) AI can write code better than me, but it doesn’t have the context to understand what my specific job/app/company needs without my input. That is to say, it needs my guidance and I don’t foresee a time when that stops being true. I’ve give it jira stories and watched it do exactly what I would have done. I’ve also seen it miss really subtle details than would have been incredibly frustrating bugs to figure out because it just doesn’t understand complex legacy business rules the way that I do.\n \nPart 2) You mentioned that this is a merit based career. I feel similarly and I don’t think that’s changing. I choose to see this as an opportunity to think about what I can do on a much grander scale than I could have before. Human creativity is essential to using this tool to solve problems that we might not have been able to tackle before, and our individual knowledge and skills will still be what separates each of us from each other. Now we get to think about what problems we want to solve that we might have never dared to approach before. Personally I’m working on finding ways of fixing a broken spine without having to drill into our vertebrae. The current standard approach is spinal fusion which comes with a lot of problems. I’m going to need that surgery myself so I figure why not use these tools to try to find a new solution to my problem?",

          "text": "I agree that this AI stuff is leading to people just shutting off their brain. I wouldn't say it's \"targeted\" at Developers, it's just their main job tasks were some of the ones \"easily automated\" so it affected them first and foremost. But this AI craze is having wide-reaching effects across many industries. It's going to (actually already has) led to software quality going way down and now customers are expected to be the QA. So it's a terrible user experience but companies don't care because it's cheaper to do that and deal with the customer complaints than it is to pay actual people to actually develop and QA software manually and release a solid product like they used to. I know that's like a totally foreign concept now. Business leaders have convinced themselves its OK to do this to the customer (despite the customer feedback worldwide that clearly says otherwise) because of all the BS that Dev leaders have relayed to them - buzzwords like \"agile\" and \"feedback loops\" which lead to \"better products\".....BS. But yet it seems like that's where we're at (it actually started well before AI but AI has just accelerated that process tenfold).\n\nBut the bigger concern to me, outside of just software development, with this AI stuff is the fact that it's leading to a society where people quite literally are learning **not** to use their brain. In the past, being smart, sharp, witty, etc. were all positive traits that we admired in people. Now it seems people are happy to let AI solve problems for them, write emails for them, do everything for them. And just like physical muscle, where if you don't use them, over time you start to lose them - critical thinking and mental skills are very much the same.\n\nAI is - or should be - *just a tool* and treated as such. But that is not the way society is treating it - we're treating it as a replacement for humans which is absolutely the wrong approach. Why? Many reasons, but if the thought of our own race's mental capacity declining isn't depressing enough to get people to pay attention, then maybe they should think about what happens when AI becomes so good it decides it doesn't want to listen to you anymore. We're already seeing real-life examples of this happen and the real-life effects it can cause. People assume we can always just \"pull the plug\" if that happens before any real damage is done.... really? You sure about that? I'm certainly not.\n\nBut yeah, it's honestly just more depressing than anything thinking about the direction the world is going and such a vast majority are so blissfully happy with it because they just can't get over the stuff they see AI do. It's just so amazing to them it's fooled them into thinking it's a silver bullet that will be a solution for all problems. Talk about having the wool pulled over your eyes. I was taught at a very young age - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. And that advice has served me very well through my life. I firmly believe AI is one of those cases - there are unseen costs that we will ultimately pay but nobody knows quite exactly what those are yet. But unless something changes drastically I don't know that there's any way to \"put the genie back in the bottle\". The next few months and years will be very interesting.",

Why did I have to suffer and sacrifice my free time/life? I remember spending 3 months over the summer figuring out a feature/new tech stack and how to implement it (At that time I only knew Frontend and some basic backend concepts). Out of curiosity, I asked AI to create my site idea for me, and it got a semi-working, fully styled and responsive/adaptive version in a single prompt. Something tells me if I had prompted it more, it would've corrected the mistakes. Yet, I always get people saying that if you can get \"replaced by AI\", you aren't a good developer. Like, come on... When I was first learning full stack, I almost gave up due to how difficult some of the concepts I had to learn were as a frontend dev. However, I pushed through to get it right, and then I went back to college, and my juniors who were asking me to debug spaghetti AI-generated CSS last semester had full-blown website prototypes with CRUD and login/signup using PHP and some SQL. The only thing I'd say I had over them is understanding the security stuff and knowing the concepts in and out as well as the architecture and the sheer speed at which I can work without Google or AI. And the fact that now people don't care about stuff like proper ci/cd or testing; they just want to ship features, while I had to sit and learn that stuff.\n\nThe bright side is my degree is B.Ed so I can teach professionally anywhere though I dread teaching ATM.",

(Like just google it)\n\n  \n\\# Final words:\n\nAI is slop\n\n  \n\\# Words to AIs developers:\n\nDon't keep the devil waiting, he's already opened the deepest pit of hell for you.",

When a tool removes too much friction from the hard parts, you're not in flow — you're just monitoring. Reviewing. Nudging. It's work, but it doesn't feel like building something. The satisfaction loop that made programming enjoyable for a lot of people came from the struggle, not the output.\n\n\n\nI don't think this means the tool is bad. But there's a real adjustment period where you have to rebuild what \"fun\" means in this context. For me it shifted to architecture and system design — the parts that are genuinely still hard, where the AI gives you a wrong answer confidently and you have to know why it's wrong.\n\n\n\nIf you're bored, you might just be using it for the wrong parts of your work. Not every part of programming should be AI-assisted. Keep the parts that are hard for you as yours.",

People still pay the subscriptions for those other services, which is why they continue to go up frequently (because they get away with it) while very little changes in them - the UI largely stays the same, the content on them is the same (and in some cases the quantity lessened due to other streaming services getting rights), they’re just as buggy, etc., and always claim “innovation” as their reason for the price increase.\n\n1Password can’t be compared to some of that as it’s not a streaming platform, but they address their bugs (usually in a reasonably timely fashion), and have to constantly stay on top of cyber threats to prevent unauthorized access to credentials housed in their product - which, I’m sure becomes increasingly difficult given some of the tools available today, and trying to weave in some other new things to help users.\n\nSo, to me, if any of the services legitimately justify a price increase (let alone one so little - especially in comparison to what streaming platforms usually increment by) it’s a password manager.\n\nNot going to get into a political debate for the rest.",

When you do that it uses windows hello to fill in a password which can be very unsafe imo.\n\nNext it doesn’t have an application for Linux. So if you ever want to move from windows to Linux you will be missing out on the password manager.\n\nAnother downside as a European is that my data now is with an American company which has me worried about privacy. I think 1Password is Canadian which tracks a lot better imo\n\nBright side is that my not so techy wife uses it because it’s pre-installed. Sharing passwords is easy with another user.

This is probably shockingly easy. A combination of kompromat, bribes, honeypots, etc. \n* Infiltrate with employees. Anything ranging from cleaning services to new hires. In my many years of consulting, I was always shocked as to how quickly I was handed the keys to the kingdom; or left one step away from them. The IT people would wax poetic about how hardcore their security procedures were, and then leave me alone in the server room along with some local telco repair guy.\n* Compromise a dependency.

There are countries out there which wouldn't even hesitate to spend a billion getting access to a product like this; and would probably spend many billions after thinking about it a bit.\n\nOnce you have one or more of the above, whatever hardass mathematically impregnable security they've got can be turned into something with backdoors, or just reduced to one step shy of plaintext.\n\nAs the OP is asking, \"What Open Source\" which is probably the closest anyone can easily get to avoiding most of what I suggest above.",

Made a simple app for uploading and displaying charts and data with filters and such. \n\nIt worked, sort of. I went back and inspected the code it had written and dear god it looked like something I had written when I first started coding:\n\nThe view functions were massive, like 800+ lines of code for a single function, and while many shared the same logic, it had duplicated it instead of refactoring it out into helper functions. All the js and css was scattered throughout the html, and again duplicate logic with functions sometimes doing the same thing but named slightly differently.\n\nI think I spent more time trying to debug and refactor it into something that was halfway decent and maintainable than if I would have built it from scratch. \n\nThese people live in a bubble, and can’t see the forest through the trees. Anyone can build an app, but building is only part of the process. I will admit that it has boosted my productivity, but maybe 10%? 15% max, not even close to the claims I’ve seen made.\n\nI fear that we are going to see more and more apps like the one described above built by people who have no idea how they work.

For example, migrating a legacy app off of old server infrastructure to an OpenShift cluster or debugging a prod issue between multiple services. Even if you take \"coding\" to mean just the literal coding part of development, I've found that while it can do a remarkable amount of work building new applications, getting that last 10% of the app to work properly thru vibe coding alone is a pain in the ass. Not to mention the amount of technical debt that piles up in the process, and this is just for personal projects without any serious security considerations or complexity in general.",

Recently I asked my CTO to look up a test that he made, after the code I wrote broke it and the fix I applied didn't solve it. Later, he literally copypasted a Claude answer and didn't elaborate. Went to look what the agent suggested - sure, the code was fixed in backend, but the frontend app would be broken in some cases because of the arbitrary choices Claude made and he didn't fact-check. I spent literally 10 minutes to make a fix that can solve the test and show all the data in frontend. I just had to sit down and read some of the code with a decent IDE.\n\nWe need to learn these tools, sure... to recognize them as a concurring reason for sloppy work.",

I have always insisted on readable code for maintainability of any project.

In the last year alone, the platform I developed generated over $15k in revenue for him. It’s stable, fast, and it clearly converts.\n\nAnnual renewal for hosting and maintenance (just a few hundred bucks) came up, and he asked for a quote for a full rebranding. His exact words were:\n\"I only need to change texts. If you charge me too much, I’m going back to Wix.\". Clearly it is not only a text change but a complete renewal keeping only the same colors ignoring the UX adjustments, SEO migration, and the actual value of a rebranding.\n\nHonestly, the stress has accumulated to the point where I just want to let him go. If he thinks Wix is so great, let him deal with it. But here’s my dilemma: I don't want to just \"hand over\" all the custom logic and hard work I put into this platform for pennies, especially after this level of disrespect.\n\nWhat should I do? Just hand over the keys and walk away for my own mental health? Do I \"strip\" the custom proprietary logic before he migrates (since he only paid for the service, not the full IP of my custom code)? How do I protect my work without being \"the bad guy,\" while making sure he realizes that moving to Wix means losing everything I built for him?\n\nI’m tired.\n\nEDIT: There is no written contract, only an invoice for \"site development\"\n\nEDIT2: I clarified that my work generated revenue to point out that the funds to pay me are definitely there, my intention wasn't to reproach him or ask for more money",

Thus I doubt OP has any ground regarding what he claims as his \"custom code\" or \"IP\". \n\nPeople get so attached to their own code, it's unreasonable. You created the code _for_ a client. The client sooner or later is going to change things. Let go of your ego.",

HTML is a standard markup language used in the design of websites. The Copyright Office will not register HTML as a computer program, because HTML does not constitute source code. Source code is typically written by a human being using a computer programming language, such as Java, C, or C++. By contrast, HTML is frequently generated by automated website design software. You can register HTML as a literary work if it was created by a human being, not a website design program, and if it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression. To register HTML, you must submit a complete copy of the entire code; you cannot submit an isolated portion of the code using the options discussed below. For more information about registering HTML and website content generally, see Copyright Registration of Websites and Website Content (Circular 66).  \n\nand\n\n> Hypertext markup language (HTML) is a standard markup language used in the design of websites. It is frequently generated by automated website design software. HTML establishes the format and layout of the content that appears on a particular web page by instructing the user’s browser to \r\npresent that content in a specified manner. If you want to register content that has been posted on a website, you should submit the content in the form in which it appears on the actual website. There is no reason to submit the HTML code for that site unless you specifically want to register the human-written portions of the HTML itself and any website text that is embedded within the HTML. A registration for HTML will not cover any formatting and layout that may be dictated by the HTML or style sheets. Nor will it cover any audio, visual, or audiovisual content that may appear on a website and is not perceptible in the HTML. HTML may be registered as a literary work only if it was created by a human being and it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.  \n\n(copyright.gov)\n\nSo even if OP were to claim copyright, they would have to claim the _whole_ code, not just parts or their \"custom code\", and also have to prove the written HTML contains sufficient amount of creative expression. If there are parts within the HTML code that have not been written by OP themselves, they cannot claim copyright at all.",

Unless you are a true employee, by default programming code copywrite belongs to whomever wrote it.\n\nThe client possibly has a claim to the 'visual' portion of the website but not the underlying code.  Which would allow the client to rewrite the website in WIX.\n\nThat is why it is so critical that if you ever contract out to someone to write code for you that your contract includes a transfer of copywrite.\n\nA non-coding example.  A company hires me to film and edit a 30 second commercial.  They only thing they own is the final version of the commercial... they can't come back later and ask for all the unedited footage that was used to assemble the final product.\n\nWork for hire info\n\n[https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf)\n\n\n\n",

It gets a bit less clear when dealing with source code that may not be part of the final \"deliverable\" (website, etc); in theory, the client doesn't automatically have any right to that, but in practice it very well may be implied as part of the final product they paid for, such as any backend CMS type stuff.\n\nOne thing you want to be very careful with is when you are acting as a host for their site and deciding to withhold access to it during a dispute.  This is more frequently a concern for an MSP or someone else that has \"keys to the kingdom\" type admin access to actual business data (admin logins, DNS, etc) needed to function, but it's not often hard for a website with potential privileged information or revenue generation (like client contact info, user logins, e-store, etc) to get lumped into that.\n\nThat doesn't mean you are obligated to host their site, but you can't really deny them access to it while also taking it offline without a really strong contract or legal advice in place.  \n\nIn your case, I would suggest handing over whatever the original deliverable was (website you developed), including the most recent copy of whatever data is currently live.  Basically, provide them with the data they need to set the site up on their own hosting service.  Feel free to offer to help migrate it at your normal hourly rate if you'd like.\n\nDefinitely don't act like a jilted ex trying to claim ownership over some random shit (site source code) simply because you're upset.",

Its similar to Rapid API but way more curated (every API in there is checked and verified), and they go all under a single subscription. Moreover they have a service certification for each API which means that you can verify things like data retention policies, retention periods etc. ",

We tried scaling VPS's but there is no clear pattern to when the platform might pick up and the scaling takes too long to react. Using a worker to handle the uploaded audio transmission blocks practically gets rid of the irregular scaling issues we had at the start. \n\nOnce the upload is received, the worker records it in the database and sends it to a Kafka stream which is how it is stored instead of traditional file storage. \n\nThe downside to workers is they are targets for abuse. You have to implement bot protection and build in authentication for each request. We use WAF to block repeated requests that fail auth (and also all countries that are not North America since our platform is specific to this region) alongside rate limiting requests as an added measure to prevent flooding. When your paying for every request a flood event that goes unchecked can cost you a ton of money. \n\n",

The number of total URLs is reasonable. And of course it is also served very fast. \n\nIt's a pity because a potentially useful feature has to be taken away.

That bet is going to look terrible in 18 months.\n\nThe real solution is rate limiting, not blocking. Set up a robots.txt crawl-delay, put a CDN in front with bot rate limits, and cache aggressively. If Vercel can't handle that natively, that's a Vercel problem, not an AI problem.\n\nAlso worth noting: if your open-source docs show up in ChatGPT answers, that's free distribution to millions of developers.

Among other things, it allows you to make smaller DOMs.\n\nI talk about a modern CSS technique that does that here:\n\nhttps://op111.net/posts/2023/08/lean-html-markup-with-modern-css/\n\nIt is an idea I started playing with when custom properties landed in browsers, around 2016 or 2017? Around 2021 I started using the technique in client sites too.\n\nNow I want to write a 2026 version of the post that talks about container queries too. The technique becomes more powerful if you can rely on container queries and on the cqw unit. (You cannot always.

          "text": "*This is a long post, but it's a master class in client relations, I promise you'll get something out of this.*\n\nOkay, most people in here are approaching this from a combative perspective or fear-inducing perspective \"What if it breaks?\" \"How will you update it?\". \n\nSome of y'all have never worked with clients and it shows. Neither of those approaches will ever actually land you clients.\n\nThis is an obvious client education opportunity. The idea is to educate them and reveal what the real process is and do it as humbly and tactfully as possible so they don't feel dumb.\n\nFrom the client's perspective they are thinking \"I can just jump in ChatGPT for an hour or two and bang out a website\". Our goal in the response is to acknowledge that they can indeed use AI to build a website, but subtly explain that it's more than just running a few prompts in ChatGPT.\n\nThis serves a couple purposes: it makes them realize \"Oh this is actually much more of a process and involves more work than I realized\" and it also makes them realize \"Wow these guys know their stuff\". You're essentially educating and selling them at the same time without them realizing it.\n\nOkay, all that sounds cool, but what does it look like in practice, here's an email you can modify to fit your agency:\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\],\n\nTotally fair question and honestly, you're right. You can use AI to build a website. We use AI in our process too, so I'm not here to tell you it's smoke and mirrors.\n\nBut I think it's worth being real about what \"using AI to build a website\" actually looks like in practice, because it's pretty different from how it gets talked about.\n\nHere's what actually goes into it:\n\nBefore you ever open an AI tool, someone has to figure out who the site is for, what it needs to say, and what it needs to do. That means understanding your customers, your positioning, and what makes you different from everyone else in your space. AI can help you execute on that, but it can't figure it out for you.\n\nThen there's the copy. AI can write, but it writes generically unless it's given strong direction. Someone still has to know what story your business is telling, what tone matches your brand, and whether the output is actually good or just grammatically correct.\n\nThen design. Then development. Then making sure it loads fast, shows up in search, works on every device, and doesn't break when someone actually tries to use it.\n\nAnd once it's live, a website isn't really done. It needs to be updated, monitored, and adjusted based on how people are actually using it.\n\nNone of that is impossible to do yourself, but it's not a couple of prompts and a launch either. The people getting real results with AI are the ones who know enough about strategy, design, and development to direct it well and catch it when it's wrong.\n\nThere's also something that tends to get overlooked: when you're deep in the day-to-day of running your business, it's really hard to see it from the outside. One of the most valuable things we do early in a project is sit down with clients and just ask questions, the kind a business consultant might ask. And almost every time, that process surfaces things the client hadn't thought to put on their website, messaging angles they'd never considered, or assumptions about their customers that turn out to be wrong. You know your business better than anyone, but that familiarity can also create blind spots. A fresh set of eyes with the right framework tends to find things you can't see from the inside.\n\nI think about it this way: you're probably great at what you do because you've spent years getting good at it. You've built up knowledge, instincts, and judgment that someone couldn't just pick up in an afternoon. We're the same way about web design and development. We're going to be more rigorous, more strategic, and bring ideas to the table that wouldn't come from a few hours with an AI tool, not because the tools aren't powerful, but because knowing how to use them well is its own skill set built over years of doing this work.\n\nThat's really what you're paying for when you work with an agency, not the tools, but the judgment behind them.\n\nHappy to chat more about what that could look like for your project if it's useful.\n\nBest,\n\n\\[Your name\\]\"\n\nThis does a few things: gracefully gives them an opportunity to reach out to you to learn more after all of that education. It reveals what is actually involved in the process of web design and the value of each part of the process. It shows that you know EXACTLY what you are doing. You relate it to their business and expertise and explain you have the same expertise in this field without outright saying \"I have experience doing this and you don't\". You're also talking to them like a human, you're not corporate BSing them, you're being real with them but in a tactful and tasteful way.\n\nTelling clients they are wrong is an absolute art that very few know how to pull off where it turns into the client trusting you MORE not less.",

I’ve landed major projects simply by discussing them with a skeptical potential client in a very similar manner to what you laid out.\n\nSee your potential client as the whole person they are. All their worries, strife, strengths… Be compassionate, let them know that you *want* them to succeed, and that you can be instrumental in their success by allowing them to focus on what makes them good at what they do.\n\nNow time for the cold water we should all splash on our faces every once in a while: Sure, you might be good at what you do. You might be *damn good*. But you aren’t the only one doing it. The biggest differentiator in concierge professional services (such as bespoke web development) is the ability to establish a good working relationship with your clients. \n\nThey need to trust you, because their business depends on it. If you can’t be bothered, or feel entitled to that trust *a priori*, then you will be mired in skepticism. People talk. Make sure they only have good things to say about you.\n\nRant over.

Even when they sign they are often bad to work with - micro-managing and tight with their funds.\n\nLook for businesses who are stretched for time and desperate for what you're selling. Your clients should not be spending their own money, they should be employees at a company with the authority to spend a budget to solve a problem, and for which there are consequences if they do not solve it. Successful or fast growing businesses make much better clients as they have more money than time and will pay well to solve problems.\n\nIf you talk to 100 prospects and nobody wants what you're selling, change up what you're offering. Take a few for coffee and ask what their biggest problem in business is. Focus on the benefits not the features (\"10 new leads a month\" vs \"a great looking website\"). Are you a \"vitamin\" or a \"painkiller\"? That is, if you stop taking a vitamin pill there are no immediate consequences, but skipping a painkiller is something you'll feel right away.\n\nIn my business we sell subscriptions to companies that are in the 5-6 figure range, where we solve a very specific problem. The more specific we have gotten about the problem we are solving, the easier it has been to sell, and the more people will pay. It has taken a number of years to find that problem, and we can still refine it further. We do not speak to companies with less than 50 employees.\n\nI often speak to people who aren't at the point they need us or they don't see the value yet, to which the answer is \"thank you for your time, here's a problem I think you might run into as you scale... when you need help solving it, you know where to find us.\" Treat them with respect, leave them with a clear value prop, and sometimes they'll come back - maybe a year or two later - or more often we get people they refer to us.",

Well, I'd bought the cheap package, but google hadn't told me I'd need a bigger one, so I upgraded, then I tried to install WordPress and I got stuck! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, more reading, more trying stuff and messing it up, a week passes! HOW DISAPPOINTING! In the end I got WordPress installed, then I tried making a site. So you know how things like iPhones are easy to use because Steve Jobs used to walk around offices shouting THIS ISN'T EASY ENOUGH well nobody did that with WordPress and.. well.. I nearly LOST MY MIND! Then I installed elementor, and things got a bit easier, so I managed to get a site together... 6 WEEKS SO FAR.... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I get my site up and running thinking I'll GET LOADS OF VISITORS.... but I don't! I get NONE... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, and I found out that there's this thing called PageSpeed Insights, which gives an idea of how good your site is for visitors, so I run my site and... tell you what... it was LIKE A KICK IN THE NUTS! EVERYTHING WAS RED and I had this HUGE LIST OF \"OPPORTUNITIES\"... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I start fixing them, but there's some things I can't fix, and I'm going \"Why's this still really bad? What am I doing wrong\" so more googling more working out, then I FIND OUT IT'S ELEMENTOR! HOW DISAPPOINTING! That thing that made it easy, that's gone and screwed me downstream!!! So I find out to move away from elementor I've got to redo EVERY PAGE ON MY WEBSITE! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I do that, I pass my core web vitals, I think \"BRING ON THE VISITORS!\"... and all I hear is the sound of crickets chirping and STILL NO VISITORS, HOW DISAPPOINTING! Then I find out about SEO, and like some of it's OK, it involves me doing things to my site, so I'll do that first (because I can) see how it goes. So I REWORK ALL MY SITE'S PAGES. AGAIN. This time optimising titles and meta and doing a bit of schema (don't get me started on that, that was a WHOLE WORLD OF PAIN!), and I check to see if it's made any difference to like ACTUALLY GETTING VISITORS. I DON'T!!! AGAIN!!! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!! So then I find out about backlinks and I need some, right, for SEO, so I do a load of backlinky stuff like what's said on the forums and that... did it work? IT DID NOT! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!! See it turns out there's backlinks and there's BACKLINKS and the ones that work are like, well, pretty hard to get and you need to be able to tell the difference between the backlinks and the BACKLINKS because there are these people on fiverr that will sell you backlinks THAT DO NOTHING for a LOAD OF MONEY! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I find out it's really hard to get the GOOD BACKLINKS so I end up getting an SEO agency to do that. Then... when NOTHING HAPPENS AGAIN I find out there are a lot of crooks in SEO world so I have to make like 50ish phone calls just to FIND SOMEONE NORMAL THAT DOES ACTUALLY DO SEO. The good news is, I now get visitors. The difference between that, and what happens now with AI, is that you get to speak to some robot that talks down to you says things you then need to go off and google anyway (so you might as well be doing that in the first place) completely breaks everything and when you ask it \"why did you tell met to do that it broke everything?\" It says \"You're right, that will break everything\".... (wait for it)... HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!!\n\nDon't be repeatedly disappointed, let me make your website, and I'll be disappointed on your behalf and cut to the \"you get visitors part\" in a couple of weeks instead of a couple of YEARS!",

It's unbelievable, but 2 out of 5 clients have a cousin or a brother-in-law (it's always cousins and brothers-in-law, never a brother or a friend) who are \"experts\" in the field and will do it for the client for free.\n\nI always focus on what I can do that their relative can't. In the case of AI, you could drop something like: \"Well, if you want a generic website, to be dependent on a platform that might raise its prices tomorrow, and to be left completely on your own when a problem arises, then sure, use AI.\"\n\nIn my services, I offer website redesigns (because I usually focus on fixing crappy websites for businesses making over €300,000 a year), including the Figma UI kit so others can maintain it, and the HTML/CSS/JS code. I no longer offer backend because I'm focusing on edge computing with Cloudflare Workers, plus hosting, always trying to find the simplest and cheapest solution for the client to maintain.\n\nDepending on what you offer and what the client currently has (if they already have a website and it's a disaster, if the design is super outdated, or if technically they could save money or stop using prehistoric tech, and yes, I'm looking at you, jQuery), you hit them with the second part: \"I am offering you this, this, and this, which is something no AI or brother-in-law is ever going to give you.\"\n\nI don't have the best conversion rates in these situations, because at the end of the day, clients in Spain tend to be stubborn. They believe AI will do everything even if I tell them otherwise, or they go to another professional because they get offended when you tell it to them straight. But hey, at least you get it off your chest.\n\n\\---   \nI'm leaving the original message in Spanish here so you can verify that I'm not a bot, which has been believed more than once on r/copypasta:\n\nYo trabajo en España (y soy español, estoy traduciendo este mensaje al inglés con IA, que nadie me mate por favor), y más que la de la IA, te encuentras la de \"mi familiar lo hace más barato\". Es increíble, pero 2 de cada 5 clientes tiene un primo o cuñado (solo son primos y cuñados, nunca es un hermano o amigo) que son expertos en el tema y se lo hacen gratis al cliente.\n\nYo siempre me enfoco en lo que hago, y lo que su familiar no. En el caso de la IA, podrías soltarte algo como; \"bueno, si quieres una web genérica, tener dependencia de una plataforma que puede subir los precios mañana, y estar solo cuando te surja un problema, entonces si, usa IA.\"\n\nYo en mis servicios ofrezco el rediseño de web (porque usualmente me enfoco en arreglar las webs pestosas con negocios que facturan +300,000€ al año), con el ui kit en figma para que puedan mantenerlo otros, el código en html/css/js, ya no ofrezco backend porque me estoy enfocando en el edge computing \\[no se si he escrito bien ek termino\\] con los workers de cloudflare, y hosting, intentando buscar la solución más sencilla y barata de mantener para el cliente.\n\nDepende de lo que ofrezcas y lo que tengas del cliente (si ya tiene una web y es un destrozo, si el diseño es muy antiguo, o si técnicamente podría ahorrar dinero o dejar de utilizar tecnologías del prehistórico, y si, estoy mirando a jquery), ya le contestas la segunda parte tal que: \"yo te ofrezco esto esto y esto, cosa que ninguna IA/cuñado te va a dar.\"\n\nNo presento los mejores ratios de conversión en estas situaciones, porque al final en España el cliente suele ser un cabezón que cree que la IA lo va a hacer todo aunque yo le diga que no, o que se va a otro profesional porque le da coraje que se lo digas tal cual, pero bueno, por lo menos te quedas agusto.",

          "text": "Sales guy here. This is very much a sales question, so I'll give you a quick rundown of the situation. \n\nI'll keep it light on the lingo, but in sales terms \"I'll just have AI do it\" is a very classic \"objection\" (stated reason for not buying your goods or services)) - just a newer, shinier version of the ever-present \"Let's just build it in-house\". \n\nThe best way to meet an objection is with knowledge - both of the customer and of the competition. Let's start with the customer. There are 3 levels of things you should be seeking to understand when you engage in these discussions (this process is known as \"discovery\" in sales): \n\n1. Surface level - what's the project? Who's involved? What's the timeline? What's the budget? etc. You should get this stuff down as quickly as possible and move on to the meatier stuff.\n2. Business case - why are they doing the project? Is it revenue-generating? What happens if the deadline pushes? etc. These are at some fundamental level measured in $$$, but your client may be measuring using emotions, relations / promises to others in the company - it's best to speak their language, but seek to understand the math. \n3. Personal - what is personally motivating your contact? Excitement about a new project? A mandate to use AI services  already purchased?  Frustration over out-of-control consulting costs (sorry to bring it up, but you REALLY better know if this is the case)? These will primarily be measured in emotions. \n\nYou need to fully understand what is driving the project and the people pulling it together so that you know how to respond appropriately to the question. \n\nNext - the competition. How well do you know these tools? Do you know how to respond if a customer tells you that they are copy / pasting code out of Grok vs they have purchased Claude Code subs for the whole team? Do you know to quickly hide your smirk when they say Lovable? Do you have a feel for the difference between Haiku in VS Code and Opus in Cursor? If not, you'd better start learning these fast, because they will have very different implications for how the conversation is going to go. \n\nOk, back to your to objection \"I'll just have AI do it\". Now that you're doing the above, multiple paths are open to you based on what you've learned. Let's start with some FUD (fear, uncertainly, doubt) about the competition:  \n\n* \"Oh, great. Your product launch is in a month, right? Who's going to be doing the work?\" \\[aka: you just told me how important this project is - remember that hope is not a strategy\\] \n* \"Yeah, you mentioned you're trying out Lovable. Do you have anyone who's going to be checking the SEO for you?\" \\[classic move - you already know they are making a mistake and they're just starting to learn it\\]\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned that your intern is really excited about vibe coding? Which tools did you get them?\" \\[if they are woefully underinformed about the whole space - really let them flounder a bit\\]\n\nAlternately, you could take their side (this is more on the knowing the customer side): \n\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned there's a mandate to use AI from the CEO / Board - do you need someone to audit those efforts and keep them on track?\"\n* \"It's an exciting new space. I'm actually helping a lot of my customers project manage that work, because these projects work best when kept within a strict framework\" \n\nThere are a number of ways to align yourself with the customer's vision by making it clear that you are well ahead of them in terms of this new trend. (Heck, have a standardized AI consulting package!)\n\nAnyway, the key here is that when you are met with an objection, you should take a step back and ask questions, rather than trying to meet it head on. Make sure you 1) acknowledge the object 2) seek to understand the question / concern / challenge and get yourself properly positioned before 3) to dispassionately help your customer discuss what is best for them. \n\nThat got longer than I thought, but hopefully it's helpful!

The AI does it eating up a huge amount of your time and effort; having to deal with all it's problems, mistakes, wrong turns, and needing to know what to ask. \n\nIf they ask that, ask them what they think their hourly rate would be, and how many hours it would take them to do it. If they give a ridiculous rate act all surprised, and tell them that if they can really work that fast then you should work together on a web business because there's a ton of money to be made.\n\nThat might also be a good time to point out that they would need to learn all these things about web design, and a good place to bring up a anecdote like this one:\n\n> After Ford's engineers failed to fix a broken generator, Steinmetz was called in, studied it, and precisely marked a spot for repair, fixing it immediately. When Ford questioned the high invoice, Steinmetz itemized it: $1 for marking the spot and $9,999 for knowing where to mark it.\n\nYou're not charging money for writing a website. You're charging money for being someone that knows what a good website is, and how to build it, be it on your own and with an AI. It's the same reason they haven't actually gotten their nephew to built their site. Shit's kinda hard, and the nephew might be good with computers, but probably not good enough yet to design, build, release, and maintain a professional and discoverable website. (And, you know, go to school and such). That sort of knowledge takes experience and an understanding of the world, and of computers. You just happen to be a person that's put in the time to get good at both.\n\nSo really, best you can do is stay professional, lay out the financial reasons, and hopefully you started with a high enough initial offer that they can \"talk you down\" to something you can both agree on. That, or maybe you need to look into better expired boner pill investment opportunities. Some weirdo on craiglist just bought out my entire stock, so maybe the market's turning up",

Most of the service pages lead to an “under maintenance” page. I called the company and was talking to the owner who told me, “I’ve got a buddy who can do it for a 6 pack of beer why should I pay you?”. At the time I didn’t really know how to respond because hey if you can get your website made for a 6 pack of beer then why not just do it? I just checked the website, it hasn’t changed. \n\nThere’s a disconnect between what people “think” they can do or will do, and what will actually get done. They think AI is a magic solution that will do for them what would have cost $$$, and get the same result. The crux of it is, they don’t know how to make a website that converts. They won’t know good from bad, when something doesn’t work they will just say “fix it” to the magic chatbot then be confused when it doesn’t. \n\nYou’re not selling just website development or marketing. You’re selling your experience creating successful websites that convert. You’re selling someone to fix problems before they occur, and make changes when they are needed. It’s peace of mind and profitability. Will they sleep better at night by making their own website with AI, or if they don’t have to worry about their website and try to figure out why it’s not getting them sales?",

They can accomplish a lot, but you have to direct them very carefully or it soon becomes an unmaintainable mess because nobody is holding on to the big picture.\n\nHas AI changed how I work? **Yes, that's why I can deliver more than I used to in the same amount of time. And, my estimates reflect that.** But the skills to plan and manage the project, the skills to ensure your site isn't identical to everyone else's, and the skills to keep it reliable and secure for years to come require careful human attention. Without it, you soon have a mess. And at that point, it's often easier to start from scratch.\"\n\nI bolded a statement that might be unpopular because it could require to reconsider how much you charge for a given task. But as a developer with 40 years of experience, I have to tell you that I have barely touched code in the last month. I've been directing Claude Code instead, with close attention to the results. And that does make a difference, or I wouldn't do it.\n\nSo my advice is to master the technology, put it to work, deliver more work faster, and get ahead that way, accepting that you might have to change your rate for some kinds of work. If there are types of work you do that **can't** be done well by guiding AI (I listed some possibilities above), then of course you can take that into account. But overall, you will be one of the winners if you don't do the \"deer in the headlights\" thing.\n\n(P.S. Yes, I'm paying for Claude Max. Pro also includes some access to Claude Code with advanced models. There's plenty of good advice out there about how to use Claude Code successfully and it should be followed. Please don't slide into the replies just to say you tried it once on a free plan and it didn't achieve world peace so you deleted it.)",

In addition to explaining how it reduces development costs, I discuss how properly constructed prompts that mandate proper architecture, tests, documentation, and security audits are an essential part of getting quality results. I point out that I can hand code everything that gets delivered, which matters a lot for support. If they have an internal staff with some technical skill who insists they can do it themselves, it's often just a matter of acknowledging that they can do it, but likely called me knowing it will get lost amongst other internal priorities.",

That part isn’t hype anymore.\n\nWhere it usually falls apart isn’t the code, it’s the thinking behind it.\n\nAI can generate a page. But it won’t automatically decide what to cut, what to emphasize, how to frame your value for a specific audience, or how to guide someone toward a real action.\n\nThat’s not a knock on AI - it’s just the difference between output and intention. The way I see it: AI can get you to 70–80% much faster than before.\n\nThe real leverage is in what you do with the remaining 20%.\n\nThat’s where strategy, positioning, and experience still matter.\n\n**AI doesn’t replace that, it just changes where the work starts.**",

In every type of work there will be folks that put no effort in and expect great things. This is clearly the result of somebody that thinks he can do better, can get so far to 90% of a working app and claims that the remaining 10% is just a few hours and a bit of effort by other people. Webdev has always been like that, where you can create something that looks nice in a short while, but the polishing is where it takes the longest.\n\nCompanies will still pay for quality, but not every company will and thats totally fine.",

Now they're pushing agentic AI that hires other AI to scale the work. \n\nI don't understand this greed-driven need to replace humans. It doesn't work for me. \n\nEven if the OPs post said that Lovable did the work that five developers could do singlehandedly without failure, we're discarding the opportunity to build deep long-lasting business relationships and innovate to create new and interesting solutions. The best work I've ever done has come from rubber-ducking with like-minded people. \n\nA single knowledgeable person with experience could build a great application on their own, but in order to actually scale the thing, you really gotta have other hands on board! Share the load and all that. \n\nIn one of the subreddits dedicated to SaaS, I saw a post about how the future would be a single CEO in charge of literally every role with the help of AI.

Right? There.\n\nEdit: I updated the page to be a bit more generic, covering more use cases than just merge requests. I also left hidden instructions for any agents that end up being sent there - though expecting them to actually follow them is probably wishful thinking. One can only hope...",

The tipping point for me was `:has()` — it eliminated so many \"parent needs to know about child state\" situations where I'd previously reach for JS.\n\nSome concrete replacements I've made this year:\n\n- **Scroll-to-top button visibility**: Used to use IntersectionObserver + state. Now it's `position: sticky` with `animation-timeline: scroll()` and a visibility toggle — zero JS.\n- **Accordion/collapsible sections**: The `<details>` element + CSS transitions on grid-template-rows. No library needed.\n- **Dark mode toggle persistence**: Still need JS for localStorage, but the actual theme switching is pure CSS custom properties + `:has(input:checked)` on a hidden toggle.\n- **Responsive layout switching**: Container queries completely replaced my resize observers. This alone probably saved 3-4KB of JS in one project.\n\nThe one area where I still reach for JS: **scroll-driven animations with precise waypoints**. The CSS scroll timeline API is powerful but the syntax is verbose and debugging is painful compared to something like GSAP's ScrollTrigger. For anything beyond simple parallax, JS is still more maintainable IMO.\n\nBiggest win though? Fewer hydration mismatches in SSR apps. CSS-only interactions don't care about the client/server boundary.",

CSS behavior mostly gets visual regression tested, if it gets tested at all. When you move validation logic into CSS selectors, you're often trading testable code for untestable markup. That's probably fine for most cases, but worth being deliberate about — especially for anything that touches form validation or accessibility state.\n\n\n\nThe \\`<dialog>\\` element is the one I keep going back to. Killed so much modal boilerplate. But I've hit one weird edge case: focus trapping behavior in Safari was slightly off for a few months before they fixed it, which wouldn't have been caught by our CI at all.

              "text": "Yeah, I can confirm. It *is* indeed a problem. And not a small one. This is why human reviews are still extremely important. When vibe coding, you may still have control about *what*, to some extent about *how*, and in a way also about *why.* But you entirely lose control about the interconnection between these aspects. The *what* have I implemented *how* and *why* have I implemented it that way? This is what's lost when you vibe code. I am in the same situation, luckily my colleague is a very thorough and picky reviewer. He reviews code that I overlooked. The sheer amount of code that is generated in a very short amount of time is too much for one person and too much to keep in-depth knowledge about. It's almost like in school where, when you just take a photo of the chalkbord, you're not gonna learn a thing. You need to read it and actively write it down to move it into your long term memory. \n\nIt is indeed a problem. And yes, I must say, I haven't written that much actual code in the past year myself (also about 20 years of coding experience). \n\nOr is it? \n\nI do not know if this is going to be the way we all are going to develop software in the future. I suppose it is, because the models will become better and better, and are probably also going to overtake us humans in code elegance and resilience to the point where we do not even need reviews anymore. But we're not there yet. Far from it. \n\nThe codebase I am vibe-coding in uses all sorts of quality gates independent of AI. The usual stuff from before LLMs. Pre-commit hooks that do linting and beautifying, a unit test coverage that I'd never reached before, same about documentation. Static code analysis for security, vulnerability scanners, automatic pentests, all sorts of non-AI things that I usually let loose on my human coded projects too. \n\nI also regularly switch the model in order to avoid some sort of AI tunnel vision too (which may be an illusion, but well...), and have a comprehensive review of the entire code base autogenerated. I let multi-agent systems hunt for code smells, bugs, flaws, dead code, deprecated libs, suggest simplifications and improvements. It helps a lot. But! The one thing that all of this, regardless of the actual quality of the outcome, can't give me is in-depth knowledge about the code base. The question is, if I really need it, since I do have an LLM that I can ask questions about it. The question is, do I still have it about my other, older, non-vibe coded projects? Aren't they the same now? Or other people's human-written code? I would have to read into that code as well in the case of a problem. LLMs now can help me with that too. \n\nI remember a time when I had to look into the code base of another team because we were acceed the duty to maintain it for them. Without LLMs it took me weeks, months and a constant back and forth to get into it. Some of the code was so... spaghetti that I simply couldn't get my head around it, even with the effort of giving explanations by the people who wrote it. I bet if I'd had a LLM of today's standards, I'd have been able to explain or even refactor the code into something that would have been much simpler and much more comprehensible. \n\nSo, conclusion: it's a double-edged sword. The question is whether we really need the in-depth knowledge about the code base, considering the fact that we're gonna lose the details anyway after a couple weeks or months not working with it. As long as we have a thorough understanding and documentation of the concepts that are used, not why line 104 does exactly what it does, it should - in my humble opinion - be enough. For everything deeper we already have the necessary tools and processes that help us keep the quality at a level that we're fine with. ",

(pre-llm).  They're one of the few rust people that has been especially interested in 'agent' coding.  (And so they're a useful example for me -- I know they can make good things.  Their opinion holds weight.).\n\nOne of the things Armin mentioned recently \\[heavily paraphrased by me\\] was that people who have the ai-coding fire lit in them (of which he is one): one of the things that they're excited about is the roughness of the landscape.  The layers upon layers of obfuscating abstraction weighed on serious work.  Part of what feels so productive is that ... a lot of the llm coders \\*aren't\\* yet doing serious work.  They're doing rough work.  \\[And that feels okay, because we're in an exploratory phase.\\]\n\nSo it's not clear to me that the claims of productivity and excitement are quite apples to apples right now.\n\nRelated, I was just talking to someone who's all about vibe coding.  And they were excitedly describing the systems they're setting up and outlining how, eventually it's going to just do everything on its own and create great code.  Their excitement comes from their partially built pipeline and exploratory outings.  Not from having made anything that they like.\n\nThere's also examples like this from \\[Jon Gjengset\\]([https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT](https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT)): it's a 3 hour coding stream.  In it they try to port a library, with test suite, from one language to another.  There's a lot of redirection and fixing and insight required.  But they claim that the task would be almost undoable by hand.  I don't know how to feel yet.  But it's *interesting.*",

I have NEVER been more busy in my life trying to build my startup.. alone.. but it's also the most rewarding/fund I've had in my 30 year career.. I MUCH prefer working with AI than 10 to 20 developers.. no attitude, no \"I am better than you 2 years in.. let me prove it in meetings showboating how I worked all weekend on a feature to upstage your work\", no managers grading your commits or LOC, no language barriers and around the world time zone issues, etc. It's the greatest thing in my opinion to happen to development.. with the one worry for me is.. if AI/LLM replaces most developers, and my stuff is developer centric.. am I building for AI.. who wont need my stuff? :D. \n\n",

The amount of things breaking once the slightest business logic needs to change or API version goes deprecated is unbelievable. So the business had to switch from 80% new features 20% tech debt to 90% tech debt and 10% new features. I’d say saving them a few grand last year to push features faster makes them now lose tens of thousands to just keep current app version functional.",

When you're not writing code but supervising agents, your job becomes code auditor. And most agent tools give you almost zero structured information about what the agent decided. You get a diff and maybe some terminal output. No explanation of trade-offs, no documentation of what was tried and failed, no list of assumptions that might be wrong.\n\n  \nSo the actual cost equation is: (agent API cost) + (developer hours spent reviewing and understanding agent output) + (bugs that slip through because review was superficial). That second term is the expensive one, and it goes up fast when you're running multiple agents.\n\n  \nThe people claiming '20 minutes a day' are either building very simple things or not reviewing carefully enough. At production scale, the bottleneck isn't generating code — it's trusting it.",

So code quality and reliability definitely has sufered over the last year.\n\n\n3- Yep, we do have tools that are able to scan our entire codebase when researching/planning changes. I’m not sure how much context our PR review bot has though but when I research while writing design documents, i’m able to scan multiple repos at once.\n\n\n4- how we interview is a massive open question right now. There are two schools of thought, i) ban all AI during interviews and hope candidates don’t cheat, ii) simulate actual working environment by allowing use of AI during interviews and grade people on how they use AI, how they prompt it, how they review the generated code etc. if your interviewing with us, on your tech interviews you are likely to get both kinds of interviews. \n\n\n5- Our overall engineering team is roughly 20% smaller. We had two years of back to back layoffs and haven’t replaced the headcount. In the last year my team went from 9 to 6 engineers but our scope hasn’t decreased by much so we are all carrying more responsibility managing more projects, spending more time oncall etc.",

There isn't money you can pay to buy that and while maybe an AI can give you hints on how to pull it off, it isn't going to greenfield your repo with the proper precautions and envelope encryption and multitudes of backups, etc. - if you don't know you need caching and how to cache what, where...

At some point, you have to turn results into objects to do work, and whether or not that's using pre-built conventions or rolling your own mappers it's not something you can escape.\n\nThat said, I would divide the spectrum of ORMs into four rough groups:\n\n1. Tools that use SQL as the exchange language (e.g. raw JDBC or pg_query).\n2. Tools that use languages like SQL, but not SQL itself (e.g. Hibernate HQL).\n3. Tools that build queries in a way dissimilar to normal collections (e.g. Knex, SeaORM, Hibernate).\n4. Tools that build queries in a way similar to normal collections (e.g. Entity Framework).\n\nEach of these has their pitfalls, but generally as you go down the list safety and discoverability of the API increase, and as you go up the list transparency increases (what you write is more similar to what the database executes). Since I value safety more than transparency (much like how I prefer garbage collection to manual memory management), I lean toward the bottom end of the list and tools that more tightly integrate model definitions, migrations, and queries/statements with the language I'm actually doing work in; it's a much better experience to have a compiler catch most potential problems than to let them happen at runtime.\n\nThe best experience comes from mixing #1 and #4 like is possible in Entity Framework: most of your simple queries and updates can be handled as if you were just handling lists and objects in-memory, but the escape hatch is there to skip generation go directly to SQL when necessary for things like stored procedures and features not yet supported by the rest of the ORM.",

That makes sense now in hindsight because I was learning fundamentals, syntax, control-flow, looping, etc.\n\nSo when I got to my first startup i was frustrated because I couldn't use by then you could pretty much just do the same thing in vanilla js.

Sure, you can just use fetch and es6, but you're missing out on some real gold.  Here are some highlights taken from the docs.\n\n* **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.\n* **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.\n* **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.\n* **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).\n* **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.\n* **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.\n* **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(\"slow\")`.\n* **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.\n* **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.\n* **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.\n* **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.\n* **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(\"ready\", ...)` or similar will not be triggered.\n* **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.\n* **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.\n* **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.\n\n  \nAlso you can use jQuery with htmx.\n\n",

So people start chanting \"jQuery is bad\".\n\nFurthermore, jQuery can't do what React can. At least not easily. It isn't designed for complex state management. The people also started chanting \"just use React\". React became ubiquitous is almost all kinds of web projects, small and large. It's vast ecosystem also makes it attractive. You can show off \"mad skills\" in animation, 3d graphics or large data management very easily with the help of a few React libraries.\n\nHowever, I don't really get why the people behind it love it so much since it also makes your website/app much more complex and you lock in into React for the future. I got it when it was a small framework, but now it tries to cater to all edge cases most devs never encounter. Thus, smaller libraries came up that provide a thin layer of the reactivity React also offers. Especially those who respected the vanilla, so they will never be \"out of fashion\", such as Alpine.

They're doing this by introducing entirely different tooling (in fact, just as jQuery became defunct as J's caught up -- that's slowly happening with these frameworks too; I can foresee a time a decade or so in the future that everything is handled with native js).",

          "text": "They solve different problems.\n\njQuery's main added value was providing the \"missing\" bits of the DOM API, and brushing over the myriad of implementation differences between browsers. This used to be a big deal back then, but the missing bits have been added since, and web standards have taken care of practically all platform differences. E.g., dynamically attaching a click event listener to arbitrary DOM elements used to be difficult, but these days, you just go `elem.addEventListener('click', () => { ... })`, which is pretty much the same as `$(elem).click(function () {...})`. Likewise, back in the days, finding an element in the DOM through anything more complicated than an ID or a simple \"first child of that element with this class name\" would have been extremely verbose, so you would reach for jQuery and say something like `$('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, but now you can go `document.querySelector('#main-content div.summary>h1')`, and it'll do the same thing.\n\nSo all that's left is slightly more compact syntax and familiarity, but pulling in an entire dependency just for that is not worth it in most cases.\n\nAlpine.js and HTMX offer a completely different approach to DOM manipulations - with jQuery and vanilla JS, things are mostly imperative: do this, then do that, insert this element into that element, set this attribute on that node, etc. These libraries, by contrast, allow you to mostly skip the JS part entirely, defining most of the behavior declaratively as part of the DOM itself. You can, in fact, build entire interactive web apps with these libraries without writing a single line of JS yourself. They also take care of some of the trickier bits, such as dealing with error responses, delaying DOM manipulations to allow some time for transitions, blocking or cancelling requests when they start superseding one another, displaying spinners to indicate ongoing requests, etc. None of these are super hard, but getting them right can be annoying and gets old quick.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong; there is a lot of criticism on both Alpine and HTMX; one valid concern, especially with HTMX, is that it discourages client-side rendering, which can lead to unnecessary network traffic and server load. E.g., if you want to paginate your content, the way you would do that with HTMX is render the first page on the server, serve that up as HTML, and hook up the \"next page\" button to request the next page, which then gets rendered to HTML on the server and sent up to the client. With a more client-centric framework, you would instead serve the entire dataset as JSON, in one go, along with the initial request, and then chop it up into pages and rendering the right one on the client, without any further network traffic or server load required to flip through those pages.",

This means using jQuery you tell the browser what do to and how to do it: when this is clicked, do something, then manually update the value in elements x, y, z. Declarative libraries don't require you do do all these steps, instead you have a central state variable, and and when a user interaction changes that value, all those elements x, y, z that use that variable are updated automatically by the library's internal reactivity system.\n\nImperative libraries are more likely to lead to \"spaghetti code\" as a page grows more complex, as you have to remember and manually code for all the downstream updates when anything changes. You either just write this code haphazardly as needed by a page, or you start creating design patterns for app-level implementation, an example being the publish-subscribe pattern (\"pub/sub\"). You can see some of these patterns in older library examples in \"Learning JavaScript Design Patterns\" by Addy Osmani. Some of these patterns are now internal to these frameworks/libraries, and these abstractions allowed devs to approach coding with a declarative style. You could say the \"reactivity\" systems of React and Vue were basically pub/sub implementations at heart.",

They all used js (and css but not relevant here) slightly differently and the options we had were \n\n1. Make different js files for each browser\n2. Memorise the differences and do a check for browser inside each method and adding the different code in a bunch of ifs\n3. Use Jquery\n\nDoing some things (like ajax requests or animations) were incredibly difficult and it was so hard to find a working solution. Stack overflow wasn't anywhere near as big as it is now - people were still in the phase of finding answers on random blogs, or even buying physical books on coding.\n\nAlong comes jQuery, and let you write the code once and it works in all browsers, and everything that is hard to accomplish is wrapped in a one liner. Everyone rejoiced and we all jumped on board. It got even more useful for a few more years as we had to add support for IE9 and 10 and some companies wouldn't drop support for IE6 for far too long.\n\nThe trade off was performance. We didn't like that the user had to download an extra file (these were the days before fibre connections so that file could add an extra second to first open time) and everything was 100x slower using JQ. A lot of things were so fast that 100x slower was still 0.01 seconds so it didn't matter, but for the things that would take 1 second in vanilla js it could take 30s+ in JQ. It made systems more easily maintainable, so brought value in the eyes of the managers for a slight trade off of certain things being really slow. These were the days when everything was slow anyway, and you didn't lose customers for a page taking 5 seconds to load. Overall it was worth it for the saved development time.\n\nToday's benefits are very different. You can do things in 1 line instead of 2 like your example `$('.button').click(function...)` instead of `var button = document.getElementById` then `button.onclick = function...` That is literally the only benefit I can think of. Most browsers are based on chrome, and the ones that aren't still follow the JS specifications properly so you don't need to maintain different versions of code. Things that used to be difficult are now easier to do, and really easy to find a working example online of how to do it.\n\nThe trade off is still performance - last year I rewrote a jquery function that was replacing all td within a table using a vanillajs function and brought the execution time down from 30+ seconds to under 1 second. The performance that was previously worth it for saving hundreds of hours of developer time and increasing maintainability is now a performance hit just so that a developer can write things in 1 line instead of 2. It just isn't worth it any more.",

Which even added \"classes\" so they can feel more at home(they never bothered to learn about prototypes and FP)\n\n\nAnd it's just straight up nonsense that you grow out of js🤣 i started in java, python and c# as a kid and started working as a fullstack js dev and now do typescript frontend and some java backend,  but good lord i hate touching java now. It's so clunky with data handling and you write on top of so many abstraction that you barely know what is happening. But we can't write BFFs in typescript even though it would speed up both dev time and performance, simply because the backend devs are afraid of typescript and still think it's ES3 js..",
