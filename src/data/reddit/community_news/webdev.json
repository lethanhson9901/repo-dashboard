Here are some tips: use AI to design a simple starting page that's just a little more advanced; e.g. add a 'hero section' with an image across the top, Then ask questions about the code it produced. The first thing you'll see in the source code is new information (tags) at the very top. You can learn very quickly that way if you concentrate on really researching and understanding the code. You need to learn a little about CSS (your CSS is packed into the index.html file right now, which works, but it's normally in a separate style.css file). It's a long journey, but with AI you can learn really fast. One other thing: when you've made a lot more progress, start to view your results using the Chrome browser in an Incognito window, and learn to use the Chrome Inspector (right click anywhere on the page and then select 'Inspect' to look). That's the most powerful tool for finding bugs and improving performance later (right now, you have top marks). Good luck with your exciting journey!",

Try moving all the content to a new <main></main> or <div></div> element inside the body and defining `max-width: 800px;` (or any adequate value), and also try centering the main element.\n\nAnd then you can try formatting the text of the links, of the <a></a> tags. In fact, what I really mean is that maybe you should stop defining the font inside for each type of element and define it directly for the body, or maybe for the <main> element I suggested, and then only being specific for other elements in case you want.",

But I've realized, based on what I've seen, we're getting the definition wrong.\n\nClaude Cowork isn't \"intelligent,\" it's an algorithmic prediction engine. It's an orchestrator that needs constant maintenance and management, just like when computing arrived in businesses in the 70s and suddenly entire IT departments were needed that didn't even exist before.\n\nIn the end, this is literally like a compass or Excel. They're democratizing tools. A compass is cheap. Google Sheets is practically free. Nobody hires a \"compass expert\"; you hire a captain who knows how to navigate and uses the compass to avoid getting lost. The same thing will happen with this: a generic \"AI profile\" won't replace us. Instead, experts in each field (finance professionals, designers, or developers like us in music-tech) will have to manage that prediction, because it's a **PREDICTIVE TOOL**. Nobody titles their Excel profile \"Excel Expert.\" Excel doesn't make business decisions in your area just because it has macros, and this AI-powered system isn't going to create a complex and meaningful workflow without an expert to validate whether the direction in the business area it's helping is the right one.\n\nI think that's a good example. Does anyone see any problem with this reasoning?\n\nI don't buy into the \"end-to-end\" panic. I see a future focused on developing the skills of being the kind of worker who knows how to manage the tool. In the future, LinkedIn won't be full of \"AI Specialists,\" but rather people who know how to apply prediction in their industry.  It’s more work, not less, and someone has to be at the helm because prediction without governance is useless.\n\nLet me know what you think of this reflection :)",

But I expect that's temporary though - quarters come and go and at the end of the day, sh\\*t still needs to get done, competitively. OP's Excel example is very astute. I'm sure when electronic spreadsheets came out, people thought they'll massacre the workforce on desktop calculators and literal paper \"spread sheets\".\n\nAnd yet there's now more people on Excel than there ever were on desk calculators. Our expectations simply insta-rose and new use cases emerged leveraging the new capability. And sure, some trivial tasks that used to be done by hand and be worth money for that labor, had been made worthless. Yet there are other tasks & careers infinitely more advanced (like finance analysts & quants writing Excel programs linked direct to data feeds and trading platforms) that are worth $500K/yr and more that were simply unfathomable with the old desktop calculators.",

So we will see it play out. It changes how we code for tedious things, or types things out for us. This makes us faster, but it gets worse and is unusable for many domains. Luckily, a lot of jobs are slop and simple - even if people believe that throwing some data and forms together with reactive state is engineering and difficult   ",

It doesn't mean conscious or alive. Also words that are difficult to define, but in intelligent systems, anything is intelligent if it acts intelligently, ie it does what it does more efficiently than trial and error would, on average, where there is no simple mathematical relationship that circumvents the need for intelligent solutions. This can include discovering new mathematical relationships, if you want to get all recursive about it. \n\nLLMs are soft AI, they are basically a more complicated parameter optimisation algorithm, like a linear regression equation. They act intelligently. Consciousness is called hard AI, and that is beyond our comprehension at this time. The mind is more like a set of parameter optimisation algorithms have evolved in tandem on a nueral network, which is by definition incomprehensible and irreducible, and itself connected to a series of sensory inputs, such that the total appears to exceed the sum of its parts. It is emergent, and not just through the \"programming,\" but through the forms and composition of the structure of the brain (and therefore the body) itself. Fascinating.",

It's not just that a LLM takes stuff from the training data based on how likely it think a human would pick that thing is. Rather, they do have millions of internal representations of logical relationships in the topology of the model, and they are able to apply these relationships to the selection of the next tokens or a group of a tokens.\n\nThe reason they are so successful is indeed the fact that they learn logical relationships and are able to build internal representations that, on some very crude level, is similar to how humans conceptualize and compartmentalize information and relationships between pieces of information.",

Yes, I program by thinking about patterns; my memory and my strength guide me to find similar solutions based on my experience. The predictions of current LLMs are so good that they cover practically every domain and path already programmed in the past. Google used to seem like a job hack: you found the solution and implemented it Stack Overflow was exactly the same.\n\nMy lowest salary was when I was just a \"programmer.\" But when we move into the business world, we start earning more money, but because we \"think,\" and we get paid precisely for thinking ahead.\n\nLow-code and no-code have existed for many years. But the real money isn't there; the money is in being ahead of the curve, thinking about the minimum necessary adjustments, competing with those who know the local domain. The real money is in approaching the person in charge to take control. Having a coffee and listening to their problems. To understand, as a human being, what those who buy what you solve in their company want. Human domains are human, with their own needs. Algorithmic prediction is what we do when we program boring problems, problems that low-code and no-code mastered years ago. This prediction goes further, because it predicts complex architectures and structures. That's not human intelligence.\n\nFor example, Claude Code solves the problems I need to implement, but what comes first? A prompt. An indication from someone real who knows the domain of the next thing that competes with the cutting edge. LLM training can't be in that area of ​​the business because it's a trade secret. So, can my boss write a prompt and not hire me? Absolutely not. It's not the prompt; it's deployment, it's monitoring, it's getting into the nitty-gritty, it's being in control of the governance of this problem I'm solving, it's communicating a result in a meeting. My boss already has enough on his plate closing deals and funding rounds using predictive inference. In fact, could I take my job away from my boss because now, with predictive generation, I have a knack for business solutions? Absolutely not.",

Most of its ideas will be rubbish but then so are most of humanities; we're just good at filtering out a several-9s fraction of them.  I don't think creativity is the defining feature you're looking for.",

This ‘tool’ can not only provide some specific utility, but also apply it in practice, i.e., show the way and navigate the optimal route, fill in the spreadsheet, decide what to compute and how, etc.\n2. There are compelling neuroscientific theories which explain human cognition and specifically decision-making in terms of predictive probability models (e.g. predictive coding by Karl Friston and others), also known as Bayesian approaches to brain function.\n3. Even if these tools required similar managers, I fail to see objective support for the quantitative similarity. In other words, instead of naval captains, office workers, and IT departments, these may quite possibly function well enough with one COO (or some logistics executive), one CFO, or one CTO respectively.\n\nI don't hold my breath for the bombastic claims of professional corporate liars akin to Musk or Altman whose primary objective is to generate and maintain the hype, but I wouldn't be so optimistic about the purpose of humans in the intellectual workplace – least of all in web development, which was already oversaturated years ago.",

The real shift is that we'll need to get better at knowing when to trust the prediction and when to override it.",

Karl Friston, Andy Clark, and others have built a pretty compelling case that this is the core mechanism underlying perception, action, and reasoning in biological intelligence.\n\nSo when you say \"it's just prediction, not real intelligence\", you're also describing human brains too.

I had read something about it, though certainly much less than you :P\n\nAnyway, is saying \"it's just prediction\" a misconception? I don't think so.\n\nIt's just prediction, and nothing more. If these recent studies you mentioned by Karl Friston and Andy Clark are accurate, then with current AI, that's all we really have: prediction.\n\nAI doesn't take charge in this world; it doesn't understand the world's problems because it doesn't live in it. The power of prediction lies in the fact that we have prediction with LLMs that incorporate practically all of human knowledge. A powerful tool, isn't it?\n\nHumans adapt predictions in response to the world around them. AI doesn't have a world to surround it; it's just prediction.\n\nAnyway, tell me what you think; I'm sure you know more about this than I do ;)",

                  "text": "You're actually making a more interesting point now, and I think we can partially agree. The embodiment argument is legitimate. Biological predictive processing isn't just prediction in isolation, it's prediction grounded in survival, action, and real consequences in the world. Friston's active inference specifically emphasizes that organisms don't just passively predict, they act to bring the world in line with their predictions. LLMs don't have that. No stakes, no body, no feedback loop with reality.\n\nBut here's where I'd push back: the conclusion you draw from that gap doesn't quite follow. \"Just prediction without embodiment\" still produced something that passes bar exams, writes production code, and reasons through novel problems. Underselling the mechanism doesn't make the outputs less real.\n\nAnd more importantly the gap you're describing is the current limitation, not a permanent ceiling. We're already moving toward agentic systems that act, receive feedback, and update from consequences. The disembodiment problem is an engineering challenge more than a philosophical one. ",

They can synthesize novel answers that are not as such in the training data; and while they can not replace white collar workers, they can perform a subset of e.g. remote work tasks successfully.\n\nAt the moment, they are a force multiplier. Good use of these tools lets people do their work more effectively (bad use might do the opposite). This matters quite a bit in the sense that it forces people to learn to use them and people who can't keep up may face unemployment.\n\nI don't know what \"predictive tool\" really entails. LLMs can capture logical patterns in the data that allow them to construct answers based on logical relationships and the model topology rather than simplistically parsing together parts from the training data to a semi-cohesive whole.\n\nOne thing about this just really is the pace of advancement. The kind of benchmarks that AI researchers 5 years ago would have considered as something that AIs can't get good scores in for many decades to come, are now fairly easy to the bleeding edge models. Benchmarks that have been specifically designed to be hard have had massive improvements in them - like Humanity's Last Exam. AIs can answer highly technical and difficult questions based on modern research at a level higher than any human could - even when not allowed to use external tools like googling.\n\nBenchmarks trying to measure success rate in difficult, high complexity remote work tasks are still scored low in by these tools, but the scores are constantly improving and there's no sign at the moment that this improvement slowed down. If anything, the pace of improvement seems exponential; if that is the case, then we really are looking at really massive practical improvements by the end of the year.\n\nMy own worry really is that the combination of actual concrete impact with the perceptions that businesses have to this, means pretty drastic changes in knowledge work industries and those changes can be economically disruptive to the point of triggering kind of a domino effect in the wider economy. Let's say, if out of a million people, you suddenly have several thousand accountants, lawyers, programmers, etc, unemployed - whether for a good reason or not - then those people are suddenly going much less to restaurants and to barbers, they push back renovation plans, and the tax revenue from their income dies down. Even if the majority of white collar workers continue as before, it's enough that a large enough minority are affected that the end-effect is close-to catastrophic.",

Everything in cognition can be framed as prediction.

You left out that while computing created IT departments, it also eliminated typists (remember those, probably not), switchboard operators (before my time), filing clerks, MANY accounting roles, and entire categories of manual data processing and entry jobs.\n\nNew jobs appeared though, old jobs vanished.  We need less lace knitters and buggy whip manufacturers.\n\nLong and short is, as history suggests, AI will both create new coordination roles AND eliminate a meaningful fraction of execution roles.\n\nYour premise that governance guarantees headcount stability is similarly flawed.  saying \"someone must manage the tool, therefore jobs are safe.\"  This doesn't logically follow.\n\nToday one person supervising AI can now replace 5 junior devs, replace an outsourced QA team and replace documentation writers.  Governance will scale differently from execution.  We will need fewer implementors, but more validators, systems designers, and risk controllers.

          "text": "An interesting train of thought.  What I often reflect on is the difference between prediction and true intelligence and how much of what the human brain does might actually be the former even though we think of it as the latter.\n\nImagine you could make a perfect predictor of a person.  You could give that predictor a problem and it would predict, correctly, the answer.  It actually did solve the problem in giving the answer.  I could then make an iterative step, so use the engine to predict how a human would plan a task then predict what they would do to execute each step, predict how success of each step is evaluated and how the plan adapts as a result, etc.  This is basically what modern AI does.\n\nSo then you might say that it is impossible to make said predictor perfect.  If you give the predictor a problem which requires genuine intelligence to solve a predictor would not be able to predict the answer.  It would just be wrong.  I would agree with this.\n\nBut then when you look at what AI does it actually does solve problems which we would think of as requiring intelligence.  AI has done genuine maths research and advanced the sum of human knowledge.  All by essentially predicting the answer to questions, then feeding the results into more predictions.\n\nAI is also capable of predicting logic and reasoning in the same way.  It is not perfect, but if I picked a random person on the street AI would do well against them in logic problems.\n\nWe know how AI works and we know that it just predicts things.  So why is it so hard to find a simple task which clearly demonstrates human intelligence vs prediction by showing something AI just cannot solve no matter how good it is?  What does that say about humans?  Are we just good predictors too?  Is there any such thing as true intelligence?",

I know it’s very hard but it’s doable (I’m mostly recovering from it myself so I know how bad it can get). \n\nWhat worked for me was better sleep. Going to bed late made me very unproductive the next day which made me go to bed even later and that made a terrible feedback loop. So before anything else, force yourself to sleep and wake up early. \n\nAlso, make very small objectives out of the big objective. Set up small goals you can realistically achieve. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAnother thing I did was creating a Productive focus mode on my phone and computer where all notifications (except for immediate family members) are totally silenced. I work 50 minutes nonstop full focus followed by a 10 minute break. \n\nWhat also helped me a lot was moving my work desk from my bedroom out into a brighter part of the flat. Like this I work in a much brighter space so I don’t get sleepy or drowsy or bored as fast. Also, you shouldn’t sleep where you work and you shouldn’t work where you sleep. \n\nOther than that, waking up early morning, going for quick short walks, and doing some very light exercise has definitely helped as well. Out of all these, I would say regulate your sleep before anything else.",

Its been fun, I'm learning lots and its fun to try and solve problems.\n\nMy main job I'm implementing a new form and its just nice to work with new clean code, rather than our legacy react - which is a mess but its a well written mess haha. \n\nThis weekend I went home and... programmed more lmao. Working on a game, learning websockets and best backend stuff. \n\nAI seems to help a little but more often than not the code it generates is complex and unmaintable so I just write my own, and use it for autocomplete, code review before the actual code review.\n\nAnd to those who think its just because I'm young (true), I have a very busy life still.

Watch series, walk outside, hang out with friends, whatever you like, but make sure your brain gets novelty. Many times brain fog comes from monotony, so make sure you’re not ignoring rest and leisure. Also, workout daily and hydrate. Workout boosts your brain and hydration is fundamental. Avoid junk food and eat enough protein. These sound like generic tips but man do they make a change when you make them your routine.\n\nAlso, make sure you mix a boring but needed task with a rewarding one every day. Doing work that you must but hate can make you feel like trash. If you feel you can’t force yourself to work on something and have time margin, literally do something else that is engaging and do what you have to do later.

That's super cool! Also as a bank it's super important for us for some fucking reason that users stay on our app more of their walking hours as if attention is our business model not being a fucking bank. Super cool! Oh and the online support? Let's build a chatbot that helps nobody instead! Don't you look forward to during all of our asian branch? We're also downsizing our teams cos AI helped you become more productive so guess who gets to do increasingly more work for the same pay but double the stress? You do! Huzzah! \" And like everywhere just seems to be a variation of that? Everything is just that. \n\nSo yeah I think the big one for me is that, as a junior dev I used to think tech well save us, be this massive change that improves our lives in many ways and it's just a matter of more and more cool projects coming along with solutions to everything (yes, I was dumb) and now I'm more aware it's this FOMO-driven, skirt the rim of legal responsibility, cash grab bullshit. \n\nWhenever I hear the CEO in the same sentence talk about our commitment to the environment, and increasing in big oil and AI datacenters în the same sentence and then go on to call climate activists terrorists for not understanding they can't just stop investing in oil willy nilly and they're mean for graffiting the front door just urgh KMN\n\nSo that drips into all the everyday stuff.",

They can't operate at a loss forever, so it was only a matter of time before they found ways to make some profit off their free tier. This looks like the first step in that direction.\n\nSure, chats and personal details are \"private\", but if they ever decided to sell that data, I'm sure they could find a loophole in their own privacy policy. Even if \"they\" don't sell it, they can always get *hacked*.\n\nLet me show you how it's not just a conspiracy theory but a matter of time (I know this sounded a lot like AI, but this is all me I swear)\n\nRemember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?\n\nThat facebook quiz app harvested profile information from about 87 million people, including posts that were set to friends-only. That data was then sold to campaigns (like Trump's) to create \"psychographic profiles\" of potential voters. \n\nThey made ~$16M from it. 5.9M of which came from Trump, which may or may not have helped him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe facebook data of those 87 million people is **nothing**, compared to what people share with chatgpt. With facebook, even if your posts were set to friends-only, you were still \"choosing\" to show that content to other people. Whereas I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to see even your smartest question to chatgpt, lol\n\nNow compare that, to the sheer volume of information chatgpt has on its 190 million daily active users. Even if you and me are not, there are people out there using it as a friend, a business partner, a mentor or even more. The \"profiling\" that could be built from what chatgpt knows about us would be significantly more valuable (and dangerous)than a few old facebook posts.\n\nI don't think ANY single person, company, or even government should possess this level of intimate data on hundreds of millions of people. It's too much power for anyone to hold, regardless of their current mission statement or privacy policy. This is a massive SPOF risk, and if it isn't yet, it (OpenAI) will be the biggest target in a similar future scenario, whether for an election campaign or just an ad company going rogue.",

Scalability, maintainability, debugging, requirement speccing, architecture, technology choice trade offs, pipelines, I could go on. This is what actually fills my time, not the coding. But it depends on the application. A massive SaaS with critical uptime requirements? A government software with real world implications for bugs? Not a good candidate for vibe coding. A workout log app, a Trello clone? Could probably be done quite well with vibe coding.\n\n\nEdit: And you’re right, it’s very easy for a skilled software engineer to stand out from a vibe coder. Software engineering is in this weird place where you need to know more than ever to be useful, and you need to know coding very well to be able to take the wheel or catch the errors in Claude, but the output from juniors isn’t needed any more.

Bootstrap or tailwind, for example, feel like they bring back the element-embedded presentation attributes of yore (`<table border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"red\">`) and replaces it with a class-focused version.\n\nI often see something like `<article class=\"card\">` that could be styled with a small css file is actually created with `<div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">` which works just as well, but feels much more verbose to me.",

The idea that abstracting to the degree of a class named \"text-4xl\" in the \"benefit\" of \"removing dead CSS and utility\" BAFFLES me.\n\nBut that in combo with the need to declare all breakpoints ON THE ELEMENT is NUTS.

When you ask people why they use Tailwind (personally or in a team setting) most of the answers are related to not understanding or accepting how CSS works.\n\nTailwind team marketed in early versions by creating this “us vs them” situation by saying that “best practices don’t work” and such (regardless of if these best practices were good or not, but there is a reason people say most of the people who use TW don’t really understand CSS). \n\nYou can write vanilla CSS or Tailwind CSS without understanding it as well, at the end you write CSS but that doesn’t mean you “understood it enough”. You can also drive a car without understanding it much, because you didn’t crash doesn’t mean you know how to drive well.\n\nCSS is easy to start learning but hard to master, especially when it comes to architecture and code organisation. Tailwind helps with that because it creates constraints (I’m not talking about design tokens, which is not a Tailwind concept to begin with). Being able to add css declarations in the form of utility classes doesn’t mean you mastered CSS, you’re just able to write CSS through class composition, which prevents many people from making mistakes that’s a result of not understanding how CSS actually works.",

Hearing these arguments is the reason people know that whoever comes up with them doesn’t really know what they are talking about. (There are plugins to remove conflicting TW classes because it uses cascade as well, if it wasn’t you wouldn’t need those plugins)\n\nAlso do you write your tests in the same file as well? They are directly connected to your code and when you change one you may change the other, why you don’t colocate them? Also why we are separating components to separate files, why can’t we have one giant App.tsx file with all component definitions in them IF navigating to other files is such a big pain? It’s not 2010 anymore where we use BEM in a one giant CSS file, we use small css files to write our styles just like we separate our components to small files. Once you wrote your styles, you don’t need to see them everyday again and again, unnecessary mental burden, especially when that element doesn’t have any semantic (class) name to hint at you what it is for (if you name that element .main-chat-sidebar it’s more of a “you” problem, not CSS)\n\nWhen you iterate over an array in JSX, you don’t hardcode the array values to see “what this array consists of instead of naming it to a variable”. We name our components, their props, enums, states, hooks, test names, variables, functions and many dozens things but god forbid, naming a .Sidebar is too hard thing to do.\n\nAlso “on theming”, you can change the hue of blue-500 but you can’t easily change them to orange-500, if you want to change all your app to use orange instead of a blue. Using predefined tokens (design tokens) is not a Tailwind specific feature either.\n\nWe should also stop using semantic elements and use divs everywhere, nobody has time or energy to think about what kind of element we need after all which may change in the future (naming things is so so hard that your brain may explode). /s",

The development experience is shockingly good once you stop fighting the urge to install things. You open one file, you edit it, you refresh the browser. No build step, no node\\_modules, no waiting for webpack.\n\nThe counterargument is always \"but it doesn't scale\" and that's true. It doesn't need to. Most projects are not the next Facebook.

I like the invitations for further interaction, although I don't quite get the prompt thing under the newsletter signup.\n\nIt takes time to develop a sense of where and when to hold back rather than stuffing an experience to the gills with effects, and I think this page demonstrates that sense, or at least the ongoing development of it.\n\nThe individual product pages all look generically vibe-coded (whether they were or weren't doesn't matter much; vibers have claimed the patterns). PingPong is the exception, although I'm not going to the trouble of signing up for that or of auditing any of your actual experiences for security issues, etc.\n\nAs a landing page, I think it suffices. As a portfolio, at least in terms of UX design, it's lacking actual case studies showcasing your decisions, the rationales behind them, what you explored, what you learned, what you would do with more resources available, and so on. Not that it necessarily concerns you at 15, but those are the things I'd expect if someone told me \"here's my portfolio\" rather than just \"here's my homepage.\"\n\nThe cutesy brainrot zoomer/alpha affect doesn't really work for me, but I'm old as hell, and you're free of the optics concerns that a lot of us have to deal with when the industry determines your ability to pay rent, so I salute your bold assertion of personal taste",

Having too many makes it harder to read and I spend more time flicking between text than actually understanding the content. 3) Capitalization exists for a reason.

One thing to consider is making key sections pop more with subtle hierarchy, right now a lot of elements feel equal in weight, so adding slightly bolder headings or background shifts could guide users’ attention better. Also, small depth touches like shadows or layered cards can make it feel less flat without losing your minimal style. Overall, it’s a polished portfolio for a teenage designer, very impressive!

Maybe there’s ways of utilising the current state of the art in a way that the entire team aligns, but for now I consider them really good for codebase exploration if it’s an enterprise environment.

Even existing devs (including your future self) must reverse‑engineer intent from unfamiliar, inconsistent code instead of building on clear designs.\n\nImagine when you have multiple devs writing different prompts in different sessions, or different devs asking the AI questions but getting back different patterns for the same problem. Over time you get multiple ways to do auth, validation, error handling, etc., which increases cognitive load and bugs.\n\nRemember, speed shifts effort, but it doesn't remove it. You still have to design, review, test and maintain. Those steps don't become 10x faster just because writing the first version did.

          "text": "This is something I've been noticing more and more. The problems are different than traditional tech debt but just as real.\n\n**Traditional tech debt:** You inherit a messy codebase. It's badly structured, poorly documented, but at least someone UNDERSTOOD it when they wrote it. There was human reasoning behind the decisions, even if they were bad decisions.\n\n**AI generated tech debt:** The code works. Tests pass. But nobody actually understands WHY it works. The AI generated some clever solution that does the job, but the logic is... weird. Not wrong, just unintuitive.\n\nSix months later when you need to modify it, you're stuck. Do you:\n\n* Rewrite it from scratch (now you're back to square one)\n* Try to modify the AI generated code (good luck understanding the context)\n* Ask AI to modify its own code (works sometimes, breaks spectacularly other times)\n\n**What I'm seeing in practice:**\n\nThe biggest issue is inconsistency. When humans write code, even bad code, there's usually a consistent style and approach. You can predict how they'll solve similar problems.\n\nAI generated code feels like it was written by 10 different people. Because technically, it was trained on code from thousands of developers. So you get:\n\n* Three different patterns for error handling in the same file\n* Mix of functional and OOP styles randomly\n* Dependencies that made sense in the training data but are overkill for your use case\n\n**The maintenance burden:**\n\nWhat kills me is the cognitive load. With human written code, even messy code, I can usually trace the thought process. \"They were trying to solve X, got stuck on Y, so they did this workaround.\"\n\nWith AI code, it's just... there. Working. No narrative. No evolution. Just a blob of functionality that appeared fully formed.\n\nWhen something breaks, I find myself spending MORE time understanding the AI generated code than I would have spent just writing it myself originally.\n\n**What actually helps:**\n\nI've started treating AI generated code as a first draft that MUST be refactored. Never commit it as is. Always:\n\n* Add comments explaining the INTENT, not just what it does\n* Simplify the clever bits into obvious bits\n* Make it consistent with the rest of the codebase\n* Document any non obvious dependencies or assumptions\n\nBasically spending the time I saved on initial coding on cleanup instead. Net result is probably neutral on time, but at least the codebase stays maintainable.\n\nAnyone else finding this? Or have people figured out better workflows for keeping AI generated code from turning into unmaintainable spaghetti?",

Even with all tags disabled lol - literally loading bare GTM fucked the pagespeed scores.\n\nWhen CWV was rolled out, I was the tech lead on a rebuild of a site for a company that was trying to compete for rankings in a space that was already dominated by two big players. (Fwiw, the company I worked for did relatively well as a 3rd contender, consistently hitting 1st page results but for the most common search phrases would usually be in the lower half of 1st page, and for certain more niche phrases they'd dominate the top 5.) I was investigating the impact of CWV very closely as I had been specifically tasked with maximizing our pagespeed scores. During the roll-out there was a blog post by John Mueller where he very clearly stated that CVW were nothing more than a mild tie-breaker in case two sites were otherwise very equal. So basically perfect CWV does not automatically mean higher rankings even if the competitor's scores are absolute garbage. (Anecdotally, I recall one round of analysis where our competitors had <50/100 and we were at like 98,100,100,100 on mobile and 100 across the board on desktop.)\n\nIt's no secret that Google's ranking algorithm is a complex, secret that's constantly evolving in order to thwart the SEO-exploiters. It's a cat and mouse game that's been around for as long as search engine rankings were any kind of business concern.\n\nThere are also some clear statements by Google saying that sites for businesses with noteworthy reputations in the real-world do have priority ranking. Basically there are manual \"knobs\" they can tune their algorithm with, regardless of whatever SEO prowess is implemented on the technical or content levels.\n\nLast time I checked, a site like Amazon has absolute trash CWV, but imagine if google ranked janky little Etsy or Shopify sites over Amazon for certain searches... People would simply stop using Google as their main access point for those. Plus who knows what kind of deals and partnerships google has with various companies outside of their open-market \"sponsored results\".\n\nSo basically the game is already rigged no matter how well you do your own SEO. For most markets, organic rankings are a delusional KPI to chase if you aren't also pushing real-world business reputation. Imho it's a rather fair play, because SEO has always been something that marketing specialists try to game tf out of. The downside is that it certainly does make it difficult for smaller up-and-comers to break into top-tier rankings. But at the same time, how easy has it ever been to break into any other mainstream business rankings such as the F500?",

          "text": "Yep. Multiple times. It also depends on what the page is. Each website build is different. There are valid exceptions to not having 100. Overall page speed should be used a tool for developers to know what browsers expect of them, and not a pissing contest between websites to see whos is actually faster.\n\nBasically 0 network requests in the critical path assuming rational webpage payload and you'll get 100. The critical path is just what browsers need to build the initial view which is usually above the fold. You can still do shit loads of network requests but for initially building the page you don't want any if possible, it seems like inline CSS is the way to go for performance in the critical path, for example.\n\nI'm working on a custom SSG + a website output from the SSG. It's a heavy JS media site with a 60fps deltatime gameloop running a pretty significant animation right off the hop, went from 73 performance to 90-93 and it can go to 100 on-demand if you turn off cloudflare/js tracking stuff, which was used in this domain i was optimizing for example.\n\nBiggest things were LCP was not being present on the page right away, so I fixed the custom SSG to have image preloading functionality and preloaded the LCP in the critical path so it's present during drawing and so the browser knows how to build the page properly.\n\nThen I had about 1 full second of render blocking assets, I inlined the critical css on the page so there is no network request for critical path, then inlined whatever JS in the head for a small theme switcher script to stop FOUS and the application/ld+json, and then rest of CSS scripts were preloaded async and the rest of the JS was defered until doc load. Rest of JS moved and loaded outside of head. preload the fonts in head for FOUS and to stop additional network requests\n\nImages were not optimized this was a huge win, swapped everything to webp. And have fallback pngs optimized for web JIC. Rest of the website was already in the 90s with no real issues beside blogs index pages which was just an image size issue because it's not dynamically grabbing a different size for the card. So I'm not bothering for now because it's blazing fast and images are very very small in size anyway being webp.",

Therefore, I'm a bit wary that we're just seeing the cracks starting to form on economic stressors and the adoption of AI as a \"replacement.\" I'm an early adopter of erroneous redundancy it seems. \n\nI really don't think AI can replace human ingenuity (yet,) but companies are more concerned with profits than ever before and the opportunity to save considerably even for a less functional product is tantalizing. I've spoken to a couple of companies who collapsed and sold rather than reinvest and pivot their business to be more competitive. \n\nI've always been happy as a freelance developer, but I think it might be time to pick up Cracking the Coding Interview and start applying to 9-5s. I will say, it's not enticing. The value companies are placing on devs are lower than ever before. The wages are so stagnant.",

There was an e-commerce WordPress project that someone reached out to me to take over, they had a bad experience with their first developer, both technical issues but also interpersonnel issues between the owner of the company and the developer ... some rumblings about legal action from both sides.  I agreed to take a look at it, started to consult with them, but pretty quickly jumped off the project, I didn't accept any pay for it despite spending \\~20 or so hours working on various parts of it.  There was a \"technical lead\" (the owner's brother in law) who I worked with primarily, he's the guy who hired me, and I was frank with him, told him that it's much harder to jump into a project and \"get it over the finish line\" than it is to build it the way that I built projects from the start.  I would have been making up for the technical debt of this developer, but also that the original developer did not have the experience to push back against the owner's vision and promised things that just couldn't be done for the budget expectations that she had set.\n\nI liken it to plumbing.  A plumber quotes $10,000 for a job, but someone else quotes $1,000 for the same job.  The home owner hires the person who quoted $1,000, but after weeks and weeks the work isn't complete, they're not around, there's water leaking.  You're brought in to \"finish their work,\" but your quote now isn't $10,000, it's $15,000, because it requires un-doing the shoddily done inexperienced work that isn't to code.",

The left menu, button and popover could use the subtle shadow, especially when their colour is too close to the map colour. And let's be honest, the dark bevel borders of the left menu buttons screams 2000s.\n\nThe font choice wouldn't fly into today's devices either. It isn't as legible and accessible, especially the bold fonts. There are modern fonts designed for devices today that works better. The second version font is a tiny bit better, although I'm not particularly fond of the choice as well.\n\nPersonally, I use the updated design, but incorporate some of the things from the first that made it feels unique.",

Pretty clear line between frontend and backend.\n\nNow I'm writing server components, setting up edge functions, configuring middleware, dealing with database queries in my \"frontend\" framework, thinking about caching strategies, and recently even having to consider how AI agents will interact with the sites I build. Half of what I do would have been called \"backend work\" not that long ago.\n\nI'm not complaining, it's genuinely more interesting. But I'm curious if other people are experiencing this same shift.

You touch caching, auth, databases, queues, edge functions and even business logic because UX depends on latency and data flow. I ended up building an internal tool just to handle leads, events, communication and automation in one place because jumping between 6 different services was slower than writing code. Kinda feels like modern dev work is less about pages and more about systems thinking.",

It’s still about state management, rendering performance, UX constraints, and translating product requirements into reliable interfaces.\n\nWhat did change for me is that I now have to understand the entire request lifecycle. Not to own all of it, but to make better decisions.\n\nSo my day to day looks like:\n\n* Designing component architecture\n* Thinking about data flow and caching strategy\n* Coordinating with backend on contracts\n* Occasionally touching server logic when it’s faster to own it\n\nI don’t see it as “frontend becoming full-stack”.

I went from \"give me an API endpoint\" to \"I'll just write the endpoint myself because it's faster than waiting for a backend ticket to get prioritized.\" And once you do that a few times, suddenly you're fullstack and nobody updated your title or comp to reflect it.\n\n\n\nThe AI angle makes this even weirder. I can prototype an entire API layer with Claude in an hour now, so there's even less reason to wait for a dedicated backend developer to pick up the work. The role isn't quietly becoming fullstack.
