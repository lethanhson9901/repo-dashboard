      "text": "With how easy coding with ai is, everyone including their mother can now whip up a generic ecom website with just a few sentences. This obviously leads to the junior positions in many companies completely decimated due to both the shrinkage of the demand(1 junior with a claude subscription can replace 5 juniors from 2020) and the supply (everybody can code with ai).\n\nAll the current senior devs still have their experiences and expertise from the last 2 decades and won't be negatively affected by the adoption of ai, but there will come a time where they'll retire and have to hand over the role of \"senior\" to the little juniors.\n\nA senior solves a problem by thinking about it from more perspectives, usually out of their years of experience, completes the overall skeleton of the solution and hands the mundane part to the juniors, where they learn how the overall architecture and system should relate to each other and function properly. Obviously seniors also know how to use ai, so companies will stop hiring juniors to save on costs, and when the seniors eventually retire, there will be no new seniors since all the juniors were never there in the first place.",

It comes from seeing production failures, bad decisions, messy handoffs, and learning how humans and systems break under pressure. AI can speed up output, but it cannot recreate those lived feedback loops.

Code becomes disposable, and software is constantly reinvented and recycled. Software developers less and less look at code, they just get the AI to do stuff and then make sure it conforms to requirements. On the one hand of this means juniors can exist, because their role is basically splitting up work into very small chunks (absolutely a skill) and holding the hand of the AI through it. On the other hand this is actually slower than building good quality software in the medium and long term, but businesses don't care, because businesses never care about that sort of thing.\n\nSoftware development then is forced into this cycle: ship crap, restart every few months when the model hits its limit. Our entire industry reshapes. New SDLC models emerge, are hyped, and entire consultancies built around deploying them (ah la Agile). New frameworks emerge on this model (eg rest framework that wrap you in a secure sandbox, managing externalities, allowing your code to be as shit as you like). Many breathless blog posts are written about how to be efficient in this model.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been learning the piano in this timeline for multiple years. I quit software, and eke out a meagre life teaching 8 year olds, and supporting acts in local bars.\n\nI make no money, and am content.",

AI produces bad quality code. AI doesn't ship. A few sentences takes you nowhere productive. Most people can't use AI properly, much less \"code\".\n\n**Even if** you can truly develop a full-fledged app just prompting an AI, you still need to know how to deploy it to a professional hosting/cloud service, which is not so trivial.\n\n**Even if** you follow some tutorials and make that work, you would have not put on a CI/CD with linting, testing, automatic deployment, etc. You will most likely wreck this a few prompts in the future.\n\n**Even if** that somehow miraculously doesn't stop you, and if users start using your service, you'll surely start getting issues with concurrency and load spikes. You would need to know a bit more about how kubernetes work, what's a pod, what's a node, how computers work, how to scale vertically, how to manage state, how to manage replicas, rate limiting, cache layers, load balancers, etc.\n\nAnd that's still not all of it. But if you somehow reached this point successfully, you are no vibe-coder, you are a software engineer, and most likely you didn't vibe-code your app.\n\nStop being delusional, with current state LLM you won't get more than a PoC or bare minimum MVP that someone with some knowledge will have to deploy and take care of in your place (still **very** valuable, not saying otherwise).",

Similarly, I can do a lot of math on a calculator that I would probably fail at on paper, but I need to know the equations to make good use of the calculator.\n\nThis metaphor falls apart once you swap math for natural language.

Then after that people would draw on a computer and then design each building component and send that off to be made and then make designs for the builders to follow whilst construction. Then better software was made where you draw the building and it does everything for you. This massive productivity boost didn't lead to job losses and we still have junior architects today.\n\nWe're going through this same change now. In 10 years time maybe we won't even be writing code, we'll just write a list of things that must happen when events are fired or APIs are called. Like how buildings have got bigger with more requirements and more materials and cheaper maybe software will too but we will still need people with technical understanding, design and vision in one way or another",

It’s like saying the victims of Hiroshima are to blame because they couldn’t run fast enough.\n\nSociety as we know it and as we implement it to date requires people.\n\nThose people earn money, and those people cost money. If a business is successful, it means the workers earned much more than they cost.\n\nIf work in a large enough chunk of the economy becomes a dancing contest between humans and AI, well—humans have to study for decades at a great expense to become experts at something like programming. If the whole field is destroyed, faulting them for failing to anticipate the destruction of their investment leads where exactly? A maximumly agile person in the world you describe isn’t allowed to develop expertise because the investment is likely to be eradicated by AI. The whole game of reducing worker numbers while increasing output can’t go on forever without collapsing the economy, so this Muskian blame just really doesn’t hold water. The system doesn’t promise to replace what’s destroyed, and humans can’t spend $100k + 8 years of study in an instant in order to redirect. Like asking a 50 year old to make that investment is crazy because the time it would take to recover it even if they commit to a total career change is much more likely not to be realized.\n\nLike I’m 50, my son is 18.\nI’m a programmer and I’ve been put out of work by AI. \nMy family needs money, but none of us are skilled with valuable skills (even though my skills are recently THE MOST valued).\nThe cost for skills is $100k.\n\nWho gets the $100k skills? Me or the 18 year old.\n\n18 year old is better get because I’m more likely to die at they point. But then what? The 18 year old is a slave for his family and when he grows old has nothing?\n\nAt best you displace your burden one generation.\n\nYou assign blame, but sound daft.

Most improvements are around tooling and making it more compact. Additional training data gets worse nowadays due to the fact that neural networks usually produce at least a slightly worse version of their training input. The chance that it will get bette and better are very very low and its more likely that we are actually at the limit of what an LLM can provide.\n\nAnd I also have to disagree, often the AI produces over complicated or messy code when it comes to more complex tasks. It can help a lot when using it for small units though and focusing on TDD, its rather good in generating code from tests, but even then it often adds unnecessary things to it or generates way too complicated code. As my manager put it: \"This thing is amazing for rapid prototyping! It was so much fun working with it! The code belongs in the trash can, but its great to test concepts\" <- He puts a lot of importance on code quality, technical debt was a massive issue at our company a few years ago.",

The root of the problem is that the arXiv paper is pretty bad: it uses a dataset ([HMCorp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04704)) that generated pairs of functions (human-generated, AI-generated) by stripping the docstring and letting ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo recreate the same code. The authors expanded this ancient dataset with their own ancient models (DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct 33B, released in November 2023, and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 32B, released in September 2024), and all this methodological mess was needed to claim that AI models write flawed and vulnerability-ridden code. A much better summary of this \"research\" would be:\n\n\"When outdated AI models are given vague instructions without project context, they write generic, simple code that fails to use all function arguments and defaults to insecure patterns.\"\n\nPlease, people, if you cannot evaluate a research paper on your own, don't mindlessly share it, or at least ask GPT-5.2 Thinking or Gemini 3 Pro to critically analyze the paper for you instead of spreading misinformation. Trust me, any of those models is able to perform much better analyses than most people.\n\nOn the other hand, as a security researcher, I had a good laugh when I read this, since nothing could be further from the truth:\n\n> human mistakes tend to be low-to-medium severity — typos, minor logic flaws, a missing null check. messy but catchable.",

Suffering has always been there but they hear more about it.\n\nLow interest rates caused a cash glut which resulted in a period of power for many more devs. During this period they had outsized influence over tech choices and the ability to jump ship before the results made an impact. We all suffer from them not using boring tools. \n\nThe reins are tighter on real world scope/influence of devs. With a tighter market there is now more pressure to hype to be heard.

To be clear, I don't bear any inherent ill will towards Firefox/Mozilla.\n\nI've listened to many podcasts and read many blog posts that advocate for the survival of Firefox (and more specifically, Gecko). The arguments generally distill down to the same idea: \"We do not want to experience IE6 again\" and I agree with the sentiment, I do not want to go through that again.\n\nHowever, as someone who's been building websites since the days of \"best rendered in IE6\", I don't really feel like we're in the same place as back then. Not even close.\n\nIE6 wasn't just dominant by accident, it was far better than any alternatives until Firefox came along (and I was a very early adopter). It was also closed-source and was the default browser on the dominant OS at the time.\n\nToday, we have a variety of platforms (mobile, desktop, etc.) and all of the rendering engines are open-source. Anyone can create a new browser and anyone can influence the rendering engine through the source. There are also several large companies and individuals who are on the standards/recommendations bodies who govern how HTML/CSS/JS develop.\n\nThe current environment doesn't seem conducive to a monopoly even if Firefox and Gecko were to disappear. Conversely, web standard adoption may pick up as Safari and Chrome are often faster to deliver on new features (though kudos on Temporal, Firefox!).\n\nCurious everyone's thoughts. Is it just nostalgia/gratitude that's pushing people to support Firefox or is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: I should've titled this \"Is it bad for the web if Gecko dies?\" as that's the conversation I'm really after.",

It had complete market dominance in corporate, it was by far the most popular home browser, but that dominant position is what made Microsoft miss the mark so much on mobile and not appreciate that Chrome was taking all of its users on Windows.

Companies want to race so far ahead with features and paradigms that they own from top to bottom, before standardized interoperable protocols get stood up. This is why I think it's important to invest in the success of the activity pub protocol, and support efforts that build out competitors based on it. Loops is a tiktok alternative based on activity pub, which is fascinating and very encouraging.\n\nI also think this cast s an entirely different light on Mozilla's AI efforts. People forget and relearn this lesson over and over and over and over and over, but new paradigms come that you would never have anticipated, features that don't yet exist become the new baseline of normal that users expect. We don't know what is going to be yet, but you don't want to get caught flat-footed, and so investing in that now is important.

So it's important to be ready for whatever's next.\n\nYep, this was my worry with what I thought was a bigger funding crisis for Mozilla Foundation, that as Google search starts to become less important as a financial driver, Google will abandon spending on search lock-in, and it would be hard to say right now whether \"AI Lock-in\" will be a drop-in replacement financially.\n\nWhat I come back to a lot with browsers is that, in \\~2004, really major players in the browser space other than maybe Apple forsaw the explosion of mobile/handheld internet browsing.  You had your vested players -- Internet Explorer -- the upstart challenger in Firefox, Apple with Safari for OSX, and then your minor players doing some interesting things (I Still remember when Opera was a browser that shipped with a dedicated ad bar and it was considered *a feature*).  But in 2004 it felt like IE would always dominate browser traffic, they had a 95%+ foothold, corporate/workplace lock in was complete, and it seemed impossible for any challenger to overtake them.  And then by 2012, IE was basically dead in the mindspace of browsers, and very few people saw mobile browsing as one of the mega trends that would unseat them.  I say maybe the exception of Apple because there is a very clear throughline to developing Safari for X, porting it to iPhone OS just a couple years later, that you figure that Apple was having those internal conversations about it.",

Some years ago, Mozilla tried to push a non-advertising standard for monetizing websites (more or less micro-transactions instead of ads). There were some real issues with the proposal (do you also throw up a bit at \"micro-transactions\"?), but that kind of thing is (and will continue to be) essentially dead on arrival so long as implementations of new standards rely on Google. We're already living in The Bad Place - but outside of a few (real and non-trivial!) issues it's not so bad for most of us.\n\nThere's a couple niches that would feel it significantly worse than others.

Forking Chromium doesn’t really fix that — forks follow upstream, they don’t shape standards. \n\nIf Firefox dies, we lose the only major browser that:\n\n* isn’t tied to an ad business (Google), and\n* isn’t tied to a closed platform ecosystem (Apple).\n\nStandards also don’t protect us by themselves. Specs only matter when multiple engines implement them. If Chromium becomes the only serious engine, whatever it ships becomes the de facto standard, regardless of what the spec says.\n\nAnd from a dev perspective, Firefox is still a critical reference implementation. When things work in both Chrome and Firefox, you know you’re not relying on accidental behavior.\n\nSo it’s less “save Firefox out of gratitude” and more “the web needs at least one independent engine to stay healthy.”",

We are slowly finding uses for genetic browsers, one developer can now solo build out product (even if half-baked and riddled with vulnerabilities for the time being) with the help of agents and maybe the hurdle of developing new browsers from the ground up with unique principles and features will slowly start to shrink, opening up the market for better, more aggressive movement on the browser front… but I am probably just being overly optimistic.",

      "text": "I've been a web dev for most of my career, professionally at fortune 500 companies for over 8 years (mainly LAMP/WAMP). I've also built many side projects there were SAAS, and unfortunately never were profitable, but that's fine. They helped me build my resume/portfolio up, so it wasn't a waste of time IMO.\n\nBack when I made those SAAS products (\\~8 years to 2ish years ago, pre LLM's), it took quite some time to develop the product and you had to settle on a \"great\" idea to make it worthwhile to develop. After spending hundreds of hours making the MVP idea come to life, it'd be time to market it. At that phase, you kind of still had a chance to stand out, since everyone was in the same boat in terms of time spent on the idea, and effort put in.\n\nNow with AI tools and vibe coding, people are making websites and apps on a whim, and a ton of them are honestly junk. Either poorly coded, or just not useful or novel ideas. Even the ones that are good are completely buried by the insane amount of services being created. I'm actually grateful that these tools exist, but now we're in a different game where marketing is pretty much everything. Obviously marketing and the business side of a SAAS was a huge portion of it, but now it's become the primary blocker to creating a profitable product.\n\nI see a ton of people try out these AI tools and ambitiously think that they can create a product that makes them financially free, or at least get some side income. Because of this, the market has become absurdly saturated from a product and marketing standpoint. I'm sure some people are making successful businesses, but it's becoming a majorly decreasingly small percentage of projects that succeed, mainly due to the absurd levels of market saturation. Just a few years ago, if you wanted to make a SAAS website, you were genuinely competing with a pool of creators that was a fraction of the size of what it is now. \n\nTo make matters worse, it's becoming less obvious from the consumer side of what's just a trash product slapped together using AI, vs something that is actually worth paying for. Anyone can vibe code a project now in like an hour and plug in Stripe to accept payments. I see this is especially bad for SAAS products in industries like finance and social media. \n\nI don't want any of this to come off as negative, it's just a shift in the market. The barrier to entry now is so low, that you have to focus on more organic channels of sales like local markets, and build products that serve even more niche needs. I'm already starting to switch gears to more of a consulting strategy, where I try to find businesses that need specific web automation or support on existing enterprise products, rather than trying to create new SAAS products from scratch. And no do not DM me or ask for details about that, the point stands alone, and I don't use Reddit as a commercial channel in any capacity.\n\nI've seen other posts online about this, but they're generally just complaining like \"vibe coding/AI bad\", or some other doomer take. I feel like my skills are as valuable as ever, because I'm still working on projects that are super ambiguous business problems and can't be done without having the knowledge of the business ahead of the product and web code itself. On the other hand, a ton of people are hopping into web dev, marveling at their ability to quickly generate SAAS products, and thinking they've got something valuable. I hate to compare it to AI art, but it really is quite similar. Both are ultra saturated, so the value comes from the actual experience and implementation of the artist/web dev within the business itself, not just making something pretty that you can quickly pump out that \"looks good\". \n\nCurious if anyone else feels the same way about this.",

In addition all their marketing is the same too. \n\nIt's fairly easy to separate the spam, but perhaps that's because I've seen so many. \n\nEither way, I don't feel as pessimistic about it honestly. I'm iterating a side project now and all this saas slop is mostly helping me figure out just how to promote it when the time comes. \n\nIt doesn't seem difficult to stand out based on this, but maybe I'll check back here in a couple months to let you know if I regret my confidence.",

Here's the current the situation: there's a subset of people who want to make big bucks and bail, most of these people were the crypto bros a few years back. Now they see twitter threads saying: this guy makes 50k a month with his SaaS without knowing how to code!\n\nBut what they don't see is: people get lucky! The twitter algo picks you're crappy novelty SaaS, a lot of people suddenly pay $5 to you, you get big moneys, and that's it. But that happens for a tiny tiny slice of the population. Most SaaS made by people fail. Some people make great products but can't find the market fit. Others make shitty products in an already saturated market.\n\nWho will win? Whoever can make a product that makes a difference AND has the knowdlege and power to market it (and some luck, ofc). A simple example: I've been looking for an expense tracker app for weeks. The one I use has some flaws. If you search the app store there are +100 apps out there. But there's not a single one which fit my needs and that I consider good enough to use.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to make big bucks building a crappy SaaS, give it a try, it's easy to create the product, it's hard to make it stand out, it's hard to market, and it's unlikely to get it to make money, but it's easy to try I guess",

Probably more like oil rig management companies like Schlumberger who might develop embedded software they analyzes pipeline fluid pressure in real time and regulates machinery to keep it operating within safety params.\n\nClaude is unlikely to author that for you without heavy experienced Eng involvement, and a Pre-AI “sass website maker” wasn’t going to build that anyways.\n\nOr let’s take another extreme: small time shop owner wants to create an online place or storefront using basic web tools. Not even worth vibe coding this, you’re way WAY better off just using something like square space or webflow.. it’s such a repeatable cookie cutter solved solution that’s very cheap to do in these platforms",

          "text": "I think most of this post is plain wrong and pretty misleading for the Reddit community — not because “AI good / vibe coding good,” but because it mixes a few real observations with big unsupported leaps and then presents them like market truth.\n\nA few points:\n\n1) “Back then you needed a great idea” is mythology.\nYou didn’t need a “great idea,” you needed a clearly scoped problem, a buyer, and a distribution path. Tons of profitable SaaS are boring, obvious, and iterative. The hard part was always: pick a pain people pay for, position it, sell it, keep them paying. That hasn’t changed. If anything, faster build cycles make it easier to test whether an idea is good instead of betting “hundreds of hours” up front.\n\n2) “Marketing is everything now” is an overcorrection.\nIf “marketing” means “getting attention on X/Reddit/Product Hunt,” sure, that channel is noisier. But that’s not the same thing as “marketing is the primary blocker to profitability.” In most real businesses the blockers are still: willingness to pay, trust, switching costs, onboarding, retention, reliability, support, compliance, integrations. If your product actually solves a painful job and fits a real buyer workflow, you don’t need to win the influencer lottery.\n\n3) You’re confusing “more people shipping demos” with “more competition for customer budgets.”\nThe internet is flooded with low-effort launches because it’s now cheap to publish. That doesn’t mean the market is saturated in the only way that matters: customers already having a good solution they’re happy to pay for. A thousand junk clones aren’t meaningful competition for a product that’s embedded in a workflow, integrates with existing systems, and has support + reliability. Noise is not the same thing as saturation.\n\n4) “Success rates are shrinking because saturation” is a story, not a fact.\nSide projects have basically always failed at high rates. What changed is visibility: more people can ship something, so you see more failures (and more half-baked products) in public. That’s not evidence that the percentage of serious attempts that succeed is collapsing, it’s evidence that the denominator got filled with hobbyist attempts.\n\n5) “Consumers can’t tell trash AI from real products” is backwards in many categories.\nIn B2B and especially regulated/high-trust areas (finance, healthcare, security), buyers absolutely can tell quickly. The moment they hit missing edge cases, poor support, shaky compliance, or unreliable data handling, it’s over. In finance in particular, the barrier isn’t “Stripe checkout,” it’s trust, audits, risk management, and operational competence. AI makes it easier to fake a landing page; it doesn’t make it easier to pass diligence.\n\n6) “Anyone can plug in Stripe and accept payments” is a rhetorical trick.\nA checkout link is not a business. Real billing means taxes/VAT, invoicing, refunds, chargebacks, fraud, subscription edge cases, accounting, customer support, and legal/compliance depending on the domain. Reducing “getting paid” to “plug in Stripe” is exactly the kind of simplification that misleads newer builders.\n\n7) The conclusion (“you have to go niche/local/consulting”) is fine — but the framing is off.\nYes: narrower ICPs, specific distribution channels, and consulting/productized services are often the most reliable path. But not because “AI killed SaaS.” It’s because that was always how you win without an unfair distribution advantage: you find a clear buyer with a costly problem and you solve it better than their current workaround.\n\nA cleaner version of what’s true here:\n— Build is cheaper and faster.\n— Therefore the advantage shifts toward domain insight, trust, distribution, and execution depth (reliability, integration, support).\n— Public launch channels are noisier, so “generic SaaS for everyone” is harder to sell via vibes.\n— But that doesn’t mean “marketing is everything” or that SaaS is now pointless — it means the bar for differentiation and trust is higher.\n\nIf anything, the opportunity is bigger for builders who can:\n— talk to users, map workflows, and ship the unsexy parts (integrations, admin, audit logs, permissions, support),\n— wedge into an existing business process,\n— and sell directly to a defined buyer instead of chasing attention.\n\nSo yeah: lots of AI-made junk exists. But treating that as proof that “the market is absurdly saturated and only a tiny decreasing % can succeed now” is doom narrative, not analysis. The game didn’t become impossible — it became less forgiving to “build first, hope marketing works later,” which honestly was always the most common reason side projects died.",

So the challenge was more about how to capture everything in JavaScript and make a small algorithm which compresses the data to be sent. You can check how it works here:\nWhen recording I just save the full content of the input ( https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ) with the date every time it changes but when people are done and want to send it, the content is compressed like this: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ('a' is for append, 'd' for delete and 'r' for replace)\nThen the replayer uses compress data to show the process: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/replayer.ts",

Once you depart the positions that appear in books, it starts making illegal moves and blundering relatively quickly, which makes sense from the POV of a model that’s generating a plausible next move, not necessarily a good or even legal one.\n\nIn any case, LLMs are not actually doing the things you listed, at best they’re generating code based on what it’s been trained on. When you say “it fixes bugs” I interpret it as you finding the bug, prompting to fix it, and the model spitting out something that looks like a fix, but may still be incorrect, all while telling you it’s all fixed now. After all, if it can actually investigate, find and fix the bug, why was it wrong in the first place? That’s what you’d expect from a human. When you prompt it to plan a system for you, it’s just generating what looks like a plan, but it may be off.\n\nForgive me if I don’t buy that your solo Claude operation generated such a sophisticated enterprise SaaS product when the current poster project for LLM code is a web browser where the heavy lifting is done by a couple of open source libraries, and it still cost a few millions, IIRC, in tokens and API calls.\n\nEDIT: I guess I missed a pretty obvious question. If the LLMs can actually do all that, why not just add \"make it bug-free and secure\" to the prompt, let it take a couple more hours crunching and have a working, near-bug-free and near-secure product? No need to answer that, the API call for any given prompt takes about the same amount of time as the API call including \"bug free and secure\", which means the model didn't actually do any extra work.",

What's the point of a library? Instead, developers used it as a tool and learned to be better programmers. Swaths of programmers came up this way instead of traditional schooling.\n\nI remember when I was in traditional school and we had to learn C# and ASP.NET for frontend. We could just drag and drop full form elements onto the page and students and teachers alike were like: \"This is the future, eventually programming will be obsolete and everything will be drag and drop. For now though, we still have to connect our logic to it.\" That was like, 15 years ago. Sure, the web has come a long way, and a lot of easy things we can just drag and drop now. Turns out that even the companies and their workers don't want to do this, though. They'd rather hire out a company to do this for them.\n\nNot to mention businesses that need unique functionality that makes sense to them and their business, but may not fit anywhere else. Your boss is not going to want to prompt this, implement it, refine it, and deploy it - I guarantee it. It's the reason they have workers below them to begin with: delegation.\n\nEven the most sophisticated AI isn't going to be able to build a fully functional app if it's not given a full, descriptive picture. AI is a tool just as IDEs are a tool, just as search engines are a tool, just as spell-check is a tool. Like all tools it needs to be understood to be used properly and efficiently.\n\nAnecdotally, I find AI responses to be faster almost 10 fold than trying to search the same thing. If I know of a function or method in a framework, but don't quite remember the name or arguments - AI is wayyy faster than searching the docs for the same thing. It's just computation power. 99% of the time when it comes to actual documented framework it's right too which is helpful to me in my projects.\n\nThere's no \"getting rid\" of AI. Being able to crunch a solid subset of knowledge and algorithmly access it quicker than a search API query is super useful in literally all fields. Major governments around the world are using and integrating some form of it. It's in the Open Source communities where it will be perpetuated by hobbyists and professionals alike. Corporations are pushing it and integrating it.\n\nI don't think AI will lead to full automation of all jobs, but there's certainly a subset. The biggest concerns we should have as a society regarding AI is regulation, energy consumption, and UBI. That's what we should be talking about and pushing for.",

Using things like 12factor principles and Docker, external event processors with RabbitMQ, and dead simple flask scripts behind something like Traefik for routing let's you build super loosely decoupled apps that work together and the entire source-code can fit in a single prompt.\n\nSee the *arr stack for a rough approximation of that type of app development.\n\nI have built an enormous amount of tooling around this, beginning when Chatgpt first launched to do my own job.\n\nThe thing is, my job is hard, my usage is specific to me, and my role.\n\nThe understanding of software I needed to get to the point where I could do this reliably took my entire career and adult life, and I do not think is common amongst folks like my coworkers at my last job, who seem to face-roll their keyboard when chatgpt doesnt work and cannot seem to do what they want.\n\nI run a small townie local consulting company in metro detroit. I don't particularly have high aspirations as a career goal, but ive built a small build-in-the-open consulting company.\n\nThis fits into what I do perfectly. \n\nOpen-source software has very high ambitions, but struggles in manpower to challenge establishment companies short of massively successful products.\n\nA common tactic for legacy software companies is to offer smaller companies an on-ramp and then lock them down with vendor lock in. For example, Salesforce or Zoho might start as a simple contact manager, but before you know it, you're spending 5 figures a month. \n\nMigrations are hugely expensive and time consuming. A lot of small companies are running very old code bases as a result.\n\nThis let's me punch way, way above my paygrade. Where I would normally push a company to Salesforce, which locks them into costly subscriptions for a simple contact manager, im able to give them a much better, fully open-source application which is tailor made to them. \n\nThis is software developments Napster moment. Software, to me, has always been about software. I give away what I do. It was never about money. I do, of course, need to put food on the table.\n\nI don't think this is going to put me out of work. I do think it will put the people who took the clicks-not-code approach in a pinch.\n\nIt absolutely devalued portions of the industry. However, for enterprising and industrious folks, you will see the total destruction of legacy software vendors and democratization of software and ideas. You'll see a lot better open-source software. You'll see a huge uptick in garbage.\n\nFor the developers who are able to review the code quickly, and understand the big picture, who open-source their software are going to absolutely decimate legacy software like Salesforce, Oracle, parts of Google.\n\nThe whole thing sucks for the industry, but its here.\n\nEdit: ok guys, a nuanced take?!

But apart from that, if AI were really allowing developers to much more quickly ship at-least-barely-working stuff -- much less allowing non-developers to, as the evangelists keep claiming -- shouldn't we have seen some sort of major acceleration in new products or product features in recent years? \n\nI had the idea of looking up App Store transparency reports, but they haven't done 2025 yet. Looking at [2023](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) to [2024](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2024-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) we see a ~12% increase in the rate of app submissions, but also a ~10% increase in the rate of rejections. This isn't a wide-ranging look at the data, but what we can see hardly sounds like an industry that's becoming crazily more productive, *even at shipping crap*.\n\nApart from statistics, shouldn't we be seeing an insane number of new videogame releases, or social networking sites, or Excel competitors, or just... anything?

Have AI design your new chips and cut Nvidia out of the process. CUDA lock-in?

          "text": "I am actually really curious as to whether the trade off for coding speed is really worth it.\n\nIf you're a developer who lets AI code for you and you **don't** review it, then you are terrible and will almost certainly output garbage.\n\nHowever if you do review it, then you need to take the time to actually read the code and understand the code across your entire codebase in order to ensure everything is ok, and doesn't include time spent from noticing things that are wrong or just outright insane, then going back and forth trying to get it to fix it or just implementing the fix yourself.\n\nSo really if you think about it, if you are **using AI correctly** as a developer which involves knowing the code and manually reviewing the code yourself, is it really making it faster for you?\n\nI for one find it takes me longer to review code I didn't write as I don't already have the understanding I would have originally had in my head had I written it myself, so it takes me longer to have to map out any external code  that isn't mine.\n\nMaybe you could make the argument it still makes it faster by a fraction. But when people say it makes coding faster, unless you're not bothering to review and understand it, then it can't be THAT MUCH faster. Not at fast lightning speeds. The AI can do what it does, good or bad, at lightning speeds, but not you. You yourself will always have a slow input and output speed at which you can review and understand all the code.\n\nGiven that any speed gained from this, if any, is it really worth the billions going into these data centres, the amount of power they are consuming, for those tiny gains?\n\nLet's not even get started on the dangerous level of information it provides. I am finding a lot of the time it just really doesn't understand things, even simple things.\n\nSeems crazy to me the amount that is needed for AI, and I for one do not see this as a revolution at all yet. Not even close. My life has not changed at all since AI. I genuinely can't say it has made me more productive in any way shape or form. Even when asking it to explain something, I am constantly having to search up the answers myself to confirm because it can get things wrong so much. So would you call that being more productive? Considering before AI I would just search up the damn answer anyway. Now it seems I have this extra baggage of having to ask it something first and then end up doing the research myself.\n\nAt best, AI is just useful to talk to. If you are bored and want to entertain yourself, it's ok I guess. But for using it for anything that requires attention to detail? I think everyone has massively misjudged what these things are currently capable of doing.",

To some extent, this lets them kind of print money, because they can give out shares easily, and use that to bid and make deals.\n\nThis incentivizes big companies to hype up the latest tech bubble, regardless of what it is, in hopes that it will last them until the next big thing. This way, near tech monopolies with billions of users can still be seen as growing.\n\nRegarding AI specifically, the claim is that it will be able to replace all those expensive workers and increase productivity, at a fraction of the cost. The incentives are aligned to make software engineers into people who just review AI code all day, and take the heat whenever something goes wrong.\n\nHowever, the current AI setup is extremely expensive and propped up almost entirely by investors, with no foreseeable path to make enough revenue to cover their absurd expenses.\n\nFor the near future, I predict it will continue to be an excuse to fire employees in economic downturns, while still keeping shareholders under the illusion that things are great. It will push the engineers with jobs to churn out slop and be responsible when AI breaks everything. Then the bubble will burst, rich people will make off with lots of money, regular people will lose their retirements, and we'll all be left with an absolute mess of tech debt to clean up, all while big companies look for the next big thing to hype up.",

Keep your DNS separate from your web host for better control and resilience.\n\nI'm posting this as a cautionary tale for anyone trusting \"set it and forget it.\" Especially for anyone using Netlify.\n\nI have a small side project (hundreds of unique visitors/month). The app is deployed on Netlify and the domain is registered through Netlify (via Name.com). Auto-renew was enabled for the domain name. **Netlify even emailed me in December saying everything was set and no action was required.**\n\nThen a few days ago the site was unreachable.\n\nNo recent deployments, no DNS changes. Wtf?\n\nThe domain started returning NXDOMAIN everywhere.\n\nI saw the domain was \"auto-renewing\" in Netlify and the DNS changes were \"propagating\". I think, ok maybe there will be some brief downtime -- not something I've experienced with a domain renewal before but maybe not outside the realm of possibility?\n\nThen a day goes by...so I submit a support ticket on Netlify. Nothing.\n\nAnother ticket...Nothing.\n\nDM Netlify on X. Nothing.\n\nI contact Name.com and they say they can't do anything, only Netlify can remove the hold.\n\nFile a 3rd ticket with Netlify, still nothing.\n\nFinally I posted on X and tagged Netlify. Then they intervene (bless the Netlify social media manager).\n\nOnce it was escalated, the fix was literally \"renew domain/clear hold\" but until then, there was nothing I could do.\n\nTotal downtime was almost 3 days. Obviously this isn't a big deal for a little app like mine, but it might have been a big deal for some of you.\n\nThe root cause ended up being a domain renewal edge case:\n\n* auto-renew didn't prevent expiration\n* domain was placed on clientHold at the registry\n* Netlify's UI wouldn't allow me to disable auto-renew (and therefore renew manually)\n* multiple support requests got **no acknowledgment at all (still haven't received anything communication from Netlify)**\n* the issue was only fixed after I publicly tagged Netlify on X\n\n**Takeaways for anyone shipping side projects:**\n\n* domains are production infrastructure\n* auto-renew is not a guarantee!\n* coupling registrar with DNS and hosting is a **single point of failure**\n* monitor WHOIS/NXDOMAIN when renewal is coming up\n\nAlso, I **still** haven't heard back from anyone at Netlify as to why this happened. I think the form on their support page is likely broken. Also their AI support bot is completely useless.\n\n/rant",

I can’t really use Stripe because of their content restrictions, so I’m looking for alternatives and would really appreciate some advice from people who’ve actually integrated these in production. There's similar website/competitors with already implemented payment systems, so it's doable, but the ones I saw do not use normal payment processors like Stripe or so (i guess for this reason of being blocked or going against ToS)\n\n**Context:**\n\n* It’s a web app / site where users can pay or subscribe, but they do not pay for any nsfw content, the nsfw content its just shown on the website.\n* It may be considered NSFW or “high risk”.\n* There will be erotic/sexualized imagery (girls/guys, suggestive/erotic), but no explicit genitals (it could have explicit genitals sometimes but that will be moderated to prevent happening, but could happen), and nothing illegal or extreme.\n* Think “spicy / softcore” but still potentially flagged as adult by most platforms.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* A payment processor that:\n   * Explicitly allows (or at least tolerates) NSFW / adult-adjacent content.\n   * Has a clear policy so I don’t get randomly banned later.\n   * Offers a usable API/SDK for typical web stacks (JS/Node, etc.).\n   * Can handle one-time payments to start, possibly subscriptions later.\n* Bonus points if:\n   * They support EU-based businesses (I have a bit of confusion here, my company is an LLC in USA but the customers in EU). So I need EU-based business payment processor I understand?\n   * Payouts and KYC aren’t a nightmare.\n   * Fees are reasonable and documentation is solid.\n\nI’m not asking for legal advice, just real-world dev experiences and recommendations so I don’t build the whole flow on something that will kill the account as soon as traffic picks up.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers",

          "text": "Ohh i know all about this subject! As i built the same thing over a year ago. (I tried building websites for OF models for them to accept payments) heres what i learned, if youre in the US theres really only 3 payment processors u can use, CCBILL, Epoch, and segpay. (Others are garbage) Ccbill is the best as they take the lowest cut and even give u a percentage of per transaction of sales (sell them on ur idea during phone meeting), heres the kicker, visa and mastercard have a combined $1450 per year fee for “high risk” merchants the payment processors ccbill etc pass this fee to you. So in order to get started and get the api keys that payment is due upfront. They also monitor and vet the website they have moderators that require u give them backdoor access to paywalled content at all times and will periodically check to make sure nothing illegal is being upload or sold. If you are building a platform then YOU have to sign KYB and KYC if youre building this for a creator THEY fill out KYC and u would tell them to pay the fee. You will not beable to get payment processing without doing this for any nsfw content (ive tried trust me). If u want the closest thing with no $1450 fee u need to look for “crypto on ramping” (users pay with credit card its swapped for crypto in background.) this is the most uncensored and frictionless route u can take, but they still need the same kyb and kyc forms but they dont require viewing ur content with moderators after approval. (this is the route i took). \n\n\n\nP.S. you have to have systems in place for CSAM and bots signing up to your platform. You need legal forms for your privacy policy, record keeping, DMCA takedown act, etc. for website that has adult content and if creators are making money you must verify they are 18. Mastercard, visa do this for you when a user pays with a credit card as the info of them and their age is tied to the credit card (if not kyc form pops up for user) But if u have creators on ur platform it’s on YOU to verify they are 18. Failure to do that can get u in big trouble. They will ask you how you store all this info, how you will protect against people possibly uploading illegal content they wont approve you on “i will moderate it” if you don’t have auto safe guards in place at upload u wont get approved.",

Anything that appears underage even if not don’t allow them on your platform. Its not worth the hassle and all sex nudity content must be put behind a NSFW wall if not a Paywall. Automate this process with ai tools or services at upload. Moderation at scale isn’t one person reviewing images. It’s automated detection plus human review. Cloudflare offers free CSAM detection, and services like “Sightengine” “hivemoderation” can detect CSAM and flag minors, NSFW content and auto categorize before content gets posted to your site at scale. Alot of more loose Platforms use “safe harbor” as their advantage and why you might see them operating while hosting grey area content or even pirated content but youll notice none of them have payment processing only pron ads. Paid platforms have higher obligations than free tube sites, which is why payment processors require age verification, audit trails, and moderation systems before approval. If a verified creator uploads illegal content, they’re liable. If you allow uploads without verification and records, you are. “I’ll moderate” doesn’t scale and doesn’t protect you.",

In adult, things are very different though, and you may be expected to forward a user into a hosted page to make a sale rather than embed payments directly in-page. \n\nI would generally suggest you go with an all-in-one hostedpage solution. You will likely be best served by CCBill, Epoch, or Verotel. Based on your post, if API integration is important, you will likely want to start with CCBill. \n\nIf modern API integration is really important to you, you will need a merchant account, and you will need to onboard with a gateway like RocketGate, PrimeOrange, Segpay, Bill1st, etc. \n\nThe fees are going to be higher than you are likely comfortable with. There will be upfront fees, and there will also be ongoing fees, as well as ongoing compliance requirements. You will absolutely need an industry friendly lawyer.",

And rest assured that if you allow people to upload their content, they will 100% do their best to circumvent the rules in any possible way. As I said before, porn (*as well as crypto and gambling*) attract very bad people. You're playing with fire here. What if Stripe accepts you for a while, and then you get blocked? What will be your backup plan, once the payment processor stops working? It will be painful.\n\n>I'm a bit confused on what Stripe considers or flags as not authorized content on their service.\n\nTheir [policy](https://stripe.com/en-br/legal/restricted-businesses) about porn is pretty clear, in my opinion:\n\n* Pornography **and other mature audience content** (including literature, **imagery**, and other media) designed for the purpose of sexual gratification\n\nWill your site be accessible by minors? If my 11 years old son visits it, is there any form of check/prevention? Will you ask your audience if they're 18+, before accessing the pages?\n\nAlso, you said in your description that\n\n>There will be erotic/sexualized imagery\n\nWhich 100% falls under the \"other mature audience content\". It may or may not be designed for sexual gratification, sure, but how can you prove that? I mean, nowhere on Pornhub you find any \"*welcome to our masturbation platform*\", right? We just know what it is. And we already know that people will not be uploading NSFW images to your website \"for science\". There will be a bunch of pervs / weirdos that will basically upload/watch your stuff for sexual pleasure. As simple as that.\n\n*P.s. Did you consult a lawyer who knows about this stuff? Because going from softcore NSFW to bad/violent/pedo porn is something that can happen, and will most likely happen if the website gains some traction.*",

I opened up ChatGPT, explained the purpose and expected behavior as best I can, gave it the code for the original and the refactor, and showed it some sample usage and output.\n\nBefore it even had a chance to make a mistake with the technical detail, it gave me;\n\n```ts\n// for reference, `EnterExitPair` here only contains `enter` and `exit`, nothing more\nfunction someTestHelper(\n  traversalFn: TraversalFnType,\n  root: NodeType,\n  cases: EnterExitPair,\n) {\n  const result = traversalFn(root, {\n    ...cases,\n    enter: (node) => /*some tracking stuff*/,\n    exit: (node) => /*some more tracking stuff*/,\n  })\n}\n```\nEffectively guaranteeing that any non-trivial use of `someTestHelper` causes the test to fail because the provided cases will never run.\n\nIt's not like I didn't give it enough information or anything, this is just basic ES6 objects.\n\nThere are people out there building entire apps with this stuff. How on earth do they deal with these beginner mistakes littered throughout their code? Especially the non-developers who use LLMs for programming. Is the development cycle just \"ask for refactors until it works\"?\n\nAnyways, it just reminded me why I don't let LLMs write code.",

Therefore, you need to use those tools and such reinforcement-learned models. Also, tasks need to be specifically defined. You need to provide instructions with a highly rigid prompt, much like giving a task to a junior developer. However, note that this is \"how to make an LLM output working code,\" not \"how to make it output excellent code.\" This is because the reinforcement learning primarily considers \"can it write code that solves the task?\" and not \"what is the quality of the code?\" Furthermore, LLMs don't have the ability to \"think.\" This is a theoretical limitation. Therefore, it's better not to give them tasks that require thinking. In the case of difficult tasks like your example, we need to handle the \"thinking\" ourselves and only entrust the subsequent \"work\" to the LLM.",

Using LLMs like that early Copilot as an \"Assistant\" was truly their most appropriate application. But for product marketing, the current \"agent\" or \"automate everything\" approach probably gets a better reaction, unfortunately.\n\nMany people here mention agent tools, and while they certainly write code that solves problems, it's far from excellent code. And unlike the early inline suggestion Copilot, they often edit many lines at once, making the task of reviewing and fixing all of them even more painful. However, it's important to note that this perspective varies from person to person. While we might find such code intrusive, beginners might feel that having \"base code\" makes their work easier.

Giving the agent access to tools to lint and check browser console helps a bit but it won't be perfect. I have found this domain to be some of the hardest to get success with.\n\nHave you considered being very explicit with your context guidance, pointing the agent at what to take inspiration from? e.g. \"Read ./pages/users/admin.ts then create ./pages/articles/admin.ts that provides similar admin management but for pages, using the pages/ endpoint from ./openapi.json. See ./widgets for available frontend widgets\"? this avoids the agent getting stuck on a complex codebase that wastes context size, and helps it stay 'in line's with your codebase and standards. Might not even need large context docs (AGENTS.MD) if the code you point to clearly uses a well-known framework that the underlying LLM is expected to have been trained on.\n\nMaking the agentic problem into a \"do more like this but with new constraints XYZ\" type of problem seems to generalize well, in my experience, even for complex never-before-seen code and tasks (integrating a new JavaScript engine from Fabrice Bellard into a custom private game engine), as long as those tasks are based on a foundation that relies in 'knowledge' (C, JavaScript) that underlying LLMs are trained on.",

Give it an outline, references, etc so it can constantly correct itself. Most likely you use a combo of both. If you're concerned about privacy...most aren't and it is what it is, unfortunately. People tend to run agents on their local machine because it's more effective. The other recommendation is commiting to source control when the AI does well, because the next change could screw up so I am committing much more often even though the commits are less about a coherent unit of work, and more about checkpoints for each baby step or iteration.

I started a Laravel project to get my head around multitenancy under a few different situations. I actually started it several times because, didn't git.\n\nBut I started with Claude, just in the browser. I told it I was going to be using GeminiCLI and asked threw a basic plan in, I asked Claude to make a GEMINI.MD (overall project view), TECH.MD (the technologies to use, updated with notes as preferences/standards developed) and TODO.MD (the steps to take to achieve the goals) for GeminiCLI. Then I copy/paste that into the TODO, tell GeminiCLI that I've updated the TODO, it did the things and then I'd repeat the process over and over a few times until I had an established multitenant foundation.\n\nNow and then in between I use ChatGPT as somewhat of an rubber duck, basically just trying to get ideas out of my head in a more coherent manner.\n\nBut that Claude > Gemini loop has been pretty good.. Today anyway.\n\nI don't pay for a single one, so it's all with the free tier. I hit the Gemini3 limit, but decided to call it a day before I hit the flash preview limit.\n\nThere was still a fair bit of manual coding/editing. Removing duplicate class imports, importing missing classes, basic error reading/resolving and CSS styling (that's just easier to do than explain/request).\n\nI would imagine that when/if the project grew, it'd have to become quite single feature focused do to the growth in context. But to get to where I wanted to be today, it was faster than me doing it manually. And the code was well commented (which I asked for), so I was able to go in and really follow what was/is going on.\n\nThe only reason I went Claude (browser) > GeminiCLI was the free aspect. I was going to throw some dollars at ClaudeCode, but recently I've seen a lot of unhappy usage-related complaints and odd happenings. I also don't want to become too reliant on either platform. As it was today I still manually wrote and ran tests, and that felt quite disconnected from the guts of everything.",

You have to know the high level concepts, what it should look like, what it should be doing and what it shouldn't be doing. Additionally there's a cost both literally in money and in missed experience. I've more or less decided to specialize in frontend development so I'm not super pressed about learning backend which is good because I don't learn shit using LLM's to generate code which makes sense but is worth calling out because of how often I've seen Jr. devs use AI/how often I see people recommend that they do.

In the given example why not allow an order without items.. ensure that order Total is a 0$ instead of a null and im feeling good.   \n\n\nBut let's say I did care about no items in an order. I'd do my best to ensure that such data was encountered by developers. Like, ensure that there's no bad data in production..and fill dev databases with tonnes of bad data lol. All those edge cases \"that will never happen\" I go out of my way to make sure they'll happen. If im really motivated I might so unit tests.\n\n\nThe code should be resilient to bad data and you need to test for that. When possible too im picking tech choices that make it syntactically obvious. So the problem ro me isnt that there's a lack of order items its that the page blows up when that happens. So something was null instead an array. Someone assumed the first item will always exist. With things like c# non-nullable types or typescript definitions you can ensure that is a syntax error instead of a run time explosion \n\n\nAnyways that's the vibe I get when thinking about the hypothetical ",

You've walked face-first into this meme. https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/s/a4fsoSM3KY\n\nAs many others are saying, senior devs don't think about coding this way. Most of them have gone through this phase and learned the hard way that premature abstraction is the root of all evil. That's typically true whether you're doing the abstracting (many design patterns) or whether you're letting a library or framework do the abstracting for you.\n\nThat said, I don't know if there's a faster path to becoming a senior dev than learning this lesson the hard way.  The best way to get a good intuition for identifying the right tools for the job are to build a bunch of different things and get it wrong each time in different ways and learn from those mistakes.\n\nSometimes you overengineer and regret it.  \nOther times you underengineer and regret it.\n\nSometimes you build the right thing, but you build it in the wrong way.  \nOther times you build the wrong thing entirely.  It may be the most elegant code ever written and no one will care if it isn't solving a real problem.\n\nSometimes you build the right thing 2 years too early.  \nSometimes you build it 6 months too late.\n\nA senior engineer has been involved in rewrites or pivots that have worked.  \nThey've also been involved in rewrites or pivots that have failed so hard the plans were abandoned and the old version was revived.\n\nOne becomes a senior engineer by actively learning from those experiences and designing future projects to replicate successes and avoid making mistakes you've made (or seen others make) before.\n\n---\n\nAs far as tells, senior engineers know how much they don't know.\nYou'll hear them say that they aren't experts and then ask deep technical questions that seem to show the expertise they claim to not have.  It's not imposter syndrome.  It's knowing that there are multiple levels of expertise and knowing they aren't yet on the final rung.\n\nThey'll tell you that software estimates are effectively impossible and a fools errand, and yet somehow, their ballpark gut-check, napkin math estimates are often shockingly accurate.\n\nThe best kept open secret is that senior engineers don't stop making mistakes.  Instead, they cultivate processes where mistakes are identified and learned from as early as possible in a very tight dev loop.",

First, \"senior\" means wildly different things from company to company. You can land senior in some organizations purely on YOE alone. Others need more regimented demonstration of skills. \n\nAlso, its understandable when you're first starting out, cramming your head full of challenging information, to believe that seniors are merely engineers who have already crammed their head full of information. That's not the case at all. Especially as it relates to frameworks or libraries. \n\nAlso also, keep in mind that \"senior\" is barely past the halfway point (Level 4 out of 7) in many organizations. It is nowhere near the \"top brass.\"\n\nWith all that, seniors can operate autonomously when given a large project and execute on nearly everything, but it's about this stage where they start thinking collaboratively instead of independently. Coding with others is an entirely different skill set. \n\nThe signs to look for that someone knows their shit is humility and maturity in their approach and attitude. Seniors have crossed that threshold of understanding just how much they don't understand, and are comfortable with what they know and what they don't. \n\nSeniors are better at planning because they have a better grasp on operational realities of delivering a product. They understand their role as delivering a product, not delivering \"perfect\" code. \n\nIn other words, the \"this person knows\" moment isn't putting your memorization on display. Anyone can get familiar with a library or design pattern. Its putting your battle scars on display, by taking a measured, thoughtful approach to clarifying requirements before any coding starts. Because what they _know_ is how products fail.",
