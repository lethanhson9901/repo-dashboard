      "text": "I've been feeling a bit uneasy over the past week watching the market plummet due to Anthropic and reading Dario Amodei say that within six months, models will do everything developers do. But I've realized, based on what I've seen, we're getting the definition wrong.\n\nClaude Cowork isn't \"intelligent,\" it's an algorithmic prediction engine. It's an orchestrator that needs constant maintenance and management, just like when computing arrived in businesses in the 70s and suddenly entire IT departments were needed that didn't even exist before.\n\nIn the end, this is literally like a compass or Excel. They're democratizing tools. A compass is cheap. Google Sheets is practically free. Nobody hires a \"compass expert\"; you hire a captain who knows how to navigate and uses the compass to avoid getting lost. The same thing will happen with this: a generic \"AI profile\" won't replace us. Instead, experts in each field (finance professionals, designers, or developers like us in music-tech) will have to manage that prediction, because it's a **PREDICTIVE TOOL**. Nobody titles their Excel profile \"Excel Expert.\" Excel doesn't make business decisions in your area just because it has macros, and this AI-powered system isn't going to create a complex and meaningful workflow without an expert to validate whether the direction in the business area it's helping is the right one.\n\nI think that's a good example. Does anyone see any problem with this reasoning?\n\nI don't buy into the \"end-to-end\" panic. I see a future focused on developing the skills of being the kind of worker who knows how to manage the tool. In the future, LinkedIn won't be full of \"AI Specialists,\" but rather people who know how to apply prediction in their industry.  It’s more work, not less, and someone has to be at the helm because prediction without governance is useless.\n\nLet me know what you think of this reflection :)",

But I expect that's temporary though - quarters come and go and at the end of the day, sh\\*t still needs to get done, competitively. OP's Excel example is very astute. I'm sure when electronic spreadsheets came out, people thought they'll massacre the workforce on desktop calculators and literal paper \"spread sheets\".\n\nAnd yet there's now more people on Excel than there ever were on desk calculators. Our expectations simply insta-rose and new use cases emerged leveraging the new capability. And sure, some trivial tasks that used to be done by hand and be worth money for that labor, had been made worthless. Yet there are other tasks & careers infinitely more advanced (like finance analysts & quants writing Excel programs linked direct to data feeds and trading platforms) that are worth $500K/yr and more that were simply unfathomable with the old desktop calculators.",

It doesn't mean conscious or alive. Also words that are difficult to define, but in intelligent systems, anything is intelligent if it acts intelligently, ie it does what it does more efficiently than trial and error would, on average, where there is no simple mathematical relationship that circumvents the need for intelligent solutions. This can include discovering new mathematical relationships, if you want to get all recursive about it. \n\nLLMs are soft AI, they are basically a more complicated parameter optimisation algorithm, like a linear regression equation. They act intelligently. Consciousness is called hard AI, and that is beyond our comprehension at this time. The mind is more like a set of parameter optimisation algorithms have evolved in tandem on a nueral network, which is by definition incomprehensible and irreducible, and itself connected to a series of sensory inputs, such that the total appears to exceed the sum of its parts. It is emergent, and not just through the \"programming,\" but through the forms and composition of the structure of the brain (and therefore the body) itself. Fascinating.",

The models use weights to relations to apply inference - exactly like our neurons work.\n\nRemember: these models already passed the Turing test. *Years* ago. We literally cannot tell them apart from humans. This boils down to a philosophical question of sentience and consciousness. We don’t have good definitions for what that is. Ultimately, if these models are indistinguishable from humans, I don’t see how you can dismiss them as fundamentally different. I think it’s more accurate to classify sentience as a continuum of some kind, and that every day, these models move further along that line.

Yes, I program by thinking about patterns; my memory and my strength guide me to find similar solutions based on my experience. The predictions of current LLMs are so good that they cover practically every domain and path already programmed in the past. Google used to seem like a job hack: you found the solution and implemented it Stack Overflow was exactly the same.\n\nMy lowest salary was when I was just a \"programmer.\" But when we move into the business world, we start earning more money, but because we \"think,\" and we get paid precisely for thinking ahead.\n\nLow-code and no-code have existed for many years. But the real money isn't there; the money is in being ahead of the curve, thinking about the minimum necessary adjustments, competing with those who know the local domain. The real money is in approaching the person in charge to take control. Having a coffee and listening to their problems. To understand, as a human being, what those who buy what you solve in their company want. Human domains are human, with their own needs. Algorithmic prediction is what we do when we program boring problems, problems that low-code and no-code mastered years ago. This prediction goes further, because it predicts complex architectures and structures. That's not human intelligence.\n\nFor example, Claude Code solves the problems I need to implement, but what comes first? A prompt. An indication from someone real who knows the domain of the next thing that competes with the cutting edge. LLM training can't be in that area of ​​the business because it's a trade secret. So, can my boss write a prompt and not hire me? Absolutely not. It's not the prompt; it's deployment, it's monitoring, it's getting into the nitty-gritty, it's being in control of the governance of this problem I'm solving, it's communicating a result in a meeting. My boss already has enough on his plate closing deals and funding rounds using predictive inference. In fact, could I take my job away from my boss because now, with predictive generation, I have a knack for business solutions? Absolutely not.",

They're not intelligent the same way us humans are.\n\nI get your point, and I agree that most people think that AIs are intelligent. While you can argue that from the surface, they are intelligent: I mean, ask someone any question, then ask the same question to an AI. If both of them got the same correct answer, then why would you think that one is intelligent and not the other one?\n\nBut of course, in the way this intelligence is done, it's not really a cognitive neural network (like our brains) doing all the thinking. It's just data predictions. But if the results are the same, how could you distinguish between the two?",

This ‘tool’ can not only provide some specific utility, but also apply it in practice, i.e., show the way and navigate the optimal route, fill in the spreadsheet, decide what to compute and how, etc.\n2. There are compelling neuroscientific theories which explain human cognition and specifically decision-making in terms of predictive probability models (e.g. predictive coding by Karl Friston and others), also known as Bayesian approaches to brain function.\n3. Even if these tools required similar managers, I fail to see objective support for the quantitative similarity. In other words, instead of naval captains, office workers, and IT departments, these may quite possibly function well enough with one COO (or some logistics executive), one CFO, or one CTO respectively.\n\nI don't hold my breath for the bombastic claims of professional corporate liars akin to Musk or Altman whose primary objective is to generate and maintain the hype, but I wouldn't be so optimistic about the purpose of humans in the intellectual workplace – least of all in web development, which was already oversaturated years ago.",

Biological predictive processing isn't just prediction in isolation, it's prediction grounded in survival, action, and real consequences in the world. Friston's active inference specifically emphasizes that organisms don't just passively predict, they act to bring the world in line with their predictions. LLMs don't have that. No stakes, no body, no feedback loop with reality.\n\nBut here's where I'd push back: the conclusion you draw from that gap doesn't quite follow. \"Just prediction without embodiment\" still produced something that passes bar exams, writes production code, and reasons through novel problems. Underselling the mechanism doesn't make the outputs less real.\n\nAnd more importantly the gap you're describing is the current limitation, not a permanent ceiling. We're already moving toward agentic systems that act, receive feedback, and update from consequences. The disembodiment problem is an engineering challenge more than a philosophical one. ",

AI as a “predictive tool” still means that one expert + ai outperforms a team of 5 without it.

But the pool shrinks.\nSo don’t get comfortable with “AI is just a tool”, build stuff, ship projects, have side income streams… the people who will do well aren’t the ones debating definitions, they’re the ones already using this leverage to build things that make money. The barrier to entry for everything just got way lower, which means competition goes way up.\nNot doom and gloom. just the reality that expert + ai is a smaller workforce than what we have now, and positioning yourself on the right side of that equation takes action, not just framing.",

          "text": "To me the comments on this thread read like there's a fair bit of cope and misunderstanding of where the current bleeding edge models are at. They can synthesize novel answers that are not as such in the training data; and while they can not replace white collar workers, they can perform a subset of e.g. remote work tasks successfully.\n\nAt the moment, they are a force multiplier. Good use of these tools lets people do their work more effectively (bad use might do the opposite). This matters quite a bit in the sense that it forces people to learn to use them and people who can't keep up may face unemployment.\n\nI don't know what \"predictive tool\" really entails. LLMs can capture logical patterns in the data that allow them to construct answers based on logical relationships and the model topology rather than simplistically parsing together parts from the training data to a semi-cohesive whole.\n\nOne thing about this just really is the pace of advancement. The kind of benchmarks that AI researchers 5 years ago would have considered as something that AIs can't get good scores in for many decades to come, are now fairly easy to the bleeding edge models. Benchmarks that have been specifically designed to be hard have had massive improvements in them - like Humanity's Last Exam. AIs can answer highly technical and difficult questions based on modern research at a level higher than any human could - even when not allowed to use external tools like googling.\n\nBenchmarks trying to measure success rate in difficult, high complexity remote work tasks are still scored low in by these tools, but the scores are constantly improving and there's no sign at the moment that this improvement slowed down. If anything, the pace of improvement seems exponential; if that is the case, then we really are looking at really massive practical improvements by the end of the year.\n\nMy own worry really is that the combination of actual concrete impact with the perceptions that businesses have to this, means pretty drastic changes in knowledge work industries and those changes can be economically disruptive to the point of triggering kind of a domino effect in the wider economy. Let's say, if out of a million people, you suddenly have several thousand accountants, lawyers, programmers, etc, unemployed - whether for a good reason or not - then those people are suddenly going much less to restaurants and to barbers, they push back renovation plans, and the tax revenue from their income dies down. Even if the majority of white collar workers continue as before, it's enough that a large enough minority are affected that the end-effect is close-to catastrophic.",

          "text": "An interesting train of thought.  What I often reflect on is the difference between prediction and true intelligence and how much of what the human brain does might actually be the former even though we think of it as the latter.\n\nImagine you could make a perfect predictor of a person.  You could give that predictor a problem and it would predict, correctly, the answer.  It actually did solve the problem in giving the answer.  I could then make an iterative step, so use the engine to predict how a human would plan a task then predict what they would do to execute each step, predict how success of each step is evaluated and how the plan adapts as a result, etc.  This is basically what modern AI does.\n\nSo then you might say that it is impossible to make said predictor perfect.  If you give the predictor a problem which requires genuine intelligence to solve a predictor would not be able to predict the answer.  It would just be wrong.  I would agree with this.\n\nBut then when you look at what AI does it actually does solve problems which we would think of as requiring intelligence.  AI has done genuine maths research and advanced the sum of human knowledge.  All by essentially predicting the answer to questions, then feeding the results into more predictions.\n\nAI is also capable of predicting logic and reasoning in the same way.  It is not perfect, but if I picked a random person on the street AI would do well against them in logic problems.\n\nWe know how AI works and we know that it just predicts things.  So why is it so hard to find a simple task which clearly demonstrates human intelligence vs prediction by showing something AI just cannot solve no matter how good it is?  What does that say about humans?  Are we just good predictors too?  Is there any such thing as true intelligence?",

Made a simple app for uploading and displaying charts and data with filters and such. \n\nIt worked, sort of. I went back and inspected the code it had written and dear god it looked like something I had written when I first started coding:\n\nThe view functions were massive, like 800+ lines of code for a single function, and while many shared the same logic, it had duplicated it instead of refactoring it out into helper functions. All the js and css was scattered throughout the html, and again duplicate logic with functions sometimes doing the same thing but named slightly differently.\n\nI think I spent more time trying to debug and refactor it into something that was halfway decent and maintainable than if I would have built it from scratch. \n\nThese people live in a bubble, and can’t see the forest through the trees. Anyone can build an app, but building is only part of the process. I will admit that it has boosted my productivity, but maybe 10%? 15% max, not even close to the claims I’ve seen made.\n\nI fear that we are going to see more and more apps like the one described above built by people who have no idea how they work.

Recently I asked my CTO to look up a test that he made, after the code I wrote broke it and the fix I applied didn't solve it. Later, he literally copypasted a Claude answer and didn't elaborate. Went to look what the agent suggested - sure, the code was fixed in backend, but the frontend app would be broken in some cases because of the arbitrary choices Claude made and he didn't fact-check. I spent literally 10 minutes to make a fix that can solve the test and show all the data in frontend. I just had to sit down and read some of the code with a decent IDE.\n\nWe need to learn these tools, sure... to recognize them as a concurring reason for sloppy work.",

Also, make sure your monitor is below or at the same height as your eyes. Screens in a higher level force a larger area of your eyes to be open (sounds dumb but I’ve noticed a difference).",

I know it’s very hard but it’s doable (I’m mostly recovering from it myself so I know how bad it can get). \n\nWhat worked for me was better sleep. Going to bed late made me very unproductive the next day which made me go to bed even later and that made a terrible feedback loop. So before anything else, force yourself to sleep and wake up early. \n\nAlso, make very small objectives out of the big objective. Set up small goals you can realistically achieve. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAnother thing I did was creating a Productive focus mode on my phone and computer where all notifications (except for immediate family members) are totally silenced. I work 50 minutes nonstop full focus followed by a 10 minute break. \n\nWhat also helped me a lot was moving my work desk from my bedroom out into a brighter part of the flat. Like this I work in a much brighter space so I don’t get sleepy or drowsy or bored as fast. Also, you shouldn’t sleep where you work and you shouldn’t work where you sleep. \n\nOther than that, waking up early morning, going for quick short walks, and doing some very light exercise has definitely helped as well. Out of all these, I would say regulate your sleep before anything else.",

I wonder what it is - is it that the AI agents don't seem to get tired or need time to reflect and just keep pushing feature after feature once you give them a finger, they seem to want to build the whole body from it.\n\n  \nAND tbh. i am currently working in wine industry, and it's LITERALLY the same.

Many times brain fog comes from monotony, so make sure you’re not ignoring rest and leisure. Also, workout daily and hydrate. Workout boosts your brain and hydration is fundamental. Avoid junk food and eat enough protein. These sound like generic tips but man do they make a change when you make them your routine.\n\nAlso, make sure you mix a boring but needed task with a rewarding one every day. Doing work that you must but hate can make you feel like trash. If you feel you can’t force yourself to work on something and have time margin, literally do something else that is engaging and do what you have to do later.

Also as a bank it's super important for us for some fucking reason that users stay on our app more of their walking hours as if attention is our business model not being a fucking bank. Super cool! Oh and the online support? Let's build a chatbot that helps nobody instead! Don't you look forward to during all of our asian branch? We're also downsizing our teams cos AI helped you become more productive so guess who gets to do increasingly more work for the same pay but double the stress? You do!

In the last year alone, the platform I developed generated over $15k in revenue for him. It’s stable, fast, and it clearly converts.\n\nAnnual renewal for hosting and maintenance (just a few hundred bucks) came up, and he asked for a quote for a full rebranding. His exact words were:\n\"I only need to change texts. If you charge me too much, I’m going back to Wix.\". Clearly it is not only a text change but a complete renewal keeping only the same colors ignoring the UX adjustments, SEO migration, and the actual value of a rebranding.\n\nHonestly, the stress has accumulated to the point where I just want to let him go. If he thinks Wix is so great, let him deal with it. But here’s my dilemma: I don't want to just \"hand over\" all the custom logic and hard work I put into this platform for pennies, especially after this level of disrespect.\n\nWhat should I do? Just hand over the keys and walk away for my own mental health? Do I \"strip\" the custom proprietary logic before he migrates (since he only paid for the service, not the full IP of my custom code)? How do I protect my work without being \"the bad guy,\" while making sure he realizes that moving to Wix means losing everything I built for him?\n\nI’m tired.\n\nEDIT: There is no written contract, only an invoice for \"site development\"\n\nEDIT2: I clarified that my work generated revenue to point out that the funds to pay me are definitely there, my intention wasn't to reproach him or ask for more money",

Source code is typically written by a human being using a computer programming language, such as Java, C, or C++. By contrast, HTML is frequently generated by automated website design software. You can register HTML as a literary work if it was created by a human being, not a website design program, and if it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression. To register HTML, you must submit a complete copy of the entire code; you cannot submit an isolated portion of the code using the options discussed below.

It is frequently generated by automated website design software. HTML establishes the format and layout of the content that appears on a particular web page by instructing the user’s browser to \r\npresent that content in a specified manner. If you want to register content that has been posted on a website, you should submit the content in the form in which it appears on the actual website. There is no reason to submit the HTML code for that site unless you specifically want to register the human-written portions of the HTML itself and any website text that is embedded within the HTML. A registration for HTML will not cover any formatting and layout that may be dictated by the HTML or style sheets. Nor will it cover any audio, visual, or audiovisual content that may appear on a website and is not perceptible in the HTML. HTML may be registered as a literary work only if it was created by a human being and it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.  \n\n(copyright.gov)\n\nSo even if OP were to claim copyright, they would have to claim the _whole_ code, not just parts or their \"custom code\", and also have to prove the written HTML contains sufficient amount of creative expression.

It gets a bit less clear when dealing with source code that may not be part of the final \"deliverable\" (website, etc); in theory, the client doesn't automatically have any right to that, but in practice it very well may be implied as part of the final product they paid for, such as any backend CMS type stuff.\n\nOne thing you want to be very careful with is when you are acting as a host for their site and deciding to withhold access to it during a dispute.  This is more frequently a concern for an MSP or someone else that has \"keys to the kingdom\" type admin access to actual business data (admin logins, DNS, etc) needed to function, but it's not often hard for a website with potential privileged information or revenue generation (like client contact info, user logins, e-store, etc) to get lumped into that.\n\nThat doesn't mean you are obligated to host their site, but you can't really deny them access to it while also taking it offline without a really strong contract or legal advice in place.  \n\nIn your case, I would suggest handing over whatever the original deliverable was (website you developed), including the most recent copy of whatever data is currently live.  Basically, provide them with the data they need to set the site up on their own hosting service.  Feel free to offer to help migrate it at your normal hourly rate if you'd like.\n\nDefinitely don't act like a jilted ex trying to claim ownership over some random shit (site source code) simply because you're upset.",

Unless you are a true employee, by default programming code copywrite belongs to whomever wrote it.\n\nThe client possibly has a claim to the 'visual' portion of the website but not the underlying code.  Which would allow the client to rewrite the website in WIX.\n\nThat is why it is so critical that if you ever contract out to someone to write code for you that your contract includes a transfer of copywrite.\n\nA non-coding example.

They can't operate at a loss forever, so it was only a matter of time before they found ways to make some profit off their free tier. This looks like the first step in that direction.\n\nSure, chats and personal details are \"private\", but if they ever decided to sell that data, I'm sure they could find a loophole in their own privacy policy. Even if \"they\" don't sell it, they can always get *hacked*.\n\nLet me show you how it's not just a conspiracy theory but a matter of time (I know this sounded a lot like AI, but this is all me I swear)\n\nRemember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?\n\nThat facebook quiz app harvested profile information from about 87 million people, including posts that were set to friends-only. That data was then sold to campaigns (like Trump's) to create \"psychographic profiles\" of potential voters. \n\nThey made ~$16M from it. 5.9M of which came from Trump, which may or may not have helped him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe facebook data of those 87 million people is **nothing**, compared to what people share with chatgpt. With facebook, even if your posts were set to friends-only, you were still \"choosing\" to show that content to other people. Whereas I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to see even your smartest question to chatgpt, lol\n\nNow compare that, to the sheer volume of information chatgpt has on its 190 million daily active users. Even if you and me are not, there are people out there using it as a friend, a business partner, a mentor or even more. The \"profiling\" that could be built from what chatgpt knows about us would be significantly more valuable (and dangerous)than a few old facebook posts.\n\nI don't think ANY single person, company, or even government should possess this level of intimate data on hundreds of millions of people. It's too much power for anyone to hold, regardless of their current mission statement or privacy policy. This is a massive SPOF risk, and if it isn't yet, it (OpenAI) will be the biggest target in a similar future scenario, whether for an election campaign or just an ad company going rogue.",

We tend to treat it as purely negative, but what if you flip the framing?\n\nIf coding models keep getting exponentially better, the technical debt you take on today becomes cheaper to pay off tomorrow. You ship fast now, accumulate some mess, and in six months the tools to clean it up are dramatically better than they are today. I'm not saying this is definitely the right approach, you can obviously go too far with it. But it's worth considering that the cost of paying down AI-generated tech debt might drop fast enough that taking it on aggressively today is actually a reasonable bet.",

I’m curious to know how other people respond to this.\n\n\\*\\*edit\\*\\* I’m getting a lot of generic responses, to which I appreciate, but that wasn’t what I was hoping for. So let me clarify with a little role play.\n\nPretend I’m the potential client and you’re the developer, and you really gotta make this sale because you spent all your rent on a box of expired boner pills you found on Craigslist that was to good to pass up.\n\nI hit you with a classic “I can do it myself with ai” or “my nephews good with computers” etc, etc. Based on many of the responses here people are suggesting things like“fine, do it yourself bitch and see what happens.”\n\nRemember, you just bought those boner pills and they can’t be returned.

          "text": "*This is a long post, but it's a master class in client relations, I promise you'll get something out of this.*\n\nOkay, most people in here are approaching this from a combative perspective or fear-inducing perspective \"What if it breaks?\" \"How will you update it?\". \n\nSome of y'all have never worked with clients and it shows. Neither of those approaches will ever actually land you clients.\n\nThis is an obvious client education opportunity. The idea is to educate them and reveal what the real process is and do it as humbly and tactfully as possible so they don't feel dumb.\n\nFrom the client's perspective they are thinking \"I can just jump in ChatGPT for an hour or two and bang out a website\". Our goal in the response is to acknowledge that they can indeed use AI to build a website, but subtly explain that it's more than just running a few prompts in ChatGPT.\n\nThis serves a couple purposes: it makes them realize \"Oh this is actually much more of a process and involves more work than I realized\" and it also makes them realize \"Wow these guys know their stuff\". You're essentially educating and selling them at the same time without them realizing it.\n\nOkay, all that sounds cool, but what does it look like in practice, here's an email you can modify to fit your agency:\n\n\"Hey \\[Name\\],\n\nTotally fair question and honestly, you're right. You can use AI to build a website. We use AI in our process too, so I'm not here to tell you it's smoke and mirrors.\n\nBut I think it's worth being real about what \"using AI to build a website\" actually looks like in practice, because it's pretty different from how it gets talked about.\n\nHere's what actually goes into it:\n\nBefore you ever open an AI tool, someone has to figure out who the site is for, what it needs to say, and what it needs to do. That means understanding your customers, your positioning, and what makes you different from everyone else in your space. AI can help you execute on that, but it can't figure it out for you.\n\nThen there's the copy. AI can write, but it writes generically unless it's given strong direction. Someone still has to know what story your business is telling, what tone matches your brand, and whether the output is actually good or just grammatically correct.\n\nThen design. Then development. Then making sure it loads fast, shows up in search, works on every device, and doesn't break when someone actually tries to use it.\n\nAnd once it's live, a website isn't really done. It needs to be updated, monitored, and adjusted based on how people are actually using it.\n\nNone of that is impossible to do yourself, but it's not a couple of prompts and a launch either. The people getting real results with AI are the ones who know enough about strategy, design, and development to direct it well and catch it when it's wrong.\n\nThere's also something that tends to get overlooked: when you're deep in the day-to-day of running your business, it's really hard to see it from the outside. One of the most valuable things we do early in a project is sit down with clients and just ask questions, the kind a business consultant might ask. And almost every time, that process surfaces things the client hadn't thought to put on their website, messaging angles they'd never considered, or assumptions about their customers that turn out to be wrong. You know your business better than anyone, but that familiarity can also create blind spots. A fresh set of eyes with the right framework tends to find things you can't see from the inside.\n\nI think about it this way: you're probably great at what you do because you've spent years getting good at it. You've built up knowledge, instincts, and judgment that someone couldn't just pick up in an afternoon. We're the same way about web design and development. We're going to be more rigorous, more strategic, and bring ideas to the table that wouldn't come from a few hours with an AI tool, not because the tools aren't powerful, but because knowing how to use them well is its own skill set built over years of doing this work.\n\nThat's really what you're paying for when you work with an agency, not the tools, but the judgment behind them.\n\nHappy to chat more about what that could look like for your project if it's useful.\n\nBest,\n\n\\[Your name\\]\"\n\nThis does a few things: gracefully gives them an opportunity to reach out to you to learn more after all of that education. It reveals what is actually involved in the process of web design and the value of each part of the process. It shows that you know EXACTLY what you are doing. You relate it to their business and expertise and explain you have the same expertise in this field without outright saying \"I have experience doing this and you don't\". You're also talking to them like a human, you're not corporate BSing them, you're being real with them but in a tactful and tasteful way.\n\nTelling clients they are wrong is an absolute art that very few know how to pull off where it turns into the client trusting you MORE not less.",

Even when they sign they are often bad to work with - micro-managing and tight with their funds.\n\nLook for businesses who are stretched for time and desperate for what you're selling. Your clients should not be spending their own money, they should be employees at a company with the authority to spend a budget to solve a problem, and for which there are consequences if they do not solve it. Successful or fast growing businesses make much better clients as they have more money than time and will pay well to solve problems.\n\nIf you talk to 100 prospects and nobody wants what you're selling, change up what you're offering. Take a few for coffee and ask what their biggest problem in business is. Focus on the benefits not the features (\"10 new leads a month\" vs \"a great looking website\"). Are you a \"vitamin\" or a \"painkiller\"? That is, if you stop taking a vitamin pill there are no immediate consequences, but skipping a painkiller is something you'll feel right away.\n\nIn my business we sell subscriptions to companies that are in the 5-6 figure range, where we solve a very specific problem. The more specific we have gotten about the problem we are solving, the easier it has been to sell, and the more people will pay. It has taken a number of years to find that problem, and we can still refine it further. We do not speak to companies with less than 50 employees.\n\nI often speak to people who aren't at the point they need us or they don't see the value yet, to which the answer is \"thank you for your time, here's a problem I think you might run into as you scale... when you need help solving it, you know where to find us.\" Treat them with respect, leave them with a clear value prop, and sometimes they'll come back - maybe a year or two later - or more often we get people they refer to us.",

Well, I'd bought the cheap package, but google hadn't told me I'd need a bigger one, so I upgraded, then I tried to install WordPress and I got stuck! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, more reading, more trying stuff and messing it up, a week passes! HOW DISAPPOINTING! In the end I got WordPress installed, then I tried making a site. So you know how things like iPhones are easy to use because Steve Jobs used to walk around offices shouting THIS ISN'T EASY ENOUGH well nobody did that with WordPress and.. well.. I nearly LOST MY MIND! Then I installed elementor, and things got a bit easier, so I managed to get a site together... 6 WEEKS SO FAR.... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I get my site up and running thinking I'll GET LOADS OF VISITORS.... but I don't! I get NONE... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So more googling, and I found out that there's this thing called PageSpeed Insights, which gives an idea of how good your site is for visitors, so I run my site and... tell you what... it was LIKE A KICK IN THE NUTS! EVERYTHING WAS RED and I had this HUGE LIST OF \"OPPORTUNITIES\"... HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I start fixing them, but there's some things I can't fix, and I'm going \"Why's this still really bad? What am I doing wrong\" so more googling more working out, then I FIND OUT IT'S ELEMENTOR! HOW DISAPPOINTING! That thing that made it easy, that's gone and screwed me downstream!!! So I find out to move away from elementor I've got to redo EVERY PAGE ON MY WEBSITE! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So I do that, I pass my core web vitals, I think \"BRING ON THE VISITORS!\"... and all I hear is the sound of crickets chirping and STILL NO VISITORS, HOW DISAPPOINTING! Then I find out about SEO, and like some of it's OK, it involves me doing things to my site, so I'll do that first (because I can) see how it goes. So I REWORK ALL MY SITE'S PAGES. AGAIN. This time optimising titles and meta and doing a bit of schema (don't get me started on that, that was a WHOLE WORLD OF PAIN!), and I check to see if it's made any difference to like ACTUALLY GETTING VISITORS. I DON'T!!! AGAIN!!! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!! So then I find out about backlinks and I need some, right, for SEO, so I do a load of backlinky stuff like what's said on the forums and that... did it work? IT DID NOT! HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!! See it turns out there's backlinks and there's BACKLINKS and the ones that work are like, well, pretty hard to get and you need to be able to tell the difference between the backlinks and the BACKLINKS because there are these people on fiverr that will sell you backlinks THAT DO NOTHING for a LOAD OF MONEY! HOW DISAPPOINTING! So then I find out it's really hard to get the GOOD BACKLINKS so I end up getting an SEO agency to do that. Then... when NOTHING HAPPENS AGAIN I find out there are a lot of crooks in SEO world so I have to make like 50ish phone calls just to FIND SOMEONE NORMAL THAT DOES ACTUALLY DO SEO. The good news is, I now get visitors. The difference between that, and what happens now with AI, is that you get to speak to some robot that talks down to you says things you then need to go off and google anyway (so you might as well be doing that in the first place) completely breaks everything and when you ask it \"why did you tell met to do that it broke everything?\" It says \"You're right, that will break everything\".... (wait for it)... HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!!\n\nDon't be repeatedly disappointed, let me make your website, and I'll be disappointed on your behalf and cut to the \"you get visitors part\" in a couple of weeks instead of a couple of YEARS!",

It's unbelievable, but 2 out of 5 clients have a cousin or a brother-in-law (it's always cousins and brothers-in-law, never a brother or a friend) who are \"experts\" in the field and will do it for the client for free.\n\nI always focus on what I can do that their relative can't. In the case of AI, you could drop something like: \"Well, if you want a generic website, to be dependent on a platform that might raise its prices tomorrow, and to be left completely on your own when a problem arises, then sure, use AI.\"\n\nIn my services, I offer website redesigns (because I usually focus on fixing crappy websites for businesses making over €300,000 a year), including the Figma UI kit so others can maintain it, and the HTML/CSS/JS code. I no longer offer backend because I'm focusing on edge computing with Cloudflare Workers, plus hosting, always trying to find the simplest and cheapest solution for the client to maintain.\n\nDepending on what you offer and what the client currently has (if they already have a website and it's a disaster, if the design is super outdated, or if technically they could save money or stop using prehistoric tech, and yes, I'm looking at you, jQuery), you hit them with the second part: \"I am offering you this, this, and this, which is something no AI or brother-in-law is ever going to give you.\"\n\nI don't have the best conversion rates in these situations, because at the end of the day, clients in Spain tend to be stubborn. They believe AI will do everything even if I tell them otherwise, or they go to another professional because they get offended when you tell it to them straight. But hey, at least you get it off your chest.\n\n\\---   \nI'm leaving the original message in Spanish here so you can verify that I'm not a bot, which has been believed more than once on r/copypasta:\n\nYo trabajo en España (y soy español, estoy traduciendo este mensaje al inglés con IA, que nadie me mate por favor), y más que la de la IA, te encuentras la de \"mi familiar lo hace más barato\". Es increíble, pero 2 de cada 5 clientes tiene un primo o cuñado (solo son primos y cuñados, nunca es un hermano o amigo) que son expertos en el tema y se lo hacen gratis al cliente.\n\nYo siempre me enfoco en lo que hago, y lo que su familiar no. En el caso de la IA, podrías soltarte algo como; \"bueno, si quieres una web genérica, tener dependencia de una plataforma que puede subir los precios mañana, y estar solo cuando te surja un problema, entonces si, usa IA.\"\n\nYo en mis servicios ofrezco el rediseño de web (porque usualmente me enfoco en arreglar las webs pestosas con negocios que facturan +300,000€ al año), con el ui kit en figma para que puedan mantenerlo otros, el código en html/css/js, ya no ofrezco backend porque me estoy enfocando en el edge computing \\[no se si he escrito bien ek termino\\] con los workers de cloudflare, y hosting, intentando buscar la solución más sencilla y barata de mantener para el cliente.\n\nDepende de lo que ofrezcas y lo que tengas del cliente (si ya tiene una web y es un destrozo, si el diseño es muy antiguo, o si técnicamente podría ahorrar dinero o dejar de utilizar tecnologías del prehistórico, y si, estoy mirando a jquery), ya le contestas la segunda parte tal que: \"yo te ofrezco esto esto y esto, cosa que ninguna IA/cuñado te va a dar.\"\n\nNo presento los mejores ratios de conversión en estas situaciones, porque al final en España el cliente suele ser un cabezón que cree que la IA lo va a hacer todo aunque yo le diga que no, o que se va a otro profesional porque le da coraje que se lo digas tal cual, pero bueno, por lo menos te quedas agusto.",

          "text": "Sales guy here. This is very much a sales question, so I'll give you a quick rundown of the situation. \n\nI'll keep it light on the lingo, but in sales terms \"I'll just have AI do it\" is a very classic \"objection\" (stated reason for not buying your goods or services)) - just a newer, shinier version of the ever-present \"Let's just build it in-house\". \n\nThe best way to meet an objection is with knowledge - both of the customer and of the competition. Let's start with the customer. There are 3 levels of things you should be seeking to understand when you engage in these discussions (this process is known as \"discovery\" in sales): \n\n1. Surface level - what's the project? Who's involved? What's the timeline? What's the budget? etc. You should get this stuff down as quickly as possible and move on to the meatier stuff.\n2. Business case - why are they doing the project? Is it revenue-generating? What happens if the deadline pushes? etc. These are at some fundamental level measured in $$$, but your client may be measuring using emotions, relations / promises to others in the company - it's best to speak their language, but seek to understand the math. \n3. Personal - what is personally motivating your contact? Excitement about a new project? A mandate to use AI services  already purchased?  Frustration over out-of-control consulting costs (sorry to bring it up, but you REALLY better know if this is the case)? These will primarily be measured in emotions. \n\nYou need to fully understand what is driving the project and the people pulling it together so that you know how to respond appropriately to the question. \n\nNext - the competition. How well do you know these tools? Do you know how to respond if a customer tells you that they are copy / pasting code out of Grok vs they have purchased Claude Code subs for the whole team? Do you know to quickly hide your smirk when they say Lovable? Do you have a feel for the difference between Haiku in VS Code and Opus in Cursor? If not, you'd better start learning these fast, because they will have very different implications for how the conversation is going to go. \n\nOk, back to your to objection \"I'll just have AI do it\". Now that you're doing the above, multiple paths are open to you based on what you've learned. Let's start with some FUD (fear, uncertainly, doubt) about the competition:  \n\n* \"Oh, great. Your product launch is in a month, right? Who's going to be doing the work?\" \\[aka: you just told me how important this project is - remember that hope is not a strategy\\] \n* \"Yeah, you mentioned you're trying out Lovable. Do you have anyone who's going to be checking the SEO for you?\" \\[classic move - you already know they are making a mistake and they're just starting to learn it\\]\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned that your intern is really excited about vibe coding? Which tools did you get them?\" \\[if they are woefully underinformed about the whole space - really let them flounder a bit\\]\n\nAlternately, you could take their side (this is more on the knowing the customer side): \n\n* \"Yeah, you mentioned there's a mandate to use AI from the CEO / Board - do you need someone to audit those efforts and keep them on track?\"\n* \"It's an exciting new space. I'm actually helping a lot of my customers project manage that work, because these projects work best when kept within a strict framework\" \n\nThere are a number of ways to align yourself with the customer's vision by making it clear that you are well ahead of them in terms of this new trend. (Heck, have a standardized AI consulting package!)\n\nAnyway, the key here is that when you are met with an objection, you should take a step back and ask questions, rather than trying to meet it head on. Make sure you 1) acknowledge the object 2) seek to understand the question / concern / challenge and get yourself properly positioned before 3) to dispassionately help your customer discuss what is best for them. \n\nThat got longer than I thought, but hopefully it's helpful!

          "text": "It's the same reason most people pay a plumber instead of digging through their own shit for \"free.\" It doesn't take a lot of skill to dig through your shit, but most would still pay someone else to do it because shit stinks.\n\nAlso, the AI doesn't do it for free. The AI does it eating up a huge amount of your time and effort; having to deal with all it's problems, mistakes, wrong turns, and needing to know what to ask. \n\nIf they ask that, ask them what they think their hourly rate would be, and how many hours it would take them to do it. If they give a ridiculous rate act all surprised, and tell them that if they can really work that fast then you should work together on a web business because there's a ton of money to be made.\n\nThat might also be a good time to point out that they would need to learn all these things about web design, and a good place to bring up a anecdote like this one:\n\n> After Ford's engineers failed to fix a broken generator, Steinmetz was called in, studied it, and precisely marked a spot for repair, fixing it immediately. When Ford questioned the high invoice, Steinmetz itemized it: $1 for marking the spot and $9,999 for knowing where to mark it.\n\nYou're not charging money for writing a website. You're charging money for being someone that knows what a good website is, and how to build it, be it on your own and with an AI. It's the same reason they haven't actually gotten their nephew to built their site. Shit's kinda hard, and the nephew might be good with computers, but probably not good enough yet to design, build, release, and maintain a professional and discoverable website. (And, you know, go to school and such). That sort of knowledge takes experience and an understanding of the world, and of computers. You just happen to be a person that's put in the time to get good at both.\n\nSo really, best you can do is stay professional, lay out the financial reasons, and hopefully you started with a high enough initial offer that they can \"talk you down\" to something you can both agree on. That, or maybe you need to look into better expired boner pill investment opportunities. Some weirdo on craiglist just bought out my entire stock, so maybe the market's turning up",

I asked for $2000 up front and they balked at it, but they begged me to tell them what they were doing wrong WRT SEO. \"Do you work for free? Well neither do I. The analysis didn't take me very long, but it did take me years to acquire the knowledge. If you want my knowledge, there's a cost to it.\" Cheap bastards never paid.\n\nBut the way I found most customers was to go out and build relationships with people.

          "text": "I’ll give you an anecdote. Maybe 7 years ago I called a business that had what looked like an early 2000s html website. Most of the service pages lead to an “under maintenance” page. I called the company and was talking to the owner who told me, “I’ve got a buddy who can do it for a 6 pack of beer why should I pay you?”. At the time I didn’t really know how to respond because hey if you can get your website made for a 6 pack of beer then why not just do it? I just checked the website, it hasn’t changed. \n\nThere’s a disconnect between what people “think” they can do or will do, and what will actually get done. They think AI is a magic solution that will do for them what would have cost $$$, and get the same result. The crux of it is, they don’t know how to make a website that converts. They won’t know good from bad, when something doesn’t work they will just say “fix it” to the magic chatbot then be confused when it doesn’t. \n\nYou’re not selling just website development or marketing. You’re selling your experience creating successful websites that convert. You’re selling someone to fix problems before they occur, and make changes when they are needed. It’s peace of mind and profitability. Will they sleep better at night by making their own website with AI, or if they don’t have to worry about their website and try to figure out why it’s not getting them sales?",

And, my estimates reflect that.** But the skills to plan and manage the project, the skills to ensure your site isn't identical to everyone else's, and the skills to keep it reliable and secure for years to come require careful human attention. Without it, you soon have a mess. And at that point, it's often easier to start from scratch.\"\n\nI bolded a statement that might be unpopular because it could require to reconsider how much you charge for a given task. But as a developer with 40 years of experience, I have to tell you that I have barely touched code in the last month. I've been directing Claude Code instead, with close attention to the results. And that does make a difference, or I wouldn't do it.\n\nSo my advice is to master the technology, put it to work, deliver more work faster, and get ahead that way, accepting that you might have to change your rate for some kinds of work. If there are types of work you do that **can't** be done well by guiding AI (I listed some possibilities above), then of course you can take that into account. But overall, you will be one of the winners if you don't do the \"deer in the headlights\" thing.\n\n(P.S. Yes, I'm paying for Claude Max. Pro also includes some access to Claude Code with advanced models. There's plenty of good advice out there about how to use Claude Code successfully and it should be followed.

That part isn’t hype anymore.\n\nWhere it usually falls apart isn’t the code, it’s the thinking behind it.\n\nAI can generate a page. But it won’t automatically decide what to cut, what to emphasize, how to frame your value for a specific audience, or how to guide someone toward a real action.\n\nThat’s not a knock on AI - it’s just the difference between output and intention. The way I see it: AI can get you to 70–80% much faster than before.\n\nThe real leverage is in what you do with the remaining 20%.\n\nThat’s where strategy, positioning, and experience still matter.\n\n**AI doesn’t replace that, it just changes where the work starts.**",

Scalability, maintainability, debugging, requirement speccing, architecture, technology choice trade offs, pipelines, I could go on. This is what actually fills my time, not the coding. But it depends on the application. A massive SaaS with critical uptime requirements? A government software with real world implications for bugs? Not a good candidate for vibe coding. A workout log app, a Trello clone? Could probably be done quite well with vibe coding.\n\n\nEdit: And you’re right, it’s very easy for a skilled software engineer to stand out from a vibe coder. Software engineering is in this weird place where you need to know more than ever to be useful, and you need to know coding very well to be able to take the wheel or catch the errors in Claude, but the output from juniors isn’t needed any more.

You can also drive a car without understanding it much, because you didn’t crash doesn’t mean you know how to drive well.\n\nCSS is easy to start learning but hard to master, especially when it comes to architecture and code organisation. Tailwind helps with that because it creates constraints (I’m not talking about design tokens, which is not a Tailwind concept to begin with). Being able to add css declarations in the form of utility classes doesn’t mean you mastered CSS, you’re just able to write CSS through class composition, which prevents many people from making mistakes that’s a result of not understanding how CSS actually works.",

They are directly connected to your code and when you change one you may change the other, why you don’t colocate them? Also why we are separating components to separate files, why can’t we have one giant App.tsx file with all component definitions in them IF navigating to other files is such a big pain? It’s not 2010 anymore where we use BEM in a one giant CSS file, we use small css files to write our styles just like we separate our components to small files. Once you wrote your styles, you don’t need to see them everyday again and again, unnecessary mental burden, especially when that element doesn’t have any semantic (class) name to hint at you what it is for (if you name that element .main-chat-sidebar it’s more of a “you” problem, not CSS)\n\nWhen you iterate over an array in JSX, you don’t hardcode the array values to see “what this array consists of instead of naming it to a variable”. We name our components, their props, enums, states, hooks, test names, variables, functions and many dozens things but god forbid, naming a .Sidebar is too hard thing to do.\n\nAlso “on theming”, you can change the hue of blue-500 but you can’t easily change them to orange-500, if you want to change all your app to use orange instead of a blue. Using predefined tokens (design tokens) is not a Tailwind specific feature either.\n\nWe should also stop using semantic elements and use divs everywhere, nobody has time or energy to think about what kind of element we need after all which may change in the future (naming things is so so hard that your brain may explode). /s",

Tools like **Next.js** are amazing for complex apps, but they’re often used for projects that don’t need SSR, API routes, or hydration at all. It feels like we default to power tools even when we’re just hanging a picture frame.  \nDo you think teams overbuild because of real needs, or because it’s just the industry standard now?",

A landing page, a portfolio, a single-purpose tool — these don't need client-side routing, state management, or a build pipeline. Vanilla HTML, some CSS, and a few hundred lines of JS will do it faster, load faster, and never break because a dependency got deprecated.\n\nI've been building interactive web apps as single HTML files lately — everything inline, zero external dependencies beyond a font CDN. The development experience is shockingly good once you stop fighting the urge to install things. You open one file, you edit it, you refresh the browser. No build step, no node\\_modules, no waiting for webpack.\n\nThe counterargument is always \"but it doesn't scale\" and that's true. It doesn't need to. Most projects are not the next Facebook. They're tools, games, visualizations — things where a single file that works forever is worth more than a \"scalable architecture\" that requires three CI pipelines.",

BEMoji actually highlights something important about CSS architecture that we rarely talk about: **the naming problem.**\n\nBEM exists because we needed a way to communicate component relationships through class names. But the verbosity is real—`.card__title--highlighted` doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.\n\nUsing emojis as semantic markers is actually... kind of logical? They're universally understood, visually distinct, and force you to think about classification at a glance. 🔘 for buttons, 📦 for containers, 📝 for text—the mental mapping is instant.\n\nThe ridiculousness is the point. It makes you question why we accept `__` and `--` as \"professional\" while seeing 🎨 as \"unprofessional.\" At the end of the day, CSS is about communicating structure. If emojis communicate faster for your brain, who's to say that's wrong?\n\nI'm not rebuilding my production apps with BEMoji. But I appreciate the reminder that we often cargo-cult conventions without questioning if they actually serve us.\n\nSometimes the stupidest ideas make the smartest points.",

The main issues arise when there’s misalignment between multiple devs on AI usage and the codebase already has significant existing work. Maybe there’s ways of utilising the current state of the art in a way that the entire team aligns, but for now I consider them really good for codebase exploration if it’s an enterprise environment.

Over time you get multiple ways to do auth, validation, error handling, etc., which increases cognitive load and bugs.\n\nRemember, speed shifts effort, but it doesn't remove it.

The problems are different than traditional tech debt but just as real.\n\n**Traditional tech debt:** You inherit a messy codebase. It's badly structured, poorly documented, but at least someone UNDERSTOOD it when they wrote it. There was human reasoning behind the decisions, even if they were bad decisions.\n\n**AI generated tech debt:** The code works. Tests pass. But nobody actually understands WHY it works. The AI generated some clever solution that does the job, but the logic is... weird. Not wrong, just unintuitive.\n\nSix months later when you need to modify it, you're stuck. Do you:\n\n* Rewrite it from scratch (now you're back to square one)\n* Try to modify the AI generated code (good luck understanding the context)\n* Ask AI to modify its own code (works sometimes, breaks spectacularly other times)\n\n**What I'm seeing in practice:**\n\nThe biggest issue is inconsistency. When humans write code, even bad code, there's usually a consistent style and approach. You can predict how they'll solve similar problems.\n\nAI generated code feels like it was written by 10 different people. Because technically, it was trained on code from thousands of developers. So you get:\n\n* Three different patterns for error handling in the same file\n* Mix of functional and OOP styles randomly\n* Dependencies that made sense in the training data but are overkill for your use case\n\n**The maintenance burden:**\n\nWhat kills me is the cognitive load. With human written code, even messy code, I can usually trace the thought process. \"They were trying to solve X, got stuck on Y, so they did this workaround.\"\n\nWith AI code, it's just... there. Working. No narrative. No evolution. Just a blob of functionality that appeared fully formed.\n\nWhen something breaks, I find myself spending MORE time understanding the AI generated code than I would have spent just writing it myself originally.\n\n**What actually helps:**\n\nI've started treating AI generated code as a first draft that MUST be refactored. Never commit it as is. Always:\n\n* Add comments explaining the INTENT, not just what it does\n* Simplify the clever bits into obvious bits\n* Make it consistent with the rest of the codebase\n* Document any non obvious dependencies or assumptions\n\nBasically spending the time I saved on initial coding on cleanup instead. Net result is probably neutral on time, but at least the codebase stays maintainable.\n\nAnyone else finding this? Or have people figured out better workflows for keeping AI generated code from turning into unmaintainable spaghetti?",

These teams generally have no one technical on board, and the product teams in their companies don't prioritize their requests at all. And they definitely don't want to be without someone that understands that stuff when shit goes wrong.\n\nSo I'm pivoting a bit to be that guy. Maybe that guy for like 5, 10, 15 (or more?) clients.

I would say the decline started in January of 2025, but a year later, it's worse than ever before. \n\nIt's a networking issue I think. There are definitely companies out there who need expertise, but the centralization of opportunity has made it far more difficult to reboot. I've found it incredibly difficult to find good clients. \n\nFor reference, I'm primarily a PHP developer with expertise in custom web software solutions. E-commerce, API integrations, custom applications, management systems, etc. \n\nLike most of us, I'd be happy to be in /u/Amazing_Box_8032's situation, but I was already doing specialized work and that has really dried up for me. Therefore, I'm a bit wary that we're just seeing the cracks starting to form on economic stressors and the adoption of AI as a \"replacement.\" I'm an early adopter of erroneous redundancy it seems. \n\nI really don't think AI can replace human ingenuity (yet,) but companies are more concerned with profits than ever before and the opportunity to save considerably even for a less functional product is tantalizing. I've spoken to a couple of companies who collapsed and sold rather than reinvest and pivot their business to be more competitive. \n\nI've always been happy as a freelance developer, but I think it might be time to pick up Cracking the Coding Interview and start applying to 9-5s. I will say, it's not enticing. The value companies are placing on devs are lower than ever before. The wages are so stagnant.",

I’m so tired of getting undercut on price, but then clients coming back to me to clean up the messes. It’s exhausting and they never want to pay for it. It costs me more time to fix the mess than it would have been to build it myself.\n\nThis is the third client this week that left for someone cheaper and is coming back to me to bail them out when the new team broke something. What’s a good way to say, “you should have just hired me in the first place.” Or “this is the consequences of your own actions.” Or just “I don’t want to deal with the disaster you created.”\n\nOk, perhaps this is a vent now. But back to the question, what’s a diplomatic response here?",

It's rare, but I've seen it happen.\n\nIf I were a betting man, I would say they come back offended that you would \"reject\" their \"gracious offer\" to have you finish their probably complete disaster half finished jank site.\n\nIf they do come back with complaining - just don't respond from there as tempting as it would be.\n\nAlways be the better professional.

There was an e-commerce WordPress project that someone reached out to me to take over, they had a bad experience with their first developer, both technical issues but also interpersonnel issues between the owner of the company and the developer ... some rumblings about legal action from both sides.  I agreed to take a look at it, started to consult with them, but pretty quickly jumped off the project, I didn't accept any pay for it despite spending \\~20 or so hours working on various parts of it.  There was a \"technical lead\" (the owner's brother in law) who I worked with primarily, he's the guy who hired me, and I was frank with him, told him that it's much harder to jump into a project and \"get it over the finish line\" than it is to build it the way that I built projects from the start.  I would have been making up for the technical debt of this developer, but also that the original developer did not have the experience to push back against the owner's vision and promised things that just couldn't be done for the budget expectations that she had set.\n\nI liken it to plumbing.  A plumber quotes $10,000 for a job, but someone else quotes $1,000 for the same job.  The home owner hires the person who quoted $1,000, but after weeks and weeks the work isn't complete, they're not around, there's water leaking.  You're brought in to \"finish their work,\" but your quote now isn't $10,000, it's $15,000, because it requires un-doing the shoddily done inexperienced work that isn't to code.",

Pretty clear line between frontend and backend.\n\nNow I'm writing server components, setting up edge functions, configuring middleware, dealing with database queries in my \"frontend\" framework, thinking about caching strategies, and recently even having to consider how AI agents will interact with the sites I build. Half of what I do would have been called \"backend work\" not that long ago.\n\nI'm not complaining, it's genuinely more interesting. But I'm curious if other people are experiencing this same shift. What does your day to day actually look like if your title still says frontend developer? Has the role just quietly become full-stack for most of us?",

I can prototype an entire API layer with Claude in an hour now, so there's even less reason to wait for a dedicated backend developer to pick up the work. The role isn't quietly becoming fullstack.

      "text": "stream of consciousness/adhd post but this is what ive been feeling as a dev. i am being drained by this narrative that non-devs are single-handedly pumping out $10k mrr vibe-coded saas apps while taking a morning shit. not happening.\n\ni’m a professional web developer (and seo) and have been working with ai-assisted coding since the gpt-3 api was invite-only\n\nthat was, what, 2021? over the last 5 years i’ve created 100+ apps (many unfinished) with the sole intention of offering value in return for making money, while maximizing ai to its full capability. my chatgpt transcripts alone show over 150k messages from just me, mostly coding (though i’m on copilot & codex now). i’ve been grinding this for years. it is my dream to have a profitable saas app. i do this outside of my 40 hr a week programming job. this is all i think about. this is why i learned to code. i got a programming job to “hold me over” until i started becoming profitable.\n\ni haven’t made a dollar yet and that’s fine. i might be a lil cooked, but im still trying.\n\nhere are some conclusions i’ve come to about building saas in today’s climate:\n\n\\-   the idea part is still ridiculously hard\n\n\\-   ai can’t hand you real customer pain or a distribution channel\n\n\\-   the fastest way to lose your mind is building for a market you don’t understand\n\n\\-   if your idea doesn’t solve a problem you face, you will probably have a bad time\n\n\\-   ai still cannot comprehend all the considerations of building a full stack saas web application (even a basic one)\n\n\\-   syntax is a very small piece of the saas puzzle. ai made syntax easy. the rest is still hard as fuck.\n\n\\-   the best saas apps will make $0 without marketing/distribution\n\n\\-   even if you know marketing, people aren’t going to spend money unless your value offering is actually good\n\n\\-   you can know programming, marketing, use codex/ai, and still make $0 because the pain point isn’t validated\n\n\\-   you could validate an idea with a slop landing page collecting emails, but if you don’t have any traffic you’re not validating anything\n\nits a big cycle. so many hidden steps, so many considerations. saas is hard as fuck. non-devs are at a significant disadvantage, even with ai, because the ai is simply not good enough (and I don’t think its close). devs are at a significant disadvantage because they’re being told building profitable saas is so easy that regular joes are breaking $10k/mrr saas apps in 20 minutes on their iPhone.\n\nwith as much time as i’ve personally spent on this craft, to get on the internet and see hundreds of posts about million-dollar vibe-coded success stories is a repeated spit in the face. i feel like someone is spitting in my face. it is not logically possible that these types of successes are happening anywhere near the rate at which we are being told they are.\n\nif anyone else is in the same boat, don’t give up. we are being engagement farmed by bots. welcome to the dead internet",

The best pic I’ve had was reaction out to people on tik tok that had a good following that were in the industry as my app (education).

Ideas are definitely the easy part if you're going to run into these problems.\n\nQuite a few successful businesses just took something that was already successful but they took a spin on it or simply did it better.\n\nIf vibe coding was as successful as hype would have us believe, the value of such SaaS would become incredibly watered down, so even if someone was wildly successful it's not something that would have repeated success for long if it weren't dependent upon other factors or luck.\n\nSo many got rich off bitcoin and big egos when they didn't do anything special but got lucky or bought some early with plenty of cash to spare, they didn't do any actual effort, hell I mined 40 coins over 2 weeks back in 2010, sold the bulk of it for $200 because I was a broke student and the mining 24/7 burnt my graphics card, at the time those 40 coins were worth less than $1, but I was not too bright to make sense of why this stuff became so valuable.\n\nInexperienced \"devs\" using AI don't know so many things, and AI isn't smart it's just knowledgeable. It does what the user asks even if it's stupid, and I've seen it fail quite a bit, along with confidently lie or give suboptimal outputs and security flaws (somehow experienced professional devs even fell into this trap and got hit by basic vulnerabilities due to the speed of code churn they weren't reviewing properly).\n\nThe problems are when they infect our own ecosystems and semver isn't respected by libraries published. Along with public perception of what can be achieved by vibe coding to non-technical people who don't see or grok all the issues AI is poor at (especially when directed by users with lack of expertise in the field), which devalues us.\n\nThe apps / software that does get published OSS from vibe coders sometimes is quite attractive and does things non-vibe coded competition fails to achieve, so there's all this rapport, but then comes the bugs and eventually the software is abandoned by the dev because they've built and released the product, got all the stars and anything else that feels good but maintenance and support is boring and often underappreciated. They haven't got as much of an investment into a project, so it's really a disservice to the community 😅",

Either cheaper, better or both. \n\n\nList the actual features, compliance and other relevant stuff. Obviously they don't need to be on front page but provide a clear menu to navigate. \n\n\nAnd best if you have a publicly accessible sandboxed demo to try out. ",
