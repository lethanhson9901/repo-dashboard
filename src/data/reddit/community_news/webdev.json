      "text": "The founder and my colleague enjoy vibe coding a lot (mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/s/0GX5LK2Uuf)), it's fast, it's \"good\"(according to them)\n\nSo when the first basic version of the project was ready to be deployed, it was handled by the other dev. Well guess what, the AI chose a perfect version number for next — 16.0.0. A week after the deployment, the server got hacked, and while they were shocked, I didn't even have to guess what the exploit could be.\n\nTheir response? The founder asked someone else outside the company for doing the \"architecture\" (a single EC2 instance). Thankfully it was still staging and only less important services were using production credentials. Now they're rotating keys for those services.\n\nThey found about the critical CVEs TODAY, even though I mentioned it a day later when the vulnerability was first reported. Hopefully they'll pay more attention to the other recent node and react vulnerabilities now. How do I tell them \"I told you so\" without actually telling them?? Again, I don't want to put anyone down, but this is just hilarious.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n- A lot of you seem to think this reddit thread is the communication channel in my company, and talking about this ridiculous, basic security failure is somehow demeaning to the people. No, it's not.\n- By vibe coding, I mean the lack of responsibility that comes with it. (I specifically mean *vibe coding* not *AI assisted coding*)\n- I'm not a senior dev, joined a month ago, on probation, struggling to meet my own deadlines. The issue was acknowledged when I raised it, a week after my joining, but it wasn't fixed. I don't have any access to the deployment pipeline.\n- I won't **actually** act smug in front of them, get some common sense. Let me rant in peace.\n \n I don't want to be explaining every little detail because it makes a giant page long post but some people here hallucinate worse than an LLM. Hold your horses, the post is partly ragebait, goodnight.",

To be clear, I don't bear any inherent ill will towards Firefox/Mozilla.\n\nI've listened to many podcasts and read many blog posts that advocate for the survival of Firefox (and more specifically, Gecko). The arguments generally distill down to the same idea: \"We do not want to experience IE6 again\" and I agree with the sentiment, I do not want to go through that again.\n\nHowever, as someone who's been building websites since the days of \"best rendered in IE6\", I don't really feel like we're in the same place as back then. Not even close.\n\nIE6 wasn't just dominant by accident, it was far better than any alternatives until Firefox came along (and I was a very early adopter). It was also closed-source and was the default browser on the dominant OS at the time.\n\nToday, we have a variety of platforms (mobile, desktop, etc.) and all of the rendering engines are open-source. Anyone can create a new browser and anyone can influence the rendering engine through the source. There are also several large companies and individuals who are on the standards/recommendations bodies who govern how HTML/CSS/JS develop.\n\nThe current environment doesn't seem conducive to a monopoly even if Firefox and Gecko were to disappear. Conversely, web standard adoption may pick up as Safari and Chrome are often faster to deliver on new features (though kudos on Temporal, Firefox!).\n\nCurious everyone's thoughts. Is it just nostalgia/gratitude that's pushing people to support Firefox or is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: I should've titled this \"Is it bad for the web if Gecko dies?\" as that's the conversation I'm really after.",

Companies want to race so far ahead with features and paradigms that they own from top to bottom, before standardized interoperable protocols get stood up. This is why I think it's important to invest in the success of the activity pub protocol, and support efforts that build out competitors based on it. Loops is a tiktok alternative based on activity pub, which is fascinating and very encouraging.\n\nI also think this cast s an entirely different light on Mozilla's AI efforts. People forget and relearn this lesson over and over and over and over and over, but new paradigms come that you would never have anticipated, features that don't yet exist become the new baseline of normal that users expect. We don't know what is going to be yet, but you don't want to get caught flat-footed, and so investing in that now is important. And I suppose this ties back to your earlier point about being dependent on Google. If AI eats into search, that threatens search licensing revenue. So it's important to be ready for whatever's next.",

Mozilla has an endowment that's now in excess of 1.2 billion and growing every year, as an emergency firewall to buy time. And historically they have put together alternative search licensing deals, not as lucrative as Google but the fallback is there.\n\n>One could save many things about Mozilla but they aren't running out of money.\n\nOh, nice, I didn't know that thanks!\n\n>If AI eats into search, that threatens search licensing revenue. So it's important to be ready for whatever's next.\n\nYep, this was my worry with what I thought was a bigger funding crisis for Mozilla Foundation, that as Google search starts to become less important as a financial driver, Google will abandon spending on search lock-in, and it would be hard to say right now whether \"AI Lock-in\" will be a drop-in replacement financially.\n\nWhat I come back to a lot with browsers is that, in \\~2004, really major players in the browser space other than maybe Apple forsaw the explosion of mobile/handheld internet browsing.  You had your vested players -- Internet Explorer -- the upstart challenger in Firefox, Apple with Safari for OSX, and then your minor players doing some interesting things (I Still remember when Opera was a browser that shipped with a dedicated ad bar and it was considered *a feature*).  But in 2004 it felt like IE would always dominate browser traffic, they had a 95%+ foothold, corporate/workplace lock in was complete, and it seemed impossible for any challenger to overtake them.  And then by 2012, IE was basically dead in the mindspace of browsers, and very few people saw mobile browsing as one of the mega trends that would unseat them.  I say maybe the exception of Apple because there is a very clear throughline to developing Safari for X, porting it to iPhone OS just a couple years later, that you figure that Apple was having those internal conversations about it.",

Some years ago, Mozilla tried to push a non-advertising standard for monetizing websites (more or less micro-transactions instead of ads). There were some real issues with the proposal (do you also throw up a bit at \"micro-transactions\"?), but that kind of thing is (and will continue to be) essentially dead on arrival so long as implementations of new standards rely on Google.

Forking Chromium doesn’t really fix that — forks follow upstream, they don’t shape standards. \n\nIf Firefox dies, we lose the only major browser that:\n\n* isn’t tied to an ad business (Google), and\n* isn’t tied to a closed platform ecosystem (Apple).\n\nStandards also don’t protect us by themselves. Specs only matter when multiple engines implement them. If Chromium becomes the only serious engine, whatever it ships becomes the de facto standard, regardless of what the spec says.\n\nAnd from a dev perspective, Firefox is still a critical reference implementation. When things work in both Chrome and Firefox, you know you’re not relying on accidental behavior.\n\nSo it’s less “save Firefox out of gratitude” and more “the web needs at least one independent engine to stay healthy.”",

I think the reason many of us still 'fear' the death of Gecko isn't just nostalgia; it's about the **Standards Process** itself.\n\nCurrently, for a web feature to move from a proposal to a formal W3C standard, it typically requires **two independent implementations**. Gecko acts as a critical 'sanity check' for API design. Without it, we lose a primary independent validator. If Chromium becomes the only game in town (or just Chromium + a hardware-locked WebKit), Google’s implementation *becomes* the de facto standard. We’ve already seen this with things like Manifest V3 or certain ad-blocking changes where the ecosystem had to 'react' to Chromium’s decisions rather than shaping them collaboratively.\n\nYou mentioned that anyone can influence the rendering engine because it's open source, but the reality is that the **infrastructure required to maintain** a modern engine is massive. Forking Chromium (like Brave or Vivaldi) doesn't solve the monoculture problem because you're still running 99% Google-steered code. If a bug or a specific architectural decision exists in the core, it's in your fork too.\n\nGecko represents the last major engine not tied to a massive hardware ecosystem (Apple) or an advertising-driven business model (Google). While I agree it doesn't *feel* like the IE6 days yet, losing Gecko would effectively turn the 'Open Web' into a 'Standardized Monoculture' that is much more resistant to radical innovation, like what we saw with Firefox’s Quantum project.",

Thats why on Android it also shows up as a separate App in stuff like the app drawer or settings menus. With almost all other browsers, besides Samsung internet, the browser I think just caches the website's files and creates a shortcut into a fullscreen browser window that than opens the website. This also means that a lot of nieche PWA features don't really work like homescreen shortcuts, intent intercepting on android, ...\n\nIt depends on your brand of phone, but some also display the browser's icon along side the shortcut since its just a \"app shortcut\" basically. Same mechanism is also used for example when you create to a shortcut to a location on Google Maps and add it to your homescreen.\n\nIts explained here : [WebAPKs on Android  |  Articles  |  web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/webapks)",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m working on a new web project and I’m trying to choose a payment processor. I can’t really use Stripe because of their content restrictions, so I’m looking for alternatives and would really appreciate some advice from people who’ve actually integrated these in production. There's similar website/competitors with already implemented payment systems, so it's doable, but the ones I saw do not use normal payment processors like Stripe or so (i guess for this reason of being blocked or going against ToS)\n\n**Context:**\n\n* It’s a web app / site where users can pay or subscribe, but they do not pay for any nsfw content, the nsfw content its just shown on the website.\n* It may be considered NSFW or “high risk”.\n* There will be erotic/sexualized imagery (girls/guys, suggestive/erotic), but no explicit genitals (it could have explicit genitals sometimes but that will be moderated to prevent happening, but could happen), and nothing illegal or extreme.\n* Think “spicy / softcore” but still potentially flagged as adult by most platforms.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* A payment processor that:\n   * Explicitly allows (or at least tolerates) NSFW / adult-adjacent content.\n   * Has a clear policy so I don’t get randomly banned later.\n   * Offers a usable API/SDK for typical web stacks (JS/Node, etc.).\n   * Can handle one-time payments to start, possibly subscriptions later.\n* Bonus points if:\n   * They support EU-based businesses (I have a bit of confusion here, my company is an LLC in USA but the customers in EU). So I need EU-based business payment processor I understand?\n   * Payouts and KYC aren’t a nightmare.\n   * Fees are reasonable and documentation is solid.\n\nI’m not asking for legal advice, just real-world dev experiences and recommendations so I don’t build the whole flow on something that will kill the account as soon as traffic picks up.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers",

          "text": "Ohh i know all about this subject! As i built the same thing over a year ago. (I tried building websites for OF models for them to accept payments) heres what i learned, if youre in the US theres really only 3 payment processors u can use, CCBILL, Epoch, and segpay. (Others are garbage) Ccbill is the best as they take the lowest cut and even give u a percentage of per transaction of sales (sell them on ur idea during phone meeting), heres the kicker, visa and mastercard have a combined $1450 per year fee for “high risk” merchants the payment processors ccbill etc pass this fee to you. So in order to get started and get the api keys that payment is due upfront. They also monitor and vet the website they have moderators that require u give them backdoor access to paywalled content at all times and will periodically check to make sure nothing illegal is being upload or sold. If you are building a platform then YOU have to sign KYB and KYC if youre building this for a creator THEY fill out KYC and u would tell them to pay the fee. You will not beable to get payment processing without doing this for any nsfw content (ive tried trust me). If u want the closest thing with no $1450 fee u need to look for “crypto on ramping” (users pay with credit card its swapped for crypto in background.) this is the most uncensored and frictionless route u can take, but they still need the same kyb and kyc forms but they dont require viewing ur content with moderators after approval. (this is the route i took). \n\n\n\nP.S. you have to have systems in place for CSAM and bots signing up to your platform. You need legal forms for your privacy policy, record keeping, DMCA takedown act, etc. for website that has adult content and if creators are making money you must verify they are 18. Mastercard, visa do this for you when a user pays with a credit card as the info of them and their age is tied to the credit card (if not kyc form pops up for user) But if u have creators on ur platform it’s on YOU to verify they are 18. Failure to do that can get u in big trouble. They will ask you how you store all this info, how you will protect against people possibly uploading illegal content they wont approve you on “i will moderate it” if you don’t have auto safe guards in place at upload u wont get approved.",

                  "text": "Whether an image is real, AI, “looks underage,” or sits in a gray zone is exactly why all current legal operating platforms have many systems in place to detect it and stop it before getting posted. with manual review and user reporting . U verify creators upfront (18+), require records, and block uploads without them. Dont allow ppl to just sign up and start uploading verify them first. Anything that appears underage even if not don’t allow them on your platform. Its not worth the hassle and all sex nudity content must be put behind a NSFW wall if not a Paywall. Automate this process with ai tools or services at upload. Moderation at scale isn’t one person reviewing images. It’s automated detection plus human review. Cloudflare offers free CSAM detection, and services like “Sightengine” “hivemoderation” can detect CSAM and flag minors, NSFW content and auto categorize before content gets posted to your site at scale. Alot of more loose Platforms use “safe harbor” as their advantage and why you might see them operating while hosting grey area content or even pirated content but youll notice none of them have payment processing only pron ads. Paid platforms have higher obligations than free tube sites, which is why payment processors require age verification, audit trails, and moderation systems before approval. If a verified creator uploads illegal content, they’re liable. If you allow uploads without verification and records, you are. “I’ll moderate” doesn’t scale and doesn’t protect you.",

You are absolutely in the high-risk category. \n\nThere are dozens of processors that you can use and there are different mechanisms and implementations available.\n\nTo start, there are two major paths you can take: all-in-one solutions (think Stripe), or you can acquire a merchant account and write your own integration (think Authorize.NET). In adult, things are very different though, and you may be expected to forward a user into a hosted page to make a sale rather than embed payments directly in-page. \n\nI would generally suggest you go with an all-in-one hostedpage solution. You will likely be best served by CCBill, Epoch, or Verotel. Based on your post, if API integration is important, you will likely want to start with CCBill. \n\nIf modern API integration is really important to you, you will need a merchant account, and you will need to onboard with a gateway like RocketGate, PrimeOrange, Segpay, Bill1st, etc. \n\nThe fees are going to be higher than you are likely comfortable with. There will be upfront fees, and there will also be ongoing fees, as well as ongoing compliance requirements. You will absolutely need an industry friendly lawyer.",

And rest assured that if you allow people to upload their content, they will 100% do their best to circumvent the rules in any possible way. As I said before, porn (*as well as crypto and gambling*) attract very bad people. You're playing with fire here. What if Stripe accepts you for a while, and then you get blocked? What will be your backup plan, once the payment processor stops working? It will be painful.\n\n>I'm a bit confused on what Stripe considers or flags as not authorized content on their service.\n\nTheir [policy](https://stripe.com/en-br/legal/restricted-businesses) about porn is pretty clear, in my opinion:\n\n* Pornography **and other mature audience content** (including literature, **imagery**, and other media) designed for the purpose of sexual gratification\n\nWill your site be accessible by minors? If my 11 years old son visits it, is there any form of check/prevention? Will you ask your audience if they're 18+, before accessing the pages?\n\nAlso, you said in your description that\n\n>There will be erotic/sexualized imagery\n\nWhich 100% falls under the \"other mature audience content\". It may or may not be designed for sexual gratification, sure, but how can you prove that? I mean, nowhere on Pornhub you find any \"*welcome to our masturbation platform*\", right? We just know what it is. And we already know that people will not be uploading NSFW images to your website \"for science\". There will be a bunch of pervs / weirdos that will basically upload/watch your stuff for sexual pleasure. As simple as that.\n\n*P.s. Did you consult a lawyer who knows about this stuff? Because going from softcore NSFW to bad/violent/pedo porn is something that can happen, and will most likely happen if the website gains some traction.*",

That work still matters. But it’s very different from the traditional end-to-end projects we used to get.\n\nIt makes me wonder if the era of full-scope development projects is shrinking, at least for small and mid-sized agencies. Clients seem to want speed first and correctness later, and agencies are brought in once things start breaking.\n\nI am a 100% sure that development work isn't going away, but I definitely need to shift and change with it to keep my business running.\n\nFor those running agencies or working in senior roles: how are you adapting?

I made him a rough design for his landing page using photoshop, and he set the deadline to January end. \n\nLater on in a online meeting  he asked me to share the design to vibe coding dev. He put that into loveable and the it made him the website. I did not have any problem at this stage cause it was increasing the productivity. He checked the inbuilt browser light house for rating and it was showing it as 99 optimised site. But while  meeting was going on he straight up uploaded the code without even checking it to server. When i checked the code it was a mess. \n\nAI did not followed basic semantics of html code, it put everything inside of the divs. when I asked the founder he said its the dev department responsibility to fix this code. So as I made progress code start breaking. I said to him that i could have created the same website with in less time compared to time it is taking to fix the code.

          "text": "I liked this take on it by Addi Osmani and Aaron Levie on Twitter/X:\n\nEvery time we've made it easier to write software, we've ended up writing exponentially more of it.\n\nWhen high-level languages replaced assembly, programmers didn't write less code - they wrote orders of magnitude more, tackling problems that would have been economically impossible before. When frameworks abstracted away the plumbing, we didn't reduce our output - we built more ambitious applications. When cloud platforms eliminated infrastructure management, we didn't scale back - we spun up services for use cases that never would have justified a server room.\n\nLevie recently articulated why this pattern is about to repeat itself at a scale we haven't seen before, using Jevons Paradox as the frame. The argument resonates because it's playing out in real-time in our developer tools. The initial question everyone asks is \"will this replace developers?\" but just watch what actually happens. Teams that adopt these tools don't always shrink their engineering headcount - they expand their product surface area. The three-person startup that could only maintain one product now maintains four. The enterprise team that could only experiment with two approaches now tries seven.\n\nThe constraint being removed isn't competence but it's the activation energy required to start something new. Think about that internal tool you've been putting off because \"it would take someone two weeks and we can't spare anyone\"? Now it takes three hours. That refactoring you've been deferring because the risk/reward math didn't work? The math just changed.\n\nThis matters because software engineers are uniquely positioned to understand what's coming. We've seen this movie before, just in smaller domains. Every abstraction layer - from assembly to C to Python to frameworks to low-code - followed the same pattern. Each one was supposed to mean we'd need fewer developers. Each one instead enabled us to build more software.\n\nHere's the part that deserves more attention imo: the barrier being lowered isn't just about writing code faster. It's about the types of problems that become economically viable to solve with software. Think about all the internal tools that don't exist at your company. Not because no one thought of them, but because the ROI calculation never cleared the bar. The custom dashboard that would make one team 10% more efficient but would take a week to build. The data pipeline that would unlock insights but requires specialized knowledge. The integration that would smooth a workflow but touches three different systems.\n\nThese aren't failing the cost-benefit analysis because the benefit is low - they're failing because the cost is high. Lower that cost by \"10x\", and suddenly you have an explosion of viable projects. This is exactly what's happening with AI-assisted development, and it's going to be more dramatic than previous transitions because we're making previously \"impossible\" work possible.\n\nThe second-order effects get really interesting when you consider that every new tool creates demand for more tools. When we made it easier to build web applications, we didn't just get more web applications - we got an entire ecosystem of monitoring tools, deployment platforms, debugging tools, and testing frameworks. Each of these spawned their own ecosystems. The compounding effect is nonlinear.\n\n... had to split into two posts ->",

              "text": "Now apply this logic to every domain where we're lowering the barrier to entry. Every new capability unlocked creates demand for supporting capabilities. Every workflow that becomes tractable creates demand for adjacent workflows. The surface area of what's economically viable expands in all directions.\n\nFor engineers specifically, this changes the calculus of what we choose to work on. Right now, we're trained to be incredibly selective about what we build because our time is the scarce resource. But when the cost of building drops dramatically, the limiting factor becomes imagination, \"taste\" and judgment, not implementation capacity. The skill shifts from \"what can I build given my constraints?\" to \"what should we build given that constraints have in some ways been evaporated?\"\n\nThe meta-point here is that we keep making the same prediction error. Every time we make something more efficient, we predict it will mean less of that thing. But efficiency improvements don't reduce demand - they reveal latent demand that was previously uneconomic to address. Coal. Computing. Cloud infrastructure. And now, knowledge work.\n\nThe pattern is so consistent that the burden of proof should shift. Instead of asking \"will AI agents reduce the need for human knowledge workers?\" we should be asking \"what orders of magnitude increase in knowledge work output are we about to see?\"\n\nFor software engineers it's the same transition we've navigated successfully several times already. The developers who thrived weren't the ones who resisted higher-level abstractions; they were the ones who used those abstractions to build more ambitious systems. The same logic applies now, just at a larger scale.\n\nThe real question is whether we're prepared for a world where the bottleneck shifts from \"can we build this?\" to \"should we build this?\" That's a fundamentally different problem space, and it requires fundamentally different skills.\n\nWe're about to find out what happens when the cost of knowledge work drops by an order of magnitude. History suggests we (perhaps) won't do less work - we'll discover we've been massively under-investing in knowledge work because it was too expensive to do all the things that were actually worth doing.\n\nThe paradox isn't that efficiency creates abundance. The paradox is that we keep being surprised by it.\n\n[https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544](https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544)",

          "text": "**As long as clients need websites and apps, we will be fine.**\n\nWe just need to adapt to the new tech and keep up with the changes/updates. Just like photographers moved from film to digital.\n\nThe real issue will arise if (when?) our clients will build their websites 100% on their own, from home or during the spare time. This is nothing new, though, they could do it already with *Squarespace*, *Wix* and so on. Automated and \"one-click\" tools exist since the early 2000's but companies still prefer agencies and freelancers.\n\nWhat the AI is drastically changing is the overall perception of difficulty and time investment. 10 years ago a simple landing page could be sold for a lot of money. Nowadays you can build it with Claude in seconds (kind of). So, in a way, AI will be \"downgrading\" our work by making it look a lot easier and faster (which is not that wrong, in this case).\n\nAI is fantastic for mundane and boring tasks, as well as code snippets and repetitive actions. But if you're not into development/coding, rest assured you're not going to have an easy life if you want to build a new website/app. And companies/owners don't have time to invest into \"coding an app\" in their spare time. That's never going to happen (*in 27+ years I've never met a single client who was on Wix or another one-click thing before hiring me*).\n\nFinal note: AI makes us more productive (true) but it also devalues our time. Years ago you had 1 client who gave you 1K/month to do 10 things. Now the same client will be asking 50 things in the same amount of time, for the same amount of money, \"*because AI\"*. But truth to be told, the AI is really, really, really good for development and mundane tasks.",

They don’t have the desire, time and interest to do it and would rather pay a professional to handle it.\n\nNo matter how easy AI, Squarespace, Wix or Elementor makes it, they just can’t be bothered to even try doing it themselves. It just seems like too much of a hassle to them.\n\nI predict that will never change. The vast majority of small business owners and even a lot of larger companies will not suddenly want to do their websites and apps alone without any professional guidance. At the end of the day, they’re most likely to get someone who they can trust to do the job correctly and on time.",

Accept that people will build via no-code, etc. but that they're going to run into problems.

Pair that with your established standard patterns or templates and then you can at least get back to where they were very quickly, but with a rock solid pattern you can stand over.

AI allows you to generate at scale which is great because it gives you more to work from and ideate off of, but most people don't actually utilize the best thing about AI: scale. Instead of trying to one shot a homepage concept, create 30 homepage concepts, then refine ruthlessly.

It can synthesize existing knowledge, generate options, and accelerate decisions, which is fantastic for research, scaffolding, and even architectural exploration. But it still operates entirely within the intent and judgment of a human developer.\n\nBuilding a good product requires experience, taste, trade-offs, and accountability. AI can generate code, but it doesn’t understand business context, long-term maintenance, or the consequences of bad decisions. It produces output, not ownership.\n\nThis isn’t fundamentally different from previous waves of abstraction, higher-level languages, frameworks, no-code tools. Each time, the “easy” parts got easier, and expectations increased. The result wasn’t fewer developers, but more ambitious products and higher demand for people who actually understand systems.\n\nAI will continue to improve, but without a fundamental shift toward true agency and responsibility, it won’t replace developers or agencies. It amplifies good teams far more than it replaces them.\n\nIn practice, that means the winners won’t be people who avoid AI, but those who integrate it while still providing judgment, direction, and trust.",

      "text": ">TLDR: Netlify didn't auto-renew my domain and my app went dark for 3 days, their support was nonexistent. Keep your DNS separate from your web host for better control and resilience.\n\nI'm posting this as a cautionary tale for anyone trusting \"set it and forget it.\" Especially for anyone using Netlify.\n\nI have a small side project (hundreds of unique visitors/month). The app is deployed on Netlify and the domain is registered through Netlify (via Name.com). Auto-renew was enabled for the domain name. **Netlify even emailed me in December saying everything was set and no action was required.**\n\nThen a few days ago the site was unreachable.\n\nNo recent deployments, no DNS changes. Wtf?\n\nThe domain started returning NXDOMAIN everywhere.\n\nI saw the domain was \"auto-renewing\" in Netlify and the DNS changes were \"propagating\". I think, ok maybe there will be some brief downtime -- not something I've experienced with a domain renewal before but maybe not outside the realm of possibility?\n\nThen a day goes by...so I submit a support ticket on Netlify. Nothing.\n\nAnother ticket...Nothing.\n\nDM Netlify on X. Nothing.\n\nI contact Name.com and they say they can't do anything, only Netlify can remove the hold.\n\nFile a 3rd ticket with Netlify, still nothing.\n\nFinally I posted on X and tagged Netlify. Then they intervene (bless the Netlify social media manager).\n\nOnce it was escalated, the fix was literally \"renew domain/clear hold\" but until then, there was nothing I could do.\n\nTotal downtime was almost 3 days. Obviously this isn't a big deal for a little app like mine, but it might have been a big deal for some of you.\n\nThe root cause ended up being a domain renewal edge case:\n\n* auto-renew didn't prevent expiration\n* domain was placed on clientHold at the registry\n* Netlify's UI wouldn't allow me to disable auto-renew (and therefore renew manually)\n* multiple support requests got **no acknowledgment at all (still haven't received anything communication from Netlify)**\n* the issue was only fixed after I publicly tagged Netlify on X\n\n**Takeaways for anyone shipping side projects:**\n\n* domains are production infrastructure\n* auto-renew is not a guarantee!\n* coupling registrar with DNS and hosting is a **single point of failure**\n* monitor WHOIS/NXDOMAIN when renewal is coming up\n\nAlso, I **still** haven't heard back from anyone at Netlify as to why this happened. I think the form on their support page is likely broken. Also their AI support bot is completely useless.\n\n/rant",

I opened up ChatGPT, explained the purpose and expected behavior as best I can, gave it the code for the original and the refactor, and showed it some sample usage and output.\n\nBefore it even had a chance to make a mistake with the technical detail, it gave me;\n\n```ts\n// for reference, `EnterExitPair` here only contains `enter` and `exit`, nothing more\nfunction someTestHelper(\n  traversalFn: TraversalFnType,\n  root: NodeType,\n  cases: EnterExitPair,\n) {\n  const result = traversalFn(root, {\n    ...cases,\n    enter: (node) => /*some tracking stuff*/,\n    exit: (node) => /*some more tracking stuff*/,\n  })\n}\n```\nEffectively guaranteeing that any non-trivial use of `someTestHelper` causes the test to fail because the provided cases will never run.\n\nIt's not like I didn't give it enough information or anything, this is just basic ES6 objects.\n\nThere are people out there building entire apps with this stuff. How on earth do they deal with these beginner mistakes littered throughout their code? Especially the non-developers who use LLMs for programming. Is the development cycle just \"ask for refactors until it works\"?\n\nAnyways, it just reminded me why I don't let LLMs write code.",

In other words, they're not dealing with mistakes; they're not even aware that mistakes exist in the first place.\n\nI imagine their development cycle is simply reiterating \"if something goes wrong, feed it into the prompt,\" without ever looking at the code itself. The codebase is probably a mess by this point, but they don't care because they don't look at the code.\n\nTo give a serious answer about how to get good results from LLMs: current LLMs are reinforcement-learned to be used with coding agent tools (like OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code) for coding tasks. Therefore, you need to use those tools and such reinforcement-learned models. Also, tasks need to be specifically defined. You need to provide instructions with a highly rigid prompt, much like giving a task to a junior developer. However, note that this is \"how to make an LLM output working code,\" not \"how to make it output excellent code.\" This is because the reinforcement learning primarily considers \"can it write code that solves the task?\" and not \"what is the quality of the code?\" Furthermore, LLMs don't have the ability to \"think.\" This is a theoretical limitation. Therefore, it's better not to give them tasks that require thinking. In the case of difficult tasks like your example, we need to handle the \"thinking\" ourselves and only entrust the subsequent \"work\" to the LLM.",

Using LLMs like that early Copilot as an \"Assistant\" was truly their most appropriate application. But for product marketing, the current \"agent\" or \"automate everything\" approach probably gets a better reaction, unfortunately.\n\nMany people here mention agent tools, and while they certainly write code that solves problems, it's far from excellent code. And unlike the early inline suggestion Copilot, they often edit many lines at once, making the task of reviewing and fixing all of them even more painful. However, it's important to note that this perspective varies from person to person. While we might find such code intrusive, beginners might feel that having \"base code\" makes their work easier. Ultimately, many people \"just need it to work,\" and they don't cared about code quality.",

Giving the agent access to tools to lint and check browser console helps a bit but it won't be perfect. I have found this domain to be some of the hardest to get success with.\n\nHave you considered being very explicit with your context guidance, pointing the agent at what to take inspiration from? e.g. \"Read ./pages/users/admin.ts then create ./pages/articles/admin.ts that provides similar admin management but for pages, using the pages/ endpoint from ./openapi.json. See ./widgets for available frontend widgets\"? this avoids the agent getting stuck on a complex codebase that wastes context size, and helps it stay 'in line's with your codebase and standards. Might not even need large context docs (AGENTS.MD) if the code you point to clearly uses a well-known framework that the underlying LLM is expected to have been trained on.\n\nMaking the agentic problem into a \"do more like this but with new constraints XYZ\" type of problem seems to generalize well, in my experience, even for complex never-before-seen code and tasks (integrating a new JavaScript engine from Fabrice Bellard into a custom private game engine), as long as those tasks are based on a foundation that relies in 'knowledge' (C, JavaScript) that underlying LLMs are trained on.",

Instead, be explicit and somehow forceful to steer the llm to work for you.\n- Don’t let the llm write random file. Create a scaffolding command and ask the llm to use it in the task plan. The scaffolded files can also include design pattern, rules in comments so the llm just need to fill-in the blank; rather than reinventing new patterns.\n- Before it write the file, create a hook to inject your way of working with that file to the context. Again, steer it with prompt injection deterministically.\n- After it write the file, run lint, typecheck or even have another llm to review the change. The llm as the judge should also get some rules you specify for the file path pattern rather than just some generic prompt.\n- when there is a bug, don’t just give it logs. Provide trace so it has complete picture not to guess.\nSome of the approach are included in this [toolkit](https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit) . One thing I usually suggest is to give the llm all information you could have to start the experimentation; then take one or a few components out so evaluate.",

I started a Laravel project to get my head around multitenancy under a few different situations. I actually started it several times because, didn't git.\n\nBut I started with Claude, just in the browser. I told it I was going to be using GeminiCLI and asked threw a basic plan in, I asked Claude to make a GEMINI.MD (overall project view), TECH.MD (the technologies to use, updated with notes as preferences/standards developed) and TODO.MD (the steps to take to achieve the goals) for GeminiCLI. Then I copy/paste that into the TODO, tell GeminiCLI that I've updated the TODO, it did the things and then I'd repeat the process over and over a few times until I had an established multitenant foundation.\n\nNow and then in between I use ChatGPT as somewhat of an rubber duck, basically just trying to get ideas out of my head in a more coherent manner.\n\nBut that Claude > Gemini loop has been pretty good.. Today anyway.\n\nI don't pay for a single one, so it's all with the free tier. I hit the Gemini3 limit, but decided to call it a day before I hit the flash preview limit.\n\nThere was still a fair bit of manual coding/editing. Removing duplicate class imports, importing missing classes, basic error reading/resolving and CSS styling (that's just easier to do than explain/request).\n\nI would imagine that when/if the project grew, it'd have to become quite single feature focused do to the growth in context. But to get to where I wanted to be today, it was faster than me doing it manually. And the code was well commented (which I asked for), so I was able to go in and really follow what was/is going on.\n\nThe only reason I went Claude (browser) > GeminiCLI was the free aspect. I was going to throw some dollars at ClaudeCode, but recently I've seen a lot of unhappy usage-related complaints and odd happenings. I also don't want to become too reliant on either platform. As it was today I still manually wrote and ran tests, and that felt quite disconnected from the guts of everything.",

I spend 10 next days of manually rewriting everything as I see it. When I asked it to continue the rest of the refactoring, it messed up my refactored files and broke the app again. I let it iterate for the rest of my limit.\n\nIt was shit, it basically changed variables and the app was still broken. The new several refactored files were not done in the way I explained it to be.\n\nI decided to abandon any agent AI completely and I was able to progress this last month even though very slowly.

      "text": "Like many of you, I've noticed a huge uptick in \"I built this\" posts that feel... off. Same patterns, same folder structures, same generic variable names, same suspiciously clean README files that explain nothing useful.\n\nSo over the past few weeks I built a tool that attempts to detect vibecoded/AI-generated boilerplate projects. Here's how it works:\n\nData Collection\n\n* Scrapes post content, comments, and any linked GitHub repos or deployed URLs from this sub\n* For GitHub links, it pulls the full file tree, commit history, and README\n* For deployed apps, it crawls the public-facing pages and extracts any exposed source maps\n\nAnalysis Pipeline\n\n1. Structural fingerprinting - Compares project structure against known AI scaffold patterns (create-react-app + shadcn + prisma is basically a red flag at this point)\n2. Commit entropy analysis - Real projects have messy commit histories. AI projects have like 3 commits: \"initial commit\", \"add features\", \"fix bug\"\n3. Semantic density scoring - Checks if variable/function names are suspiciously \"clean\" and self-documenting in a way humans never actually write\n4. README-to-code ratio - If your README is longer than your actual codebase, we have questions\n5. Comment pattern detection - Looking for that signature ChatGPT \"Here's what this does:\" style\n\nAnyway, I ran it against the last 6 months of this sub. Results are live:\n\n[https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/](https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/)",

None of my websites have amounted to much of anything, but I must enjoy it. I had about 14 active sites together at the peak over the last few years, now I’ve got just 5 I still have up.\n\nThe domain registrations cost a little bit but other than that since nothing I’ve made is very popular, the cloud costs are very minimal. It’s really just about putting in my time.\n\nWhat about you guys? Are you off building things, and do you similarly find yourself alone amongst your colleagues?",

He described how you start on the fun side, but eventually drift off to the more professional side in your personal projects, because they need to run well, they need to scale, be secure, customers demand more and at that point it becomes another job and stops being fun. If you can keep it on the side of fun and not worry about all the things you do in your full time job, then it's really good entertainment for you.\n\nI see juniors do this more than seniors nowadays. Even I have three kids and the family just takes up so much time and focus that I don't have any to give to a personal project, unless it's really fun.",

Something that we're not under any professional pressure to get better at, so we can take it at our own pace and enjoy it. Keep a diary. Write a story from time to time. Read books that aren't about coding. Travel is good - there's a big world out there that you're neglecting if you don't make an effort to get out and see it. And yes, it's OK to watch TV, go for a drink with your friends, play with your kids and your pets. It's even OK to do a bit of coding sometimes. :) \n\nAnd, if you're pacing yourself properly and the people who you're working for are reasonable people who appreciate the need for professional development, there should still be time to learn new stuff during your work day. If that's not the case, your employer is crap and it's time to get out there and get a new job. \n\nDon't just be one thing. Don't just be the developer and let what you do for a living define you. Be the well-rounded human - ChatGPT isn't going to be able to replace that. The fact that I code websites is the least interesting thing about me. And so it should be for most people. \n\nMe - dad, husband, cat lover, movie enthusiast, musician and developer, 53.",
