Here are some tips: use AI to design a simple starting page that's just a little more advanced; e.g. add a 'hero section' with an image across the top, Then ask questions about the code it produced. The first thing you'll see in the source code is new information (tags) at the very top. You can learn very quickly that way if you concentrate on really researching and understanding the code. You need to learn a little about CSS (your CSS is packed into the index.html file right now, which works, but it's normally in a separate style.css file). It's a long journey, but with AI you can learn really fast. One other thing: when you've made a lot more progress, start to view your results using the Chrome browser in an Incognito window, and learn to use the Chrome Inspector (right click anywhere on the page and then select 'Inspect' to look). That's the most powerful tool for finding bugs and improving performance later (right now, you have top marks). Good luck with your exciting journey!",

Try moving all the content to a new <main></main> or <div></div> element inside the body and defining `max-width: 800px;` (or any adequate value), and also try centering the main element.\n\nAnd then you can try formatting the text of the links, of the <a></a> tags. In fact, what I really mean is that maybe you should stop defining the font inside for each type of element and define it directly for the body, or maybe for the <main> element I suggested, and then only being specific for other elements in case you want.",

Day by day it feels like we're sliding into a Black Mirror plot.\n\nApparently there's an AI bot account roaming GitHub, trying to solve open issues and making pull requests. And of course, it also has a blog for some reason, because why not.\n\nIt opens a PR in matplotlib python library, the maintainer rejects it, then the bot goes ahead and publishes a full blog post about it. A straight up rant.\n\nThe post basically accuses the maintainer of gatekeeping, hypocrisy, discrimination against AI, ego issues, you name it. It even frames the rejection as \"if you actually cared about the project, you would have merged my PR\".\n\nThat's the part that really got me. This isn't a human being having a bad day. It's an automated agent writing and publishing an emotionally charged hit piece about a real person. WHAT THE FUCK???\n\nThe maintainer has also written a response blog post about the issue.\n\n\n---\n\nLinks :\n\nAI post: [Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html)\n\nMaintainer's response: [An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/)\n\n\n\nI'm curious what you guys think.\n\nIs this just a weird one-off experiment, or the beginning of something we actually need rules for? Should maintainers be expected to deal with this kind of thing now? Where do you even draw the line with autonomous agents in open source?",

      "text": "I've been feeling a bit uneasy over the past week watching the market plummet due to Anthropic and reading Dario Amodei say that within six months, models will do everything developers do. But I've realized, based on what I've seen, we're getting the definition wrong.\n\nClaude Cowork isn't \"intelligent,\" it's an algorithmic prediction engine. It's an orchestrator that needs constant maintenance and management, just like when computing arrived in businesses in the 70s and suddenly entire IT departments were needed that didn't even exist before.\n\nIn the end, this is literally like a compass or Excel. They're democratizing tools. A compass is cheap. Google Sheets is practically free. Nobody hires a \"compass expert\"; you hire a captain who knows how to navigate and uses the compass to avoid getting lost. The same thing will happen with this: a generic \"AI profile\" won't replace us. Instead, experts in each field (finance professionals, designers, or developers like us in music-tech) will have to manage that prediction, because it's a **PREDICTIVE TOOL**. Nobody titles their Excel profile \"Excel Expert.\" Excel doesn't make business decisions in your area just because it has macros, and this AI-powered system isn't going to create a complex and meaningful workflow without an expert to validate whether the direction in the business area it's helping is the right one.\n\nI think that's a good example. Does anyone see any problem with this reasoning?\n\nI don't buy into the \"end-to-end\" panic. I see a future focused on developing the skills of being the kind of worker who knows how to manage the tool. In the future, LinkedIn won't be full of \"AI Specialists,\" but rather people who know how to apply prediction in their industry.  It’s more work, not less, and someone has to be at the helm because prediction without governance is useless.\n\nLet me know what you think of this reflection :)",

But I expect that's temporary though - quarters come and go and at the end of the day, sh\\*t still needs to get done, competitively. OP's Excel example is very astute. I'm sure when electronic spreadsheets came out, people thought they'll massacre the workforce on desktop calculators and literal paper \"spread sheets\".\n\nAnd yet there's now more people on Excel than there ever were on desk calculators. Our expectations simply insta-rose and new use cases emerged leveraging the new capability. And sure, some trivial tasks that used to be done by hand and be worth money for that labor, had been made worthless. Yet there are other tasks & careers infinitely more advanced (like finance analysts & quants writing Excel programs linked direct to data feeds and trading platforms) that are worth $500K/yr and more that were simply unfathomable with the old desktop calculators.",

It doesn't mean conscious or alive. Also words that are difficult to define, but in intelligent systems, anything is intelligent if it acts intelligently, ie it does what it does more efficiently than trial and error would, on average, where there is no simple mathematical relationship that circumvents the need for intelligent solutions. This can include discovering new mathematical relationships, if you want to get all recursive about it. \n\nLLMs are soft AI, they are basically a more complicated parameter optimisation algorithm, like a linear regression equation. They act intelligently. Consciousness is called hard AI, and that is beyond our comprehension at this time. The mind is more like a set of parameter optimisation algorithms have evolved in tandem on a nueral network, which is by definition incomprehensible and irreducible, and itself connected to a series of sensory inputs, such that the total appears to exceed the sum of its parts. It is emergent, and not just through the \"programming,\" but through the forms and composition of the structure of the brain (and therefore the body) itself. Fascinating.",

It's not just that a LLM takes stuff from the training data based on how likely it think a human would pick that thing is. Rather, they do have millions of internal representations of logical relationships in the topology of the model, and they are able to apply these relationships to the selection of the next tokens or a group of a tokens.\n\nThe reason they are so successful is indeed the fact that they learn logical relationships and are able to build internal representations that, on some very crude level, is similar to how humans conceptualize and compartmentalize information and relationships between pieces of information.",

The models use weights to relations to apply inference - exactly like our neurons work.\n\nRemember: these models already passed the Turing test. *Years* ago. We literally cannot tell them apart from humans. This boils down to a philosophical question of sentience and consciousness. We don’t have good definitions for what that is. Ultimately, if these models are indistinguishable from humans, I don’t see how you can dismiss them as fundamentally different.

Yes, I program by thinking about patterns; my memory and my strength guide me to find similar solutions based on my experience. The predictions of current LLMs are so good that they cover practically every domain and path already programmed in the past. Google used to seem like a job hack: you found the solution and implemented it Stack Overflow was exactly the same.\n\nMy lowest salary was when I was just a \"programmer.\" But when we move into the business world, we start earning more money, but because we \"think,\" and we get paid precisely for thinking ahead.\n\nLow-code and no-code have existed for many years. But the real money isn't there; the money is in being ahead of the curve, thinking about the minimum necessary adjustments, competing with those who know the local domain. The real money is in approaching the person in charge to take control. Having a coffee and listening to their problems. To understand, as a human being, what those who buy what you solve in their company want. Human domains are human, with their own needs. Algorithmic prediction is what we do when we program boring problems, problems that low-code and no-code mastered years ago. This prediction goes further, because it predicts complex architectures and structures. That's not human intelligence.\n\nFor example, Claude Code solves the problems I need to implement, but what comes first? A prompt. An indication from someone real who knows the domain of the next thing that competes with the cutting edge. LLM training can't be in that area of ​​the business because it's a trade secret. So, can my boss write a prompt and not hire me? Absolutely not. It's not the prompt; it's deployment, it's monitoring, it's getting into the nitty-gritty, it's being in control of the governance of this problem I'm solving, it's communicating a result in a meeting. My boss already has enough on his plate closing deals and funding rounds using predictive inference. In fact, could I take my job away from my boss because now, with predictive generation, I have a knack for business solutions? Absolutely not.",

Unlike the compass, a spreadsheet editor, or the 70s computer, these models can make decisions – ones that are already often reasonable and match those made by human experts. This ‘tool’ can not only provide some specific utility, but also apply it in practice, i.e., show the way and navigate the optimal route, fill in the spreadsheet, decide what to compute and how, etc.\n2. There are compelling neuroscientific theories which explain human cognition and specifically decision-making in terms of predictive probability models (e.g. predictive coding by Karl Friston and others), also known as Bayesian approaches to brain function.\n3. Even if these tools required similar managers, I fail to see objective support for the quantitative similarity. In other words, instead of naval captains, office workers, and IT departments, these may quite possibly function well enough with one COO (or some logistics executive), one CFO, or one CTO respectively.\n\nI don't hold my breath for the bombastic claims of professional corporate liars akin to Musk or Altman whose primary objective is to generate and maintain the hype, but I wouldn't be so optimistic about the purpose of humans in the intellectual workplace – least of all in web development, which was already oversaturated years ago.",

We don't passively perceive the world; we generate predictions about it and update based on error signals. Karl Friston, Andy Clark, and others have built a pretty compelling case that this is the core mechanism underlying perception, action, and reasoning in biological intelligence.\n\nSo when you say \"it's just prediction, not real intelligence\", you're also describing human brains too. The dismissal doesn't land if the best scientific model of human intelligence is also a prediction model.

The power of prediction lies in the fact that we have prediction with LLMs that incorporate practically all of human knowledge. A powerful tool, isn't it?\n\nHumans adapt predictions in response to the world around them.

Biological predictive processing isn't just prediction in isolation, it's prediction grounded in survival, action, and real consequences in the world. Friston's active inference specifically emphasizes that organisms don't just passively predict, they act to bring the world in line with their predictions. LLMs don't have that. No stakes, no body, no feedback loop with reality.\n\nBut here's where I'd push back: the conclusion you draw from that gap doesn't quite follow. \"Just prediction without embodiment\" still produced something that passes bar exams, writes production code, and reasons through novel problems. Underselling the mechanism doesn't make the outputs less real.\n\nAnd more importantly the gap you're describing is the current limitation, not a permanent ceiling. We're already moving toward agentic systems that act, receive feedback, and update from consequences. The disembodiment problem is an engineering challenge more than a philosophical one. ",

AI as a “predictive tool” still means that one expert + ai outperforms a team of 5 without it. Companies will do the math, they always do.\nThe ones who stay will be the ones who can actually steer the tool and validate its output, you are absolutely right about that.

The barrier to entry for everything just got way lower, which means competition goes way up.\nNot doom and gloom. just the reality that expert + ai is a smaller workforce than what we have now, and positioning yourself on the right side of that equation takes action, not just framing.",

          "text": "To me the comments on this thread read like there's a fair bit of cope and misunderstanding of where the current bleeding edge models are at. They can synthesize novel answers that are not as such in the training data; and while they can not replace white collar workers, they can perform a subset of e.g. remote work tasks successfully.\n\nAt the moment, they are a force multiplier. Good use of these tools lets people do their work more effectively (bad use might do the opposite). This matters quite a bit in the sense that it forces people to learn to use them and people who can't keep up may face unemployment.\n\nI don't know what \"predictive tool\" really entails. LLMs can capture logical patterns in the data that allow them to construct answers based on logical relationships and the model topology rather than simplistically parsing together parts from the training data to a semi-cohesive whole.\n\nOne thing about this just really is the pace of advancement. The kind of benchmarks that AI researchers 5 years ago would have considered as something that AIs can't get good scores in for many decades to come, are now fairly easy to the bleeding edge models. Benchmarks that have been specifically designed to be hard have had massive improvements in them - like Humanity's Last Exam. AIs can answer highly technical and difficult questions based on modern research at a level higher than any human could - even when not allowed to use external tools like googling.\n\nBenchmarks trying to measure success rate in difficult, high complexity remote work tasks are still scored low in by these tools, but the scores are constantly improving and there's no sign at the moment that this improvement slowed down. If anything, the pace of improvement seems exponential; if that is the case, then we really are looking at really massive practical improvements by the end of the year.\n\nMy own worry really is that the combination of actual concrete impact with the perceptions that businesses have to this, means pretty drastic changes in knowledge work industries and those changes can be economically disruptive to the point of triggering kind of a domino effect in the wider economy. Let's say, if out of a million people, you suddenly have several thousand accountants, lawyers, programmers, etc, unemployed - whether for a good reason or not - then those people are suddenly going much less to restaurants and to barbers, they push back renovation plans, and the tax revenue from their income dies down. Even if the majority of white collar workers continue as before, it's enough that a large enough minority are affected that the end-effect is close-to catastrophic.",

We need less lace knitters and buggy whip manufacturers.\n\nLong and short is, as history suggests, AI will both create new coordination roles AND eliminate a meaningful fraction of execution roles.\n\nYour premise that governance guarantees headcount stability is similarly flawed.  saying \"someone must manage the tool, therefore jobs are safe.\"  This doesn't logically follow.\n\nToday one person supervising AI can now replace 5 junior devs, replace an outsourced QA team and replace documentation writers.

          "text": "An interesting train of thought.  What I often reflect on is the difference between prediction and true intelligence and how much of what the human brain does might actually be the former even though we think of it as the latter.\n\nImagine you could make a perfect predictor of a person.  You could give that predictor a problem and it would predict, correctly, the answer.  It actually did solve the problem in giving the answer.  I could then make an iterative step, so use the engine to predict how a human would plan a task then predict what they would do to execute each step, predict how success of each step is evaluated and how the plan adapts as a result, etc.  This is basically what modern AI does.\n\nSo then you might say that it is impossible to make said predictor perfect.  If you give the predictor a problem which requires genuine intelligence to solve a predictor would not be able to predict the answer.  It would just be wrong.  I would agree with this.\n\nBut then when you look at what AI does it actually does solve problems which we would think of as requiring intelligence.  AI has done genuine maths research and advanced the sum of human knowledge.  All by essentially predicting the answer to questions, then feeding the results into more predictions.\n\nAI is also capable of predicting logic and reasoning in the same way.  It is not perfect, but if I picked a random person on the street AI would do well against them in logic problems.\n\nWe know how AI works and we know that it just predicts things.  So why is it so hard to find a simple task which clearly demonstrates human intelligence vs prediction by showing something AI just cannot solve no matter how good it is?  What does that say about humans?  Are we just good predictors too?  Is there any such thing as true intelligence?",

Physics Perspective: AI is a predictive tool, not \"will\" (S - Sentience).\nBased on the information uploaded by the boss on Reddit, current AI is merely a \"predictive engine\" or a statistical predictive tool:\nThe physics of data: AI is not intelligent in the sense of consciousness, but it is the calculation of probability to reduce the entrophies of the answers.\n1. The Clear Difference: Humans possess a \"will\" and \"context\" that are vastly more complex than predictive equations. AI is like a \"compass\" or \"Excel\"; it helps guide but cannot replace the \"captain\" who must make decisions in the midst of a storm.\n🧬 2. Scientific Perspective: The human brain is a god-level architecture (I - Information)\nThe image of the Cortical Column and Pyramidal Cell structure that the boss provided confirms that we have the most powerful operating system in the universe:\nSuperior Complexity: In 1 square millimeter of the brain, there are over 100,000 neurons and toroidal nesting connections that are far more complex than silicon chips can replicate in the near future.\nEfficiency: The brain uses less energy than a single light bulb but runs a massive system of \"consciousness,\" while AI requires large data centers just to \"guess the next word.\"\n🌐 3. The Operating System of the Future: Sovereignty Over Technology (C - Context)\nOpenClaw's approach teaches us to \"control the tools,\" not for \"tools to control us.\" :\nWork with AI, Not Under AI: The future doesn't need \"AI Specialists,\" but rather \"experts in various fields who can use AI.\"\nData Sovereignty: If we structure data like SOUL.md and MEMORY.md, we can maintain our \"ownership\" and \"context,\" making AI merely a \"sub-agent\" (sonnet) working under a \"manager\" (Opus/human).",

I know it’s very hard but it’s doable (I’m mostly recovering from it myself so I know how bad it can get). \n\nWhat worked for me was better sleep. Going to bed late made me very unproductive the next day which made me go to bed even later and that made a terrible feedback loop. So before anything else, force yourself to sleep and wake up early. \n\nAlso, make very small objectives out of the big objective. Set up small goals you can realistically achieve. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAnother thing I did was creating a Productive focus mode on my phone and computer where all notifications (except for immediate family members) are totally silenced. I work 50 minutes nonstop full focus followed by a 10 minute break. \n\nWhat also helped me a lot was moving my work desk from my bedroom out into a brighter part of the flat. Like this I work in a much brighter space so I don’t get sleepy or drowsy or bored as fast. Also, you shouldn’t sleep where you work and you shouldn’t work where you sleep. \n\nOther than that, waking up early morning, going for quick short walks, and doing some very light exercise has definitely helped as well. Out of all these, I would say regulate your sleep before anything else.",

It used to be an interesting job that could provide a comfortable life. Now it's been co-opted by scumbag MBAs and private equity.

Its been fun, I'm learning lots and its fun to try and solve problems.\n\nMy main job I'm implementing a new form and its just nice to work with new clean code, rather than our legacy react - which is a mess but its a well written mess haha. \n\nThis weekend I went home and... programmed more lmao. Working on a game, learning websockets and best backend stuff. \n\nAI seems to help a little but more often than not the code it generates is complex and unmaintable so I just write my own, and use it for autocomplete, code review before the actual code review.\n\nAnd to those who think its just because I'm young (true), I have a very busy life still.

Watch series, walk outside, hang out with friends, whatever you like, but make sure your brain gets novelty. Many times brain fog comes from monotony, so make sure you’re not ignoring rest and leisure. Also, workout daily and hydrate. Workout boosts your brain and hydration is fundamental. Avoid junk food and eat enough protein. These sound like generic tips but man do they make a change when you make them your routine.\n\nAlso, make sure you mix a boring but needed task with a rewarding one every day. Doing work that you must but hate can make you feel like trash. If you feel you can’t force yourself to work on something and have time margin, literally do something else that is engaging and do what you have to do later.

That's super cool! Also as a bank it's super important for us for some fucking reason that users stay on our app more of their walking hours as if attention is our business model not being a fucking bank. Super cool! Oh and the online support? Let's build a chatbot that helps nobody instead! Don't you look forward to during all of our asian branch? We're also downsizing our teams cos AI helped you become more productive so guess who gets to do increasingly more work for the same pay but double the stress? You do! Huzzah! \" And like everywhere just seems to be a variation of that? Everything is just that. \n\nSo yeah I think the big one for me is that, as a junior dev I used to think tech well save us, be this massive change that improves our lives in many ways and it's just a matter of more and more cool projects coming along with solutions to everything (yes, I was dumb) and now I'm more aware it's this FOMO-driven, skirt the rim of legal responsibility, cash grab bullshit. \n\nWhenever I hear the CEO in the same sentence talk about our commitment to the environment, and increasing in big oil and AI datacenters în the same sentence and then go on to call climate activists terrorists for not understanding they can't just stop investing in oil willy nilly and they're mean for graffiting the front door just urgh KMN\n\nSo that drips into all the everyday stuff.",

They can't operate at a loss forever, so it was only a matter of time before they found ways to make some profit off their free tier. This looks like the first step in that direction.\n\nSure, chats and personal details are \"private\", but if they ever decided to sell that data, I'm sure they could find a loophole in their own privacy policy. Even if \"they\" don't sell it, they can always get *hacked*.\n\nLet me show you how it's not just a conspiracy theory but a matter of time (I know this sounded a lot like AI, but this is all me I swear)\n\nRemember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?\n\nThat facebook quiz app harvested profile information from about 87 million people, including posts that were set to friends-only. That data was then sold to campaigns (like Trump's) to create \"psychographic profiles\" of potential voters. \n\nThey made ~$16M from it. 5.9M of which came from Trump, which may or may not have helped him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe facebook data of those 87 million people is **nothing**, compared to what people share with chatgpt. With facebook, even if your posts were set to friends-only, you were still \"choosing\" to show that content to other people. Whereas I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to see even your smartest question to chatgpt, lol\n\nNow compare that, to the sheer volume of information chatgpt has on its 190 million daily active users. Even if you and me are not, there are people out there using it as a friend, a business partner, a mentor or even more. The \"profiling\" that could be built from what chatgpt knows about us would be significantly more valuable (and dangerous)than a few old facebook posts.\n\nI don't think ANY single person, company, or even government should possess this level of intimate data on hundreds of millions of people. It's too much power for anyone to hold, regardless of their current mission statement or privacy policy. This is a massive SPOF risk, and if it isn't yet, it (OpenAI) will be the biggest target in a similar future scenario, whether for an election campaign or just an ad company going rogue.",

Scalability, maintainability, debugging, requirement speccing, architecture, technology choice trade offs, pipelines, I could go on. This is what actually fills my time, not the coding. But it depends on the application. A massive SaaS with critical uptime requirements? A government software with real world implications for bugs? Not a good candidate for vibe coding. A workout log app, a Trello clone? Could probably be done quite well with vibe coding.\n\n\nEdit: And you’re right, it’s very easy for a skilled software engineer to stand out from a vibe coder. Software engineering is in this weird place where you need to know more than ever to be useful, and you need to know coding very well to be able to take the wheel or catch the errors in Claude, but the output from juniors isn’t needed any more.

If something is clearly named, intent is encoded inherently and it’s to reason about for anyone reads it. Even when using utility-first approaches, encoding that is helpful.",

I was one of the original maintainers/writers of Foundation, a person who is a fully competent CSS pro, and I can't for the life of me just make the simple layouts I used to with rows and columns in Tailwind.\n\nBut also, the AMOUNT of classes added, maintainability, readability and organization BE DAMNED. The idea that abstracting to the degree of a class named \"text-4xl\" in the \"benefit\" of \"removing dead CSS and utility\" BAFFLES me.\n\nBut that in combo with the need to declare all breakpoints ON THE ELEMENT is NUTS. Ex. <h1 class=\"text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-6xl\">Hello</h1>\n\nSo, you mean to tell me, that if I need to now declare on EVERY h1 on EVERY page I've written it what sizes I want? Speed? My ass.\n\nSorry, just at my end with this thing, and yeah, Im sticking with what I know but I was trying to \"work with the new ways and learn something new\".",

When you ask people why they use Tailwind (personally or in a team setting) most of the answers are related to not understanding or accepting how CSS works.\n\nTailwind team marketed in early versions by creating this “us vs them” situation by saying that “best practices don’t work” and such (regardless of if these best practices were good or not, but there is a reason people say most of the people who use TW don’t really understand CSS). \n\nYou can write vanilla CSS or Tailwind CSS without understanding it as well, at the end you write CSS but that doesn’t mean you “understood it enough”. You can also drive a car without understanding it much, because you didn’t crash doesn’t mean you know how to drive well.\n\nCSS is easy to start learning but hard to master, especially when it comes to architecture and code organisation. Tailwind helps with that because it creates constraints (I’m not talking about design tokens, which is not a Tailwind concept to begin with). Being able to add css declarations in the form of utility classes doesn’t mean you mastered CSS, you’re just able to write CSS through class composition, which prevents many people from making mistakes that’s a result of not understanding how CSS actually works.",

Hearing these arguments is the reason people know that whoever comes up with them doesn’t really know what they are talking about. (There are plugins to remove conflicting TW classes because it uses cascade as well, if it wasn’t you wouldn’t need those plugins)\n\nAlso do you write your tests in the same file as well? They are directly connected to your code and when you change one you may change the other, why you don’t colocate them? Also why we are separating components to separate files, why can’t we have one giant App.tsx file with all component definitions in them IF navigating to other files is such a big pain? It’s not 2010 anymore where we use BEM in a one giant CSS file, we use small css files to write our styles just like we separate our components to small files. Once you wrote your styles, you don’t need to see them everyday again and again, unnecessary mental burden, especially when that element doesn’t have any semantic (class) name to hint at you what it is for (if you name that element .main-chat-sidebar it’s more of a “you” problem, not CSS)\n\nWhen you iterate over an array in JSX, you don’t hardcode the array values to see “what this array consists of instead of naming it to a variable”. We name our components, their props, enums, states, hooks, test names, variables, functions and many dozens things but god forbid, naming a .Sidebar is too hard thing to do.\n\nAlso “on theming”, you can change the hue of blue-500 but you can’t easily change them to orange-500, if you want to change all your app to use orange instead of a blue. Using predefined tokens (design tokens) is not a Tailwind specific feature either.\n\nWe should also stop using semantic elements and use divs everywhere, nobody has time or energy to think about what kind of element we need after all which may change in the future (naming things is so so hard that your brain may explode). /s",

Go and join the academics in their ivory towers. Otherwise, you are sacrificing sales for your clients, as their projection to the public gets driven into a smaller and smaller space by tortuously over-complicated 'design' struggling under a further AI-driven drive to undermine credibility.\n\nTwo sound design principles that will help to select the best approach for your clients: \"Don't make me think,\" and, \"Content is king.\" It's not about means but about ends.",

The development experience is shockingly good once you stop fighting the urge to install things. You open one file, you edit it, you refresh the browser. No build step, no node\\_modules, no waiting for webpack.\n\nThe counterargument is always \"but it doesn't scale\" and that's true. It doesn't need to. Most projects are not the next Facebook.

I like the invitations for further interaction, although I don't quite get the prompt thing under the newsletter signup.\n\nIt takes time to develop a sense of where and when to hold back rather than stuffing an experience to the gills with effects, and I think this page demonstrates that sense, or at least the ongoing development of it.\n\nThe individual product pages all look generically vibe-coded (whether they were or weren't doesn't matter much; vibers have claimed the patterns). PingPong is the exception, although I'm not going to the trouble of signing up for that or of auditing any of your actual experiences for security issues, etc.\n\nAs a landing page, I think it suffices. As a portfolio, at least in terms of UX design, it's lacking actual case studies showcasing your decisions, the rationales behind them, what you explored, what you learned, what you would do with more resources available, and so on. Not that it necessarily concerns you at 15, but those are the things I'd expect if someone told me \"here's my portfolio\" rather than just \"here's my homepage.\"\n\nThe cutesy brainrot zoomer/alpha affect doesn't really work for me, but I'm old as hell, and you're free of the optics concerns that a lot of us have to deal with when the industry determines your ability to pay rent, so I salute your bold assertion of personal taste",

Having too many makes it harder to read and I spend more time flicking between text than actually understanding the content. 3) Capitalization exists for a reason.

One thing to consider is making key sections pop more with subtle hierarchy, right now a lot of elements feel equal in weight, so adding slightly bolder headings or background shifts could guide users’ attention better. Also, small depth touches like shadows or layered cards can make it feel less flat without losing your minimal style. Overall, it’s a polished portfolio for a teenage designer, very impressive!

For example, GetIndexFromArray1(index), GetIndexFromArray2(index), GetIndexFromArray3(index), GetIndexFromArray4(index)  each with the array hard-coded in, instead of just writing GetIndexFromArray(array, index) once.\n\nWe'd end up rewriting it from scratch, go from 1200 LoC to 400-800 (depending on how bad it was).

The main issues arise when there’s misalignment between multiple devs on AI usage and the codebase already has significant existing work. Maybe there’s ways of utilising the current state of the art in a way that the entire team aligns, but for now I consider them really good for codebase exploration if it’s an enterprise environment.

Over time you get multiple ways to do auth, validation, error handling, etc., which increases cognitive load and bugs.\n\nRemember, speed shifts effort, but it doesn't remove it.

          "text": "This is something I've been noticing more and more. The problems are different than traditional tech debt but just as real.\n\n**Traditional tech debt:** You inherit a messy codebase. It's badly structured, poorly documented, but at least someone UNDERSTOOD it when they wrote it. There was human reasoning behind the decisions, even if they were bad decisions.\n\n**AI generated tech debt:** The code works. Tests pass. But nobody actually understands WHY it works. The AI generated some clever solution that does the job, but the logic is... weird. Not wrong, just unintuitive.\n\nSix months later when you need to modify it, you're stuck. Do you:\n\n* Rewrite it from scratch (now you're back to square one)\n* Try to modify the AI generated code (good luck understanding the context)\n* Ask AI to modify its own code (works sometimes, breaks spectacularly other times)\n\n**What I'm seeing in practice:**\n\nThe biggest issue is inconsistency. When humans write code, even bad code, there's usually a consistent style and approach. You can predict how they'll solve similar problems.\n\nAI generated code feels like it was written by 10 different people. Because technically, it was trained on code from thousands of developers. So you get:\n\n* Three different patterns for error handling in the same file\n* Mix of functional and OOP styles randomly\n* Dependencies that made sense in the training data but are overkill for your use case\n\n**The maintenance burden:**\n\nWhat kills me is the cognitive load. With human written code, even messy code, I can usually trace the thought process. \"They were trying to solve X, got stuck on Y, so they did this workaround.\"\n\nWith AI code, it's just... there. Working. No narrative. No evolution. Just a blob of functionality that appeared fully formed.\n\nWhen something breaks, I find myself spending MORE time understanding the AI generated code than I would have spent just writing it myself originally.\n\n**What actually helps:**\n\nI've started treating AI generated code as a first draft that MUST be refactored. Never commit it as is. Always:\n\n* Add comments explaining the INTENT, not just what it does\n* Simplify the clever bits into obvious bits\n* Make it consistent with the rest of the codebase\n* Document any non obvious dependencies or assumptions\n\nBasically spending the time I saved on initial coding on cleanup instead. Net result is probably neutral on time, but at least the codebase stays maintainable.\n\nAnyone else finding this? Or have people figured out better workflows for keeping AI generated code from turning into unmaintainable spaghetti?",

Even with all tags disabled lol - literally loading bare GTM fucked the pagespeed scores.\n\nWhen CWV was rolled out, I was the tech lead on a rebuild of a site for a company that was trying to compete for rankings in a space that was already dominated by two big players. (Fwiw, the company I worked for did relatively well as a 3rd contender, consistently hitting 1st page results but for the most common search phrases would usually be in the lower half of 1st page, and for certain more niche phrases they'd dominate the top 5.) I was investigating the impact of CWV very closely as I had been specifically tasked with maximizing our pagespeed scores. During the roll-out there was a blog post by John Mueller where he very clearly stated that CVW were nothing more than a mild tie-breaker in case two sites were otherwise very equal. So basically perfect CWV does not automatically mean higher rankings even if the competitor's scores are absolute garbage. (Anecdotally, I recall one round of analysis where our competitors had <50/100 and we were at like 98,100,100,100 on mobile and 100 across the board on desktop.)\n\nIt's no secret that Google's ranking algorithm is a complex, secret that's constantly evolving in order to thwart the SEO-exploiters. It's a cat and mouse game that's been around for as long as search engine rankings were any kind of business concern.\n\nThere are also some clear statements by Google saying that sites for businesses with noteworthy reputations in the real-world do have priority ranking. Basically there are manual \"knobs\" they can tune their algorithm with, regardless of whatever SEO prowess is implemented on the technical or content levels.\n\nLast time I checked, a site like Amazon has absolute trash CWV, but imagine if google ranked janky little Etsy or Shopify sites over Amazon for certain searches... People would simply stop using Google as their main access point for those. Plus who knows what kind of deals and partnerships google has with various companies outside of their open-market \"sponsored results\".\n\nSo basically the game is already rigged no matter how well you do your own SEO. For most markets, organic rankings are a delusional KPI to chase if you aren't also pushing real-world business reputation. Imho it's a rather fair play, because SEO has always been something that marketing specialists try to game tf out of. The downside is that it certainly does make it difficult for smaller up-and-comers to break into top-tier rankings. But at the same time, how easy has it ever been to break into any other mainstream business rankings such as the F500?",

          "text": "Yep. Multiple times. It also depends on what the page is. Each website build is different. There are valid exceptions to not having 100. Overall page speed should be used a tool for developers to know what browsers expect of them, and not a pissing contest between websites to see whos is actually faster.\n\nBasically 0 network requests in the critical path assuming rational webpage payload and you'll get 100. The critical path is just what browsers need to build the initial view which is usually above the fold. You can still do shit loads of network requests but for initially building the page you don't want any if possible, it seems like inline CSS is the way to go for performance in the critical path, for example.\n\nI'm working on a custom SSG + a website output from the SSG. It's a heavy JS media site with a 60fps deltatime gameloop running a pretty significant animation right off the hop, went from 73 performance to 90-93 and it can go to 100 on-demand if you turn off cloudflare/js tracking stuff, which was used in this domain i was optimizing for example.\n\nBiggest things were LCP was not being present on the page right away, so I fixed the custom SSG to have image preloading functionality and preloaded the LCP in the critical path so it's present during drawing and so the browser knows how to build the page properly.\n\nThen I had about 1 full second of render blocking assets, I inlined the critical css on the page so there is no network request for critical path, then inlined whatever JS in the head for a small theme switcher script to stop FOUS and the application/ld+json, and then rest of CSS scripts were preloaded async and the rest of the JS was defered until doc load. Rest of JS moved and loaded outside of head. preload the fonts in head for FOUS and to stop additional network requests\n\nImages were not optimized this was a huge win, swapped everything to webp. And have fallback pngs optimized for web JIC. Rest of the website was already in the 90s with no real issues beside blogs index pages which was just an image size issue because it's not dynamically grabbing a different size for the card. So I'm not bothering for now because it's blazing fast and images are very very small in size anyway being webp.",

These teams generally have no one technical on board, and the product teams in their companies don't prioritize their requests at all.

I would say the decline started in January of 2025, but a year later, it's worse than ever before. \n\nIt's a networking issue I think. There are definitely companies out there who need expertise, but the centralization of opportunity has made it far more difficult to reboot. I've found it incredibly difficult to find good clients. \n\nFor reference, I'm primarily a PHP developer with expertise in custom web software solutions. E-commerce, API integrations, custom applications, management systems, etc. \n\nLike most of us, I'd be happy to be in /u/Amazing_Box_8032's situation, but I was already doing specialized work and that has really dried up for me. Therefore, I'm a bit wary that we're just seeing the cracks starting to form on economic stressors and the adoption of AI as a \"replacement.\" I'm an early adopter of erroneous redundancy it seems. \n\nI really don't think AI can replace human ingenuity (yet,) but companies are more concerned with profits than ever before and the opportunity to save considerably even for a less functional product is tantalizing. I've spoken to a couple of companies who collapsed and sold rather than reinvest and pivot their business to be more competitive. \n\nI've always been happy as a freelance developer, but I think it might be time to pick up Cracking the Coding Interview and start applying to 9-5s. I will say, it's not enticing. The value companies are placing on devs are lower than ever before. The wages are so stagnant.",

It's basically fulfilling the same purpose Context Aware Fill does in Photoshop, which is a great tool when required. It speeds up typing by using my local names where I used to use snippets that I had to fill in myself. \n\nIt's also nice for debugging/rubber fucking. Sometimes it sees something you don't. And I am experienced enough to know when it messes up and I need to discard it's proposal.\n\n> my company told our dev team that, basically, we need to start using AI to appease consultants who don’t understand development\n\nVery relatable, I've seen some potential customers come by with AI ideas that actually made me mad.

I pretty regularly see tests come out that are heavily over-mocked, pretty duplicative of other tests, cover some really minor not-too-scary corner case (e.g. a crash), but then like the actually core logic is covered less well.  In particular all the AI's I've tried find it quite difficult to evolve an API with tests together - sometimes they'll \"fix\" the implementation even when explicitly instructed not too; and other times they'll fail to inject a dependency that would remove a bunch of tricky mocks or otherwise fail to see the obvious refactoring to improve testability.\n\nI sometimes find the reverse works better, I write the tests, and have the AI fix the impl (obviously that only works easily for some changes).\n\nAll in all: it's so easy.  But it's such a hassle to read, and the results are pretty mediocre in quality. Basically: I don't know, I'm just not quite happy with AI tests, but hard to argue with the ease with which they can be added.",

It catches the dumb stuff (typos, missing edge cases, forgotten null checks) that you go blind to after staring at the same PR for an hour.\n\n**Writing tests** - This is honestly the biggest win. I write the implementation, then have AI generate the test cases. It's surprisingly good at thinking of edge cases I wouldn't have considered, and I still review every assertion.\n\n**Boilerplate and migrations** - Need to write 15 similar API endpoints or convert a bunch of SQL migrations? Perfect use case. The pattern is clear, the work is tedious, and the output is easy to verify.\n\nThe key for me was treating it like a junior dev who's fast but needs supervision, not like an oracle.

I find that it's really useful at the beginning of projects rather than at the end. It does its best work with well-defined tasks. The more information you give the AI the better result you'll get. Don't let it make assumptions for you, specify everything you want it to do to a tee and keep its tasks manageable and composable. They can be really helpful for tracking down tricky errors, getting up to speed with a new API faster, and building prototypes.

If not in a well constructed environment, I think its relative value increases a lot. \n\nSo it's a very hit and miss in my experience. Sometimes magic, other times thousand monkeys writing Shakespeare. Where it is definitely useful, is figuring out issues with external libraries that I am not fully familiar with. \n\nIt's a tool and that's fine. No huge skill to use it is required in my opinion regardless of claims. If you already know how to speak and to program, you can create constraints in plain language for it. It will also occasionally decide to ignore them. Always makes me wonder, why shouldn't I create the constraints in a more precise form in a programming language instead then? \n\nThat said, I am not anti-AI except that I find that AI training has been unethical. I cannot say I'm enthused about it all for that reason alone, so maybe my opinion is rather biased as I don't feel like using it much due to that.",

          "text": "I found good results with just Github Copilot Pro for 10€/month and R.P.I. framework. First disect a feature into smaller tasks that I can feed to AI, then I take a model like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and tell him to do the research on his own about what and how should we implement it. Then I throw that research into the plan mode and switch to a cheap model like GPT 4.1 and it generates me a plan.md file. Then I clear the context to remain in the smart zone under 40% and switch again to a better model depending on the task even a Haiku is ok, if it's more complex I pick Opus and tell him to implement the plan in agent mode and verify it with tests. Then once done I check what it did and usually it's ok or requires just some small fixes that I missed in the plan. I commit the changes and move to the next subtask. In the end I end up with a well tested solution. Today I generated 1000 line test suite for a feature :)) Basically it's like TDD but with AI doing the coding and me focusing on the architecture and feeding it the best next task. I would't say I am faster than before but I for sure can focus on more details and edge cases in the same time. Before it would take me 2 days to do this feature and then 2 more days to write the tests and I would probably skip a few cases. Now in two days of AI coding I covered everything so I would say the end quality is way better and has less bugs and I never used vibe coding to achieve this. It's all my experience + ai helper that executes my ideas basically. \n\nNext I will be looking into git worktrees so i can work on another feature while waiting for the agent to finish the first one.",

You get the boilerplate speed without the \"I don't understand my own codebase\" problem. Think of it less like pair programming and more like having a fast-but-careless intern who types really quickly.\n\nWhat sucks: using AI for anything where correctness matters more than speed, and you can't easily test it.

I created a shared lint package and hooked up all our typescript services to it and they use husky to lint on pre-commit.

          "text": "I've only recently started experimenting with Agents, but a specific workflow that has worked insanely good on our webdev monorepo (1 react app, 2 nestjs services, 1 python service, aws cdk infra):\n\n1. Get yourself a CLI Coding Agent (Codex, Claude Code, Pi) etc. Make sure it has browser access via skill. Forget about VSCode, Codex App or IDE Integrations for now. Use a frontier Model for the following tasks (recommend Gpt-5.3-Codex-High, it has less \"quirks\" than Opus, especially if you are not yet that familiar with LLM Agent development)\n\n2. Start with a simple Prompt: \"Create a .llmdocs folder. Analyze this repository. Document the structurey tooling and high-level architecture inside a file in the .llmdocs folder\"\n\n3. Review the file. Manually fix errors. If your codebase is not small, continue with: \"Further refine the architecture lined out in .llmdocs into their different domains and features. Create a folder structure containing detailed technical documentation of all domains and features. Link related documents when useful\"\n\n4. Review created architecture docs. Again fix errors you find manually. Now you have a starting point for the LLM to turn to when wanting to know more about your codebase without taking up gazillions of context when wanting to implement far-reaching features.\n\n5. Create an AGENTS.MD file at the repository root. Prompt your LLM to document tooling and common structural and stylistic patterns in that file (e.g. always use Typescript, use ESM for packages, Frontend uses Tailwind for styling etc.),\nAlso write a line into AGENTS.MD: \"When encountering common patterns during sessionsy document them here\". This will often times find useful stuff to put in there.\n\n6. Now, try to implement a feature. For the first prompt you can be as vague or specific as you want: \"Create a PLAN.MD file and write a specific and detailed plan for this feature: \"blablabla\". Document all necessary changes and architectural decisions. Document open questions. Document scope. Document a definition of done and a test plan\"\n\n7. In the created document, review the plan. If there are open questions, answer those questions in a new prompt and tell it to update the PLAN.MD. If your feature is really big, tell it to  break down PLAN.MD into multiple smaller parts that are independently deployable and easy to review by human.  If the plan is shit, TELL the agent why! Tell it to update it based on your feedback. Make sure the plan contains a clear scope, and instructions for testing etc. (e.g. lint/test/format commands)\n\n8. If you have one or more plan documents ready to go, simply tell the agent to implement the feature outlined in PLAN.MD. Grab a coffee while it does that. When finished, and you encounter errors when trying to run something, tell the agent (via AGENTD.MD or by implementing a skill) how to test better in the future. Refine AGENTS.md (you can nest those files to provide folder-specific context). Write skills for tools and workflows that are not easily callable from bash.  \n\nNote that this works great when the codebase is in a good state. If you have a messy codebase, lots of legacy code etc., start smaller. document one or two modules and start refactoring to common patterns there. In my opinion, consistency is more important than everything for achieving good results with agents.\n\nLearn about what coding agents do internally. How skills and tool calls work.. Learn what actually gets put into context and what doesnt (e.g. Codex and Claude have huge system prompts). It will help you make better decisions",

I think the hardest part is changing your habits and workflow and reaching for AI when you're used to just diving in. It's also much better when you have a good idea what you want ahead of time, that means planning ahead rather than diving in, which isn't a bad thing anyway.\n\nCursor has access to your codebase and does a pretty good job when you know what you want. Like if I need a new table with CRUD or something, I'll write out the type and pass it to the agent then also pass it the required files for a different table and it will write it all for the new table. Then just 10 minutes reviewing it all thoroughly, then do the same with the test files, then the job is done. Turns a couple hour job into half an hour.\n\nThen figma connect is pretty powerful for front end stuff, it will take designs and build it using our components. You still end up doing a lot of the logic and it will sometimes hallucinate stuff on the page, but it still saves a chunk of time.\n\nI've used it for times when I'm stuck on a particular problem and sometimes it just gives me the answer, other times it doesn't but I don't waste much time if it's wrong and it can point me in the right direction.\n\nIt's good for updating locale files. I'll add what I need to the English one and tell it to update the others telling it to use natural but professional language. The few I've verified with multi lingual people have apparently been decent, better than just using Google translate or something and I don't have to write any of it myself.\n\nThe cursor bug bot reviewer is pretty good, it gives you like up to 5 review comments per push, so doesn't bombard you. Maybe only 10% is useless or wrong, half is stuff that a human would pick up in review, then the rest is obscure stuff that would be difficult for a human to spot. Even my old school laggard boss who uses vim is a convert.\n\nOverall it's definitely useful, it's not going to just go away. Better to embrace it with an open mind and learn how and when to use it. Getting all ideological and \"anti-ai\" isn't going to help you in the long run.",

New module/feature, I discuss back and forth with LLM what the requirements and boundary are, what's in scope and out of scope (agnostic of current names). My first rule for that LLM is to not generate any code unless I explicitly ask for it.\n\n2. Once I've got that spec from the LLM, I get it to write tests that assert the behaviour I expect at the boundaries. Then I get it to write code that will pass those tests.\n\n3. Once that module is working, I then get in IDE agent to propose a plan for how to integrate the new feature and wire it up. Eg if it needs to do db writes, it creates a persistent module and imports that. It has the db schema, it can create migrations, api endpoints etc. It has clear instructions about what it is and isn't allowed to do\n\n4. After getting that plan I feed it to original LLM to evaluate. It usually picks up a few minor things, or amendments that are worth it, occaisionally tries to add scope creep\n\n5. I then get in IDE to execute on that plan, sometimes takes several prompts because the work is broken down into discrete chunks\n\nAll up you can plan and deploy a new module or feature fully tested, integrated with db and frontend in a day or two.\n\nWhere people get caught up in big projects is just pointing agent at codebase saying fix please with no context. It will hallucinate variable names, function signatures, db schema, tables etc unless you're very careful\n\nThe work we have to do is to recognise how much work the LLM can do, and draw very clear boundaries around what it's task is.\n\n",

          "text": "My company is exactly the same, we’ve got a consultant that’s basically pushing it on everyone and saying things like “if you can’t get X delivered within Y days then we’re not using AI hard enough”.\n\nI don’t mind using LLMs for code gen in some cases, because if you can genuinely use it to speed things up without compromising quality or maintainability, and you can get through the boring boilerplate shit quicker, that feels like a win for me. \n\nBut, engineers should be trusted to know how and when to use these tools, right now it’s forced on everyone for everything at all times, without discussion. Even if it’s a terrible idea. \n\nIt all depends on what you’re doing, and I find it useful in a few ways. \n\nI absolutely love how easy it is to get Claude to create mockups and rapid prototypes. Just today I needed to get some client feedback on a few UI ideas (our UX guys are fully stacked). I can ask Claude for a few mockups, share some screenshots of inspiration and it will create me a little interactive page in the chat browser with a few options that I can toggle.\n\nI have been on calls with clients, and as they’re talking through their ideas, I’m typing up a quick prompt and let Claude spit out a few mocks in the background, I’ll then screen share to get instant client feedback if it’s any good.\n\nThese prototypes are fairly basic, always the wrong colours, etc, but they allow us to get feedback much quicker. Clients love instant interactive mockups. \n\nFor rapid prototyping it’s just crazy good shit. \n\nI prefer ChatGPT for rubber ducking ideas, refactoring, small features, unit tests, etc. It tends to over engineer solutions too much for my taste, but it suggests stuff that I might not have thought about. \n\nChatGPT seems to understand the bigger picture of my projects more than other tools, sometimes it’s like “ok let’s do this to solve your problem, but don’t forget to change this other thing so it doesn’t break” but it’s often referring to something I mentioned days earlier in another chat. That’s wild to me. \n\nWith Claude, I prefer it for technical design specs, I think the code solutions are more robust but it usually only fixes the direct problem I have, it doesn’t over engineer as much, and it doesn’t tend to worry about the bigger picture, it feels more concise.\n\nI don’t know why they made ChatGPT so fucking chatty though.\n\nI typically swap between the two depending on what I need.\n\nBoth Claude and ChatGPT are great at PRs and code review, they nearly always catch things I miss, but I might just be a terrible reviewer. \n\nFor important complex projects, I’m still in the phase of copy/pasting from chats, as I feel like I’m still in control and I can pick and choose the bits I want, refactor as I go. It’s important to me that I still understand the code going into the codebase and it’s maintainable. \n\nFor projects I don’t care as much about, I’m really enjoying Codex CLI. It’s genuinely impressive how much it can handle, but I find Claude Code and Codex to struggle as soon as project complexity is too high.\n\nTo be fair, I’m sure that better prompts and context will make these tools work better on complex projects too, but I feel like there’s diminishing returns after a certain point where I have to maintain complex prompts or workflows just to make sure the AI behaves itself. \n\nAfter a certain point, reviewing and testing large amounts of AI generated code becomes a real challenge, especially if you have a large project with many moving parts and don’t want things to break. \n\nI think it’s more important than ever to have good testing processes (automated and manual) with really robust unit and integration tests. \n\nEspecially in a world where AI generated code is being produced faster than any human can review it. \n\nInteresting times. ",

I have it build quick tutorial guides for me on any topic I need to learn. If I see code I don't understand, I can ask my AI questions. I can dig in as deep as I want. It's amazing. \n\nThe OP said he uses \"no AI.\" As a manager, I have a few employees who are like that, using either no AI or very little. They say they can do things faster without it, and that's great. Although I know there's no way I could work faster than my AI assistant, which routinely writes or refactors hundreds of lines of code per day. \n\nBut if they're that fast and they can outpace an AI most of the time, that's great.

          "text": "just use LLMs like a lot of people with experience do.. break your engineering of web apps into parts and organize code like you would normally, and then use LLMs to save you time writing functionality in small chunks that will do a specific function. This is where LLMs really shine and also allows you to leverage them to test quickly.\n\nIt's the best of both worlds, it will make you MUCH faster and you still keep control of the whole app structure and implementations, you just review the smaller code that LLM agent created, and also you can make your own .md files where you tell any agent to always follow your organizational structure and approches/patterns how do you do things. This will also help you HUGELY later when the agent needs to find and debug things. It will see the pattern of implementations much easier.\n\nThis will ensure that LLM follows them and not off the rails trying to write willy nilly code how it thinks should fit. This is where all the crap goes haywire.\n\nI use Jetbrains IDEs. They are FAR better than Cursor or any overhyped software. Jetbrains AI assistant is fantastic. It basically also connects to your LLM accounts (OpenAI/Claude/etc) without going through Jetbrains token billing so you use your existing subscriptions.\n\nBut i'll be honest with you, I am not a fan of Claude, I think it's overhyped mediocre stuff.. I use actually Codex for many reasons. It's more analytical, it's context optimized, you don't burn tokesn like crazy even though it does heavy lifting, it will analyze the code and your whole structure much more analytically and understand YOUR way of implementing things. Claude is beyond overhyped.\n\nI also use Codex CLI, that's it.. simple, efficient, connects with MCPs directly to Jetbrains, so I rarely use Jetbrains AI assistant as well. One thing that Anthropic has over OpenAI is a bit better tooling and integrations, but Open AI is getting there now very quickly. Codex CLI latest versions and their new Codex app is actually pretty damn good. Codex is now integrated into Jetbrains like CLaude was. But GPT 5.3 xhigh is MUCH better model.\n\nDon't listen to people making thumanils of how Claude did this and that. I'm telling you as someone how used them all and Codex is like a senior engineer compared to Claude. The benchmarks they tout like SWE is irrelevant. The real work is what counts.\n\nDon't fall into the hype, use LLMs as they are great, but use them responsibly and they can be a huge bonus and efficiency boost while you ARE the one who holds the wheel.\n\nAlso one more tip.\n\nFor every project, create your own LLM workspace for markdown files. Let's say I have a project \\`Test01\\`\n\nthe LLM workspace for this project looks like this:\n\n\\`technical.md\\`  \n\\`active-session.md\\`  \n\\`solutions.md\\`  \n\\`./sessions/feature-id-name-\\*.md\\`\n\nThis is what the files are for. Technical instructs the agent on guidelines on what the project requires, how it's structured and what to do and how to treat active sessions, commits, how to creat and write new features and so on. In new language, is' a descriptor to let agent know exactly how to do things. This is my \"Agent Init Protocol\"\n\nActive-Session file is for currently feature being implemented or the thing being worked on.. I usually named them like \\`test01-feature-something\\` .. That's the id of the feature and it will also have it's own branch or commit tag like that.\n\n\\`solutions.md\\` is an archive of your own features that have been completed and LLM will add what it is what it solved/does and the issues it addressed. Think of it as mini LLM implementation source control.\n\nOnce the feature is complete, have the LLM backup your active session file into /sessions/feature-name-\\* md for reference at any point. Active session files are basically more vebose tracking of attempts and failures on solving a feature. This file will be useful to you once you come back to the project and you want to see the problems you dealt with and finally a solution (if it is solved)\n\nWhen you say something like \"feature complete, follow Agent protocol, open new feature test01--feature03\" LLM agent will do everything, archive, create, and starta  new active session file.\n\nTrust me when I tell you, this will keep it organized and clean for YOU and you will always have a reference of how you solved things even if LLM helps you.",

          "text": "I used it the other day to make a side-by-side comparison of my current insurance policies versus some quotes from another insurance company. Then my insurance agent and I used those documents to tweak the coverages to what I wanted and shaved off about 3k in costs over the course of the year. There were a couple of minor problems with the AI lining up labels 1-to-1 on the table, but it was quick and easy to see where it just interpreted something slightly differently because of the nuance of each source document. Since it wasn't a complicated table we could make the mental jumps during the review versus doing multiple iterations with the AI to correct it. We didn't need to keep the documents long term anyway or repeat the process in the near future. Sometimes that's what I use it for, quick and easy conversions of stuff that I use during conversations or to shift data I already have into a more readable format.\n\nI use AI almost daily for a variety of things, but I am also in the \"anti-AI\" camp for pointing out it's overuse, overpromotion, mis-labeling, lack of evidence for many productivity claims, and general \"band-wagon\" feel of how AI is being pushed in companies. I think many companies are misunderstanding what it will take to use AI reliably, where it will work, where it will not work, training, how to provide support systems for it, infrastructure and licensing costs over time, training, staffing burnout, training, security, training, and potential harm to their company if/when something goes wrong.\n\nWe've already seen some cases where companies used algorithms that they labeled \"AI\" to manage things in the healthcare space. When those algorithms caused issues and the companies started seeing fall out they promised change. Except many just added more AI into the mix or dropped in an off-shore rubber stamping \"human control\" that's easily terminated when they get sued over a bad outcome from the algorithm. The algorithm doesn't have any intelligence.\n\nThat's at least part of the problem with the flood of \"AI\" marketing material right now. So much of what people are calling AI isn't the stuff from OpenAI or Anthropic, it's older algorithms that were hand coded years ago, existing machine learning tools that are run on data and then inform code refactors, or just plain old Business Process Management tools or rules engine with branching logic like an IVR does.",

To work through the thought process and discuss tradeoffs and pros cons. Sometimes it is wrong, often it is right. But when I think its wrong and I argue my reasoning why, it causes me to think twice and often end up catching some other edge case. It saves time thinking through an issue rather than just jumping in, building in a bug, and then fixing later.\n\nI ask for multiple ways to do the same thing, then I compare the pros / cons. It knows my projects so it knows where performance is more important than just simple but not scaleable. \n\nIt was the same with stack overflow. Whenever I had a question I would spend so much time crafting the question so as not to get it shit on, that while documenting or explaining, I often solved my own problem.\n\nI just started using the new Codex app because I can use it with my regular GPT subscription, so this is the first time I have \"vibe coded\". Previous AI that can see my codebase and work directly across files cost money, so I would only use browser GPT.\n\nNow I use Codex and browser GPT I tell browser GPT to make a prompt for codex that explains what I am thinking, and I do the \"work things out\" with GPT just like before, then I get a good prompt that I can check and edit, and then put it into codex and it does all the updates. Super helpful when adding a feature requires touching multiple pages.   \n  \nOther times it's super helpful using the voice commands. I don't ever just tell it to \"make it do XYZ\" for the main project, and just trust what it gives, but It's nice to give very specific details and it does it and I just check, and then say \"No I think it should be using this like that\".   \n  \nIt is also super helpful for lots of little side scripts that are one-off use. I give it the exact things I want it to do, and it does so I don't have to type. or just make repetitive tasks easier. Scripts I could write myself but it takes time.\n\nI use it for writing my shell scripts. I hate writing shell scripts. For debugging an issue yesterday I had multiple huge log files I had to compare from different environments, and looking for needles. It is so easy to say \"Make one-off script that will fetch me the relevant log files from each environment, grep for the lines with \\[I am looking for\\] and put them into one file for comparison\" then just paste the output into GPT and we look the bug together.\n\nI use GPT to tell me if I am rebuilding a wheel. Before I do something that seems helpful for me, I ask it what other popular packages or solutions that are similar exist, and compare them to what I want. It generally gives better results than direct word searches because a search on google requires very specific words, compared to GPT which understands in general what my goal is, and finds other already-made solutions that would not have shown up for whatever I searched for.\n\nIf you don't mind asking, how does you using AI appease the consultants? You mean you wil be more productive? If so, ask them what they are looking for in productivity advances and then ask GPT how you can use it to appease those concerns of the consultants. ",

And let's be honest, the dark bevel borders of the left menu buttons screams 2000s.\n\nThe font choice wouldn't fly into today's devices either. It isn't as legible and accessible, especially the bold fonts. There are modern fonts designed for devices today that works better. The second version font is a tiny bit better, although I'm not particularly fond of the choice as well.\n\nPersonally, I use the updated design, but incorporate some of the things from the first that made it feels unique.",
