They start adding absolutely ridiculous metrics like trying to calculate how much of your code is written by AI versus by you, check to see how frequently you're using the apis via tooling (IDEs, CLIs like Code Puppy, etc...). Their goal is to fully implement AI as coders and humans as reviewers. You already have tools like Qodo Merge that can actually do a very good job at code reviews but still requires manual intervention. It has a bunch of false positives that show up but with time that will get better as well. \n\nThe major Gap that I've seen so far is that for experienced engineers at senior level or above, this can absolutely speed up their development and they'll catch the problems they see for the most part. However, for the Junior and mid-level, they don't have the experience necessary to understand what is actually happening when they do their reviews. They don't have the reps in to identify issues that are only gained by experience. \n\nThis is just the opinion of a two decade software engineer forced to try to use AI to replace my knowledge so I can watch it wither away along with my career.\n\nI'm just glad this didn't exist when I was starting my career. I wouldn't have the skills I do today, especially in staying calm when things go wrong, having to design an architecture from scratch with no tooling, and learning how to problem solve without extra tools beyond debug messages and AltaVista -> Google search",

This obviously leads to the junior positions in many companies completely decimated due to both the shrinkage of the demand(1 junior with a claude subscription can replace 5 juniors from 2020) and the supply (everybody can code with ai).\n\nAll the current senior devs still have their experiences and expertise from the last 2 decades and won't be negatively affected by the adoption of ai, but there will come a time where they'll retire and have to hand over the role of \"senior\" to the little juniors.\n\nA senior solves a problem by thinking about it from more perspectives, usually out of their years of experience, completes the overall skeleton of the solution and hands the mundane part to the juniors, where they learn how the overall architecture and system should relate to each other and function properly. Obviously seniors also know how to use ai, so companies will stop hiring juniors to save on costs, and when the seniors eventually retire, there will be no new seniors since all the juniors were never there in the first place.",

Code becomes disposable, and software is constantly reinvented and recycled. Software developers less and less look at code, they just get the AI to do stuff and then make sure it conforms to requirements. On the one hand of this means juniors can exist, because their role is basically splitting up work into very small chunks (absolutely a skill) and holding the hand of the AI through it. On the other hand this is actually slower than building good quality software in the medium and long term, but businesses don't care, because businesses never care about that sort of thing.\n\nSoftware development then is forced into this cycle: ship crap, restart every few months when the model hits its limit. Our entire industry reshapes. New SDLC models emerge, are hyped, and entire consultancies built around deploying them (ah la Agile). New frameworks emerge on this model (eg rest framework that wrap you in a secure sandbox, managing externalities, allowing your code to be as shit as you like). Many breathless blog posts are written about how to be efficient in this model.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been learning the piano in this timeline for multiple years.

Whoa, I don't even understand what's wrong with my CV. I did the most beautiful and impactful things and still there is someone better than me. I'm not even asking for 200,000$ job, at least 24,000$ as a start.\n\nBut no, nothing, so I'm on my way to just have fun building things I always wanted to. I've been constantly reflecting on what I feel wrong working on a company - I realized that I'm tired of working on projects where clients just \"want to see if it's good\" and I want to build a nice looking, reliable and meaningful application. Not another toy project or a copy of Google.\n\nI'm finding myself in a state where I'm truly considering doing something else for money (I do any job at my best) and programming just for fun, building non-profit applications and helping other people to get into, especially children. That's my way as I see it.",

The concept of the skill gap is one of the most worrying things in this whole AI craze right now, at least for me. If we lose the opportunity for juniors to learn on the job for years and become seniors, it will only strengthen the iron grip that AI automation has on everything it touches. I don't have a solution. I just know it's a huge problem that's looming on the horizon and we have no plan for it.\n\nAlso, all the people commenting \"This isn't a hot take\" or \"This is a lukewarm take\"... what do you think YOU are contributing to the conversation? You are adding nothing to what you already consider something not worth mentioning... why? Add something unique or maybe consider not commenting.",

          "text": "So a while back in early 20th century structural engineering and architects used to hand draw diagrams for buildings. Then after that people would draw on a computer and then design each building component and send that off to be made and then make designs for the builders to follow whilst construction. Then better software was made where you draw the building and it does everything for you. This massive productivity boost didn't lead to job losses and we still have junior architects today.\n\nWe're going through this same change now. In 10 years time maybe we won't even be writing code, we'll just write a list of things that must happen when events are fired or APIs are called. Like how buildings have got bigger with more requirements and more materials and cheaper maybe software will too but we will still need people with technical understanding, design and vision in one way or another",

So the cost of being inexperienced is also reduced. I won't claim to ever be a senior dev since I still look to others in that role as different from me. But I can see that with enough effort I can match them in results. They might have an easier time getting there but what I lack in experience I'll make up for in determination.",

I'm a chemistry major and have no prior web development experiences, but I had 3 weeks of vacation and built a basketball [website](https://measurevertical.com/) from scratch. If somebody like myself with no IT background can do it on the side I think anybody can do it. I'm living proof xD\n\nBut it was a very small project without complex infrastructure to be fair and I found out about shadznUI which helped me a lot\n\nObviously, I couldn't work for a company because I rely too much on AI and have no deep knowledge but it's amazng how far I came with using only online ressources and AI. I have some friends who are IT majors and they liked my project but said the code is a bit shaky",

It’s like saying the victims of Hiroshima are to blame because they couldn’t run fast enough.\n\nSociety as we know it and as we implement it to date requires people.\n\nThose people earn money, and those people cost money. If a business is successful, it means the workers earned much more than they cost.\n\nIf work in a large enough chunk of the economy becomes a dancing contest between humans and AI, well—humans have to study for decades at a great expense to become experts at something like programming. If the whole field is destroyed, faulting them for failing to anticipate the destruction of their investment leads where exactly? A maximumly agile person in the world you describe isn’t allowed to develop expertise because the investment is likely to be eradicated by AI. The whole game of reducing worker numbers while increasing output can’t go on forever without collapsing the economy, so this Muskian blame just really doesn’t hold water. The system doesn’t promise to replace what’s destroyed, and humans can’t spend $100k + 8 years of study in an instant in order to redirect. Like asking a 50 year old to make that investment is crazy because the time it would take to recover it even if they commit to a total career change is much more likely not to be realized.\n\nLike I’m 50, my son is 18.\nI’m a programmer and I’ve been put out of work by AI. \nMy family needs money, but none of us are skilled with valuable skills (even though my skills are recently THE MOST valued).\nThe cost for skills is $100k.\n\nWho gets the $100k skills? Me or the 18 year old.\n\n18 year old is better get because I’m more likely to die at they point. But then what? The 18 year old is a slave for his family and when he grows old has nothing?\n\nAt best you displace your burden one generation.\n\nYou assign blame, but sound daft. Most likely, you will not survive.",

It’s about creating. And honestly, there’s something refreshing about skipping the overhead of research, users, or constraints and just putting something out there.\n\nWhat really stands out is the confidence. No unnecessary complexity, no messy edge cases, no burden of reality getting in the way. Just a clean demo, a compelling narrative, and a clear sense of momentum. That kind of focus is rare.\n\nI also love how this reframes the problem. It’s not about solving a specific pain point — it’s about unlocking potential. And potential, as we all know, is much easier to scale than actual value.\n\nThis isn’t replacing traditional approaches — it’s redefining them. By prioritising speed over understanding, and presentation over depth, it shows what’s possible when you optimise for output instead of outcomes.\n\nIs it finished? Probably not.  \nBut finished isn’t the point. Shipping is.  \nAnd shipping something will always beat thinking too hard about anything. Build it and they will come.\n\nReally curious to see where this goes next — whether that’s iteration, expansion, or a bold new reframing of the same core idea.\n\nKeep going. This kind of energy is exactly what the subreddit needs ✨",

I’ve found that for every one hour of generating a new feature, if a bug or bad bug pops up, it’s minimum 2.5x the amount of time for it to add in logging, logging functions, console logging functions, etc.\n\nBuilt a really neat diff functionality for jsons in my web app (total time for neat diff functionality ~80 hours). At least 30 of those hours were spent debugging. Granted it’s been a weekend project for the past 3 months. Updates to Codex definitely affect that over time since it goes through Ebs and Flows, either firing on all cylinders some nights or a complete hallucination night the other. It’s just not consistent enough over time to trust the same output quality/consistency, IMO.",

The big push was the transformer architecture itself, but the underlying neural network architecture still has the same limits a before. Most improvements are around tooling and making it more compact. Additional training data gets worse nowadays due to the fact that neural networks usually produce at least a slightly worse version of their training input. The chance that it will get bette and better are very very low and its more likely that we are actually at the limit of what an LLM can provide.\n\nAnd I also have to disagree, often the AI produces over complicated or messy code when it comes to more complex tasks. It can help a lot when using it for small units though and focusing on TDD, its rather good in generating code from tests, but even then it often adds unnecessary things to it or generates way too complicated code. As my manager put it: \"This thing is amazing for rapid prototyping! It was so much fun working with it! The code belongs in the trash can, but its great to test concepts\" <- He puts a lot of importance on code quality, technical debt was a massive issue at our company a few years ago.",

The root of the problem is that the arXiv paper is pretty bad: it uses a dataset ([HMCorp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04704)) that generated pairs of functions (human-generated, AI-generated) by stripping the docstring and letting ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo recreate the same code.

A much better summary of this \"research\" would be:\n\n\"When outdated AI models are given vague instructions without project context, they write generic, simple code that fails to use all function arguments and defaults to insecure patterns.\"\n\nPlease, people, if you cannot evaluate a research paper on your own, don't mindlessly share it, or at least ask GPT-5.2 Thinking or Gemini 3 Pro to critically analyze the paper for you instead of spreading misinformation. Trust me, any of those models is able to perform much better analyses than most people.\n\nOn the other hand, as a security researcher, I had a good laugh when I read this, since nothing could be further from the truth:\n\n> human mistakes tend to be low-to-medium severity — typos, minor logic flaws, a missing null check. messy but catchable.",

Suffering has always been there but they hear more about it.\n\nLow interest rates caused a cash glut which resulted in a period of power for many more devs. During this period they had outsized influence over tech choices and the ability to jump ship before the results made an impact. We all suffer from them not using boring tools. \n\nThe reins are tighter on real world scope/influence of devs. With a tighter market there is now more pressure to hype to be heard.

To be clear, I don't bear any inherent ill will towards Firefox/Mozilla.\n\nI've listened to many podcasts and read many blog posts that advocate for the survival of Firefox (and more specifically, Gecko). The arguments generally distill down to the same idea: \"We do not want to experience IE6 again\" and I agree with the sentiment, I do not want to go through that again.\n\nHowever, as someone who's been building websites since the days of \"best rendered in IE6\", I don't really feel like we're in the same place as back then. Not even close.\n\nIE6 wasn't just dominant by accident, it was far better than any alternatives until Firefox came along (and I was a very early adopter). It was also closed-source and was the default browser on the dominant OS at the time.\n\nToday, we have a variety of platforms (mobile, desktop, etc.) and all of the rendering engines are open-source. Anyone can create a new browser and anyone can influence the rendering engine through the source. There are also several large companies and individuals who are on the standards/recommendations bodies who govern how HTML/CSS/JS develop.\n\nThe current environment doesn't seem conducive to a monopoly even if Firefox and Gecko were to disappear. Conversely, web standard adoption may pick up as Safari and Chrome are often faster to deliver on new features (though kudos on Temporal, Firefox!).\n\nCurious everyone's thoughts. Is it just nostalgia/gratitude that's pushing people to support Firefox or is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: I should've titled this \"Is it bad for the web if Gecko dies?\" as that's the conversation I'm really after.",

Companies want to race so far ahead with features and paradigms that they own from top to bottom, before standardized interoperable protocols get stood up. This is why I think it's important to invest in the success of the activity pub protocol, and support efforts that build out competitors based on it. Loops is a tiktok alternative based on activity pub, which is fascinating and very encouraging.\n\nI also think this cast s an entirely different light on Mozilla's AI efforts. People forget and relearn this lesson over and over and over and over and over, but new paradigms come that you would never have anticipated, features that don't yet exist become the new baseline of normal that users expect. We don't know what is going to be yet, but you don't want to get caught flat-footed, and so investing in that now is important.

You had your vested players -- Internet Explorer -- the upstart challenger in Firefox, Apple with Safari for OSX, and then your minor players doing some interesting things (I Still remember when Opera was a browser that shipped with a dedicated ad bar and it was considered *a feature*).  But in 2004 it felt like IE would always dominate browser traffic, they had a 95%+ foothold, corporate/workplace lock in was complete, and it seemed impossible for any challenger to overtake them.  And then by 2012, IE was basically dead in the mindspace of browsers, and very few people saw mobile browsing as one of the mega trends that would unseat them.  I say maybe the exception of Apple because there is a very clear throughline to developing Safari for X, porting it to iPhone OS just a couple years later, that you figure that Apple was having those internal conversations about it.",

I don't think this is as catastrophic as it sounds, but it does put the web in the uncomfortable spot where standards that don't align with Google's business interest are unlikely to get any traction. Some years ago, Mozilla tried to push a non-advertising standard for monetizing websites (more or less micro-transactions instead of ads). There were some real issues with the proposal (do you also throw up a bit at \"micro-transactions\"?), but that kind of thing is (and will continue to be) essentially dead on arrival so long as implementations of new standards rely on Google. We're already living in The Bad Place - but outside of a few (real and non-trivial!) issues it's not so bad for most of us.\n\nThere's a couple niches that would feel it significantly worse than others. I work with graphics heavy apps that need to use WebGPU, Firefox maintains their Rust implementation (wgpu) and Google a C++ implementation (dawn). I think it's pretty unlikely to have this kind of diversity around reference implementations with only Google in the game, which I don't love looking forward.",

Forking Chromium doesn’t really fix that — forks follow upstream, they don’t shape standards. \n\nIf Firefox dies, we lose the only major browser that:\n\n* isn’t tied to an ad business (Google), and\n* isn’t tied to a closed platform ecosystem (Apple).\n\nStandards also don’t protect us by themselves. Specs only matter when multiple engines implement them. If Chromium becomes the only serious engine, whatever it ships becomes the de facto standard, regardless of what the spec says.\n\nAnd from a dev perspective, Firefox is still a critical reference implementation. When things work in both Chrome and Firefox, you know you’re not relying on accidental behavior.\n\nSo it’s less “save Firefox out of gratitude” and more “the web needs at least one independent engine to stay healthy.”",

In 2021, her salary rose again to more than $5.5 million,[17] and again to over $6.9 million in 2022.[18] In August 2020, the Mozilla Corporation laid off approximately 250 employees due to shrinking revenues after laying off roughly 70 employees in January 2020.

We need Firefox/gecko and safari/webkit but it would be even better if we started to see more options as well. \n\nI think we are at a turning point in browser development right now though too. We are slowly finding uses for genetic browsers, one developer can now solo build out product (even if half-baked and riddled with vulnerabilities for the time being) with the help of agents and maybe the hurdle of developing new browsers from the ground up with unique principles and features will slowly start to shrink, opening up the market for better, more aggressive movement on the browser front… but I am probably just being overly optimistic.",

This was by design, they wanted *their* interpretation of the web to be the one everyone used because it would further fortify their dominance. This kind of approach is anathema to a free and open web, and is *very, very* bad.",

      "text": "I've been a web dev for most of my career, professionally at fortune 500 companies for over 8 years (mainly LAMP/WAMP). I've also built many side projects there were SAAS, and unfortunately never were profitable, but that's fine. They helped me build my resume/portfolio up, so it wasn't a waste of time IMO.\n\nBack when I made those SAAS products (\\~8 years to 2ish years ago, pre LLM's), it took quite some time to develop the product and you had to settle on a \"great\" idea to make it worthwhile to develop. After spending hundreds of hours making the MVP idea come to life, it'd be time to market it. At that phase, you kind of still had a chance to stand out, since everyone was in the same boat in terms of time spent on the idea, and effort put in.\n\nNow with AI tools and vibe coding, people are making websites and apps on a whim, and a ton of them are honestly junk. Either poorly coded, or just not useful or novel ideas. Even the ones that are good are completely buried by the insane amount of services being created. I'm actually grateful that these tools exist, but now we're in a different game where marketing is pretty much everything. Obviously marketing and the business side of a SAAS was a huge portion of it, but now it's become the primary blocker to creating a profitable product.\n\nI see a ton of people try out these AI tools and ambitiously think that they can create a product that makes them financially free, or at least get some side income. Because of this, the market has become absurdly saturated from a product and marketing standpoint. I'm sure some people are making successful businesses, but it's becoming a majorly decreasingly small percentage of projects that succeed, mainly due to the absurd levels of market saturation. Just a few years ago, if you wanted to make a SAAS website, you were genuinely competing with a pool of creators that was a fraction of the size of what it is now. \n\nTo make matters worse, it's becoming less obvious from the consumer side of what's just a trash product slapped together using AI, vs something that is actually worth paying for. Anyone can vibe code a project now in like an hour and plug in Stripe to accept payments. I see this is especially bad for SAAS products in industries like finance and social media. \n\nI don't want any of this to come off as negative, it's just a shift in the market. The barrier to entry now is so low, that you have to focus on more organic channels of sales like local markets, and build products that serve even more niche needs. I'm already starting to switch gears to more of a consulting strategy, where I try to find businesses that need specific web automation or support on existing enterprise products, rather than trying to create new SAAS products from scratch. And no do not DM me or ask for details about that, the point stands alone, and I don't use Reddit as a commercial channel in any capacity.\n\nI've seen other posts online about this, but they're generally just complaining like \"vibe coding/AI bad\", or some other doomer take. I feel like my skills are as valuable as ever, because I'm still working on projects that are super ambiguous business problems and can't be done without having the knowledge of the business ahead of the product and web code itself. On the other hand, a ton of people are hopping into web dev, marveling at their ability to quickly generate SAAS products, and thinking they've got something valuable. I hate to compare it to AI art, but it really is quite similar. Both are ultra saturated, so the value comes from the actual experience and implementation of the artist/web dev within the business itself, not just making something pretty that you can quickly pump out that \"looks good\". \n\nCurious if anyone else feels the same way about this.",

In addition all their marketing is the same too. \n\nIt's fairly easy to separate the spam, but perhaps that's because I've seen so many. \n\nEither way, I don't feel as pessimistic about it honestly. I'm iterating a side project now and all this saas slop is mostly helping me figure out just how to promote it when the time comes. \n\nIt doesn't seem difficult to stand out based on this, but maybe I'll check back here in a couple months to let you know if I regret my confidence.",

Here's the current the situation: there's a subset of people who want to make big bucks and bail, most of these people were the crypto bros a few years back. Now they see twitter threads saying: this guy makes 50k a month with his SaaS without knowing how to code!\n\nBut what they don't see is: people get lucky! The twitter algo picks you're crappy novelty SaaS, a lot of people suddenly pay $5 to you, you get big moneys, and that's it. But that happens for a tiny tiny slice of the population. Most SaaS made by people fail. Some people make great products but can't find the market fit. Others make shitty products in an already saturated market.\n\nWho will win? Whoever can make a product that makes a difference AND has the knowdlege and power to market it (and some luck, ofc). A simple example: I've been looking for an expense tracker app for weeks. The one I use has some flaws. If you search the app store there are +100 apps out there. But there's not a single one which fit my needs and that I consider good enough to use.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to make big bucks building a crappy SaaS, give it a try, it's easy to create the product, it's hard to make it stand out, it's hard to market, and it's unlikely to get it to make money, but it's easy to try I guess",

Probably more like oil rig management companies like Schlumberger who might develop embedded software they analyzes pipeline fluid pressure in real time and regulates machinery to keep it operating within safety params.\n\nClaude is unlikely to author that for you without heavy experienced Eng involvement, and a Pre-AI “sass website maker” wasn’t going to build that anyways.\n\nOr let’s take another extreme: small time shop owner wants to create an online place or storefront using basic web tools. Not even worth vibe coding this, you’re way WAY better off just using something like square space or webflow.. it’s such a repeatable cookie cutter solved solution that’s very cheap to do in these platforms",

          "text": "I think most of this post is plain wrong and pretty misleading for the Reddit community — not because “AI good / vibe coding good,” but because it mixes a few real observations with big unsupported leaps and then presents them like market truth.\n\nA few points:\n\n1) “Back then you needed a great idea” is mythology.\nYou didn’t need a “great idea,” you needed a clearly scoped problem, a buyer, and a distribution path. Tons of profitable SaaS are boring, obvious, and iterative. The hard part was always: pick a pain people pay for, position it, sell it, keep them paying. That hasn’t changed. If anything, faster build cycles make it easier to test whether an idea is good instead of betting “hundreds of hours” up front.\n\n2) “Marketing is everything now” is an overcorrection.\nIf “marketing” means “getting attention on X/Reddit/Product Hunt,” sure, that channel is noisier. But that’s not the same thing as “marketing is the primary blocker to profitability.” In most real businesses the blockers are still: willingness to pay, trust, switching costs, onboarding, retention, reliability, support, compliance, integrations. If your product actually solves a painful job and fits a real buyer workflow, you don’t need to win the influencer lottery.\n\n3) You’re confusing “more people shipping demos” with “more competition for customer budgets.”\nThe internet is flooded with low-effort launches because it’s now cheap to publish. That doesn’t mean the market is saturated in the only way that matters: customers already having a good solution they’re happy to pay for. A thousand junk clones aren’t meaningful competition for a product that’s embedded in a workflow, integrates with existing systems, and has support + reliability. Noise is not the same thing as saturation.\n\n4) “Success rates are shrinking because saturation” is a story, not a fact.\nSide projects have basically always failed at high rates. What changed is visibility: more people can ship something, so you see more failures (and more half-baked products) in public. That’s not evidence that the percentage of serious attempts that succeed is collapsing, it’s evidence that the denominator got filled with hobbyist attempts.\n\n5) “Consumers can’t tell trash AI from real products” is backwards in many categories.\nIn B2B and especially regulated/high-trust areas (finance, healthcare, security), buyers absolutely can tell quickly. The moment they hit missing edge cases, poor support, shaky compliance, or unreliable data handling, it’s over. In finance in particular, the barrier isn’t “Stripe checkout,” it’s trust, audits, risk management, and operational competence. AI makes it easier to fake a landing page; it doesn’t make it easier to pass diligence.\n\n6) “Anyone can plug in Stripe and accept payments” is a rhetorical trick.\nA checkout link is not a business. Real billing means taxes/VAT, invoicing, refunds, chargebacks, fraud, subscription edge cases, accounting, customer support, and legal/compliance depending on the domain. Reducing “getting paid” to “plug in Stripe” is exactly the kind of simplification that misleads newer builders.\n\n7) The conclusion (“you have to go niche/local/consulting”) is fine — but the framing is off.\nYes: narrower ICPs, specific distribution channels, and consulting/productized services are often the most reliable path. But not because “AI killed SaaS.” It’s because that was always how you win without an unfair distribution advantage: you find a clear buyer with a costly problem and you solve it better than their current workaround.\n\nA cleaner version of what’s true here:\n— Build is cheaper and faster.\n— Therefore the advantage shifts toward domain insight, trust, distribution, and execution depth (reliability, integration, support).\n— Public launch channels are noisier, so “generic SaaS for everyone” is harder to sell via vibes.\n— But that doesn’t mean “marketing is everything” or that SaaS is now pointless — it means the bar for differentiation and trust is higher.\n\nIf anything, the opportunity is bigger for builders who can:\n— talk to users, map workflows, and ship the unsexy parts (integrations, admin, audit logs, permissions, support),\n— wedge into an existing business process,\n— and sell directly to a defined buyer instead of chasing attention.\n\nSo yeah: lots of AI-made junk exists. But treating that as proof that “the market is absurdly saturated and only a tiny decreasing % can succeed now” is doom narrative, not analysis. The game didn’t become impossible — it became less forgiving to “build first, hope marketing works later,” which honestly was always the most common reason side projects died.",

Once you depart the positions that appear in books, it starts making illegal moves and blundering relatively quickly, which makes sense from the POV of a model that’s generating a plausible next move, not necessarily a good or even legal one.\n\nIn any case, LLMs are not actually doing the things you listed, at best they’re generating code based on what it’s been trained on. When you say “it fixes bugs” I interpret it as you finding the bug, prompting to fix it, and the model spitting out something that looks like a fix, but may still be incorrect, all while telling you it’s all fixed now. After all, if it can actually investigate, find and fix the bug, why was it wrong in the first place? That’s what you’d expect from a human. When you prompt it to plan a system for you, it’s just generating what looks like a plan, but it may be off.\n\nForgive me if I don’t buy that your solo Claude operation generated such a sophisticated enterprise SaaS product when the current poster project for LLM code is a web browser where the heavy lifting is done by a couple of open source libraries, and it still cost a few millions, IIRC, in tokens and API calls.\n\nEDIT: I guess I missed a pretty obvious question. If the LLMs can actually do all that, why not just add \"make it bug-free and secure\" to the prompt, let it take a couple more hours crunching and have a working, near-bug-free and near-secure product? No need to answer that, the API call for any given prompt takes about the same amount of time as the API call including \"bug free and secure\", which means the model didn't actually do any extra work.",

What's the point of a library? Instead, developers used it as a tool and learned to be better programmers. Swaths of programmers came up this way instead of traditional schooling.\n\nI remember when I was in traditional school and we had to learn C# and ASP.NET for frontend. We could just drag and drop full form elements onto the page and students and teachers alike were like: \"This is the future, eventually programming will be obsolete and everything will be drag and drop. For now though, we still have to connect our logic to it.\" That was like, 15 years ago. Sure, the web has come a long way, and a lot of easy things we can just drag and drop now. Turns out that even the companies and their workers don't want to do this, though. They'd rather hire out a company to do this for them.\n\nNot to mention businesses that need unique functionality that makes sense to them and their business, but may not fit anywhere else. Your boss is not going to want to prompt this, implement it, refine it, and deploy it - I guarantee it. It's the reason they have workers below them to begin with: delegation.\n\nEven the most sophisticated AI isn't going to be able to build a fully functional app if it's not given a full, descriptive picture. AI is a tool just as IDEs are a tool, just as search engines are a tool, just as spell-check is a tool. Like all tools it needs to be understood to be used properly and efficiently.\n\nAnecdotally, I find AI responses to be faster almost 10 fold than trying to search the same thing. If I know of a function or method in a framework, but don't quite remember the name or arguments - AI is wayyy faster than searching the docs for the same thing. It's just computation power. 99% of the time when it comes to actual documented framework it's right too which is helpful to me in my projects.\n\nThere's no \"getting rid\" of AI. Being able to crunch a solid subset of knowledge and algorithmly access it quicker than a search API query is super useful in literally all fields. Major governments around the world are using and integrating some form of it. It's in the Open Source communities where it will be perpetuated by hobbyists and professionals alike. Corporations are pushing it and integrating it.\n\nI don't think AI will lead to full automation of all jobs, but there's certainly a subset. The biggest concerns we should have as a society regarding AI is regulation, energy consumption, and UBI. That's what we should be talking about and pushing for.",

Using things like 12factor principles and Docker, external event processors with RabbitMQ, and dead simple flask scripts behind something like Traefik for routing let's you build super loosely decoupled apps that work together and the entire source-code can fit in a single prompt.\n\nSee the *arr stack for a rough approximation of that type of app development.\n\nI have built an enormous amount of tooling around this, beginning when Chatgpt first launched to do my own job.\n\nThe thing is, my job is hard, my usage is specific to me, and my role.\n\nThe understanding of software I needed to get to the point where I could do this reliably took my entire career and adult life, and I do not think is common amongst folks like my coworkers at my last job, who seem to face-roll their keyboard when chatgpt doesnt work and cannot seem to do what they want.\n\nI run a small townie local consulting company in metro detroit. I don't particularly have high aspirations as a career goal, but ive built a small build-in-the-open consulting company.\n\nThis fits into what I do perfectly. \n\nOpen-source software has very high ambitions, but struggles in manpower to challenge establishment companies short of massively successful products.\n\nA common tactic for legacy software companies is to offer smaller companies an on-ramp and then lock them down with vendor lock in. For example, Salesforce or Zoho might start as a simple contact manager, but before you know it, you're spending 5 figures a month. \n\nMigrations are hugely expensive and time consuming. A lot of small companies are running very old code bases as a result.\n\nThis let's me punch way, way above my paygrade. Where I would normally push a company to Salesforce, which locks them into costly subscriptions for a simple contact manager, im able to give them a much better, fully open-source application which is tailor made to them. \n\nThis is software developments Napster moment. Software, to me, has always been about software. I give away what I do. It was never about money. I do, of course, need to put food on the table.\n\nI don't think this is going to put me out of work. I do think it will put the people who took the clicks-not-code approach in a pinch.\n\nIt absolutely devalued portions of the industry. However, for enterprising and industrious folks, you will see the total destruction of legacy software vendors and democratization of software and ideas. You'll see a lot better open-source software. You'll see a huge uptick in garbage.\n\nFor the developers who are able to review the code quickly, and understand the big picture, who open-source their software are going to absolutely decimate legacy software like Salesforce, Oracle, parts of Google.\n\nThe whole thing sucks for the industry, but its here.\n\nEdit: ok guys, a nuanced take?!

No developer I've worked with ever knew nor questionied how the magic of some frameworks works - like Vue's proxy or Laravels automatic dependency injection. And no employer ever cared that I know how to develop these things myself. \n\nIn a past job we had very strict bandwidth limitations. I'm talking about limits like 100 KBs of initial load including all assets, so in practise we had like 10 KB left for our code. Common libraries would've taken a lot of that already. I've developed our own little \"jQuery\", our own animation library, and our own basic \"Vue\" specifically for our usecases. Devs, especially juniors, didn't need to figure out these things repeatedly themselves anymore and could spend more time actually coding for the project rather than google how to write an animate function in JavaScript.\n\nWhen I left that job, the only thing that interviewers asked was how much experience I have working in their 0815 stack specifically. It was always easy to show them my knowledge and experience right then and there, but coding the same thing 255 times each month, the same kind of API endpoint, the same kind of UI element, became depressing pretty quickly. From what I've gathered, creativity and deeper-than-surface-level knowledge is rarely asked for. Reasonable - why pay for skill that you don't need in your company?\n\nYour overengineered web app beats every single (frontend) web developer I've ever met by multiple magnitudes already. But that level of skill and knowledge isn't even remotely needed in most companies.",

Deep knowledge of the browser just *amplifies* what I can do with them. I've tried and worked with a lot of frameworks throughout my career. This particular project is built with Svelte plus a few pragmatic hacks -- for example, it shows a boot log immediately and only switches to the desktop once everything is ready. It hides latency without an ugly preloader. And this part is obviously not framework-based.\n\nAnd yeah, I'll be honest: the HR side of things is pretty depressing. Repeating how many years I've used React to people who can only process yes/no answers is draining, especially when that experience barely reflects what I actually know or enjoy doing.\n\nThanks for the compliment -- I really appreciate it. And for the record, the coolest web dev ever, in my opinion, is [mrdoob](http://mrdoob.com), the creator of Three.js",

So the challenge was more about how to capture everything in JavaScript and make a small algorithm which compresses the data to be sent. You can check how it works here:\nWhen recording I just save the full content of the input ( https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ) with the date every time it changes but when people are done and want to send it, the content is compressed like this: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ('a' is for append, 'd' for delete and 'r' for replace)\nThen the replayer uses compress data to show the process: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/replayer.ts",

But apart from that, if AI were really allowing developers to much more quickly ship at-least-barely-working stuff -- much less allowing non-developers to, as the evangelists keep claiming -- shouldn't we have seen some sort of major acceleration in new products or product features in recent years? \n\nI had the idea of looking up App Store transparency reports, but they haven't done 2025 yet. Looking at [2023](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2023-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) to [2024](https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/docs/2024-App-Store-Transparency-Report.pdf) we see a ~12% increase in the rate of app submissions, but also a ~10% increase in the rate of rejections. This isn't a wide-ranging look at the data, but what we can see hardly sounds like an industry that's becoming crazily more productive, *even at shipping crap*.\n\nApart from statistics, shouldn't we be seeing an insane number of new videogame releases, or social networking sites, or Excel competitors, or just... anything? The only sort of software we're seeing hugely more of is AI being haphazardly bolted onto existing products.",

But when people say it makes coding faster, unless you're not bothering to review and understand it, then it can't be THAT MUCH faster. Not at fast lightning speeds. The AI can do what it does, good or bad, at lightning speeds, but not you. You yourself will always have a slow input and output speed at which you can review and understand all the code.\n\nGiven that any speed gained from this, if any, is it really worth the billions going into these data centres, the amount of power they are consuming, for those tiny gains?\n\nLet's not even get started on the dangerous level of information it provides. I am finding a lot of the time it just really doesn't understand things, even simple things.\n\nSeems crazy to me the amount that is needed for AI, and I for one do not see this as a revolution at all yet. Not even close. My life has not changed at all since AI. I genuinely can't say it has made me more productive in any way shape or form. Even when asking it to explain something, I am constantly having to search up the answers myself to confirm because it can get things wrong so much. So would you call that being more productive? Considering before AI I would just search up the damn answer anyway. Now it seems I have this extra baggage of having to ask it something first and then end up doing the research myself.\n\nAt best, AI is just useful to talk to. If you are bored and want to entertain yourself, it's ok I guess. But for using it for anything that requires attention to detail? I think everyone has massively misjudged what these things are currently capable of doing.",

This way, near tech monopolies with billions of users can still be seen as growing.\n\nRegarding AI specifically, the claim is that it will be able to replace all those expensive workers and increase productivity, at a fraction of the cost. The incentives are aligned to make software engineers into people who just review AI code all day, and take the heat whenever something goes wrong.\n\nHowever, the current AI setup is extremely expensive and propped up almost entirely by investors, with no foreseeable path to make enough revenue to cover their absurd expenses.\n\nFor the near future, I predict it will continue to be an excuse to fire employees in economic downturns, while still keeping shareholders under the illusion that things are great. It will push the engineers with jobs to churn out slop and be responsible when AI breaks everything.

I actually had a lot of success refactoring some problematic systems at my work with AI that no one had been able to untangle for years.\n\nThat being said, the one thing I didn’t expect was how fast AI would accelerate bad and problematic code. The bad AI code comes in at a far higher rate than what AI can fix so right now I am seeing AI as a net negative for software overall. A lot of times too, bad AI code is hitting some context or other limit of AI which means other AIs can’t fix it.\n\nI don’t really know what is going to happen but it doesn’t seem great. I think it’s kind of a reflection of our society right now where we are constantly having all these “productivity” gains but it just doesn’t feel like we know how to use them or that the average person feels them at all.

      "text": ">TLDR: Netlify didn't auto-renew my domain and my app went dark for 3 days, their support was nonexistent. Keep your DNS separate from your web host for better control and resilience.\n\nI'm posting this as a cautionary tale for anyone trusting \"set it and forget it.\" Especially for anyone using Netlify.\n\nI have a small side project (hundreds of unique visitors/month). The app is deployed on Netlify and the domain is registered through Netlify (via Name.com). Auto-renew was enabled for the domain name. **Netlify even emailed me in December saying everything was set and no action was required.**\n\nThen a few days ago the site was unreachable.\n\nNo recent deployments, no DNS changes. Wtf?\n\nThe domain started returning NXDOMAIN everywhere.\n\nI saw the domain was \"auto-renewing\" in Netlify and the DNS changes were \"propagating\". I think, ok maybe there will be some brief downtime -- not something I've experienced with a domain renewal before but maybe not outside the realm of possibility?\n\nThen a day goes by...so I submit a support ticket on Netlify. Nothing.\n\nAnother ticket...Nothing.\n\nDM Netlify on X. Nothing.\n\nI contact Name.com and they say they can't do anything, only Netlify can remove the hold.\n\nFile a 3rd ticket with Netlify, still nothing.\n\nFinally I posted on X and tagged Netlify. Then they intervene (bless the Netlify social media manager).\n\nOnce it was escalated, the fix was literally \"renew domain/clear hold\" but until then, there was nothing I could do.\n\nTotal downtime was almost 3 days. Obviously this isn't a big deal for a little app like mine, but it might have been a big deal for some of you.\n\nThe root cause ended up being a domain renewal edge case:\n\n* auto-renew didn't prevent expiration\n* domain was placed on clientHold at the registry\n* Netlify's UI wouldn't allow me to disable auto-renew (and therefore renew manually)\n* multiple support requests got **no acknowledgment at all (still haven't received anything communication from Netlify)**\n* the issue was only fixed after I publicly tagged Netlify on X\n\n**Takeaways for anyone shipping side projects:**\n\n* domains are production infrastructure\n* auto-renew is not a guarantee!\n* coupling registrar with DNS and hosting is a **single point of failure**\n* monitor WHOIS/NXDOMAIN when renewal is coming up\n\nAlso, I **still** haven't heard back from anyone at Netlify as to why this happened. I think the form on their support page is likely broken. Also their AI support bot is completely useless.\n\n/rant",

I don't disbelieve they dropped the ball here, but I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt on this being a mistake more than deliberate or even just not caring. It's just math: they make money on renewals, and auto-renewals are a fantastic way to lock in cash flow. They have an incentive to do it right, and it's probably safe to assume somebody dropped the ball in a way they will care about fixing.\n\nBuilding tech is hard, and even giants like AWS and Cloudflare \"go down.\" I'm not defending them at all, but I suppose I do see it more neutrally, not something that's likely to be a 'run like hell\" type of thing.

Calculates the distance and direction, takes the angle and charge needed to reach that target. Then I have it able to add a forward observer that can give adjustments from their perspective. It also gives time of flight and a timer for when you shoot.\n\nIt worked surprisingly well, but I would have a really hard time trusting it for something actually important.",

I started dabbling last year with AI, and more recently gone much deeper with Claude.\n\nI just spent the last week converting a 15-year old long abandoned project of mine to a completely different framework and adding tons of features. Like 2-3 months of **full-time** work compressed into a week easily. Multiple 12 hour days. Yesterday alone I spent 18 hours. This was a very big and complex project. Not just another to-do list type of thing. Native pro-level desktop application on Windows and Mac that once upon a time I charged hundreds of dollars for. \n\nHowever it does make tons of mistakes and wrong assumptions. Everything needs to be broken down into tiny chunks, and thoroughly explained in detail. You have to hold its hand, monitor what it’s doing, test, bugfix, test again.\n\nSo, no, it’s not like the tech bro propaganda that claims you can just tell it “build me an app that does X” and it just magically does it all. That’s a complete fairy tale. I wouldn’t trust anybody who claims that. You still need to know how to code first.\n\nBut god damn does it save massive amounts of time. Just explain the whole concept of what you want a particular button or checkbox to do, and it’ll do hours of work in minutes. I’ve found it’s best to keep an eye on what it’s doing (it gives live output of its thought process) so that when it’s done you can say “I notice you said this, but actually it should be this”.\n\nI’m addicted. I haven’t been this excited about a coding project in years. I feel like it has given this old man a fresh breath of energy and life.\n\nIf you haven’t already, dive in now or you absolutely will be left behind.\n\nEDIT: I knew I was gonna trigger a lot of people with this. Not surprised. I’ve been accused of being a bot, of using AI to write this, of using too many emojis, of being a worthless boomer, and also being a naive youngster making all this up. I’ve repeatedly explained my own skepticism about AI, and how much I detest tech bro culture. It didn’t seem to matter. My god you people are insufferable.

It had a few use cases here and there, basically a little easier to use Stackoverflow was how i saw it.\n\nThen i got access to ChatGPT paid version through my work, suddenly ChatGPT felt capable. It kept track of conversation, it stopped hallucinating as much, it maintained memory across chats to know my coding preferences.\n\nThen I got a github copilot subscription. I didn’t get the token/request usage, so i only used chatgpt5-mini or so. Having chatgpt in my editor was a great addition. Good autocomplete, fixing bugs, scaffolding simple code (with issues here and there). I worked like that for about a year.\n\nThen i found out about better models being included for free in this subscription, like Claude Opus 4.5 etc. Suddenly AI was able to build complexer things, not making the mistakes it had been making. My only complaint was it didn’t follow the project standards as i wanted.\n\nSo i wrote documentation AI could use (copilot-instructions.md / AGENT.md etc. there are various standards for this).\n\nI did some tests. I build out a component following our usual work style, and separately i asked AI to build it, it did it just as good (sometimes better), following are standards, giving improvements where possible. Suddenly it was like a capable coworker.\n\n\n— As for fully vibe coding, which was your original question. This is where the line between engineering and just asking.\n\nI recently build some things with Lovable.dev. I wrote a deep explanation of an app i wanted to build. (Which pages, which features, authentication, whicb api’s to use, which colors i want, plus an example site to copy the layout of).\n\nIt build this app 95% perfectly in just 10 minutes. I needed to enter some API keys in the environment variables and it worked.\n\nI dove into the code and wasn’t such a fan. Some components were very large, did multiple things.\n\nFor the next app i added a code quality section to the prompt. The result was much better code quality.\n\nYou can keep iterating on them (or just edit the code yourself within lovable (or just push to github, it jntegrates).\n\nYes, you can fully vibe code. Or just scaffold with AI.\n\n—- more modern version:\n\nI’ve been playing with AntiGravity for fun. Google’s new AI IDE. It is very fun to build like this, my technical knowledge does really help me making solid apps or features.\n\nI’m a freelance web developer for a year now. I’ve had jobs recently where i needed to build features which would take me 3-4 hours of work to build, which AI now builds in minutes. I always do thorough code reviews on what it produces, i still always unit test, i run e2e tests and i do manual tests.\n\nAI has become a very capable tool for serious software engineers. Despite that, anyone can now vibe code what they want, that is until they run into larger issues. It can be difficult to fix issues if you don’t understand what is going wrong under the hood and AI can still get in a loop every now and then.",

Yt-dlp library already does this but it has a ton of flags that I just can't remember. So I asked gpt to build me a script that takes the url and downloads it accordingly to whether it's a single video or a playlist. I made it download in a certain directory and if I'm downloading a playlist I made it so it generates a new folder in the download directory with the name of the playlist.\n\nI am also working on large scale business to business software, and there's no way in hell I'm vibe coding that one.

AI is unreliable, it often attempts to write a functionality from scratch while there's already an industry standard library that does that exact same job (and I don't mean things like auth, but more like image compression and stuff).\n2. It's not secure, it doesn't think ahead about all the edge cases and even obvious bugs while writing the code, it just gives you exactly what you asked it for\n3. It always gets messy in large scale projects. This one might just be me, since I exclusively work solo and freelance, for example I never had to review someone else's code or merge a PR. But you know the saying \"if it takes one dev one month to build an app, it takes two months for two devs to build the same app\"? That's the best way I can explain this, whenever I need to change something or work on a new feature, I have to reread the code it previously written and understand how it works again.

Then code reviews providing feedback after each step. Then yes, you can build an entire app without writing any of the code. Simply directing how it should be coded and ensuring it's coded properly.  \n  \nIt also depends greatly on what you are building. A basic Nextjs frontend connected to existing and well documented APIs is much easier than a full stack application. Heck some people are making static websites.

It grew into a real application with an advanced architecture — front end, back end, API layer, tests, CI — but it took months, not hours. And the repo is sitting around 400 commits and roughly 75K lines of code.\n\nBut still, 100% AI generated code. Yes, real software doesn’t technically need any human-written code anymore. But….and it’s a big but…. it still needs human engineering.\n\nBecause you don’t “vibe” your way to a coherent 75K-line codebase by accident.\n\nTo keep it moving in the right direction, I had to act as the director for a whole ecosystem: multiple models, multiple agent/guardrail instruction files, and a ridiculous amount of CLI tooling to keep the codebase consistent, debuggable, and buildable. Even a shallow tree view shows thousands of files/directories (and sure, some are deps/assets), but the surface area you’re orchestrating is still massive.\n\nOf course a macOS app is an entirely different beast than a mobile app but that’s even more of a reason to say yes. That’s also why the “anyone can build a full app in 1–2 hours with no background” claim is usually a template demo that survives only on the happy path.\n\nTo me it’s like advanced calculus with a graphing calculator: the calculator can produce answers, but you still need the fundamentals to know what you’re solving, how to use the tool, and whether the output is even valid.\n\nSo yes — AI can write all the code.\nBut without SE fundamentals (and the prompt/tooling discipline to steer it), you’re not building software — you’re generating output and hoping it turns into a product.",

          "text": "I don't know much about coding, though I have learned quite a bit over the last few months. I do have a fairly extensive knowledge of systems and how to put pieces together.   I was playing around one evening and thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could build an automation that can read bank statements, flag specific types of deposits or withdrawals, show me a screenshot of those transactions, and give me a PDF file so I can go and request the information.  I gave ChatGPT and Gemini some prompts, and within a couple of hours, I had a working react/vite app running locally on my machine, with built-in parsers for 7 different banks, that was accurately parsing the statements and doing exactly what I wanted. I showed it to my boss, who said he wanted it, but I didn't want to email my technology, so down the rabbit hole I went.  \n  \nUsing AI prompts and the AWS ecosystem, I've built a system that has a dedicated auth platform, which validates emails, requires TOTP, and is an SSO for multiple front-end applications. My front-end and back-end are completely separate, with the exception of using the session-validator to determine if a user has the credentials to see an application. \n\nEverything was built with a security-first, zero trust, least permission posture, so most of my endpoints are inside of a VPC with multiple layers of security, so if there was a breach, there would still not be a way to get into the data. The things that can't be in the VPC are all WAF protected, and I have extensive security logs. It's a multi-tenant system, and because of how the CDK code was built, it can be used over and over and over. Nothing is hardcoded, so, in theory, it should only take a few minutes to spin up a white label auth system for a different company. The authorization system is not industry-specific, so someone could take any sort of application they built, plug it in, and use it. The auth system doesn't care what an application is, just that the user has the proper credentials and validation token to be in it.  \n  \nIt certainly hasn't been an hour of work, but it is something that I've done by myself while leveraging AI.  I started on this project on October 31st last year. I'd guess the cost to get to where I'm at in the process would have been at least $200,000. That's something that would never be in my reach.\n\nLike anyone new to this kind of stuff, the first month of me in this was building this ridiculously gigantic beast of a monolith, where everything was interconnected and super-easy to break. It didn't take any real genius to understand compartmentalizing each aspect would make it easier to plan out the steps, and easier to troubleshoot when something didn't work correctly. \n\n  \nTo be honest, I don't know if I'll ever do a thing with this, but I might. And even if I don't, my AWS costs are about $120 a month. I was paying over $200 for a bunch of services that were hard to tie together, didn't work very well, and were constantly frustrating me. So, it's a win for me either way.",

      "text": "I want to share an honest experience here so you guys can avoid this and do proper research about companies beforehand. This is my and others combined experience regarding this organisation.\n\nThe company is run by a single person with around 12-15 employees. Its a startup so not a lot of expectations but some things are straight out bizzare.\n\n\n\nWork Culture context:\n\n* Monday to Saturday working\n* 10 to 7:30 (almost everyday stretching upto 8:00 - 8:30 minimum)\n* Saturday (10 to 4:00) stretching upto 4:30 - 5:00 sometimes\n* Its a 2 BHK room as a workplace\n* No seperate washrooms for boys and girls\n* No mirror in washroom etc.\n\n\n\nWhen you join it seems fine for a few days but after a week or two things get worse for you, for example:\n\n1. Every single day the working hours stretches upto 8 - 8:30 because the owner here likes to review the work we are doing, it feels like he purposely comes out late from his room most often after 7:30 - 7:45 and then reviews work one by one talking to each of the employee, till our time comes he expects us to wait in the office itself until review is done, and also we need to add daily status email and fill in gitlab on top of this unnecessary review.\n\n2. Sometimes work is assigned in second half of the day and that needs to be done the same day making it hard for us to leave on time, even if the client might have sent the email and stuff 2-3 days back the employees here recieve it at the last moment expecting it to be done.\n\n3. There are very less people around 12-15 employees only, and here most of only freshers fresh out of college are being hired, the old employees either leave once they recieve their bonus because of the working conditions or are being fired for wierd reasons. \n\n4. I have also noticed once the new employees the freshers get hired the owner kind of stops speaking softly with the old employees, and finds more problems in the work or anything else as he have someone else now as replacements.\n\n5. The employees here are not supposed to chat or have a laugh in the morning hours, or in afternoon and stuff like that, then the employees recieve emails regarding behaviour and code of conduct saying what is acceptable and what is not.\n\n6. One incident where a guy was fired because he was sick and instead of calling the owner on phone to ask for leave he just put in a email taking sick leave (like in normal companies this is absolutely acceptable), but here the owner fired him because of that reason and then later called everyone in his office to say that you are supposed to call on phone for leaves otherwise strict action will be taken like this and other similar stuff.\n\n7. Also the owner expects you to be on time in the morning, if you are late for 3 days in a month even if you are waiting till late hours then too your 1 day salary will be deducted, even if you have to wait late upto 8 - 8:15 that is not considered.\n\n8. There is grace period for arrival given of 15 - 30 mins so you can come upto 10:30 after that it will be considered as half day. Everytime the rules change sometimes its half day after 2:00 sometimes its at 11:00 and what not, it gets wierd.\n\n9. There are no seperate washrooms for girls and the boys, there is no mirror in the washroom to look into, we need to look up in the showers head reflection to fix ourselves, and definitely its worse for the girls because of that.\n\n10. For developers its much more worse, there is one senior guy (the only senior guy) who writes his entire code using ChatGPT, and later acts like how his work finished in a few hours and why others take so much time, later other developers have to debug that code cause he broke the functionality built by other developers, when asked he will say \"Chotasa hi fix hai, mereko kam hai, khud karo (Its a small fix, I am busy so do it yourself)\". And he is like the owners favourite because he delivers his job fast but causing others to spent more time to fix it for him and no one can't even complain.\n\n\n\nAnd Honestly thats not everything, there is no proper management of anything at all, there are no proper coding standards, no proper documentations to refer, no proper code reviews, no proper testing - if it works and does not break then ship it thats all. The codebase looks like mess, there is so much redundancy and single files having 9k-10k lines of code and functions instead of seperating them.\n\n\n\nThe problem is most of the people working here are freshers, hence they don't say anything about all this stuff. They need to have that job in order to keep family happy. But leaving late everyday, overworking and burnout is real. I have also see that the people joining here mostly abandon the job within the few months or days itself else are stuck because of family issues and 90 days of notice period.\n\n\n\nAlso the issue is the old employees who worked here or were here have not added reviews on platforms like glassdoor or ambition box at all. And I cannot say much here cause there are so less people already in the office so I can only state the most generic stuff here.\n\n\n\nI have read horrible stuff on reddit here regarding jobs, some might say that this is normal in IT companies but I wanted to share this for freshers as the hiring might start sometime later.\n\n\n\nI suggest all of the freshers and people who are searching for a job to first review the company properly no matter what, try to connect with old employees to ask them why they left, or connect with working employee to understand the culture cause in the long term it is going to matter.\n\n\n\nAlso a request to people to leave honest reviews about workplaces so it can help avoid falling into this again.\n\n\n\nCompany Name: **SaffireTech** (Mumbai, India)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis post is based on multiple experiences and observations shared by current and former employees, combined with my own. It is not intended to defame any individual or organization. Others may have had different experiences.",

They are either subcontracted or work for mid and small businesss.\n\n\nInternal demand dosnt really exist, for software apart from tiny government contracts, which by the way are gobbled up by corrupt politicians.\n\n\nWhat makes it worst is the no. of people obsessed with getting CSE degree. If talent was finite this situation would never exist.\nAnd to make it further worst India has no proper industry, to employ the number of graduates it produces each year in full capacity, so even chemical engineers are completing there for dev jobs. \n\n\nOn top of that there are many paths — those who actually did go through exams like JEE still have to compete against those who didn't. These second type of degrees will just pick anyone from street, so long as 12 years of prior education is there they will allow them anyway.\n\n\nChina prevents such situations by having one path for one role, and choke it early so by the time people graduate they have enough jobs for at least those that graduate. \n\n\nOfcourse you can't really compare india with China interns of employment. Because China is extremely well managed and has a huge industry, even if working conditions are 996 style.",
