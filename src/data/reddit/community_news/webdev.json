Hours before he went on air, he released a proposal to \"fix Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\"\n\n> https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348238/zuckerberg-dorsey-pichai-section-230-hearing-misinformation\n\n> CDA230 is the rule that says that the people who publish unlawful speech should be accountable for it – not the service providers that hosted the speech (but it does allow online services to moderate speech it finds offensive).\n\n> CDA230 is among the only good technology laws the US Congress ever adopted, and without it, no one would ever host your complaint about a business, your #MeToo whistleblowing, your negative reviews or your images of official corruption or police violence.\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/03/25/facebook-has-a-facebook-problem/\n\nYeah, you're not going to like him if you're mostly okay with the economic status quo, but don't make stuff up. Cory is not Lisan al-Gaib or whatever, but he has a lot of good ideas and a talent for making something as boring as bilateral trade agreements interesting. I found [this recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C1Gnxhfok0) interesting and engaging. I also don't think he claims everything he talks about to be *his ideas*, either. A lot of it comes from the EFF",

They are the same types of people who monetize over the latest fad, whether its paranormal, aliens or dumping on celebrities. I wouldn't let it worry you.\n\nThe problem isn't AI driven development, IMO. It's the person submitting the code. I've been in the business since the 90's and interviewed tons of people who didn't know enough to realize they knew very little about programming. They get weeded out and hopefully learn where their deficits are. If someone is tricking their way into a position by submitting vibe coded slop, then that's on the interviewers. Hell, I've been burned by fakers and ne'er do-wells before, and its frustrating. You want to trust them. But their ability to bullshit through an interview will get them in the door more times than I like. \n\nIn the enterprise world, we use AI all day, but only as a tool. A really good tool, but it doesn't mean we get to cram more tickets in a sprint. We still have rules to follow, proper code reviews on Merge Requests, QA, Jira and Confluence hygiene, Scrum, you name it. Coding is a small fraction of the work, but when stuff goes wrong, there is a lot of blame to go around. Someone failed along the journey to catch it. \n\nIn my case, a deployment of mine failed because I discovered that I left in some debug code inserted by Claude. It was totally my fault, not Claude. I have to stand by every single line. Luckily, it was a good learning opportunity for us early in our AI coding decisions and we are all learning its strengths and weaknesses, but have no illusions on just how much productivity you can squeeze into a sprint that has built in time sinks for non-coding work. \n\nIn the enterprise world, I'm not worried about AI.

A fan looked into it, profiling and disassembling the game, and discovered that the load time was due to the game loading a 10 megabyte hunk of JSON data with 63,000 entries, and then parsing it in a way that caused the game to iterate over the entire entire JSON string, from beginning to end, for every single item (so parsing 10 megabytes of text 63,000+ times).",

They start adding absolutely ridiculous metrics like trying to calculate how much of your code is written by AI versus by you, check to see how frequently you're using the apis via tooling (IDEs, CLIs like Code Puppy, etc...). Their goal is to fully implement AI as coders and humans as reviewers. You already have tools like Qodo Merge that can actually do a very good job at code reviews but still requires manual intervention. It has a bunch of false positives that show up but with time that will get better as well. \n\nThe major Gap that I've seen so far is that for experienced engineers at senior level or above, this can absolutely speed up their development and they'll catch the problems they see for the most part. However, for the Junior and mid-level, they don't have the experience necessary to understand what is actually happening when they do their reviews. They don't have the reps in to identify issues that are only gained by experience. \n\nThis is just the opinion of a two decade software engineer forced to try to use AI to replace my knowledge so I can watch it wither away along with my career.\n\nI'm just glad this didn't exist when I was starting my career. I wouldn't have the skills I do today, especially in staying calm when things go wrong, having to design an architecture from scratch with no tooling, and learning how to problem solve without extra tools beyond debug messages and AltaVista -> Google search",

This obviously leads to the junior positions in many companies completely decimated due to both the shrinkage of the demand(1 junior with a claude subscription can replace 5 juniors from 2020) and the supply (everybody can code with ai).\n\nAll the current senior devs still have their experiences and expertise from the last 2 decades and won't be negatively affected by the adoption of ai, but there will come a time where they'll retire and have to hand over the role of \"senior\" to the little juniors.\n\nA senior solves a problem by thinking about it from more perspectives, usually out of their years of experience, completes the overall skeleton of the solution and hands the mundane part to the juniors, where they learn how the overall architecture and system should relate to each other and function properly. Obviously seniors also know how to use ai, so companies will stop hiring juniors to save on costs, and when the seniors eventually retire, there will be no new seniors since all the juniors were never there in the first place.",

Code becomes disposable, and software is constantly reinvented and recycled. Software developers less and less look at code, they just get the AI to do stuff and then make sure it conforms to requirements. On the one hand of this means juniors can exist, because their role is basically splitting up work into very small chunks (absolutely a skill) and holding the hand of the AI through it. On the other hand this is actually slower than building good quality software in the medium and long term, but businesses don't care, because businesses never care about that sort of thing.\n\nSoftware development then is forced into this cycle: ship crap, restart every few months when the model hits its limit. Our entire industry reshapes. New SDLC models emerge, are hyped, and entire consultancies built around deploying them (ah la Agile). New frameworks emerge on this model (eg rest framework that wrap you in a secure sandbox, managing externalities, allowing your code to be as shit as you like). Many breathless blog posts are written about how to be efficient in this model.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been learning the piano in this timeline for multiple years.

Then after that people would draw on a computer and then design each building component and send that off to be made and then make designs for the builders to follow whilst construction. Then better software was made where you draw the building and it does everything for you. This massive productivity boost didn't lead to job losses and we still have junior architects today.\n\nWe're going through this same change now. In 10 years time maybe we won't even be writing code, we'll just write a list of things that must happen when events are fired or APIs are called. Like how buildings have got bigger with more requirements and more materials and cheaper maybe software will too but we will still need people with technical understanding, design and vision in one way or another",

It’s like saying the victims of Hiroshima are to blame because they couldn’t run fast enough.\n\nSociety as we know it and as we implement it to date requires people.\n\nThose people earn money, and those people cost money. If a business is successful, it means the workers earned much more than they cost.\n\nIf work in a large enough chunk of the economy becomes a dancing contest between humans and AI, well—humans have to study for decades at a great expense to become experts at something like programming. If the whole field is destroyed, faulting them for failing to anticipate the destruction of their investment leads where exactly? A maximumly agile person in the world you describe isn’t allowed to develop expertise because the investment is likely to be eradicated by AI. The whole game of reducing worker numbers while increasing output can’t go on forever without collapsing the economy, so this Muskian blame just really doesn’t hold water. The system doesn’t promise to replace what’s destroyed, and humans can’t spend $100k + 8 years of study in an instant in order to redirect. Like asking a 50 year old to make that investment is crazy because the time it would take to recover it even if they commit to a total career change is much more likely not to be realized.\n\nLike I’m 50, my son is 18.\nI’m a programmer and I’ve been put out of work by AI. \nMy family needs money, but none of us are skilled with valuable skills (even though my skills are recently THE MOST valued).\nThe cost for skills is $100k.\n\nWho gets the $100k skills? Me or the 18 year old.\n\n18 year old is better get because I’m more likely to die at they point. But then what? The 18 year old is a slave for his family and when he grows old has nothing?\n\nAt best you displace your burden one generation.\n\nYou assign blame, but sound daft. Most likely, you will not survive.",

A Reddit user shares an opinionated [article](https://webmatrices.com/post/vibe-coding-has-a-12x-cost-problem-maintainers-are-done) pointing to another [article](https://www.radware.com/blog/threat-intelligence/synthetic-vulnerabilities/), which in turn references an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21634) written in August 2025. The root of the problem is that the arXiv paper is pretty bad: it uses a dataset ([HMCorp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04704)) that generated pairs of functions (human-generated, AI-generated) by stripping the docstring and letting ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo recreate the same code. The authors expanded this ancient dataset with their own ancient models (DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct 33B, released in November 2023, and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 32B, released in September 2024), and all this methodological mess was needed to claim that AI models write flawed and vulnerability-ridden code. A much better summary of this \"research\" would be:\n\n\"When outdated AI models are given vague instructions without project context, they write generic, simple code that fails to use all function arguments and defaults to insecure patterns.\"\n\nPlease, people, if you cannot evaluate a research paper on your own, don't mindlessly share it, or at least ask GPT-5.2 Thinking or Gemini 3 Pro to critically analyze the paper for you instead of spreading misinformation. Trust me, any of those models is able to perform much better analyses than most people.\n\nOn the other hand, as a security researcher, I had a good laugh when I read this, since nothing could be further from the truth:\n\n> human mistakes tend to be low-to-medium severity — typos, minor logic flaws, a missing null check. messy but catchable.",

Cloudflare has been making really smart moves lately with their developer tools and this acquisition gives Astro the resources and infrastructure to scale properly.\n\n\n\nWhat I find interesting is the timing. Astro has been gaining a ton of momentum as the go to framework for content heavy sites that need to be fast. Cloudflare obviously sees value in owning that space especially with their Pages platform competing directly with Vercel and Netlify.\n\n\n\nThe real question is whether Astro will stay framework agnostic or if theyll start pushing deeper Cloudflare integration. One of Astros strengths has been that you can use it with React Vue Svelte whatever and deploy anywhere. If they start optimizing specifically for Cloudflare Workers or Pages that could be great for performance but might alienate people who want to deploy elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side Cloudflare has a pretty good track record of keeping their acquisitions open and community focused. Wrangler and Workers are still usable outside the Cloudflare ecosystem so hopefully Astro stays similarly flexible. Plus having Cloudflares resources behind it means better docs faster bug fixes and potentially some really interesting performance optimizations at the edge.\n\n\n\nOverall this feels like a win for both sides but time will tell if it stays true to what made Astro appealing in the first place.",

I think that coding is not literally for me. I'm burnt out from this job, I'm burnt out from this career itself, there is no joy here tbh. I almost feel like I'm a machine who needs to go at some place from mon-fri do this and that and then spend my weekends in anxiety that omg wtf am I doing with my life.\n\n\nI'm a very creative guy, I've tried music, singing, writing in the past. Also, I'm thinking to be a technical writer because I just love writing, bit coding is really hard for me I feel like an imposter and I don't want to do a job which is as fucked as me not feeling a passion to do what I'm doing.\n\n\nIt would be a great help if there are people who can guide me the jobs in tech or outside of it that actually involves very less/no coding at all and is pretty a good one to invest in.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so so much everyone, for your genuine responses, I'm really getting clarity and you know what I think my role should look like it should be where I'm the lead, where I'm the visionary leader, where I divide tasks, manage teams, I think I'd love something like this.

I got laid off 7 months ago and have only had 3 interviews, making it to final two twice but not getting the job. \n\nI have also felt like a complete imposter the entire time, barely staying afloat. I’ve been laid off from every dev job I’ve had so not only is the imposter syndrome stressful but I feel like there is no job security and the future looks much more bleak.\n\nI’m turning 40 years old this year and have been feeling totally lost. I started my dev career when I was 30, after skipping college and hopping around between low wage entry level office jobs, with all signs pointing to this career in web development being in demand and super stable well into the future. \n\nMy 25 year old friend manages a coffee shop in my neighborhood so my fallback has been to start a new career as a barista at 40 years old. Woof.\n\nHowever my luck has changed somewhat recently. Luckily my wife is a very talented senior shoe designer that is beloved by everyone at her company. The VP for the costing department has been struggling to fill a position for a Senior Costing Analyst and is willing to train the right person. After researching the role I discovered plenty of skills that translate from dev to this role and it sounds pretty interesting to me. I generalized my resume to cater to the position and had a chat with the VP and it’s looking pretty promising and pays well. I’m having to learn excel which is a simple breeze compared to programming. \n\nSo my advice would be take advantage of any networking you can and do some research into open positions that sound like something you could generally be interested in. There are so many jobs out there that I had no clue even existed. After learning programming I feel like learning anything else is possible and probably a lot easier. You just gotta find someone willing to take a chance on you.\n\nGood luck!",

I can do this with ai in a few minutes...\" ... Yeah, this is quite a lot that almost every frontend dev has to deal with these days.\n\nPersonally I'm trying to keep design and dev in balance because creativity is something you can't just toggle on/off or force. So when ever I feel drained, I'm diving more into dev, once I'm tied of dev and feeling creative again, I'm jumping back into design. A benefit of doing my own thing and working only with clients I want to work with. \n\nIf you're in a corporate world, try agency. Simply because being a dev/designer in a company and doing things only for basically one client can be super exhausting. In am agency, you have multiple clients but also tighter deadlines and might have to deal with people who don't have the suggest clue about your work... Can be draining as well\n\n\nWhat you can try is focusing on something specific. Like building pages for a specific CMS. \nI've used to create/develop things for Joomla, WordPress, dipped my toes into TYPO3 but then switched entirely to HubSpot around 8 years ago. \nBest decision ever to be honest",

I looked at pages that had designs I liked, tried redesigning them with my own touch and thinking about how I'd slice then into assets for a table structure. Back then it wasn't that hard, as there was no such thing as responsiveness, fancy css or fancy js stuff. Even something like jQuery wasn't a thing at first. Every websites was basically just a big static table tag.\n\nAnd at it's core this approach hasn't changed. \nTables got replaced by divs or semantic tags. Css frameworks like bootstrap and tailwind became a thing to provide predefined and reusable css classes so you don't need to write everything from scratch every time. \nBut in the end, it's still the same. It just got fancier and easier to start & repeat. \n\nmy recommendation would be to start with the basics like HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. You don't need to master each of these languages, but a good foundation is very helpful. Also look into three atomic design principles by Brad Frost. This should boost your coding approach immensely. \n\nThe very first job i got was a freelance job in a marketing-like agency where I did basically everything. Designing stuff for internal purposes, building and maintaining the website of a sub company of the agency... At some point I landed a freelance job in a design agency and got hired by one of it's clients as a developer a few months later.",

          "text": "If you're 5 years in as an FE dev and claim to have gone through every stack, while I think you're probably being a bit hyperbolic and have gone through a lot of stacks, maybe that's part of the problem: lack of an area of focus .\n\nIf you're a front end, why such an emphasis on full stack? What drove you to try to many stacks? Was it a lack of joy found with any of them? Are you stuck in tutorial hell? Are you only building toy projects or have you tried to build something real? Are you exploring stacks due to your day job or just personal desire?\n\nMy suggestion is always to pick a stack, give it a real go, break out of tutorial hell with a personal project that has enough moving pieces to learn, and to stick with it long enough to get to know it a bit. If you're jumping around like crazy over 5 years, it might be that you just didn't stick with anything long enough to feel empowered to stop learning syntax and language quirks and to instead learn the program more broadly.\n\nEither way, I hope you find joy in whatever you choose. Software engineering is hard if you don't enjoy I, I feel you on that.",

DevOps - I love during my time as a dev learning git, building my own pipelines, working in cloudflare, working in K8s. But when I was younger working in software like this was always something I enjoyed. I will have to go and do a deep dive on AWS or Azure if I prefer to stay in the company I am currently in. \n\n2. Project management - In the place I work and also the place my friend works. Just hearing how poorly their projects are managed. How they work till about 1pm and the rest of the days they are in meetings discussing how they're going to work the project and then they have to go home and work some more. Also in my company projects are handled extremely poorly. \n\nSo these are the ideas I am playing with. \n\nDevOps I can at least shadow and learn where I am at the moment project management I will have to go and do courses. \n\nI hope you find your new direction or maybe find a way to revive your passion.",

Who knows? It may even be code, but in a different way, like running a consultancy or maybe something like digital art or even more out in left field.\n\nBut find the field that makes it feel like work isn't work.

If you’re an ex developer the tasks will usually be easier and you will often be valued by your team for like simply understanding a line or two of scripting or whatever. \n\nIt’s mostly about finding the right IT job, but if you can find a decent place it’s pretty good. \n\nSolve 5-15 tickets a day and log off, go play your guitar and enjoy life without thinking about work and burn out.",

With that said, I'm not convinced this changes a ton. It's for sure better than web dev, but you're still more or less facing the same sentiment of being a commodity.\n\nIt just depends on how that sits with you. When you say \"creative, music, singing\" it makes me think you're not a person that should be working on commodities... at the same time, you then mention technical writing, which is kind of the opposite. Bit conflicted on what to advise here, lmao. But FWIW, technical writing is cool. My journey went \"studying > nope, not being a dev > writing gig > project manager > product manager\". Still write a lot so I can relate to not wanting to be a dev and wanting to write. It *might* be worth a shot but I'm not sure technical writing is a good fit for someone that appears to be very creative.",

So many older coders just don’t know how to use AI or get the most out of it. But you have high school students building million dollars applications weekly that would take the top engineers at Google years to develop just a year ago. Claude is just better. Sorry. If you have a powerful AI workflow and know what you’re doing, there is actually nothing that humans are better at in every field, not just engineering. If this wasn’t true, i wouldn’t have been able to build a billion dollar business in sub 2 years with a team of 4. Every VC in the U.S. is begging to get in our Series A round next month. Why if AI is just hype? 4 people. Imagine. So the only valuable convos moving forward, for me at least, are convos with other engineers about their AI workflow and stack. Asking a question about coding is borderline embarrassing and actually would be grounds for not getting hired and fired at my company. It’s actually part of our interview process. We are specifically testing for how proficient programmers are with AI and rapidly weeding out anyone that is still that narcissistic and egoistical that they think they’re better than AI. I kid you not. It’s in our interview process as a trick question. It reveals everything if you agree with the comment above and yeah, pro tip, you’ll struggle to get hired anywhere if you don’t fully embrace AI. Queue the downvotes but I’m legit trying to help. People need to adapt. AI is not replacing you. It’s just displacing you. We are hiring dozens of coders right now but only those with an AI-first mindset.",

I joined during the initial beta, so know it really well.\n\nIMO it can absolutely be saved, but it'll need a fundamental shift in how it works.\n\nBack in around 2010 there was a push towards how SO handles the inevitable duplicate questions at scale. Some of us liked the idea of leaning into the wiki concept, and others wanted a single question. It's obvious which side won.\n\nI'd go back, and reopen all closed duplicate questions. I'd push people towards answering with high quality answers, and would reward those that provide canonical and combined sources for questions - have them merge instead of close, but with two threads and a canonical \"right\" answer if they both apply.\n\nFrom there I'd redo all the cool shit they used to be known for, real community shit with an updated feel, like:\n\n* A yearly tech conference, with cheap tickets, solid speakers, and dates around the world.\n\n* Lean into chat again, creating logs that can be cross-referenced. Maybe embed it into Discord, but with full logs that are then referenced via the site?\n\n* Bring back the job board, but lower the costs and make it cheap for start-ups to post jobs. Maybe acquire LeetCode or build a competitor that people can use for hiring? I'd also lean into Pramp-esque video chat and videos to allow people to run mock interviews, learn about complex topics, etc.\n\n* Open the platform to universities. Let them have private instances, and provide free accounts + benefits to CS students. Be the resource for students, so they continue to use after graduating.",

That slight variation, a niche of a niche, is what is valuable. \n\nIMHO, it tried to force humans to change how they contribute and seek information at a fundamental level instead of aligning with the natural flow of most people.

I've seen the Linux, security, dba-specific ones -- but also the gaming and movie SO sites are usually quite good.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to entice smart people to answer questions.

I think this was however also when their traffic started to surge, and they misinterpreted the health of the product as a result and missed the mark.\n\nthe product itself perhaps can survive as a niche product for helping with niche use cases of relatively smaller tools. even in that case, I’d probably sell to github since that overlaps a lot with community management / issue triaging / feature request handling of the tool and would benefit a lot from proper integration into those processes.",

      "text": "I've been a web dev for most of my career, professionally at fortune 500 companies for over 8 years (mainly LAMP/WAMP). I've also built many side projects there were SAAS, and unfortunately never were profitable, but that's fine. They helped me build my resume/portfolio up, so it wasn't a waste of time IMO.\n\nBack when I made those SAAS products (\\~8 years to 2ish years ago, pre LLM's), it took quite some time to develop the product and you had to settle on a \"great\" idea to make it worthwhile to develop. After spending hundreds of hours making the MVP idea come to life, it'd be time to market it. At that phase, you kind of still had a chance to stand out, since everyone was in the same boat in terms of time spent on the idea, and effort put in.\n\nNow with AI tools and vibe coding, people are making websites and apps on a whim, and a ton of them are honestly junk. Either poorly coded, or just not useful or novel ideas. Even the ones that are good are completely buried by the insane amount of services being created. I'm actually grateful that these tools exist, but now we're in a different game where marketing is pretty much everything. Obviously marketing and the business side of a SAAS was a huge portion of it, but now it's become the primary blocker to creating a profitable product.\n\nI see a ton of people try out these AI tools and ambitiously think that they can create a product that makes them financially free, or at least get some side income. Because of this, the market has become absurdly saturated from a product and marketing standpoint. I'm sure some people are making successful businesses, but it's becoming a majorly decreasingly small percentage of projects that succeed, mainly due to the absurd levels of market saturation. Just a few years ago, if you wanted to make a SAAS website, you were genuinely competing with a pool of creators that was a fraction of the size of what it is now. \n\nTo make matters worse, it's becoming less obvious from the consumer side of what's just a trash product slapped together using AI, vs something that is actually worth paying for. Anyone can vibe code a project now in like an hour and plug in Stripe to accept payments. I see this is especially bad for SAAS products in industries like finance and social media. \n\nI don't want any of this to come off as negative, it's just a shift in the market. The barrier to entry now is so low, that you have to focus on more organic channels of sales like local markets, and build products that serve even more niche needs. I'm already starting to switch gears to more of a consulting strategy, where I try to find businesses that need specific web automation or support on existing enterprise products, rather than trying to create new SAAS products from scratch. And no do not DM me or ask for details about that, the point stands alone, and I don't use Reddit as a commercial channel in any capacity.\n\nI've seen other posts online about this, but they're generally just complaining like \"vibe coding/AI bad\", or some other doomer take. I feel like my skills are as valuable as ever, because I'm still working on projects that are super ambiguous business problems and can't be done without having the knowledge of the business ahead of the product and web code itself. On the other hand, a ton of people are hopping into web dev, marveling at their ability to quickly generate SAAS products, and thinking they've got something valuable. I hate to compare it to AI art, but it really is quite similar. Both are ultra saturated, so the value comes from the actual experience and implementation of the artist/web dev within the business itself, not just making something pretty that you can quickly pump out that \"looks good\". \n\nCurious if anyone else feels the same way about this.",

In addition all their marketing is the same too. \n\nIt's fairly easy to separate the spam, but perhaps that's because I've seen so many. \n\nEither way, I don't feel as pessimistic about it honestly. I'm iterating a side project now and all this saas slop is mostly helping me figure out just how to promote it when the time comes. \n\nIt doesn't seem difficult to stand out based on this, but maybe I'll check back here in a couple months to let you know if I regret my confidence.",

Probably more like oil rig management companies like Schlumberger who might develop embedded software they analyzes pipeline fluid pressure in real time and regulates machinery to keep it operating within safety params.\n\nClaude is unlikely to author that for you without heavy experienced Eng involvement, and a Pre-AI “sass website maker” wasn’t going to build that anyways.\n\nOr let’s take another extreme: small time shop owner wants to create an online place or storefront using basic web tools. Not even worth vibe coding this, you’re way WAY better off just using something like square space or webflow.. it’s such a repeatable cookie cutter solved solution that’s very cheap to do in these platforms",

No developer I've worked with ever knew nor questionied how the magic of some frameworks works - like Vue's proxy or Laravels automatic dependency injection. And no employer ever cared that I know how to develop these things myself. \n\nIn a past job we had very strict bandwidth limitations. I'm talking about limits like 100 KBs of initial load including all assets, so in practise we had like 10 KB left for our code. Common libraries would've taken a lot of that already. I've developed our own little \"jQuery\", our own animation library, and our own basic \"Vue\" specifically for our usecases. Devs, especially juniors, didn't need to figure out these things repeatedly themselves anymore and could spend more time actually coding for the project rather than google how to write an animate function in JavaScript.\n\nWhen I left that job, the only thing that interviewers asked was how much experience I have working in their 0815 stack specifically. It was always easy to show them my knowledge and experience right then and there, but coding the same thing 255 times each month, the same kind of API endpoint, the same kind of UI element, became depressing pretty quickly. From what I've gathered, creativity and deeper-than-surface-level knowledge is rarely asked for. Reasonable - why pay for skill that you don't need in your company?\n\nYour overengineered web app beats every single (frontend) web developer I've ever met by multiple magnitudes already. But that level of skill and knowledge isn't even remotely needed in most companies.",

Deep knowledge of the browser just *amplifies* what I can do with them. I've tried and worked with a lot of frameworks throughout my career. This particular project is built with Svelte plus a few pragmatic hacks -- for example, it shows a boot log immediately and only switches to the desktop once everything is ready. It hides latency without an ugly preloader. And this part is obviously not framework-based.\n\nAnd yeah, I'll be honest: the HR side of things is pretty depressing. Repeating how many years I've used React to people who can only process yes/no answers is draining, especially when that experience barely reflects what I actually know or enjoy doing.\n\nThanks for the compliment -- I really appreciate it.

The main reason is that modern vanilla JavaScript has caught up to what jQuery made easy. Things like querySelector document.getElementById and fetch make DOM manipulation and API calls straightforward without needing a library.\n\n\n\nThat said theres still tons of legacy code out there using jQuery and if youre working on an older codebase youll definitely encounter it. Some WordPress themes and plugins still rely heavily on it. For new projects though most teams have moved to modern frameworks or just vanilla JS. The browser APIs are so much better now that the abstraction jQuery provided isnt as necessary.\n\n\n\nIf youre learning web dev I wouldnt prioritize jQuery. Focus on understanding vanilla JavaScript first and then pick up a modern framework like React or Vue. Youll pick up jQuery quickly if you ever need it since its just a simpler API wrapper around the DOM.",

Every niche has 50 clones, every “simple app idea” already exists, and the vibe around building stuff has gotten so weird. Now there’s “vibe coding,” where people who never really bothered learning a language are pumping out half-baked apps because they saw a tiktok about “making money with A.I\", on top of that, there are whole courses being sold on how to “create apps and get rich” without knowing how to code. It’s like a big circus.\n\n\n\nI’m not even mad at people for trying to improve their situation, but it’s hard not to feel depressed when you’ve put years into learning the craft and the whole market feels like it’s getting noisier and more shallow at the same time. Not to mention the people rooting against you, and saying that you'll be replaced, that you should watch out for A.I so you don't end up homeless... The same motherfuckers who used to go around saying that I.T is the profession of the future and that's where the money is.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall? If you got past it, what helped?

Very little I'm doing today couldn't be done with technology made a decade ago, with the added bonus of much more stability. It's not that I don't use AI, I do in some capacity, but it's but like hanging out with a bunch of friends who are obsessed with a TV show you have no interest in. I'm just really tired of hearing about it.\n\nI'm trying to lean into that. Leave the technical decisions to the young guns, they can pick whatever crap they collectively agree on, if they are uninterested in my default sensible / boring suggestions. Instead I focus on requirements, and what will best help the user. I think that kind of makes me a technical ba? Whatever.\n\nI also no longer code outside of work that much, though I admit AI is helping there. I would much rather hang out with my partner, watch movies, play videogames, learn piano, go outside.",

              "text": "Very similar in POV and time.\n\nI have opinions. I have things I don't really want to work in. But most times that really hasn't mattered. Either the client or the company I work for has dictated it. And I don't really see a reason to use some of the short list of big players that have established themselves.\n\nI've never really coded outside of work. I like coding but similar to your I like solving problems. And I've never had a problem so unique and important that making something myself was the only solution.\n\nAs far as AI - my company has been mandating it. Started out as using the AI Assistant in JetBrains. Which was pretty good. Great for rubber ducking. Debugging vague problems. Filling in some gaps that I have.\n\nWe have now moved on to more agentic coding per leadership. Claude Code is now part of my every day life.\n\nI hate to say it but it has put a little spark back in me. It's something new. Something shiny. Something that can be scripted and customized. I've always loved automation. Removing tedium. Not some new framework or language that's mostly the same thing as the last one.\n\nThere is a feature our product needs. It's not high priority or particularly complicated. It would just take time. But I have a solution in mind. A solution that I probably wouldn't get to do normally because of the time investment. But I really want to tackle it because I know I can architect it and Claude will spit it out in 10 minutes 80% of the way there and how I would have done it.\n\nI learned that you can a great deal of functionality with MCP servers. Found there are already several that can tie into our ticketing system's API. I could put in a slash command and I could pick a ticket, make a new branch, and pull in context.\n\nIt reminds me of when a company I worked for had priced themselves out of WordPress work but weren't pulling in the numbers form the bigger clients. So they decide to invest in a couple robust, developer friendly WordPress builders. I was offended. I know it's just WordPress but I still took pride in the way I did it.\n\nWhat I found out is that it removed a lot of the boring stuff. It allowed me to focus on the handful of important features. Turns out I didn't actually like fussing about making template files and admin forms. I liked solving problems.",

AWS certs, obviously. A+ cert as practice then Sec+ based on what was available locally. 100+ resumes (at that time) later with no responses, I'm 100 pages into the A+ book and I just think \"is this what you're supposed to do with your life?\"\n\nIt didn't help that the propaganda for vibe coding had hit a fever pitch while the deleterious effects hadn't yet become apparent. So I was feeling concerned at that point that vibe coders could actually replace real coders (though my experiences with the two dunces in my office who were doing it should have clued me in).\n\nSo I walked away - Sec+ book still in its wrapper. Sorry if you wanted a motivational story about getting back into this specific field, OP.\n\nI've still got my side gig, it's covering the bills. I have summers off, so I spent half of last summer converting my garage into a shop, doing woodworking, charcuterie/cutting boards. Hopefully moving into furniture this summer.\n\nI'm still coding, though. Working on a Unity game, aiming to have it in Early Access by summer. I have a couple niche website ideas I keep telling myself I'm going to put together and try to monetize.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I'm changing what I build, *and* taking a break from for working for someone else.",

Solve a problem for them, singular. If it can solve their issue, see if it scales. Worst case you get paid once, and maybe charge recurring maintenance fees.

You're likely sinking a ton of time without knowing if people are willing to pay or not. Know when to quit. \n\n3. The niche matters: look at legacy software in technologically behind practice areas. Stop trying to build a SaaS for a generic solution or a dumb AI prompt idea spits out. Legacy issues require research & customer outreach. \n\n3a.

A job for me without creativity/some flexibility will always leave me feeling stale and well redundant. \n\nI understand easier said than done for some people.

Previously, if you denied the browser prompt, I had no way to ask you again because the browser won't show the prompt.\n\nSites get around this by first showing you a fake prompt then only showing you the real one if you hit allow. This allows them to spam their own prompt until you allow. I think the browsers are making a mistake in not allowing sites to re-request because bad actors just use this loophole to spam you anyway while good ones that show the real prompt are stuck if you hit deny then change your mind. This new element is partly an attempt to solve that problem but it's a problem of their own making.\n\nGood devs already don't show the prompt until the user clicks a relevant button so I'm not sure what problem this solves. Especially as I suspect good devs will continue to use the old API as it allows their choice of styling and text (e.g. showing a rangefinder icon instead of \"Get location\" text that could differ from browser to browser). It was very interesting to look at the case studies because the designs shown are easily replicable with current API and good sites use these patterns already.\n\nIt might have been better if this new element was the way the API had worked from the beginning but that ship has sailed. This feels like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Unless they plan on deprecating the old imperative API but that seems extremely unlikely.",

Even on Chrome the button is not in any way obvious that it would be used to enable location (assuming the user even understands that they need to do that). It is just a generic settings icon.\n\nThat being said I do think it's slightly silly that they prevent sites from requesting permission after denial 3 times (presumably to prevent them spamming the user) but now there's nothing to stop a site effectively achieving the same result by spamming a dialog with this button in it.

I started dabbling last year with AI, and more recently gone much deeper with Claude.\n\nI just spent the last week converting a 15-year old long abandoned project of mine to a completely different framework and adding tons of features. Like 2-3 months of **full-time** work compressed into a week easily. Multiple 12 hour days. Yesterday alone I spent 18 hours. This was a very big and complex project. Not just another to-do list type of thing. Native pro-level desktop application on Windows and Mac that once upon a time I charged hundreds of dollars for. \n\nHowever it does make tons of mistakes and wrong assumptions. Everything needs to be broken down into tiny chunks, and thoroughly explained in detail. You have to hold its hand, monitor what it’s doing, test, bugfix, test again.\n\nSo, no, it’s not like the tech bro propaganda that claims you can just tell it “build me an app that does X” and it just magically does it all. That’s a complete fairy tale. I wouldn’t trust anybody who claims that. You still need to know how to code first.\n\nBut god damn does it save massive amounts of time. Just explain the whole concept of what you want a particular button or checkbox to do, and it’ll do hours of work in minutes. I’ve found it’s best to keep an eye on what it’s doing (it gives live output of its thought process) so that when it’s done you can say “I notice you said this, but actually it should be this”.\n\nI’m addicted. I haven’t been this excited about a coding project in years. I feel like it has given this old man a fresh breath of energy and life.\n\nIf you haven’t already, dive in now or you absolutely will be left behind.\n\nEDIT: I knew I was gonna trigger a lot of people with this. Not surprised. I’ve been accused of being a bot, of using AI to write this, of using too many emojis, of being a worthless boomer, and also being a naive youngster making all this up. I’ve repeatedly explained my own skepticism about AI, and how much I detest tech bro culture. It didn’t seem to matter. My god you people are insufferable.

It had a few use cases here and there, basically a little easier to use Stackoverflow was how i saw it.\n\nThen i got access to ChatGPT paid version through my work, suddenly ChatGPT felt capable. It kept track of conversation, it stopped hallucinating as much, it maintained memory across chats to know my coding preferences.\n\nThen I got a github copilot subscription. I didn’t get the token/request usage, so i only used chatgpt5-mini or so. Having chatgpt in my editor was a great addition. Good autocomplete, fixing bugs, scaffolding simple code (with issues here and there). I worked like that for about a year.\n\nThen i found out about better models being included for free in this subscription, like Claude Opus 4.5 etc. Suddenly AI was able to build complexer things, not making the mistakes it had been making. My only complaint was it didn’t follow the project standards as i wanted.\n\nSo i wrote documentation AI could use (copilot-instructions.md / AGENT.md etc. there are various standards for this).\n\nI did some tests. I build out a component following our usual work style, and separately i asked AI to build it, it did it just as good (sometimes better), following are standards, giving improvements where possible. Suddenly it was like a capable coworker.\n\n\n— As for fully vibe coding, which was your original question. This is where the line between engineering and just asking.\n\nI recently build some things with Lovable.dev. I wrote a deep explanation of an app i wanted to build. (Which pages, which features, authentication, whicb api’s to use, which colors i want, plus an example site to copy the layout of).\n\nIt build this app 95% perfectly in just 10 minutes. I needed to enter some API keys in the environment variables and it worked.\n\nI dove into the code and wasn’t such a fan. Some components were very large, did multiple things.\n\nFor the next app i added a code quality section to the prompt. The result was much better code quality.\n\nYou can keep iterating on them (or just edit the code yourself within lovable (or just push to github, it jntegrates).\n\nYes, you can fully vibe code. Or just scaffold with AI.\n\n—- more modern version:\n\nI’ve been playing with AntiGravity for fun. Google’s new AI IDE. It is very fun to build like this, my technical knowledge does really help me making solid apps or features.\n\nI’m a freelance web developer for a year now. I’ve had jobs recently where i needed to build features which would take me 3-4 hours of work to build, which AI now builds in minutes. I always do thorough code reviews on what it produces, i still always unit test, i run e2e tests and i do manual tests.\n\nAI has become a very capable tool for serious software engineers. Despite that, anyone can now vibe code what they want, that is until they run into larger issues. It can be difficult to fix issues if you don’t understand what is going wrong under the hood and AI can still get in a loop every now and then.",

Yt-dlp library already does this but it has a ton of flags that I just can't remember. So I asked gpt to build me a script that takes the url and downloads it accordingly to whether it's a single video or a playlist. I made it download in a certain directory and if I'm downloading a playlist I made it so it generates a new folder in the download directory with the name of the playlist.\n\nI am also working on large scale business to business software, and there's no way in hell I'm vibe coding that one. There's lots of reasons for it but the main ones are :\n\n1. AI is unreliable, it often attempts to write a functionality from scratch while there's already an industry standard library that does that exact same job (and I don't mean things like auth, but more like image compression and stuff).\n2. It's not secure, it doesn't think ahead about all the edge cases and even obvious bugs while writing the code, it just gives you exactly what you asked it for\n3. It always gets messy in large scale projects. This one might just be me, since I exclusively work solo and freelance, for example I never had to review someone else's code or merge a PR. But you know the saying \"if it takes one dev one month to build an app, it takes two months for two devs to build the same app\"? That's the best way I can explain this, whenever I need to change something or work on a new feature, I have to reread the code it previously written and understand how it works again. Whereas if I wrote it myself I'd immediately know what's already there and what's not.\n\nOn that main app, I use AI to either bounce ideas off of, or have it explain concepts that I'm not familiar with.\n\nTLDR: Yes, but not on the apps that matter",

It grew into a real application with an advanced architecture — front end, back end, API layer, tests, CI — but it took months, not hours. And the repo is sitting around 400 commits and roughly 75K lines of code.\n\nBut still, 100% AI generated code. Yes, real software doesn’t technically need any human-written code anymore. But….and it’s a big but…. it still needs human engineering.\n\nBecause you don’t “vibe” your way to a coherent 75K-line codebase by accident.\n\nTo keep it moving in the right direction, I had to act as the director for a whole ecosystem: multiple models, multiple agent/guardrail instruction files, and a ridiculous amount of CLI tooling to keep the codebase consistent, debuggable, and buildable. Even a shallow tree view shows thousands of files/directories (and sure, some are deps/assets), but the surface area you’re orchestrating is still massive.\n\nOf course a macOS app is an entirely different beast than a mobile app but that’s even more of a reason to say yes. That’s also why the “anyone can build a full app in 1–2 hours with no background” claim is usually a template demo that survives only on the happy path.\n\nTo me it’s like advanced calculus with a graphing calculator: the calculator can produce answers, but you still need the fundamentals to know what you’re solving, how to use the tool, and whether the output is even valid.\n\nSo yes — AI can write all the code.\nBut without SE fundamentals (and the prompt/tooling discipline to steer it), you’re not building software — you’re generating output and hoping it turns into a product.",

          "text": "I don't know much about coding, though I have learned quite a bit over the last few months. I do have a fairly extensive knowledge of systems and how to put pieces together.   I was playing around one evening and thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could build an automation that can read bank statements, flag specific types of deposits or withdrawals, show me a screenshot of those transactions, and give me a PDF file so I can go and request the information.  I gave ChatGPT and Gemini some prompts, and within a couple of hours, I had a working react/vite app running locally on my machine, with built-in parsers for 7 different banks, that was accurately parsing the statements and doing exactly what I wanted. I showed it to my boss, who said he wanted it, but I didn't want to email my technology, so down the rabbit hole I went.  \n  \nUsing AI prompts and the AWS ecosystem, I've built a system that has a dedicated auth platform, which validates emails, requires TOTP, and is an SSO for multiple front-end applications. My front-end and back-end are completely separate, with the exception of using the session-validator to determine if a user has the credentials to see an application. \n\nEverything was built with a security-first, zero trust, least permission posture, so most of my endpoints are inside of a VPC with multiple layers of security, so if there was a breach, there would still not be a way to get into the data. The things that can't be in the VPC are all WAF protected, and I have extensive security logs. It's a multi-tenant system, and because of how the CDK code was built, it can be used over and over and over. Nothing is hardcoded, so, in theory, it should only take a few minutes to spin up a white label auth system for a different company. The authorization system is not industry-specific, so someone could take any sort of application they built, plug it in, and use it. The auth system doesn't care what an application is, just that the user has the proper credentials and validation token to be in it.  \n  \nIt certainly hasn't been an hour of work, but it is something that I've done by myself while leveraging AI.  I started on this project on October 31st last year. I'd guess the cost to get to where I'm at in the process would have been at least $200,000. That's something that would never be in my reach.\n\nLike anyone new to this kind of stuff, the first month of me in this was building this ridiculously gigantic beast of a monolith, where everything was interconnected and super-easy to break. It didn't take any real genius to understand compartmentalizing each aspect would make it easier to plan out the steps, and easier to troubleshoot when something didn't work correctly. \n\n  \nTo be honest, I don't know if I'll ever do a thing with this, but I might. And even if I don't, my AWS costs are about $120 a month. I was paying over $200 for a bunch of services that were hard to tie together, didn't work very well, and were constantly frustrating me. So, it's a win for me either way.",
