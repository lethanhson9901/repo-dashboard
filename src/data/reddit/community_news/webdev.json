Seeing how the dynamic data on these pages should be fairly static you could use a fairly long cache or chose to keep it there until invalidated by busting the cache when that set of specific data is updated.\n\nThat’s 30k urls you can cache and any request made to a url that is not valid should not trigger a function. The fact these bots could trigger 29M requests from urls that are already generated tells me its very likely your app is just sensing a request to the function to see if there is something there with the query parameters given, rather than actually validating if the requested parameters are even valid.\n\nIf thats not the case you’re serving up those 30k urls fresh each and every single time which means your caching strategy is insufficient.\n\nIf your other end points are serving up any response that comes from a cloud function even when the url has no business in existing then you need much better validation logic.",

I did my own traffic analysis and found that more than 95% of all traffic on my sites is bots (so take your stats with grain of salt too). Half of them advertise themselves openly, and the rest are cleverly hidden. Official analytics tools report completely different numbers because they simply cannot detect most bot traffic. When I look at them, it feels like huge crowds are visiting my site, but the reality is very different. I had to analyze logs manually, and the true numbers shocked me.\n\nThe good news is I am fully self-sufficient, so I do not care if bots crawl my sites. I actually welcome it because it costs me nothing. It just uses otherwise idle resources on my servers that I would be paying for anyway.\n\nPractical advice: if you want to run your service long-term at low cost, use your own servers. I use Hetzner - this is not an ad, just my experience - and there are many competitors that are equally good or better, so do your research. Meanwhile, put your site behind Cloudflare free tier and enable their anti-bot protection. As someone who scrapes frequently, Cloudflare can be difficult to trick so I can recommend you this service to tame your bot problem and save costs.",

They use all sorts of stealth tricks to hide their automation signals, and they navigate around like regular humans.\n\nOne of the secrets of the internet is most services want bots (including Reddit) as they make their engagement numbers look good, and the bots generate revenue by clicking on the ads.\n\n> Cloudflare can be difficult to trick \n\nWe have many clients using Cloudflare in front of our service, and I can see it misses most modern bots. 🤷",

This significantly increased both processing costs and scraping time.\n\nSo yes, when I said it is \"difficult to trick,\" I didn’t mean impossible. It just makes low-effort, fast, and cheap approaches less practical, which is enough to achieve effective bot protection for the purposes of the OP.\n\nBut I agree, if you really care about every bot, for example if your site provides valuable data or your data points are rare and worth the scrapper's extra effort, then Cloudflare alone will not be enough - contrary it will stand in your way as it creates extra layer between you and bot that makes your traps more difficult to implement. In that case, a dedicated service or more advanced anti-bot solution makes sense. Scrapers have become extremely sophisticated. Cloudflare can block the script kiddies and average scrapers, but there is still a significant number of skilled operators who will find ways around basic protections, and those are the ones you need to plan for.\n\nBut in this case OP is worried about mass traffic - common scrappers so my advise stands.",

Set aggressive limits for known crawlers.\n\n**Crawler-specific caching headers** - Return `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` for requests from known bot user agents. Many well-behaved crawlers honor these.\n\n**Static pre-rendering for bot traffic** - Detect crawler UA in middleware, serve a static/cached version. Your dynamic SSR is wasted on scrapers anyway.\n\n**Challenge suspicious traffic** - JS challenges filter out crawlers that can't execute JavaScript (most of them).\n\nThe real issue is that serverless pricing assumes human traffic patterns. Crawler traffic is fundamentally different - high volume, low value, no sessions. The defaults punish you for being indexable.\n\nFor ISR specifically: the revalidate period only helps if the *same URL* is hit multiple times within the window. Crawlers hitting unique listing slugs bypass ISR entirely since each URL is a cache miss.\n\nConsider generating a sitemap with your actual important pages and blocking crawlers from deep pagination. Meta doesn't need to index 30M listing variations.",

Well guess what, the AI chose a perfect version number for next — 16.0.0. A week after the deployment, the server got hacked, and while they were shocked, I didn't even have to guess what the exploit could be.\n\nTheir response? The founder asked someone else outside the company for doing the \"architecture\" (a single EC2 instance). Thankfully it was still staging and only less important services were using production credentials. Now they're rotating keys for those services.\n\nThey found about the critical CVEs TODAY, even though I mentioned it a day later when the vulnerability was first reported. Hopefully they'll pay more attention to the other recent node and react vulnerabilities now. How do I tell them \"I told you so\" without actually telling them?? Again, I don't want to put anyone down, but this is just hilarious.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n- A lot of you seem to think this reddit thread is the communication channel in my company, and talking about this ridiculous, basic security failure is somehow demeaning to the people. No, it's not.\n- By vibe coding, I mean the lack of responsibility that comes with it. (I specifically mean *vibe coding* not *AI assisted coding*)\n- I'm not a senior dev, joined a month ago, on probation, struggling to meet my own deadlines. The issue was acknowledged when I raised it, a week after my joining, but it wasn't fixed. I don't have any access to the deployment pipeline.\n- I won't **actually** act smug in front of them, get some common sense. Let me rant in peace.\n \n I don't want to be explaining every little detail because it makes a giant page long post but some people here hallucinate worse than an LLM.

In 2016 these things were still years from entering public awareness, couldn't even attempt to generate an image or walk outside a lab.\n\nIf that rate of progress is typical of what we can expect going forward then its going to improve in abilities in the same way computers did from the 80s until about the 2010s. What now requires a data centre will become the kind of chip that is causally thrown into any device thats far beyond the abilities of any modern model by 2040, 2050.\n\nWhile I don't think jobs are under immediate direct threat, I also don't think the technology needs to improve impossibly far to get into that situation. If you can show it an arbitrary role and just expect high quality reliable results, what is left for Human employment? \n\nEvery existing team can be reduced to a single human lead being actively and intelligently prompted through their high level requirements and reading reports. Even accounting for massive expansion of activity I would still expect Human employment to fall far below 50%, maybe even 20% - its a generic solution that seems to apply everywhere once the models improve and to any activity you come up with keep people employed.",

Biological devs increasingly acting like tech leads to digital devs. Understanding requirements; interacting with project managers/stakeholders; going to meetings; writing prompts; testing; code reviews; feedback; the occasional manual intervention. And it might take AI a decade to reach the next phase after that. Which I imagine to be completely autonomously and reliably working to specifications with no code review necessary. \n\nIf that happens, then the best path for devs gets a bit murky. I think a sideways move towards analysing business problems and specifying solutions might be one way... for a bit. In 10 years AI might be able to autonomously meet with people, read documents, observe a workplace and fully handle that by then. A full robo business analyst digital director. That can identify the entire gamut of a business and by itself manage construction of all the systems required to support it. Which would pretty much make digital agencies obsolete.\n\nBut when you extrapolate that idea, if you can get to that point exactly how many of the rest of the employees in companies are required? If you work in an office in any capacity your years may be numbered. And if you work with your hands? Better keep one eye on the robots.",

One, you need to understand the code yourself enough to even know how to guide the AI. Two, if its too complex then the AI becomes more error prone or deletes things it shouldnt. \n\nSo with that in mind you could essentially say that its good for greenfield and bad for brownfield.

However, the number it reports is simply the number of queries times 2000, and it claims that’s how much faster it was. Very wrong. \n\nDon’t get me wrong it’s a great autocomplete when it’s not in my way and good for simple projects where I just want a UI over a simple CRUD app on a single object.

I've been in projects where using AI accelerated the project, and projects where AI actually slowed down the development time and we had to fix and clean up so much garbage code. Long slow paths are sometimes the way to go to make sure the code is well written, and you can use AI to assist of course. I'm not anti-AI, I use it too.\n\nAs I said, it's just a tool at the end of day. If you write a prompt, press Enter, check the end result and call it a day, then you are in for big surprises.

One that has game changing implications for certain tasks, and, if used effectively, can dramatically increase your performance for those tasks. \n\nBut “using it effectively” is key, and that’s where the misunderstanding often comes in. For effective use, this means learning effective patterns and prompts, getting your own pace and review cadence right, and who knows what else eventually - it’s a learned skill. It’s a learned skill ON TOP OF the existing skills, sure you’re writing less code, but to use it effectively you need to read and understand the same amount of (or even more) code as before.\n\nFor some low hanging fruit it can do a pretty good job with minimal intervention, but for most real design/engineering/analysis tasks you really need all those foundational skills _and_ the practice at using AI to complement your conventional skills.\n\nSo I think there’s a very real threat to juniors employment, because it’s hard to justify another salary on basic grindy tasks that we can ask AI to do, but I do think most established software guys will actually be _more_ valuable if you learn the new tools effectively.

The fact you’re barely writing code while still employed means your role has already fundamentally shifted whether your company acknowledges it or not.\n\nThe value proposition isn’t coding anymore, it’s knowing what to build, why it matters, how it fits user needs, and whether the AI output is actually good. If you can’t articulate why you’re valuable beyond code generation, then yeah, your anxiety is justified. Product sense, architecture decisions, and stakeholder management are harder to automate than implementation.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is some frontend roles will disappear, especially junior positions focused on translating designs to code. Your survival depends on moving up the value chain into product thinking, technical leadership, or specializations AI struggles with like performance optimization or accessibility. Loving UI creation doesn’t matter if AI does it faster and cheaper. Figure out what humans still do better and become excellent at that, or accept you’re riding this job until it ends.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Basically, he has a whole bunch of MCPs including our ticketing software, Shortcut, and our design platform, Figma. And for small bugs, it can just be told, implement Shortcut ticket 12345, and it will go.\n\n  \nThankfully, he's been trying some more difficult challenges for it, and it's tanking them pretty badly. For better or for worse, our app is too complex for it to do 95% of our work. But it is scary to see it bang out a little bug on its own. I'm afraid too. I don't have a backup. I might lean more into design/UX, as the human element is still more valuable there IMO.\n\n  \nIt's just especially crazy to me that when I graduated almost a decade ago, there could not be enough people to fill all the jobs. There was so much demand, and I never once dreamed we'd be afraid of never having opportunities available.",

They’re getting good at using the tooling instead of replacing themselves. \n\nHave you used databricks AI for writing a query based off a hunch yet? Shits amazing. I know SQL, but I don’t care for querying the fourty fucking billion tables of unstructured data myself. My manager still wants a human to wake up at 2am when sentry goes off. Juniors on my team are shitting out PRs faster than I can review them.\n\nDon’t know if you’ve ever watched office space, but even in this current hellscape, we still need to generate the TPS reports.

If I use AI to build something cool.. a product that is software, ideally a tool used by other developers/etc, but they are all disappearing.. how exactly am I going to get my own product sold? I asked AI this question.. and the answer was that AI would consume my product.. e.g. a GUI app somehow AI will become the \"user\" consuming the GUI. Clearly it would be API and not GUI.. and I hope that my GUI app will remain relevant for a few more years for end users to use.. but if AI is really replacing a lot of the \"customers\" that my app would be used by.. then that means my app is no longer relevant even though there is almost nothing like it now anyway. \n\nSo.. do APIs become the primary way apps are built in the near future.. so AI can consume them? I mean.. YES.. I know it is to some degree.. but I do wonder if the majority of us that use software products.. like HR apps, desktop apps of various types, etc.. as we disappear from the work force, will things shift to mostly APIs that AI uses and the desktop/web app disappears? \n\nAm I wasting my time with about a year or so out for my product launch (trying to get there sooner of course).. unsure if AI will advance THAT fast that the majority of those that would use my product for many years to come will lose jobs too and make my offering irrelevant?",

          "text": "I liked this take on it by Addi Osmani and Aaron Levie on Twitter/X:\n\nEvery time we've made it easier to write software, we've ended up writing exponentially more of it.\n\nWhen high-level languages replaced assembly, programmers didn't write less code - they wrote orders of magnitude more, tackling problems that would have been economically impossible before. When frameworks abstracted away the plumbing, we didn't reduce our output - we built more ambitious applications. When cloud platforms eliminated infrastructure management, we didn't scale back - we spun up services for use cases that never would have justified a server room.\n\nLevie recently articulated why this pattern is about to repeat itself at a scale we haven't seen before, using Jevons Paradox as the frame. The argument resonates because it's playing out in real-time in our developer tools. The initial question everyone asks is \"will this replace developers?\" but just watch what actually happens. Teams that adopt these tools don't always shrink their engineering headcount - they expand their product surface area. The three-person startup that could only maintain one product now maintains four. The enterprise team that could only experiment with two approaches now tries seven.\n\nThe constraint being removed isn't competence but it's the activation energy required to start something new. Think about that internal tool you've been putting off because \"it would take someone two weeks and we can't spare anyone\"? Now it takes three hours. That refactoring you've been deferring because the risk/reward math didn't work? The math just changed.\n\nThis matters because software engineers are uniquely positioned to understand what's coming. We've seen this movie before, just in smaller domains. Every abstraction layer - from assembly to C to Python to frameworks to low-code - followed the same pattern. Each one was supposed to mean we'd need fewer developers. Each one instead enabled us to build more software.\n\nHere's the part that deserves more attention imo: the barrier being lowered isn't just about writing code faster. It's about the types of problems that become economically viable to solve with software. Think about all the internal tools that don't exist at your company. Not because no one thought of them, but because the ROI calculation never cleared the bar. The custom dashboard that would make one team 10% more efficient but would take a week to build. The data pipeline that would unlock insights but requires specialized knowledge. The integration that would smooth a workflow but touches three different systems.\n\nThese aren't failing the cost-benefit analysis because the benefit is low - they're failing because the cost is high. Lower that cost by \"10x\", and suddenly you have an explosion of viable projects. This is exactly what's happening with AI-assisted development, and it's going to be more dramatic than previous transitions because we're making previously \"impossible\" work possible.\n\nThe second-order effects get really interesting when you consider that every new tool creates demand for more tools. When we made it easier to build web applications, we didn't just get more web applications - we got an entire ecosystem of monitoring tools, deployment platforms, debugging tools, and testing frameworks. Each of these spawned their own ecosystems. The compounding effect is nonlinear.\n\n... had to split into two posts ->",

Every workflow that becomes tractable creates demand for adjacent workflows. The surface area of what's economically viable expands in all directions.\n\nFor engineers specifically, this changes the calculus of what we choose to work on. Right now, we're trained to be incredibly selective about what we build because our time is the scarce resource. But when the cost of building drops dramatically, the limiting factor becomes imagination, \"taste\" and judgment, not implementation capacity. The skill shifts from \"what can I build given my constraints?\" to \"what should we build given that constraints have in some ways been evaporated?\"\n\nThe meta-point here is that we keep making the same prediction error. Every time we make something more efficient, we predict it will mean less of that thing. But efficiency improvements don't reduce demand - they reveal latent demand that was previously uneconomic to address. Coal. Computing. Cloud infrastructure. And now, knowledge work.\n\nThe pattern is so consistent that the burden of proof should shift. Instead of asking \"will AI agents reduce the need for human knowledge workers?\" we should be asking \"what orders of magnitude increase in knowledge work output are we about to see?\"\n\nFor software engineers it's the same transition we've navigated successfully several times already. The developers who thrived weren't the ones who resisted higher-level abstractions; they were the ones who used those abstractions to build more ambitious systems. The same logic applies now, just at a larger scale.\n\nThe real question is whether we're prepared for a world where the bottleneck shifts from \"can we build this?\" to \"should we build this?\" That's a fundamentally different problem space, and it requires fundamentally different skills.\n\nWe're about to find out what happens when the cost of knowledge work drops by an order of magnitude. History suggests we (perhaps) won't do less work - we'll discover we've been massively under-investing in knowledge work because it was too expensive to do all the things that were actually worth doing.\n\nThe paradox isn't that efficiency creates abundance. The paradox is that we keep being surprised by it.\n\n[https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544](https://x.com/addyosmani/status/2005768629691019544)",

I made him a rough design for his landing page using photoshop, and he set the deadline to January end. \n\nLater on in a online meeting  he asked me to share the design to vibe coding dev. He put that into loveable and the it made him the website. I did not have any problem at this stage cause it was increasing the productivity. He checked the inbuilt browser light house for rating and it was showing it as 99 optimised site. But while  meeting was going on he straight up uploaded the code without even checking it to server. When i checked the code it was a mess. \n\nAI did not followed basic semantics of html code, it put everything inside of the divs. when I asked the founder he said its the dev department responsibility to fix this code. So as I made progress code start breaking. I said to him that i could have created the same website with in less time compared to time it is taking to fix the code. Which lead to dispute that i can't accept the AI so I had to leave his startup. And as of now he is still using the same ai generated code on his website.",

Just like photographers moved from film to digital.\n\nThe real issue will arise if (when?) our clients will build their websites 100% on their own, from home or during the spare time. This is nothing new, though, they could do it already with *Squarespace*, *Wix* and so on. Automated and \"one-click\" tools exist since the early 2000's but companies still prefer agencies and freelancers.\n\nWhat the AI is drastically changing is the overall perception of difficulty and time investment. 10 years ago a simple landing page could be sold for a lot of money. Nowadays you can build it with Claude in seconds (kind of). So, in a way, AI will be \"downgrading\" our work by making it look a lot easier and faster (which is not that wrong, in this case).\n\nAI is fantastic for mundane and boring tasks, as well as code snippets and repetitive actions. But if you're not into development/coding, rest assured you're not going to have an easy life if you want to build a new website/app. And companies/owners don't have time to invest into \"coding an app\" in their spare time. That's never going to happen (*in 27+ years I've never met a single client who was on Wix or another one-click thing before hiring me*).\n\nFinal note: AI makes us more productive (true) but it also devalues our time. Years ago you had 1 client who gave you 1K/month to do 10 things. Now the same client will be asking 50 things in the same amount of time, for the same amount of money, \"*because AI\"*. But truth to be told, the AI is really, really, really good for development and mundane tasks.",

You could take your knowledge and experience and build a free \"AI-experience\" that takes the potential customers' requirements, desires, wishes, etc.  Then, knowing standard patterns you've followed before, have it determine which template/standard pattern you've created yourselves.\n\nc. Accept that people will build via no-code, etc. but that they're going to run into problems.  When they do, make use of AI to assess their codebase to summarize the requirements from it - extract that information you need to work out what they want you to build for them.  Pair that with your established standard patterns or templates and then you can at least get back to where they were very quickly, but with a rock solid pattern you can stand over.  If you can that, you can get them in the door.\n\n  \nWith my team, I've been open for people to embrace the tools - which they are, they're tools.

Unfortunately, you can't convince everyone.  And perhaps that's a sign that you need to niche down more, or go for higher end projects that require something special.

Maybe it was 90€/h if the customer is present and allowed to comment on the work.\n\nI'm guessing this is either standard part of the discussion with websites or it's becoming one.

Anyone thinking [enter computer facing job here] isn’t going away isn’t looking ahead 3-5 years from now. Services like Lovable are the tip of the iceberg. I’m “100% sure” to not be 100% sure about anything. What you see right now is an extremely blurry look into the future. Anything that isn’t “good” right now will be 5-10x better in a year. With everything inside the circle of life, it’s an iterative process. AI is 5-10x better than it was last year and none of the billion dollar companies are slowing down. It’s an arms race resulting in a career vertical extinction event. My project will likely be no bueno in a couple of years. My job will likely be eliminated in 5-10. It’s not reality right now but thinking “never” is how you stay behind.",

Thats why on Android it also shows up as a separate App in stuff like the app drawer or settings menus. With almost all other browsers, besides Samsung internet, the browser I think just caches the website's files and creates a shortcut into a fullscreen browser window that than opens the website. This also means that a lot of nieche PWA features don't really work like homescreen shortcuts, intent intercepting on android, ...\n\nIt depends on your brand of phone, but some also display the browser's icon along side the shortcut since its just a \"app shortcut\" basically. Same mechanism is also used for example when you create to a shortcut to a location on Google Maps and add it to your homescreen.\n\nIts explained here : [WebAPKs on Android  |  Articles  |  web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/webapks)",

So the challenge was more about how to capture everything in JavaScript and make a small algorithm which compresses the data to be sent. You can check how it works here:\nWhen recording I just save the full content of the input ( https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ) with the date every time it changes but when people are done and want to send it, the content is compressed like this: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/recorder.ts ('a' is for append, 'd' for delete and 'r' for replace)\nThen the replayer uses compress data to show the process: https://github.com/einenlum/human-replay/blob/main/src/replayer.ts",

I can’t really use Stripe because of their content restrictions, so I’m looking for alternatives and would really appreciate some advice from people who’ve actually integrated these in production. There's similar website/competitors with already implemented payment systems, so it's doable, but the ones I saw do not use normal payment processors like Stripe or so (i guess for this reason of being blocked or going against ToS)\n\n**Context:**\n\n* It’s a web app / site where users can pay or subscribe, but they do not pay for any nsfw content, the nsfw content its just shown on the website.\n* It may be considered NSFW or “high risk”.\n* There will be erotic/sexualized imagery (girls/guys, suggestive/erotic), but no explicit genitals (it could have explicit genitals sometimes but that will be moderated to prevent happening, but could happen), and nothing illegal or extreme.\n* Think “spicy / softcore” but still potentially flagged as adult by most platforms.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* A payment processor that:\n   * Explicitly allows (or at least tolerates) NSFW / adult-adjacent content.\n   * Has a clear policy so I don’t get randomly banned later.\n   * Offers a usable API/SDK for typical web stacks (JS/Node, etc.).\n   * Can handle one-time payments to start, possibly subscriptions later.\n* Bonus points if:\n   * They support EU-based businesses (I have a bit of confusion here, my company is an LLC in USA but the customers in EU). So I need EU-based business payment processor I understand?\n   * Payouts and KYC aren’t a nightmare.\n   * Fees are reasonable and documentation is solid.\n\nI’m not asking for legal advice, just real-world dev experiences and recommendations so I don’t build the whole flow on something that will kill the account as soon as traffic picks up.\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers",

          "text": "Ohh i know all about this subject! As i built the same thing over a year ago. (I tried building websites for OF models for them to accept payments) heres what i learned, if youre in the US theres really only 3 payment processors u can use, CCBILL, Epoch, and segpay. (Others are garbage) Ccbill is the best as they take the lowest cut and even give u a percentage of per transaction of sales (sell them on ur idea during phone meeting), heres the kicker, visa and mastercard have a combined $1450 per year fee for “high risk” merchants the payment processors ccbill etc pass this fee to you. So in order to get started and get the api keys that payment is due upfront. They also monitor and vet the website they have moderators that require u give them backdoor access to paywalled content at all times and will periodically check to make sure nothing illegal is being upload or sold. If you are building a platform then YOU have to sign KYB and KYC if youre building this for a creator THEY fill out KYC and u would tell them to pay the fee. You will not beable to get payment processing without doing this for any nsfw content (ive tried trust me). If u want the closest thing with no $1450 fee u need to look for “crypto on ramping” (users pay with credit card its swapped for crypto in background.) this is the most uncensored and frictionless route u can take, but they still need the same kyb and kyc forms but they dont require viewing ur content with moderators after approval. (this is the route i took). \n\n\n\nP.S. you have to have systems in place for CSAM and bots signing up to your platform. You need legal forms for your privacy policy, record keeping, DMCA takedown act, etc. for website that has adult content and if creators are making money you must verify they are 18. Mastercard, visa do this for you when a user pays with a credit card as the info of them and their age is tied to the credit card (if not kyc form pops up for user) But if u have creators on ur platform it’s on YOU to verify they are 18. Failure to do that can get u in big trouble. They will ask you how you store all this info, how you will protect against people possibly uploading illegal content they wont approve you on “i will moderate it” if you don’t have auto safe guards in place at upload u wont get approved.",

U verify creators upfront (18+), require records, and block uploads without them. Dont allow ppl to just sign up and start uploading verify them first. Anything that appears underage even if not don’t allow them on your platform. Its not worth the hassle and all sex nudity content must be put behind a NSFW wall if not a Paywall. Automate this process with ai tools or services at upload. Moderation at scale isn’t one person reviewing images. It’s automated detection plus human review. Cloudflare offers free CSAM detection, and services like “Sightengine” “hivemoderation” can detect CSAM and flag minors, NSFW content and auto categorize before content gets posted to your site at scale. Alot of more loose Platforms use “safe harbor” as their advantage and why you might see them operating while hosting grey area content or even pirated content but youll notice none of them have payment processing only pron ads. Paid platforms have higher obligations than free tube sites, which is why payment processors require age verification, audit trails, and moderation systems before approval. If a verified creator uploads illegal content, they’re liable. If you allow uploads without verification and records, you are. “I’ll moderate” doesn’t scale and doesn’t protect you.",

You will likely be best served by CCBill, Epoch, or Verotel. Based on your post, if API integration is important, you will likely want to start with CCBill. \n\nIf modern API integration is really important to you, you will need a merchant account, and you will need to onboard with a gateway like RocketGate, PrimeOrange, Segpay, Bill1st, etc. \n\nThe fees are going to be higher than you are likely comfortable with.

Stripe is **extremely** reluctant to any \"risky\" business and they don't tolerate gambling and porn.\n\nWhat you may consider \"not porn\" is still borderline porn, at least from what you said in your post. And rest assured that if you allow people to upload their content, they will 100% do their best to circumvent the rules in any possible way. As I said before, porn (*as well as crypto and gambling*) attract very bad people. You're playing with fire here. What if Stripe accepts you for a while, and then you get blocked? What will be your backup plan, once the payment processor stops working? It will be painful.\n\n>I'm a bit confused on what Stripe considers or flags as not authorized content on their service.\n\nTheir [policy](https://stripe.com/en-br/legal/restricted-businesses) about porn is pretty clear, in my opinion:\n\n* Pornography **and other mature audience content** (including literature, **imagery**, and other media) designed for the purpose of sexual gratification\n\nWill your site be accessible by minors? If my 11 years old son visits it, is there any form of check/prevention? Will you ask your audience if they're 18+, before accessing the pages?\n\nAlso, you said in your description that\n\n>There will be erotic/sexualized imagery\n\nWhich 100% falls under the \"other mature audience content\". It may or may not be designed for sexual gratification, sure, but how can you prove that? I mean, nowhere on Pornhub you find any \"*welcome to our masturbation platform*\", right? We just know what it is. And we already know that people will not be uploading NSFW images to your website \"for science\". There will be a bunch of pervs / weirdos that will basically upload/watch your stuff for sexual pleasure. As simple as that.\n\n*P.s. Did you consult a lawyer who knows about this stuff? Because going from softcore NSFW to bad/violent/pedo porn is something that can happen, and will most likely happen if the website gains some traction.*",

I opened up ChatGPT, explained the purpose and expected behavior as best I can, gave it the code for the original and the refactor, and showed it some sample usage and output.\n\nBefore it even had a chance to make a mistake with the technical detail, it gave me;\n\n```ts\n// for reference, `EnterExitPair` here only contains `enter` and `exit`, nothing more\nfunction someTestHelper(\n  traversalFn: TraversalFnType,\n  root: NodeType,\n  cases: EnterExitPair,\n) {\n  const result = traversalFn(root, {\n    ...cases,\n    enter: (node) => /*some tracking stuff*/,\n    exit: (node) => /*some more tracking stuff*/,\n  })\n}\n```\nEffectively guaranteeing that any non-trivial use of `someTestHelper` causes the test to fail because the provided cases will never run.\n\nIt's not like I didn't give it enough information or anything, this is just basic ES6 objects.\n\nThere are people out there building entire apps with this stuff. How on earth do they deal with these beginner mistakes littered throughout their code? Especially the non-developers who use LLMs for programming. Is the development cycle just \"ask for refactors until it works\"?\n\nAnyways, it just reminded me why I don't let LLMs write code.",

In other words, they're not dealing with mistakes; they're not even aware that mistakes exist in the first place.\n\nI imagine their development cycle is simply reiterating \"if something goes wrong, feed it into the prompt,\" without ever looking at the code itself. The codebase is probably a mess by this point, but they don't care because they don't look at the code.\n\nTo give a serious answer about how to get good results from LLMs: current LLMs are reinforcement-learned to be used with coding agent tools (like OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code) for coding tasks. Therefore, you need to use those tools and such reinforcement-learned models. Also, tasks need to be specifically defined. You need to provide instructions with a highly rigid prompt, much like giving a task to a junior developer. However, note that this is \"how to make an LLM output working code,\" not \"how to make it output excellent code.\" This is because the reinforcement learning primarily considers \"can it write code that solves the task?\" and not \"what is the quality of the code?\" Furthermore, LLMs don't have the ability to \"think.\" This is a theoretical limitation. Therefore, it's better not to give them tasks that require thinking. In the case of difficult tasks like your example, we need to handle the \"thinking\" ourselves and only entrust the subsequent \"work\" to the LLM.",

Using LLMs like that early Copilot as an \"Assistant\" was truly their most appropriate application. But for product marketing, the current \"agent\" or \"automate everything\" approach probably gets a better reaction, unfortunately.\n\nMany people here mention agent tools, and while they certainly write code that solves problems, it's far from excellent code. And unlike the early inline suggestion Copilot, they often edit many lines at once, making the task of reviewing and fixing all of them even more painful. However, it's important to note that this perspective varies from person to person. While we might find such code intrusive, beginners might feel that having \"base code\" makes their work easier.

Giving the agent access to tools to lint and check browser console helps a bit but it won't be perfect. I have found this domain to be some of the hardest to get success with.\n\nHave you considered being very explicit with your context guidance, pointing the agent at what to take inspiration from? e.g. \"Read ./pages/users/admin.ts then create ./pages/articles/admin.ts that provides similar admin management but for pages, using the pages/ endpoint from ./openapi.json. See ./widgets for available frontend widgets\"? this avoids the agent getting stuck on a complex codebase that wastes context size, and helps it stay 'in line's with your codebase and standards. Might not even need large context docs (AGENTS.MD) if the code you point to clearly uses a well-known framework that the underlying LLM is expected to have been trained on.\n\nMaking the agentic problem into a \"do more like this but with new constraints XYZ\" type of problem seems to generalize well, in my experience, even for complex never-before-seen code and tasks (integrating a new JavaScript engine from Fabrice Bellard into a custom private game engine), as long as those tasks are based on a foundation that relies in 'knowledge' (C, JavaScript) that underlying LLMs are trained on.",

That technique doesn't work too well and they 'forget' what they are doing. As others have mentioned you either A. Use agent versions that scan your codebase or B. Give it an outline, references, etc so it can constantly correct itself. Most likely you use a combo of both. If you're concerned about privacy...most aren't and it is what it is, unfortunately. People tend to run agents on their local machine because it's more effective. The other recommendation is commiting to source control when the AI does well, because the next change could screw up so I am committing much more often even though the commits are less about a coherent unit of work, and more about checkpoints for each baby step or iteration. So yes, constant iteration and hand holding is normal.",

Again, steer it with prompt injection deterministically.\n- After it write the file, run lint, typecheck or even have another llm to review the change. The llm as the judge should also get some rules you specify for the file path pattern rather than just some generic prompt.\n- when there is a bug, don’t just give it logs. Provide trace so it has complete picture not to guess.\nSome of the approach are included in this [toolkit](https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit) .

I told it I was going to be using GeminiCLI and asked threw a basic plan in, I asked Claude to make a GEMINI.MD (overall project view), TECH.MD (the technologies to use, updated with notes as preferences/standards developed) and TODO.MD (the steps to take to achieve the goals) for GeminiCLI. Then I copy/paste that into the TODO, tell GeminiCLI that I've updated the TODO, it did the things and then I'd repeat the process over and over a few times until I had an established multitenant foundation.\n\nNow and then in between I use ChatGPT as somewhat of an rubber duck, basically just trying to get ideas out of my head in a more coherent manner.\n\nBut that Claude > Gemini loop has been pretty good.. Today anyway.\n\nI don't pay for a single one, so it's all with the free tier. I hit the Gemini3 limit, but decided to call it a day before I hit the flash preview limit.\n\nThere was still a fair bit of manual coding/editing. Removing duplicate class imports, importing missing classes, basic error reading/resolving and CSS styling (that's just easier to do than explain/request).\n\nI would imagine that when/if the project grew, it'd have to become quite single feature focused do to the growth in context. But to get to where I wanted to be today, it was faster than me doing it manually. And the code was well commented (which I asked for), so I was able to go in and really follow what was/is going on.\n\nThe only reason I went Claude (browser) > GeminiCLI was the free aspect. I was going to throw some dollars at ClaudeCode, but recently I've seen a lot of unhappy usage-related complaints and odd happenings. I also don't want to become too reliant on either platform. As it was today I still manually wrote and ran tests, and that felt quite disconnected from the guts of everything.",

This allows me to say \"create frontend\", the thing searches through its VSS db, find a matching workflows, and asks me x questions about what frontend I want, before it attempts to solve anything.\n\nHowever, regardless of how hard a frikkin' try, I can always make it perfectly generate my backend using my Hyperlambda Generator (my own fine-tuned LLM), but then end up \"fighting\" the LLM on the frontend. This might just be because my tool isn't optimised for frontend development, or that I'm using the wrong model (GPT5) - Or something - But at least, I've never (so far) cracked that part.\n\nBut I can guarantee you with 100% certainty, that's a temporary problem, and will be solved ...",

Same patterns, same folder structures, same generic variable names, same suspiciously clean README files that explain nothing useful.\n\nSo over the past few weeks I built a tool that attempts to detect vibecoded/AI-generated boilerplate projects. Here's how it works:\n\nData Collection\n\n* Scrapes post content, comments, and any linked GitHub repos or deployed URLs from this sub\n* For GitHub links, it pulls the full file tree, commit history, and README\n* For deployed apps, it crawls the public-facing pages and extracts any exposed source maps\n\nAnalysis Pipeline\n\n1. Structural fingerprinting - Compares project structure against known AI scaffold patterns (create-react-app + shadcn + prisma is basically a red flag at this point)\n2. Commit entropy analysis - Real projects have messy commit histories. AI projects have like 3 commits: \"initial commit\", \"add features\", \"fix bug\"\n3. Semantic density scoring - Checks if variable/function names are suspiciously \"clean\" and self-documenting in a way humans never actually write\n4. README-to-code ratio - If your README is longer than your actual codebase, we have questions\n5. Comment pattern detection - Looking for that signature ChatGPT \"Here's what this does:\" style\n\nAnyway, I ran it against the last 6 months of this sub. Results are live:\n\n[https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/](https://redditwebdev.vercel.app/)",

Sometimes I’ll have an idea one day and get a new site up for it the next day. I find though that zero of my coworkers are building anything.\n\nPeople usually say they don’t wanna code all day at work and then do more after at home, or that they have other things they do or have kids etc. I am sure not having kids really makes the difference for me, but it’s still odd that \\*\\*nobody\\*\\* I work with does anything.\n\nI couldn’t imagine that anymore. None of my websites have amounted to much of anything, but I must enjoy it. I had about 14 active sites together at the peak over the last few years, now I’ve got just 5 I still have up.\n\nThe domain registrations cost a little bit but other than that since nothing I’ve made is very popular, the cloud costs are very minimal. It’s really just about putting in my time.\n\nWhat about you guys? Are you off building things, and do you similarly find yourself alone amongst your colleagues?",

Something that we're not under any professional pressure to get better at, so we can take it at our own pace and enjoy it. Keep a diary. Write a story from time to time. Read books that aren't about coding. Travel is good - there's a big world out there that you're neglecting if you don't make an effort to get out and see it. And yes, it's OK to watch TV, go for a drink with your friends, play with your kids and your pets. It's even OK to do a bit of coding sometimes. :) \n\nAnd, if you're pacing yourself properly and the people who you're working for are reasonable people who appreciate the need for professional development, there should still be time to learn new stuff during your work day. If that's not the case, your employer is crap and it's time to get out there and get a new job. \n\nDon't just be one thing. Don't just be the developer and let what you do for a living define you.

He described how you start on the fun side, but eventually drift off to the more professional side in your personal projects, because they need to run well, they need to scale, be secure, customers demand more and at that point it becomes another job and stops being fun. If you can keep it on the side of fun and not worry about all the things you do in your full time job, then it's really good entertainment for you.\n\nI see juniors do this more than seniors nowadays.
