I built something similar — [https://kindro.me](https://kindro.me) — but\n\n  went with server-side processing instead (Python/rembg with U2Net,\n\n  MediaPipe for face detection). Interesting to see the client-side\n\n  approach.\n\n\n\n  A few things I ran into that might be relevant to your project:\n\n\n\n  \\- **Hair** **edge** **quality**: The hardest part for me wasn't the background\n\n  removal itself, it was the semi-transparent edge pixels around hair.\n\n  rembg leaves a halo that gets passport photos rejected. I ended up\n\n  hardening the alpha matte (blur + contrast stretch) before\n\n  compositing onto white. Curious how u/imgly/background-removal handles\n\n   fine hair detail — that's usually where the model differences really\n\n   show up.\n\n  \\- **Head** **sizing** **across** **presets**: Getting the forehead-to-chin\n\n  measurement to land within spec for different countries (US 2x2, MX\n\n  35x45, CA 50x70) was trickier than expected. The face detector gives\n\n  you landmarks, but translating that into a scale factor that respects\n\n   both the head size spec AND leaves enough headroom above the hair is\n\n   a constraint satisfaction problem. Do you handle that automatically\n\n  or let the user manually adjust?\n\n  \\- **The** **\"no** **digital** **alteration\"** **issue**: I saw some comments flagging\n\n  this. FWIW, the US State Department's own photo tool does cropping\n\n  and resizing. Background removal is the gray area. For US passport\n\n  renewals online, they explicitly accept self-taken photos — the key\n\n  is no AI face modification (smoothing, reshaping, etc). Background\n\n  removal + crop/resize has been accepted in practice.\n\n\n\n  The client-side privacy angle is compelling. My approach auto-deletes\n\n   photos after 7 days, but yours is architecturally private by default\n\n   — nothing to delete if nothing was uploaded. Trade-off is the 84MB\n\n  model download, but that's a one-time cost.\n\n\n\n  Nice work.",

Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company. I dont get the same zeal anymore when one person can just write a prompt and achieve the same results in lesser time.\n\nMoreover, with the recent updates from Claude i wonder if developers or going to last. Please note, i’m not naive. I have seen what the new models from Claude can do. It’s scary. So before putting in statements like “engineering is not only coding”, “we’ll get do roles like product or architecture”, “competent developers would always be required” please dont. The current state of these models is already mind blowing, imagine what they’ll achieve in the next 2-3 years. If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nI did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. But now i think all that was a waste, should have just prepared for govt exams like my dad used to insist me for. At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nThis all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists? \n\nI feel betrayed and cheated, i wish these ai companies and ai preachers rot in hell",

If you persisted tokens over a long period of time, that would be kind of like what you're talking about. But, every additional token that needs to be consumed for a prompt increases cpu and memory usage. And crucially, gen AI doesn't actually remember anything; it simply takes in previous tokens to give it some level of guidance for the next thing it spits out, which mimics having a context about previous input and output. When you're talking to a chat bot, the reason it *seems* like it remembers what you had said is because the previous chat history (or a tokenized, summarized version of it) is fed into it for each prompt. It would be like having a conversion with someone, but every response you say (or they say) all the previous conversation must be repeated up to that point. And it gets longer and longer each response.",

Sure, it will become easier to run them, or it eventually takes less resources to train them (but now all the training data is trashed since its all AI slop).

I still do manual coding with no ai even for tab completions on personal project where I can still hold on to the joy of programming without the limitations of worrying  about efficiancy , for client work ai does the work but I am reviewing and trying to find ways to better manage the reviews and outputs, cause I am still not really happy with the quality that comes out and the amount od time needed to get it right, for side project workibg witihin the company I mostly vibe code them with some top level arhitectural guidence and dont worry about code quality that much.Definitly dont agree with op that its over for devs, I am seeing what my pm’s and designers at the company are producing with vibe coding, and while impressive the scale to which they can push it without any help from devs is really not there, the designer is making an app he wants to have accounts for people and teams , sharing some resources publicly or privatly and so on, he said it was probably written in react, I looked at the code it was one big html file with two external js scripts, consider that those are people with 10 years working alongsode developers, so general public is even further away. It will take some time for all of them to hit the walls eventually and figure out how much deva are still needed and that is the meesed up part, but if we manage to go through this phase I think we good at least for a couple of years, but I am still betting I can spend my full carrer in this field no matter how it changes with further advancments.",

          "text": "Here's the thing: right now ai cannot fully replace a developer, maybe about 80% and it does make mistakes when it comes to architecture and large scale applications. They have been promising for years now that 100% is coming soon but continue to fail to get there. Right now, the entire ai industry is heavily subsidized and is eating the cost of expensive queries. At some point they will have to significantly raise the prices and that point ceos are going to start questioning if they want to pay exorbitant fees for something that only does about 80% of what it promised at most. Use ai as a tool for now but don't become dependent on it.\n\nEdit: some of y'all really drank the Kool aid... Their current plan to scale for profitability involves consuming most of the power we produce and while everyone keeps saying the cost of inference will go down, Nvidia's chips keep getting more and more expensive while the data centers they are going to live in are behind schedule. They lose money on every premium subscription sold and they will have to make up for years of unprofitability if they ever decide to become anywhere close to a sustainable industry.",

But, as a counter-argument, the real problem is not convincing yourself that you're worth more, it is convincing our particularly impressionable bosses that get their business tips from psychopaths that lead them into these bubbles thanks to heavy dosages of FOMO and unverifiable claims. At least I had at least 3 such cases in my career.\n\nI'm having some difficulties with my current ones, for instance. They constantly push this crap and just copy-paste responses from Claude instead of telling me themselves. I told them exactly this, that apart from the technical and security concerns (there's data leaks constantly in the field and they still have to assure me they're being strict enough with how they process our customer's sensible data through their agents), it's almost certain they're trying their best to make us dependant on their infrastructure and then steeply raise prices once monopoly's been estabilished. They just... shrugged and said it is the future and we must walk the walk.\n\nI'm not actually looking for a new job because of this, but, since that conversation, I'm seriously considering what my plan B should be. I'm considering English teacher but, I dunno, with DeepLy or even normal LLMs... the problem is the same - how do I convince my students they need to know it? I can tell them innumerable practical cases for knowing English yourself, but will they just shrug as well and say 'who cares'?",

              "text": "Prices won't go up that much, because that'd be counter-productive. Instead we'll see quality go down as companies realize you can do good enough, and start to use more limited, specialized AIs (or even just straightforward non-AI tools) instead of generic and expensive LLMs for more and more tasks. This limits what can be achieved, but again good enough is good enough. Companies will realize that if AI can do 60% (down from 80%) of what a junior engineer does it's still a great gain, but it would mean engineers would have to do more work.\n\nThe thing is, if AIs were really improving efficiency that much we'd see an explosion of little side projects in companies. Because why not: just throw a new agent to work on the little thing and then show it off. Yet we are not seeing this, engineers are busy while their productivity isn't that much higher.\n\nWhat will change is that a lot of jobs that we handed off will now not be handed off as much. When tickets they'll be split into three buckets: AI handles it (for trivial bugs), hand off to junior/mid (for bugs that are not trivial, but also don't require a large volume of knowledge, allowing developers to gain a deep or wide understanding without getting overwhelmed) and the problems that go to seniors+ (problems that require a deep and wide understanding of the issue, and are non-trivial, problems that have strong political weight or challenge to them such as bugs in the interaction of code belonging to multiple teams, and systemic issues). The automated tool itself only goes as far as it can, it can collect pertinent logs and data, identify the potential commits at fault, create a repro test, offer potential solutions, not all done by AI, all of these to help close the ticket, only when it basically does all the job and only needs a review is it considered \"handled by AI\". Also this shifts certain responsibilities, we'd expect juniors and mid engineers to review code a lot more, and trust them to handle more things, to balance this mentorship will be a bigger issue on senior+ engs because we need junior/mid to be able to increase in skill faster.\n\nSo it will transform our jobs, how exactly isn't sure now, and it's going to be a transition. The problem is that right now leadership thinks it has a clear idea and it's pushing it blindly with the engineers on the ground not seeing how it could work out. This is eating away at morale. Leadership is acting really blindly here, and it will result in companies getting stuck in their own mire, as it has happened before.",

First in was anti Luddite fears (they didn’t destroy tech arbitrarily, they said innovation was being used to abuse workers and children as opposed to lifting community or conditions), more racism based wedging in the early 20th, the red scare, seventies into eighties self interest bonanza, nineties thoughts on correction crushed by a stock priority and tech boom that collapsed and left us with even less protective structure, now all this.\n\nThere is no actual plan. UBI is, at best, a stop gap semi solution that can insufficiently reach some of the necessary population and works great as a baseline in contexts with open education and enrichment and human-centric work opportunity but we don’t have that so the success of it elsewhere isn’t even flatly applicable here. If they succeed in convincing the market that their models should replace labor, you will see a jump even more extreme towards mass poverty and incredible wealth at the same time",

I'm guessing it'll be a matter of years before all webdev is phased out, so yeah, prep for that lol\n\nTwo hundred years ago, you'd call us insanely stupid for wanting to be able to talk to anyone across the world in milliseconds, now it's a basic thing that just sort of exists in developed countries. The same thing is happening now with the big ai shift, you can hate it all you want, but it's literally just better ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEdit: This isn't to say I've figured it all out, either. I taught myself how to use a frontend webdev tool, made my own personal site and found it fun, joined this sub. I still haven't made a penny with webdev, don't know if I ever will, but it's a fun skill for now for sure. I still work a crappy job that I don't truly enjoy and isn't paying me enough, so I'm very much still looking for my \"thing\", the ai onslaught isn't helping me either lmao",

Because no-code tools that \"anyone can use\" have been around for decades, and managers still want to be telling developers what to build even if they technically could be doing the work with those no-code tools themselves. \n\nAnd the same will happen here. Developers will continue to be specialists wrangling all of the code. Really trivial \"plumbing\" category code tasks and simple UI will mostly be done by AI, but there will still need to be an expert involved for the foreseeable future.\n\nFrankly, most managers don't want to be coding or prompting. They are done with being an IC and want to keep track of higher level details. And there is no universe where some rando untrained minimum wage employee can replace a software engineer as the prompter.\n\nThe tools are pretty good, but they still make really bad mistakes with algorithm and architecture. They're useful to save some time at first, but if you're not a competent software engineer, you'll be spending 100x as much effort trying to iterate to fix errors you don't understand. And as the architecture gets further off the rails, the multiplier keeps going up.\n\nFinally, the way a lot of corporate management works, there's more prestige the larger your team is. It's rare that any manager will want to lose members of their team, so instead of cutting jobs (assuming AI is effective at increasing productivity) they will tighten schedules and add features.\n\nThere are always more features to add. Unless you're maintaining something like a web site for a restaurant that only needs a new menu update every couple of months, the backlog is usually enormous. If not the backlog, then the feature wish list. I'm skeptical that AI will result in more than a 10-20% productivity boost over the long term, but even if it does, they'll just ask for more work to be done.",

But give it another 3 years right?\n\nEvery time i hear someone fellating AI this pops into my head and i smile 😌\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DUQwhlvgIvH/\n\n> If even after this you think our jobs are safe, then you are living under a rock or just reluctant to use AI on full scale. And please stop comparing AI to the advent of calculator, computer or the internet. This is one whole another level. It’s not a tool, it’s cheap cognition for companies not wanting to invest in humans.\n\nPffft no you're just retarded.\n\nI'll give you a parallel. Cloud providers (AWS / GCP). At the beginning it was great right? I was around for those days, companies just offloading entire in house IT departments and hardware on prem into the cloud. And you could horizontally scale pretty easy...\n\nFast forward a decade or more, now that they've upped the ingress egress fees, enshitified everything with a gazillion microservices, and made it extremely hard to migrate away (since you're using their bespoke API) it's flipped back. It's actually cheaper to host your own data and stick it behind some caching, then use those services.\n\nIt's going to be the same with AI.\n\nStarts out nice and roses. But eventually they're going to have to put up the $prices to hand off cost. As for vibe coding, i can imagine it inserting random code that spawns ads. If devs aren't in control / no ones doing PR reviews and they're just AI-ing all the stuff. You'll get ads in your software where there should be none, and with the wrong tracker the profits would go elsewhere.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nUhuh, because it's not like they made generative AI that's churning out slop images, and videos' targeting basically everyone in the content industry... animators, artists. They didn't train it on all legal documents and test it against lawyers...\n\nAI stands for artificial inflation, as that's mostly what it's done so far.",

I just prompt Cursor to do it. I give it every crumb of knowledge that I can and it still fails.

It's not really meant to be fun. It's great that you found it fun for a while, but that runs out for most people at some point.\n\nEventually you realise that you're not doing new and exciting things.

I try keep up with all the latest research, I run a home lab, I try out various products, I watch podcasts, I follow announcements, and I just keep missing this \"full scale use\" that you describe. If anything, one think keeps being abundantly clear, AI does a great job at multiplying and magnifying human effort, and does a mediocre job of simulating human effort with periodic horrible mistakes that can set you back a ton if you miss them. \n\n> I did a lot of hard work during my college days and work life. To make sure i give this career all i could and be one of the best developers out there. I thought tech is the only career where success is deterministic on how much good you can get at your skills and job. \n\nIt is. Getting good at AI, and understanding how you can leverage your life of experience in combination with AI is the next step you have to embrace if you want to be a good developer going forward. It's not like your skills are pointless. Sure you don't have to type out all that code yourself, but you still have to read it and think about it and discuss it and decide how to evolve it. Your skills and logic are still critically important, it's just now part of utilising those skills and logic is how well you can convey your intent to the AI, and how well you can track what the AI is doing.\n\n> At that time, i used to think “meh”, im going to let my skills n hard work decide my salary. But look here we are, dev jobs in absolute danger snd govt employees soon to get 8th commission.\n\nYou really think government employees are going to escape the AI revolution? You're just on the leading wave. You have the unique opportunity to surf this wave into the new age at it's crest, and your complaint seems to be that it's not fun anymore. Well, then try to use AI for something more fun, maybe something you've been putting off because it seemed way too hard to tackle. By the time AI comes for the government it's going to be late enough that they are likely to struggle far more than you will as you learn the new styles of working with AI.\n\n> This all is so discouraging. Out of all the jobs and fields in the world, why are these ai companies hell bent on us only? And if AI can replace a software engineer then what job is safe other than rocket scientists?\n\nAI companies are focus on software because there's an infinite need for software, and that need is ever changing and evolving. Instead of bemoaning it, embrace the super-power your understanding of software gives you. You can talk to the AI on the same level, and direct it in ways people without that experience can't even hope to replicate.",

What business value does a bug have? Customer retention at best. Features are customer acquisition and that is why they are preferred over bugfixing.\n\nIf the AI can literally solve our problems it frees our hands so to speak, to figuring out what to point the AI at, and how to build around that. We are talking on my team about how to make it auto open PRs for tickets it sees as easy wins.\n\nMoreover I don’t think we should be celebrating the “days where you could take pride in developing a feature or fixing a sprint blocking bug that no one in the team could solve” - 1. I still take pride in what the AI outputs, because I am still responsible for it in the end. 2. Lowering the bar of who can fix sprint blocking bugs is an objectively good thing, and the whole team should take pride in it.\n\n“Gone are the days when your knowledge, skills snd logic building were things which would add value to your role or candidature for the company.” Nope.

This is not the end, it's only a stark shift in the way of things at this point in time. In the early 20th century, there was no such thing as a software engineer, or even software for that matter.

It had added tooltips which in our app are spans that form blue circles with a white i, but it added purple circles with a white *i* (cursive here to emphasize the i’s looked different). So after thinking a bit it realized it had added tooltips using the `info` class instead of `normal`. So it happily changed those and finished, but upon rendering the i’s looked different still. Turns out that the font difference for the i’s depended on using the `text-normal` class, and Claude rendered the tooltips using `text-info` and **in the same line where the info class was!** So of course I had to change that myself and be done with it. So if it could happen that Claude or Opus or others are able to eliminate software engineering jobs, either new jobs will open to fill in what they can’t do, or it would happen after a good long time yet.",

I like it and I'm not scrounging around in the same docs over and over. \n\nWhat AI can't replace is experience and intuitive problem solving. When something goes wrong I know how to fix it because I either wrote it or reviewed and committed it. I don't let AI write without explicit permission and I'm still cautious. I don't entirely trust it to stay in scope and have heard too many horror stories. This is a skill issue, but it's hard to keep up.\n\nUpdates are the same way. Terrible to automate and I've been burnt too many times. I'll be happy to look them over myself, it's kinda my job.\n\nI'm aware of my skill issues and know I'm not using AI to the fullest, but I need to determine just how much time and money to invest. This is a moving target and if I spent my time learning the models I wouldn't be working much at all. \n\nIt's a hard balance to find and I sympathize with anyone starting out.

I tend to sort waffle between two trains of thought on this subject. \n\nDespair: I feel very similarly to you, and it upsets me that AI is basically here to stay. I write code because I enjoy it, and the admin work of managing an AI agent is cool, but not what I want to do with my time. I’m fortunate that my job only wants us to use it as much as we want to use it. So I mostly use it for tedious work that I don’t want to do or when I get stuck. However, it’s important that any of us in that boat recognize that this will likely change over time. As everyone gets used to the speed of AI, they will get less patient with project timelines and expect quicker turnaround.\n\nOptimism: I’m optimistic about my career in two ways. \n\nPart 1) AI can write code better than me, but it doesn’t have the context to understand what my specific job/app/company needs without my input. That is to say, it needs my guidance and I don’t foresee a time when that stops being true. I’ve give it jira stories and watched it do exactly what I would have done. I’ve also seen it miss really subtle details than would have been incredibly frustrating bugs to figure out because it just doesn’t understand complex legacy business rules the way that I do.\n \nPart 2) You mentioned that this is a merit based career. I feel similarly and I don’t think that’s changing. I choose to see this as an opportunity to think about what I can do on a much grander scale than I could have before. Human creativity is essential to using this tool to solve problems that we might not have been able to tackle before, and our individual knowledge and skills will still be what separates each of us from each other. Now we get to think about what problems we want to solve that we might have never dared to approach before. Personally I’m working on finding ways of fixing a broken spine without having to drill into our vertebrae. The current standard approach is spinal fusion which comes with a lot of problems. I’m going to need that surgery myself so I figure why not use these tools to try to find a new solution to my problem?",

          "text": "I agree that this AI stuff is leading to people just shutting off their brain. I wouldn't say it's \"targeted\" at Developers, it's just their main job tasks were some of the ones \"easily automated\" so it affected them first and foremost. But this AI craze is having wide-reaching effects across many industries. It's going to (actually already has) led to software quality going way down and now customers are expected to be the QA. So it's a terrible user experience but companies don't care because it's cheaper to do that and deal with the customer complaints than it is to pay actual people to actually develop and QA software manually and release a solid product like they used to. I know that's like a totally foreign concept now. Business leaders have convinced themselves its OK to do this to the customer (despite the customer feedback worldwide that clearly says otherwise) because of all the BS that Dev leaders have relayed to them - buzzwords like \"agile\" and \"feedback loops\" which lead to \"better products\".....BS. But yet it seems like that's where we're at (it actually started well before AI but AI has just accelerated that process tenfold).\n\nBut the bigger concern to me, outside of just software development, with this AI stuff is the fact that it's leading to a society where people quite literally are learning **not** to use their brain. In the past, being smart, sharp, witty, etc. were all positive traits that we admired in people. Now it seems people are happy to let AI solve problems for them, write emails for them, do everything for them. And just like physical muscle, where if you don't use them, over time you start to lose them - critical thinking and mental skills are very much the same.\n\nAI is - or should be - *just a tool* and treated as such. But that is not the way society is treating it - we're treating it as a replacement for humans which is absolutely the wrong approach. Why? Many reasons, but if the thought of our own race's mental capacity declining isn't depressing enough to get people to pay attention, then maybe they should think about what happens when AI becomes so good it decides it doesn't want to listen to you anymore. We're already seeing real-life examples of this happen and the real-life effects it can cause. People assume we can always just \"pull the plug\" if that happens before any real damage is done.... really? You sure about that? I'm certainly not.\n\nBut yeah, it's honestly just more depressing than anything thinking about the direction the world is going and such a vast majority are so blissfully happy with it because they just can't get over the stuff they see AI do. It's just so amazing to them it's fooled them into thinking it's a silver bullet that will be a solution for all problems. Talk about having the wool pulled over your eyes. I was taught at a very young age - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. And that advice has served me very well through my life. I firmly believe AI is one of those cases - there are unseen costs that we will ultimately pay but nobody knows quite exactly what those are yet. But unless something changes drastically I don't know that there's any way to \"put the genie back in the bottle\". The next few months and years will be very interesting.",

You can't fight technological progress. It's here to stay.\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nWell another thing i've been thinking lately. It's the impact of AI on our brain and cognitives abilities. Relying on it too much makes us dumber. The brain needs training, like a muscle. We should not rely on AI for everything. Keep reading books, doing maths in your head, and overall, think by yourself.

Why did I have to suffer and sacrifice my free time/life? I remember spending 3 months over the summer figuring out a feature/new tech stack and how to implement it (At that time I only knew Frontend and some basic backend concepts). Out of curiosity, I asked AI to create my site idea for me, and it got a semi-working, fully styled and responsive/adaptive version in a single prompt. Something tells me if I had prompted it more, it would've corrected the mistakes. Yet, I always get people saying that if you can get \"replaced by AI\", you aren't a good developer. Like, come on... When I was first learning full stack, I almost gave up due to how difficult some of the concepts I had to learn were as a frontend dev. However, I pushed through to get it right, and then I went back to college, and my juniors who were asking me to debug spaghetti AI-generated CSS last semester had full-blown website prototypes with CRUD and login/signup using PHP and some SQL. The only thing I'd say I had over them is understanding the security stuff and knowing the concepts in and out as well as the architecture and the sheer speed at which I can work without Google or AI. And the fact that now people don't care about stuff like proper ci/cd or testing; they just want to ship features, while I had to sit and learn that stuff.\n\nThe bright side is my degree is B.Ed so I can teach professionally anywhere though I dread teaching ATM.",

I was looking and checking for a few good minutes, then prompted AI to find the problem. It didn't. All is fine. Clear the cache. Yada, yada.\n\nThen I've noticed that I was referencing a wrong name space for one of the parameters being used. so... my trusty AI is still a shithead. \n\nI've never successfully diagnosed any code issue with AI once.

He's not technical at all and the demo at least worked - it really wasn't bad. But as I sat there watching this, he was trying to get us pumped at how we can harness this to sell more of our app by flooding more features. I'm instead thinking \"if even this guy can do this, what value is any software going to have once this is a bit better and more widely adopted?\"\n\nThese execs and founders might get a small boost in sales for the next few quarters but if this stuff can replace all of us, it will crash their business model, too.\n\nMy experience with this stuff: I've been forced to use Claude at work so I took it for a test drive on my personal projects. In the last month I wrote a pretty intense D&D 5e character builder / campaign manager app with a lot of working features like leveling up and stuff, a writing app for writing fiction and managing all of my world building stuff, a dance practice app with a mobile app that acts as a remote to control playback speed and such, and a board game tracker for tracking which games we play, who wins, and our collection overall. Claude handled all of it effortlessly. Sometimes there is a bug or two and one additional prompt resolves basically all of them. How valuable is any of this when anyone can do it? I didn't have to provide technical diagrams, database relationships, or anything even remotely technical. Literally just tell it what I want in plain ass English.",

It was local extraction of data.\n\nThe other thing that is muddying the results is that the overarching recommendation was \"Update systems with modern cryptography\" which is great an all, except the ultimate point of passwords is to use them, so at some point they will be on your local system unencrypted. All the cryptography in the world doesn't eliminate the fact that at some point, you have to tell a website what your password is, in plain text. Your conversation (TLS/HTTPS) can be encrypted obviously.\n\nSomeone smarter than me should read that and give you a better outlook on those findings.",

People still pay the subscriptions for those other services, which is why they continue to go up frequently (because they get away with it) while very little changes in them - the UI largely stays the same, the content on them is the same (and in some cases the quantity lessened due to other streaming services getting rights), they’re just as buggy, etc., and always claim “innovation” as their reason for the price increase.\n\n1Password can’t be compared to some of that as it’s not a streaming platform, but they address their bugs (usually in a reasonably timely fashion), and have to constantly stay on top of cyber threats to prevent unauthorized access to credentials housed in their product - which, I’m sure becomes increasingly difficult given some of the tools available today, and trying to weave in some other new things to help users.\n\nSo, to me, if any of the services legitimately justify a price increase (let alone one so little - especially in comparison to what streaming platforms usually increment by) it’s a password manager.\n\nNot going to get into a political debate for the rest.",

When you do that it uses windows hello to fill in a password which can be very unsafe imo.\n\nNext it doesn’t have an application for Linux. So if you ever want to move from windows to Linux you will be missing out on the password manager.\n\nAnother downside as a European is that my data now is with an American company which has me worried about privacy. I think 1Password is Canadian which tracks a lot better imo\n\nBright side is that my not so techy wife uses it because it’s pre-installed. Sharing passwords is easy with another user.

Paste JSON, get TypeScript interfaces instantly. \n- **caniuse.com** — Most people know this one but still underuse it.

Dead simple for testing error handling in your frontend without mocking.\n- **jsoncrack.com** — Visualises JSON as an interactive graph.

Maybe I am not that “coder” (?), I always feel anxious to deal with JSON with code. bassanite.dev is my new favorite for complex structures. This one is a visual schema builder with a live content editor, meaning you can tweak fields and data on the fly. It handles conversions between JSON, JS Objects, Yup/Zod, TS, and Prisma perfectly. Plus, it’s privacy-first (all local) and shares via URL hash.\n\n[bgvault.tech](https://bgvault.tech): A fantastic resource for code snippet backgrounds. It had so many great options, though it seems down recently and not sure if it will come back soon (or anyone else knows what’s happening?)…but the GitHub is still there: [github.com/WabweniBrian/bgvault](https://github.com/WabweniBrian/bgvault) and there’s the code for the snippets still.\n\n[starting.app](https://www.starting.app) : One of the cleanest boilerplates/launchpads out there. The ability to customize colors and fonts with such a clean UI is a huge plus for rapid prototyping.",

We tried scaling VPS's but there is no clear pattern to when the platform might pick up and the scaling takes too long to react. Using a worker to handle the uploaded audio transmission blocks practically gets rid of the irregular scaling issues we had at the start. \n\nOnce the upload is received, the worker records it in the database and sends it to a Kafka stream which is how it is stored instead of traditional file storage. \n\nThe downside to workers is they are targets for abuse. You have to implement bot protection and build in authentication for each request. We use WAF to block repeated requests that fail auth (and also all countries that are not North America since our platform is specific to this region) alongside rate limiting requests as an added measure to prevent flooding. When your paying for every request a flood event that goes unchecked can cost you a ton of money. \n\n",

Among other things, it allows you to make smaller DOMs.\n\nI talk about a modern CSS technique that does that here:\n\nhttps://op111.net/posts/2023/08/lean-html-markup-with-modern-css/\n\nIt is an idea I started playing with when custom properties landed in browsers, around 2016 or 2017? Around 2021 I started using the technique in client sites too.\n\nNow I want to write a 2026 version of the post that talks about container queries too. The technique becomes more powerful if you can rely on container queries and on the cqw unit. (You cannot always. That stuff is still new.)\n\nFor an example of the convenience cqw offers if you can rely on it, see the snippets I have in this:\n\nhttps://omnicarousel.dev/docs/css-tips-know-your-width/",

But eventually they want an experienced full stack developer who can built their application or at least a production grade MVP for Free. \n\nI got curious seeing this kind of post and even approached one person. My God the person had some tantrum. He was already thinking of himself as Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page. He gave me Do's and Don't for building the application ( He is a non technical person Btw) \nHe gave me timeline, I can give feedback about changes, I can't have any opinion on the product. But funny enough I am the co founder. \n\nIt made me laugh so hard. Like seriously you want a production ready application. With 3-4 premium core features. Payment gateway integration. API integration. And in return you are giving me 10% of your business which doesn't even exist without me? \n\nPlease give me your thoughts on this. ",

          "text": "I see this like some stranger asking me \"Let's you buy us a lottery ticket, with your money, and if it wins, I will portion out you a 'fair' amount of the winnings.\"\n\nThe reality is that I've seen this scenario over and over and over; mostly it entirely fails, but sometimes with the 50/50, the business does make profits; at which time:\n\n* Business (ideas) guy is the one who dealt with the lawyers, the accountants, and any investors. Thus, tech half is entirely in the dark. \n* The business guy often just throws things in front of tech guy to sign saying, \"The investors/lawyers/accountants/client needs this signed, this is normal business practice.\" Sometimes these documents are legit, as in an NDA or something, but other times, it is a reworking of the shareholder's agreement because it had clauses giving the tech half \"too much power\"\n* Money starts coming in, and the business guy will be cagey as to how much, and where it si going.\n* Business guy realizes that tech guy having 50% sucks. He now has the money to hire tech people who don't get any share.\n* Business guy will bring in someone to be CTO COO or something because the tech guy needs \"adult supervision\". \n* If tech guy balks, business guy will have probably raised some money by selling off 5-10% of the company. There is a shareholder's vote, and tech guy gets demoted. \n* These lopsided votes happen one after another until tech guy quits, or is fired.\n* Some magical way, tech guy leaving triggers the loss of most, if not all of his equity.\n* Any lawsuits against business guy will have business guy using company funds to pay for his defense.\n\nIf, in the remote case you are tech guy and are stupid enough to do such a deal make sure there are a few things in your contract (get a lawyer who you picked):\n\n* Shotgun clause. You need to be able to force business guy out. \n* If you are 50/50 keep it exactly that. Have voting shares, and non voting shares. You and business guy keep 50% each, and your agreement to sell these requires, well, your agreement. \n* Everything you sign which isn't fantastically routine like an NDA goes to your lawyer. You don't want some family friend lawyer, but someone who is a pitbull. Looking over a contract for landmines isn't very expensive at all.\n* Be prepared to walk away. If business guy ever just presents you with a wildly unfair contract and you are early into the business. Don't negotiate, but walk away. Even if they back down this time, they will just take another run at you in the future. \n* Don't let them ever talk to the accountants, lawyers, investors without you in the room. Never, not once, zero. \n* All, and I mean ever penny, of spending has to be approved by both parties. Have it in the contract that any unapproved spending or signed contracts are to be covered by the single signing party. You can have this go to an arbitrator, where the losing party has to also pay for the arbitrator.\n\nThis last one was where a friend of mine used it as a nuclear option to annihilate his business partner post shotgun clause. This business MBA d-bag hired some friends, took some business trips, and signed some other contracts. Post, breakup from the shotgun clause, the d-bag now had the personal obligations of the severance of those employments, their salaries to date, etc. This came out of his shotgun clause payment; which was tiny.\n\nWhat the tech half did was to convince the business half that he was in financial distress. The MBA d-bag tried to take advantage of this and super lowballed him with a shotgun clause. The tech guy returned with the company lawyer, a few goons from a security company, and a bank draft for the matching shotgun clause. He and his fratboy recent hires were all out the door 5 minutes later. Except, the bank draft didn't go to the d-bag, it went to the lawyer, who was then going to deduct all the expenses that an arbitrator would say were owing. This pretty much eliminated the bulk of the money. \n\nOne extra bonus, was that in their contract, they had an extra bit that if certain clauses were contested in court, that not only would court costs be covered, but there was an additional penalty to the losing party. Around 100k or something.\n\nThe moral of the story is that I've seen very few tech/business partnerships work. The simple reality is that business people are a dime a dozen. But business capable tech people working in small teams are killer. Later on, they can hire all the business talent they might need. \n\nMost business people will argue they have domain experience and a network. Often this network only exists because they were fired from an industry job. Most people in this \"network\" are of the attitude, \"My connection to you was your position, not your person; so could you lose my number.\"\n\nWhere business people can bring value to the table, is if they literally bring value to the table. Some people have magical abilities to sell and/or raise money. Thus, far beyond \"an idea\" a real business person will show up with the company ready to hit the ground running. Clients who are willing to prepay for a product which doesn't exist, or invest in the business to the point where salaries can be paid. Often, these people can sell/raise money for anything. Thus, they are usually less enamored with a specific idea, but prefer ones which check those two simple boxes; easy to sell, easy to raise money with.\n\nThis last is a real business person; in which case, get the best contract you can, and then try to learn some of their magic along the way.",

They had all the ideas for features but accepted no input or critique for their business plan they've been baking for 3-5 years. Neither party wanted to pay anything and offered \"full time work\" as a possible reward for when funding started to trickle in.\n\nI tested the waters by adding my critiques and seeing how they'd respond. Sometimes it was a mix of \"idk yet\" and pushback. No enthusiasm for my interest in engaging ideas nor recognition that I knew my stuff—signs they just wanted a tech printer to just print off their ideas for free. Both individuals failed. I pulled away interest because I refuse to work full stack LEAD dev for free. It required a steep learning curve on my end as a frontend dev with zero pay or incentives other than \"trust me bro, you'll have a job\". There is a reason these people can't build teams around their generic products. I saw their proofs of concepts. Both ended up trying to vibe code their solution. Person one had most things built vibe coded and was loosely and indirectly asking me to either rebuild it all from scratch or fix their current vibe. Person two created a very skeletal poc, admitted they were in over their head, and wanted me to take over from the mess they had with a bunch of UI/UX failures.\n\nLong story short, I will never work for these people for free no matter how much I want projects to bolster my portfolio to return to the industry as a dev.

I started programming around the year 2000. I learned PHP before it supported OOP. I went from LAMP to every stack.\n\nSome software I wrote as a teenager is still live in prod as companies all these years later - I wish I was joking.\n\nI have two projects live in prod now - both have raked in millions and millions of dollars for the company I work for. I am probably coming up on $10 million.\n\nI was in federal prison for a long time for import chemicals from China. I used to manage strip clubs and before that I was a DJ for a living. I produce music and videos for free.\n\nIf you pirated music between 2007-2010, I probably helped you out. I launched one of the largest privatized music sharing communities in the world (as the lead developer).\n\nI have servers all over the world and a ton of domains.\n\nIf I like an idea - I just do it for free.\n\nNobody can stop me - I'm all the way up.\n\nI got everything I ever wanted in life times a hundred.\n\nWhile most of the people reading this are human, I am something else. \n\nYou may find this hard to digest - but I live this life and many others. The real me is floating somewhere, far away. I use some kind of device to be here... Not just here, but many other places. Even if I did tomorrow, in my reality, I will rewind the events until I am alive again. I will still be living multiple other lives.\n\nI am here to slay the dragon. \n\nSometimes I lose my path... I wander away. But never have you met somebody like me. A year in my life is a thousand years for most humans. \n\nIf you want me to help or not, I am always available for a free consultation. I have worked in many industries. All things are the same to me: tables of columns and rows.\n\nA real person like me doesn't ever do things for the money. That is why I crush my contemporaries. Money is but a material motive. How many lifetimes does it take to seek something more?\n\nI need for nothing. I want for nothing.\n\nTo entertain my mind is all I seek. \n\nAnybody reading this, doubt me now. But in the future, even a moment from now... You can reach out to me. And I will be there for you. Whatever resources I have, I will share with you. My knowledge, my skills, my dedication. \n\nPitch me your ideas and your projects. I have too many of my own to ever bother stealing yours. I can pitch you mine, if you are of a similar mind. \n\nMy cost is $0 and I will provide more value in this post than you may get out of any other human for the next year or more.\n\nIf you want to get an idea off the ground - let me know. Most people will never even taste the kind of success I have feasted upon my entire life. Almost everything I try to do (outside a few strange things), I am wildly successful at, beyond even my own wildest dreams. I can help you achieve these same levels of success and it doesn't cost you anything.\n\nMost other people don't even bring much to the table. I am the table. I am the house in which the table rests. \n\nIf I was tooting my own horn, the walls of Jericho would crumble.\n\nYou have nothing to lose.\n\n\"But I am not OP!\", okay.\n\n'but my idea isn't even done yet!\", okay.\n\nNothing should be a barrier.\n\nEvery single thing in life I wanted, I have achieved. \n\nI believe all people are created equal. I just invested more time in certain skills than some people may have done. That is why I am willing to share and consult and even work for free.\n\nWhoever else says they can help you? I will beat their price. I will beat their deadline. I will slaughter their skills. \n\nI do this for fun. I do this because I enjoy it. Some of my jobs pay me over $100 USD per hour. Others pay me $0. I give the same amount of effort to both. \n\nIf you want a worldly person with otherworldly experience, please, reach out. I will show you what I can do without you spending a penny.\n\nTell me, have you read somebody who has typed like me? I doubt it. If you have, you are blessed. I am always willing to network. Always willing to meet new people.\n\nYou can have no money and no skills and no ideas - but if you reach out to me, I still may be able to help you. What I am seeking in this life, I was born with.  Don't hesitate. I will always be there for you, even when nobody else is. As long as you know me, you will always have a friend.\n\n:)",

Now they're pushing agentic AI that hires other AI to scale the work. \n\nI don't understand this greed-driven need to replace humans. It doesn't work for me. \n\nEven if the OPs post said that Lovable did the work that five developers could do singlehandedly without failure, we're discarding the opportunity to build deep long-lasting business relationships and innovate to create new and interesting solutions. The best work I've ever done has come from rubber-ducking with like-minded people. \n\nA single knowledgeable person with experience could build a great application on their own, but in order to actually scale the thing, you really gotta have other hands on board! Share the load and all that. \n\nIn one of the subreddits dedicated to SaaS, I saw a post about how the future would be a single CEO in charge of literally every role with the help of AI.

I have 15 yoe in web development, I'm mainly backend so I sometimes offload some of the frontend work to an AI. But even then ~60 lines of code is where I draw the line. When it gets to above 100, it immediately becomes a tangled, unusable mess. And that is with me and my 15 yoe in webdev supervising it, not hope-prompting that any 9 year old can do.\n\nLet him suffer and enjoy his pain. We spent our years doing this stuff, they're just buying the AI hype that's being sold by, wait for it, *AI companies*.\n\nIt's like buying a slab of marble, cutting it in half with a chainsaw, and then asking a sculptor to make the statue of David out of it. *What do you mean it's in pieces? All the marble is still there!*\n\nGood luck finding a \"young and smart\" guy to fix this crap.",

          "text": "Same experience here. The tipping point for me was `:has()` — it eliminated so many \"parent needs to know about child state\" situations where I'd previously reach for JS.\n\nSome concrete replacements I've made this year:\n\n- **Scroll-to-top button visibility**: Used to use IntersectionObserver + state. Now it's `position: sticky` with `animation-timeline: scroll()` and a visibility toggle — zero JS.\n- **Accordion/collapsible sections**: The `<details>` element + CSS transitions on grid-template-rows. No library needed.\n- **Dark mode toggle persistence**: Still need JS for localStorage, but the actual theme switching is pure CSS custom properties + `:has(input:checked)` on a hidden toggle.\n- **Responsive layout switching**: Container queries completely replaced my resize observers. This alone probably saved 3-4KB of JS in one project.\n\nThe one area where I still reach for JS: **scroll-driven animations with precise waypoints**. The CSS scroll timeline API is powerful but the syntax is verbose and debugging is painful compared to something like GSAP's ScrollTrigger. For anything beyond simple parallax, JS is still more maintainable IMO.\n\nBiggest win though? Fewer hydration mismatches in SSR apps. CSS-only interactions don't care about the client/server boundary.",

CSS behavior mostly gets visual regression tested, if it gets tested at all. When you move validation logic into CSS selectors, you're often trading testable code for untestable markup. That's probably fine for most cases, but worth being deliberate about — especially for anything that touches form validation or accessibility state.\n\n\n\nThe \\`<dialog>\\` element is the one I keep going back to.

              "text": "So, as a public service, I’m going to list assumptions your systems probably make about names.  **All of these assumptions are wrong**.  Try to make less of them next time you write a system which touches names.\n\n1. People have exactly one canonical full name.\n2. People have exactly one full name which they go by.\n3. People have, at this point in time, exactly one canonical full name.\n4. People have, at this point in time, one full name which they go by.\n5. People have exactly N names, for any value of N.\n6. People’s names fit within a certain defined amount of space.\n7. People’s names do not change.\n8. People’s names change, but only at a certain enumerated set of events.\n9. People’s names are written in ASCII.\n10. People’s names are written in any single character set.\n11. People’s names are all mapped in Unicode code points.\n12. People’s names are case sensitive.\n13. People’s names are case insensitive.\n14. People’s names sometimes have prefixes or suffixes, but you can safely ignore those.\n15. People’s names do not contain numbers.\n16. People’s names are not written in ALL CAPS.\n17. People’s names are not written in all lower case letters.\n18. People’s names have an order to them.  Picking any ordering scheme will automatically result in consistent ordering among all systems, as long as both use the same ordering scheme for the same name.\n19. People’s first names and last names are, by necessity, different.\n20. People have last names, family names, or anything else which is shared by folks recognized as their relatives.\n21. People’s names are globally unique.\n22. People’s names are *almost* globally unique.\n23. Alright alright but surely people’s names are diverse enough such that no million people share the same name.\n24. My system will never have to deal with names from China.\n25. Or Japan.\n26. Or Korea.\n27. Or Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Russia, Sweden, Botswana, South Africa, Trinidad, Haiti, France, or the Klingon Empire, all of which have “weird” naming schemes in common use.\n28. That Klingon Empire thing was a joke, right?\n29. Confound your cultural relativism!  People ***in my society***, at least, agree on one commonly accepted standard for names.\n30. There exists an algorithm which transforms names and can be reversed losslessly.  (Yes, yes, you can do it if your algorithm returns the input.  You get a gold star.)\n31. I can safely assume that this dictionary of bad words contains no people’s names in it.\n32. People’s names are assigned at birth.\n33. OK, maybe not at birth, but at least pretty close to birth.\n34. Alright, alright, within a year or so of birth.\n35. Five years?\n36. You’re kidding me, right?\n37. Two different systems containing data about the same person will use the same name for that person.\n38. Two different data entry operators, given a person’s name, will by necessity enter bitwise equivalent strings on any single system, if the system is well-designed.\n39. People whose names break my system are weird outliers.  They should have had solid, acceptable names, like 田中太郎.\n40. People have names.\n\n  \n[https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)",

And even if Unicode isn't in use, these characters are like, some of the most commonly found ones in any character set used in Western Europe and USA. They are found in Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1 and so on. So it's kind of telltale that yeah, it's plain pure ASCII in use.\n\nCan't say the systems I worked in necessarily filled every point you make, but yeah, where I live all public service name forms have at least been supporting Unicode for a long time; and usually there are separate fields for e.g. the name you are called by; and length limits are really large. I have needed to fix a bunch of cases though where the system hasn't supported someone's name. Lack of name has not been supported in the systems I've worked with, though, those systems tend to in any case require that a person has some sort of a registered identification in some other service.

Oh, single input for name - this is an open question if you ask me. There are cases where financial institutions or accounting software will require first, last and sometimes even middle. There are also heavily Legacy stuff that has just always been built like that. BUT, in terms of modelling \"names\" a single non-restricted unicode input is actually better in almost all cases.... Not all cultures have multiple names, and the difference between \"first\", \"family\" and their ordering varies from westernized first-last.\n\nMany of the length restrictions are for interfacing with legacy systems that more often than naught just want to spit the name out on an addressing label where only 100 columns of space are available.

              "text": "I really like the UK's gov.uk site as a starting point for form UX.  They have a whole section in the design system for [patterns of inputing data](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/), and they're well-researched, and designed to be as accessible as possible.\n\nBased on their advice:\n\n* [Names](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/names/): This depends on what your data needs to look like internally, but they recommend a single field if you can get away with it (and don't need to split the name into \"first\"/\"last\"/etc).  Otherwise, ask only for the specific information you need.\n* [Phone Numbers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/phone-numbers/): Single field, but use examples and add clarifications such as \"for international numbers include the country code\" so that the user understands the format.  Strip out space characters and add the right autocomplete tags etc.  And validate the number using an up-to-date library so you can give the user feedback (e.g. there are too many or too few digits).\n* [Addresses](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/addresses/): This depends on where the user is.  If you know the format of the address, then provide multiple inputs, one for each line (and make sure there's enough inputs!).  Interestingly, they don't split house number and street name at all, and just keep it as a single line.  If you know the address will be a UK address, they recommend using an address finder so the user can look up their postcode and select from a limited number of options, making things easier.  (This works well in the UK, where postcodes can't contain more than 100 addresses, and on average contain around 15.)  If neither option works, use a text area and let the user write freeform text — but bare in mind that you won't be able to parse it later, if you need to do that.\n* [Dates](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/): There's a few different patterns here, but for known dates (e.g. dates of birth), they recommend three numeric-only text inputs, with clear labels and an example (e.g. \"27 3 2025\") that disambiguates the positions of the inputs.  They also link a [blog post about why they don't recommend dropdowns](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/05/asking-for-a-date-of-birth/), which is quite interesting.\n* [Text inputs generally](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/) should be as wide as they need to be, and you generally want each question to have its own line.  So \"City and State\" should probably be two questions with two different fields on two lines.\n\nImportantly, gov.uk is the UK's government services website, so there are a lot of digital forms on there but they do probably have different requirements than the average e-commerce site or something similar.  Accessibility is obviously vital, but also the target audience is often people in extreme need who need extra support from the Government, so if just a tiny fraction of people are confused by dropdowns for dates, say, then it's still worth finding a better alternative.  That extreme level of care might not be as important in most commercial applications.\n\nSimilarly, there are a lot of assumptions around the UK's rules for e.g. addresses or names, which might not apply to other countries (and in particular might not apply when dealing with people who could be from any country).  Ideas that work for gov.uk might not work as well for a site that should be equally accessible to people from various countries around the world, with different ideas of what a name is or how to write their address.\n\nThat said, I think the general principles there are great, and when there are surprising things (e.g. using number fields for dates instead of dropdowns), there's often a blog or comment that explains some of the reasoning behind each decision.",

It's closer to like be a super system analyst giving instructions to speedy junior devs on steroid.\n\nOpposite to programming where it sometimes can be relaxing, where when we do some mundane codes like property mapping, logging, etc where the feedback may be slower and letting your brain rest, now the high speed feedback from AI and the need to review the output really drains your brain energy fast.\n\nJust imagine that a feature that usually be done in one week now you do in one day, the discoveries, feedbacks and adjustment that you usually do across the span of one week now you do in one day, it should have taken a burden for you.",

              "text": "Yeah, I can confirm. It *is* indeed a problem. And not a small one. This is why human reviews are still extremely important. When vibe coding, you may still have control about *what*, to some extent about *how*, and in a way also about *why.* But you entirely lose control about the interconnection between these aspects. The *what* have I implemented *how* and *why* have I implemented it that way? This is what's lost when you vibe code. I am in the same situation, luckily my colleague is a very thorough and picky reviewer. He reviews code that I overlooked. The sheer amount of code that is generated in a very short amount of time is too much for one person and too much to keep in-depth knowledge about. It's almost like in school where, when you just take a photo of the chalkbord, you're not gonna learn a thing. You need to read it and actively write it down to move it into your long term memory. \n\nIt is indeed a problem. And yes, I must say, I haven't written that much actual code in the past year myself (also about 20 years of coding experience). \n\nOr is it? \n\nI do not know if this is going to be the way we all are going to develop software in the future. I suppose it is, because the models will become better and better, and are probably also going to overtake us humans in code elegance and resilience to the point where we do not even need reviews anymore. But we're not there yet. Far from it. \n\nThe codebase I am vibe-coding in uses all sorts of quality gates independent of AI. The usual stuff from before LLMs. Pre-commit hooks that do linting and beautifying, a unit test coverage that I'd never reached before, same about documentation. Static code analysis for security, vulnerability scanners, automatic pentests, all sorts of non-AI things that I usually let loose on my human coded projects too. \n\nI also regularly switch the model in order to avoid some sort of AI tunnel vision too (which may be an illusion, but well...), and have a comprehensive review of the entire code base autogenerated. I let multi-agent systems hunt for code smells, bugs, flaws, dead code, deprecated libs, suggest simplifications and improvements. It helps a lot. But! The one thing that all of this, regardless of the actual quality of the outcome, can't give me is in-depth knowledge about the code base. The question is, if I really need it, since I do have an LLM that I can ask questions about it. The question is, do I still have it about my other, older, non-vibe coded projects? Aren't they the same now? Or other people's human-written code? I would have to read into that code as well in the case of a problem. LLMs now can help me with that too. \n\nI remember a time when I had to look into the code base of another team because we were acceed the duty to maintain it for them. Without LLMs it took me weeks, months and a constant back and forth to get into it. Some of the code was so... spaghetti that I simply couldn't get my head around it, even with the effort of giving explanations by the people who wrote it. I bet if I'd had a LLM of today's standards, I'd have been able to explain or even refactor the code into something that would have been much simpler and much more comprehensible. \n\nSo, conclusion: it's a double-edged sword. The question is whether we really need the in-depth knowledge about the code base, considering the fact that we're gonna lose the details anyway after a couple weeks or months not working with it. As long as we have a thorough understanding and documentation of the concepts that are used, not why line 104 does exactly what it does, it should - in my humble opinion - be enough. For everything deeper we already have the necessary tools and processes that help us keep the quality at a level that we're fine with. ",

It also uses signal like encryption. It is also multi platform. This would have taken me and my team probably two months to build, it took me a week and 55mil tokens ~$200. So that saved us a lot and that’s just a subsystem. \n\nIt REALLY struggled to write the ssh logic to allow orchestration of transfers from the server through the vue, but for the normal server operations and the ui you can just blow through iterations, completely rewrite the html and APIs in sweeping statements (have to remind it to use code that already exists as the codebase gets big, but then you just refactor the filesystem to be more context friendly) and re release it almost as fast as requirements come in. \n\nHuge huge savings. Don’t have to read api specs yourself anymore, just ask the llm, the integrations piece is basically solved by them. It’s incredible",

(pre-llm).  They're one of the few rust people that has been especially interested in 'agent' coding.  (And so they're a useful example for me -- I know they can make good things.  Their opinion holds weight.).\n\nOne of the things Armin mentioned recently \\[heavily paraphrased by me\\] was that people who have the ai-coding fire lit in them (of which he is one): one of the things that they're excited about is the roughness of the landscape.  The layers upon layers of obfuscating abstraction weighed on serious work.  Part of what feels so productive is that ... a lot of the llm coders \\*aren't\\* yet doing serious work.  They're doing rough work.  \\[And that feels okay, because we're in an exploratory phase.\\]\n\nSo it's not clear to me that the claims of productivity and excitement are quite apples to apples right now.\n\nRelated, I was just talking to someone who's all about vibe coding.  And they were excitedly describing the systems they're setting up and outlining how, eventually it's going to just do everything on its own and create great code.  Their excitement comes from their partially built pipeline and exploratory outings.  Not from having made anything that they like.\n\nThere's also examples like this from \\[Jon Gjengset\\]([https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT](https://youtu.be/EL7Au1tzNxE?si=UDTr8F0QuA87wkKT)): it's a 3 hour coding stream.  In it they try to port a library, with test suite, from one language to another.  There's a lot of redirection and fixing and insight required.  But they claim that the task would be almost undoable by hand.  I don't know how to feel yet.  But it's *interesting.*",

We (or rather the llms) write code faster than we humans can review. We do have bots enabled to review prs that catch logical mistakes or code changes that diverge from the intent of the pr based on the pr description but they are not perfect. So code quality and reliability definitely has sufered over the last year.\n\n\n3- Yep, we do have tools that are able to scan our entire codebase when researching/planning changes. I’m not sure how much context our PR review bot has though but when I research while writing design documents, i’m able to scan multiple repos at once.\n\n\n4- how we interview is a massive open question right now. There are two schools of thought, i) ban all AI during interviews and hope candidates don’t cheat, ii) simulate actual working environment by allowing use of AI during interviews and grade people on how they use AI, how they prompt it, how they review the generated code etc. if your interviewing with us, on your tech interviews you are likely to get both kinds of interviews. \n\n\n5- Our overall engineering team is roughly 20% smaller. We had two years of back to back layoffs and haven’t replaced the headcount. In the last year my team went from 9 to 6 engineers but our scope hasn’t decreased by much so we are all carrying more responsibility managing more projects, spending more time oncall etc.",

How are we as a relatively small startup supposed to protect ourselves from malicious users using this ability to host child porn or even become used as a sharing site? Normally before you have access to a project and thus upload ability, you would be under a paid plan, but it’s probably relatively simple to get invited by someone in a paid plan (like with spoofed emails pretending to be colleague) and then gain access to the ability to upload files. Is this even a realistic risk or would this kind of malicious actor have much easier ways to achieve the same?

The initial HTTP handshake → 101 Switching Protocols → full-duplex flow is something a lot of devs use daily (via Socket.io or similar) but never actually understand at the protocol level. It would fit perfectly with your existing format.\n\nAlso, the HTTPS section could benefit from showing the 0-RTT resumption failure case — what happens when the server rejects the early data and falls back to a full handshake. That's the part that catches people off guard in production when they're debugging intermittent TLS issues.\n\nReally nice work overall.
