Hours before he went on air, he released a proposal to \"fix Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\"\n\n> https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348238/zuckerberg-dorsey-pichai-section-230-hearing-misinformation\n\n> CDA230 is the rule that says that the people who publish unlawful speech should be accountable for it – not the service providers that hosted the speech (but it does allow online services to moderate speech it finds offensive).\n\n> CDA230 is among the only good technology laws the US Congress ever adopted, and without it, no one would ever host your complaint about a business, your #MeToo whistleblowing, your negative reviews or your images of official corruption or police violence.\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/03/25/facebook-has-a-facebook-problem/\n\nYeah, you're not going to like him if you're mostly okay with the economic status quo, but don't make stuff up. Cory is not Lisan al-Gaib or whatever, but he has a lot of good ideas and a talent for making something as boring as bilateral trade agreements interesting. I found [this recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C1Gnxhfok0) interesting and engaging. I also don't think he claims everything he talks about to be *his ideas*, either. A lot of it comes from the EFF",

They are the same types of people who monetize over the latest fad, whether its paranormal, aliens or dumping on celebrities. I wouldn't let it worry you.\n\nThe problem isn't AI driven development, IMO. It's the person submitting the code. I've been in the business since the 90's and interviewed tons of people who didn't know enough to realize they knew very little about programming. They get weeded out and hopefully learn where their deficits are. If someone is tricking their way into a position by submitting vibe coded slop, then that's on the interviewers. Hell, I've been burned by fakers and ne'er do-wells before, and its frustrating. You want to trust them. But their ability to bullshit through an interview will get them in the door more times than I like. \n\nIn the enterprise world, we use AI all day, but only as a tool. A really good tool, but it doesn't mean we get to cram more tickets in a sprint. We still have rules to follow, proper code reviews on Merge Requests, QA, Jira and Confluence hygiene, Scrum, you name it. Coding is a small fraction of the work, but when stuff goes wrong, there is a lot of blame to go around. Someone failed along the journey to catch it. \n\nIn my case, a deployment of mine failed because I discovered that I left in some debug code inserted by Claude. It was totally my fault, not Claude. I have to stand by every single line. Luckily, it was a good learning opportunity for us early in our AI coding decisions and we are all learning its strengths and weaknesses, but have no illusions on just how much productivity you can squeeze into a sprint that has built in time sinks for non-coding work. \n\nIn the enterprise world, I'm not worried about AI.

A fan looked into it, profiling and disassembling the game, and discovered that the load time was due to the game loading a 10 megabyte hunk of JSON data with 63,000 entries, and then parsing it in a way that caused the game to iterate over the entire entire JSON string, from beginning to end, for every single item (so parsing 10 megabytes of text 63,000+ times).",

      "text": "Hello!   \nAs the title says, I am basically annoyed by people who keep telling me that I should ditch CSS and learn one of these high level frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. I simply don't see the reason of these two frameworks. CSS was created to separate style from object instantiation (in this case, the objects are HTML tags). Then, these frameworks combine them again into one entity... they basically undo a solution to a problem that existed before and it's become a problem again. Well, my reasoning here might be nuanced more or less so I will express my problems with it :  \n  \n**My subjective reasons for disliking CSS frameworks :**  \n\\->I already learned CSS and I'm really good at it. Learning something else that does the exact same thing is not worth to me. I'd rather spend the time doing anything else.  \n\\->Reading lines as large as the width of a monitor to identify and modify styles is much harder than locating the specific class that's stylizing the tag and read the properties one below another (where each one is a very short line).  \n  \n**My objective reasons for why I think vanilla CSS is better :**  \n\\->Less dependencies, especially for websites that are small and that could load in an instant. The web is full of dependencies and useless JavaScript imports that adding CSS frameworks too on top of it is simply not worth it.  \n\\->All websites are looking too similar. These frameworks are killing more the personality and creativity of frontend developers, just as the corporation push the \"Alegria art\" on every product they have (and this shit is ugly and sucks ass).   \n\\->Whenever you need to create a costum style or costum behavior, these frameworks will stay in your way because these frameworks are more or less predefined styles that you can attach to your tags and slightly modify.  \n\\->Vanilla CSS allows you to reuse a class for as many elements you want and create subclasses for specific changes. It even allows you to make and use variables so you can easily swap a size or a color later. But these frameworks are... write once and forget it... until you need to come back to change something... \n\nAlso, for those who say it's easier to use for organizing big teams... I work in web development and I can say for sure that 50% of the time working is basically useless team meetings... instead of actual coding. Also, corportions have now more money than they ever had, they managed to kill their competition so... they have all the time in the world to properly onboard people on local and costum code.",

I personally love languages without a lot of ceremonies, boilerplate, and inflexibility in how to do things that come with opinionated languages. But there are some languages that are very opinionated that make it easier to onboard people and ramp up on new areas of large codebases because it is the same methods across the board in that codebase, and most every other codebase in that language.",

Utility-first CSS evolved and was adopted by leads and seniors PRECISELY because it solves the issues that the \"just write CSS\" crowd have clearly never encountered.\n\n* Visual regressions caused by rushed changes that abuse the cascade.\n* Long onboarding of new developers who need to learn not just what the CSS names are, but where they are defined, and if there are cascade headaches.\n* Naming classes (there's a reason there's a saying 'the two hardest things in programming are naming things and invaliding cache', both of which are triggered by semantic CSS).\n\nThe number one thing these junior and mid-level devs don't seem to understand is we went through 10 years of constantly trying new techniques to solve these problems. OOCSS, ITCSS, SMACSS, BEM, AtomicCSS. None of them worked in the end because the underlying fundamental issue was semantic CSS (naming the classes after how they're used; not what they do), which prevented scaling.\n\nIn theory, semantic CSS can work if it's controlled tightly. In practice, that was impossible due to commercial pressures of \"just get it in\" or \"this needs doing immediately\", which once you started on that path, it was doomed to failure.\n\nTailwind wasn't some magical thing. It succeeded because Adam came from the Laravel community and that – like Ruby, Spring Boot, [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) – are primarily convention over configuration. And that was the thing utility first frameworks like BeardCSS that came before it lacked.\n\nTailwind isn't adopted because people don't like writing CSS. It's adopted because your job is to solve problems, not write code. And this solves several of the biggest cost centres in front end development.",

They do not clash with Tailwind at all.\n\nIt's faster to develop with Tailwind because every lower level class you need already exists, so you are just writing css directly in the same file, constructing them from lower level classes. There is **zero latency**.\n\nThe entire idea of Tailwind is reusability. Tailwind is astronomically more efficient by default than most developers who use vanilla css. There is actually less stylesheet bloat in general with Tailwind because your stylesheet comes  from one single file that is quite light in size, not hundreds of different .css files.\n\nIf you write a custom stylesheet, how many times have you written \"padding\" in a stylesheet? Tailwind has classes for all **low level** styles. So nothing is ever being duplicated. Every element you write CSS for in Tailwind are all using existing stylesheets. Nothing is ever duplicated. That's why there is significant less bloat with Tailwind compared to typical vanilla CSS.\n\nOf course, you could be a very forward thinking CSS developer, and write classes out yourself for all the lower level stuff, then reuse them when writing new classes. But, you'd just be doing the exact same thing that Tailwind already does. Except you just reinvented the wheel for no reason.\n\nTailwind does not make you \"forget CSS\". You cannot use Tailwind without knowing how to write CSS. I've used Tailwind for the last year and a half now and I can still switch to Vanilla CSS when I've needed to. Writing Tailwind CSS is the same as writing Vanilla CSS, it's just written in a different file with a slight variation of names. That's it. If you're a great CSS developer, you'll be great writing Tailwind.\n\nSo is Tailwind bad? No. Is Vanilla CSS bad? No. Do you not know what you're talking about and deciding to bash something before having actually used it? Yes.",

Those selectors contain style declarations which alter the visual style of the elements to which they are attached. Nothing here is _not_ CSS.\n\n> I already learned CSS and I'm really good at it.\n\nCongrats, CSS is a massive knowledge area and mastering it is key to being a well-rounded FE engineer. Working with a framework is a skill you add on top of this knowledge, not a replacement for it.\n\n> Reading lines as large as the width of a monitor to identify and modify styles is much harder than locating the specific class that's stylizing the tag and read the properties one below another.\n\nValid. Though many people, myself included, think the context-switching of jumping from CSS to markup and back over and over again is more painful than reading out a long class list directly in the markup. Outside of your component libraries - looking at you, <Button> - how long are your class lists, really?\n\nWith Bootstrap though, IIRC, you are just adding component-level class names ('button', etc) which do then map to a group of properties - as opposed to a single property, like Tailwind - which is exactly the thing that you are describing you would rather do.\n\n> Less dependencies, especially for websites that are small and that could load in an instant.\n\nSure. But a hammer is not _bad_ just because it isn't right for _every_ nail.\n\n> adding CSS frameworks too on top of it is simply not worth it.\n\nTo whom? In which cases? Define \"worth it\". Every engineering decision has trade-offs.\n\n> All websites are looking too similar.\n\nThis is a themeing/design issue that is really independent of which framework you use. If you don't like the default tailwind color palette, make your own.\n\n> Whenever you need to create a costum style or costum behavior, these frameworks will stay in your way because these frameworks are more or less predefined styles.\n\nThis may be more true in bootstrap than in tailwind. I've had no issue customizing every last bit of Tailwind. I _just_ (like yesterday) implemented in Tailwind a completely custom design system our design team just handed off. Regardless, if the framework is getting in your way for some task, just don't use it for that task. You still have access to \"normal\" styling.\n\n> Vanilla CSS allows you to reuse a class for as many elements you want and create subclasses for specific changes. It even allows you to make and use variables so you can easily swap a size or a color later.\n\nYou can reuse every class defined in either Tailwind or Bootstrap. Why couldn't you? Tailwind is largely powered by variables (CSS custom properties) that allow you to, as you say, \"easily swap a size or color later\". I don't understand either part of this argument.",

I argue that for enterprise work styles should be local first AND it should be obvious in a code review when someone on the team decides to introduce a global style that will affect the whole app. Frameworks help in the sense of a 'low trust' environment where the framework already has an opinion and the team needs to be consistent and stay more granular in their changes. You could say \"just learn css better and do it properly\" but most devs just hack together css until it works.

          "text": "My opinion started exactly the same as yours.   I coded all of our sites static pages in the last, 100% w3c validation on markup, css and accessibility (for a very large website, over 3k pages).  I had all style sheets, templates etc organized and could easily grab one, modify what was necessary to create a new page or set of pages, and tweak as needed on css, adding new classes where needed.   So when everyone started with the “omg bootstrap” I refused as I felt there was no real need.  \n\nAt the time I was correct, however with the move to more dynamic frameworks, something like plugging the bootstrap library into a cms or having it available is a breeze.  Bootstrap is solid, breaks no validation kept up-to-date and generically attractive.   Implementation works without a thought (which I think is part of what you might be saying here, there’s no thinking involved using a library, it is more plug n play).  I now see the value of having this library. I went through the same thing when sass first came out, why would I need variables etc?   But omg, once I incorporated even the first few for some header and footer colors, I was sold. \n\nSo I completely appreciate your stance on this because still in the back of my mind is “who needs this stuff when you can expert code it yourself”, but I also see the advantage in using a well documented css library that even a new dev joining a project can grasp, as well as future devs (what happens when you or I leave and someone now has to make sense of our css, naming conventions, organization, etc.    We all know that the documentation freaks are sadly fewer than we can hope for, so what seems obvious to you in a use-case can be completely confusing to someone else.  \n\nSo sadly I am at least partially a convert to the new ways, but I appreciate your worship of the old gods also.   I still feel it.",

Also, to the point of many commenters, I don't generally work in large teams. However...\n\n> All websites are looking too similar. These frameworks are killing more the personality and creativity of frontend developers, just as the corporation push the \"Alegria art\" on every product they have (and this shit is ugly and sucks ass).\n\nThis comment reminds me of two terrible things:\n\n1. The early/mid years of the internet when \"clever\" site designs were trendy and you'd get to a \"unique\" looking website and have no clue how to use it. (Kind of like those Apple-like pages today that hijack your scroll wheel and break expectations about how web pages are interacted with.) CSS is made by committees that decide the full toolset that's needed for the web. Frameworks play a different role by bringing together many stakeholders to decide how that toolset is best used.\n2. The other is my early days as a developer when I'd receive a photoshop file of a beautiful web page drawn by a graphic designer who had no real clue or care about any of the technical details of implementing their vision. The amount of wasted hours implementing very subtle details that probably didn't really matter but just happened to be really hard to phrase in web tech at the time... Plenty of times it makes sense to place the creativity and uniqueness second and look at the cost of that creativity. Massaging a vision until it fits into something that's easy to do in the tech can often be well worth it for everybody.\n\nWebsites looking similar is, in general, optimal for users and optimal for developers.\n\n- For users, consistent appearance means it's immediately apparent how to use a site, what things do, what they mean, etc. It's good for users that don't want to spend any effort \"figuring out\" your site. It's good because that singular standard look probably bakes in over time so many subtle accessibility fixes that you yourself probably aren't even aware of or can't keep in your head for every design. It's good because that look is tested on more devices and platforms than you'll ever hold. A framework is going to be improving based on feedback from many times the amount of users you have.\n- For developers, consistent appearance means that you're not reinventing the wheel for the sake of it. You need to consciously choose to deviate from the efficient path.\n\nSimilar appearance should be the default and unique appearance, for users and developers alike, should be a deviation that must be argued for and supported. Websites aren't created to provide time for \"creativity of frontend developers\". Developers are in service of users and the business (or equivalent) stakeholder. If doing the job well for those stakeholders is boring and impersonal, put your selfishness aside and just do that thing.\n\n> Also, for those who say it's easier to use for organizing big teams... I work in web development and I can say for sure that 50% of the time working is basically useless team meetings... instead of actual coding.\n\nWhy would that be a useful counterpoint? Troubling organizing is a thing that surfaces both in code time and in meeting time. Ideally, the more it surfaces while coding the more you talk about it in meetings to find ways to address it.\n\n> Also, corportions have now more money than they ever had, they managed to kill their competition so... they have all the time in the world to properly onboard people on local and costum code.\n\n1. Corporations aren't the creators of the majority of websites.\n2. The reason they are profitable is specifically because they don't make those inefficient decisions for the sake of it.\n3. Why would they do that? You work for them, they don't work for you. If you don't like that the people who make the money to pay developers want to decide what developers develop, then avoid employers and clients and be self employed.",

Some projects really don't need a dedicated library or a component framework like ShadCN, but I can see why it's beneficial for larger ones, especially when you may have multiple people working on the same part of a project over multiple days. It's the same reason why linters and code style guidelines exist.\n\nI also have to comment on this \n\n>Reading lines as large as the width of a monitor to identify and modify styles is much harder than locating the specific class that's stylizing the tag and read the properties one below another (where each one is a very short line).\n\nI disagree entirely - with utility-first approach, you look at mark-up and can pretty much right away understand what the component is supposed to look like. When I see '.card' or '.hero-container-left' or whatever other magical identifier the dev before me decided on, I can maybe guesstimate, based on my previous experiences with such components, what it's meant to be, but I still have to read the properties, and it can get messy and kinda time-consuming with large components with many nested elements. As long as the classes have names corresponding to what they do, understanding them is as easy as understanding css itself.\n\n\"flex items-center justify-around mx-4 my-2 text-black bg-slate-200 hover:bg-slate-700 hover:text-white transition-all duration-250\"\n\nIt's really not that complex. You don't need to use all of TW's features, it can be as complex or as simple in your project as you need. And if you want to not have this crap in your markup, there is a way to use Tailwind's classes  inside the <style> tag, but I forgot the exact directive (@includes I think?).\n\n>Vanilla CSS allows you to reuse a class for as many elements you want and create subclasses for specific changes. It even allows you to make and use variables so you can easily swap a size or a color later. But these frameworks are... write once and forget it... until you need to come back to change something...\n\nTailwind lets you edit and expand basically its entire theme. Screen-size breakpoints, typography, color themes, animations. I haven't used Bootstrap for a long while but I'm pretty sure it lets you change some stuff too - though it's not really meant for that, Bootstrap is more for when you just want to have decently-looking and working stuff ASAP.  \n  \nThis kinda reads like a 'you' problem to me, if I'm honest.\n\nTailwind's biggest weakness is that it needs a build step, so if you don't have access to source code (like you're working on a weirdly closed-in CMS for example - hello IdoSell) where you have to copypaste code blocks into UI elements, yeah it's a pain in the ass. \n\nBut that can be solved by just writing a pretty simple utility-first library for yourself. Layout, some colors via css variables, typography, gutter sizes, maybe some simple transitions and you've got basically like 95% of the stuff needed for most websites. \n\nI will agree on the web looking very samey, but I'll say I blame the popularity of mobile devices as browsing tools more. There's just less you can get away with when your screen's width is like 20% of an average computer screen, and you kinda want your website to be usable for people, so a lot of eyecandy often has to go.",

          "text": "Personally, I have found that most people don't understand CSS that well and it's not entirely their fault. There are definitely many confusing parts of CSS. Those parts exist not because something is happening randomly but because most behaviours aren't well explained in the general sites that people use to learn.\n\nSome time back I was reading the CSS spec guide. And using that I found out that `display` can take two values, one for `display out` and one for `display in`. This did allow me to create an `inline flex`.\n\nNow people who know CSS well know that there's another property that combines these two properties and you don't need to write them like this. But that's the point, I was trying to understand that one word property and hence I went on exploring how `display` actually works.\n\nSo, frameworks are a way so that the general public doesn't have to understand how the web really works and still produce some code. Just look at React replacing all the HTML tags with `div`.\n\nBut instead of using some framework, I now just use  a `GUIDELINES.md` for CSS guidelines to follow in a project. I am wondering if I can find some parser that can check if the guidelines are followed and pass or fail builds based on that. If I have that I probably will never require to use another CSS framework.\n\nLastly, I just want to say that you spelled \"**custom**\" wrong every time. It was kind of bugging me, reading that so many times.",

And also I do not agree :)  \nI'm writing CSS since \\~2005, used all major frameworks, advocated (https://workingdraft.de/378/) for TailwindCSS before its v1 release and used it in most of my projects.\n\nLike it's always in life one has to gain experience to make wise/good/better decisions.  \nSo my experience is:   \nTailwind is perfect for quick prototypes, because it basically takes away all technical design decisions upfront. Install Tailwind and start developing.  \nSame for very small one/off projects where you know upfront, you won't have to work ever again on this project.\n\nFor everything else, Tailwind is a burden:  \nThe HTML gets really unreadable, especially if you have to implement complex designs. Just take a look to one of the bigger components on Tailwind Plus. You're in hell, if you need to make changes, which would be mostly a breeze with \"just CSS\".\n\nYou are forced to work with Components to prevent duplicated, long lines of CSS-Classes. Working with components may be very hard, depending on which project you are working (not every project is a greenfield project).\n\nYou are basically unlearning CSS, or if you're a junior, you won't learn CSS at all. And trust me, there are times, you have to write Vanila-CSS, though Tailwind covers a big part of CSS's possibilities.  \nThe main reason I'm currently moving away from Tailwind is because I was shocked a few months ago, when I discovered what I've missed in the CSS world and how powerful it got. I get it, the argument could be: that's why framework exists, to extract away the complexities. Yes and No - I think you should know your tools, all your tools.\n\nThese are just my 2 cents ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯  \nCurrently I'm working mostly with the CubeCSS methology (https://cube.fyi/) and it feels like I've arrived. No more fighting against a framework (hi Bootstrap), no more ignoring the cascade because it's bad (hello BEM), no more mixing things in a way together, which is \"unhealthy\" (that's you, Tailwind)… just embracing the capabilities of CSS.",

You use your knowledge of CSS to write the class lists.\n\n- *dependency bloat affecting page load speed*: Almost all use-cases of these frameworks incorporate them at the build step. In production you just have vanilla CSS. No extra dependencies. In fact, the outputted CSS is often smaller than badly written CSS (of which there is a lot out there)\n\n- *everything looking the same*: some frameworks, like bootstrap, are opinionated and have a distinctive style, but others are not. Yes some people use them as a design starting point but, again, most do not.\n\n- *custom functionality*: there's nothing to stop you writing vanilla CSS alongside these frameworks as, again, all they do is output more vanilla CSS.\n\nI agree the class lists quickly become ugly and unmaintainable. To solve this you really need to be using partials and components (which I know isn't always suited to a project)",

Pair it with semantic HTML and you can build responsive layouts without a single framework.  \n  \nWhere “CSS is enough” breaks down is when people are really arguing about:  \n  \n\\- Design systems at scale (tokens, theming)  \n\\- Component reuse across teams  \n\\- Tooling for consistency (linting, docs, etc.)  \n  \nBut if you’re a solo dev or small team, the framework tax is real. You spend more time wiring build tools than solving the user problem.  \n  \nFunny enough, I’ve started using **Manus web builder** for quick marketing sites because it generates a solid baseline from a plain-English prompt, and then I just tweak the styling. The reason it fits this convo: it does **code export**, so you can pull the generated HTML/CSS and keep things lightweight—no vendor lock-in, no mystery runtime. If you need more than static pages, you can still use its **backend/auth/database** features, but the front-end can remain “just CSS.”  \n  \nSo yeah: CSS is enough… until org complexity forces other compromises.",

Astro has been gaining a ton of momentum as the go to framework for content heavy sites that need to be fast. Cloudflare obviously sees value in owning that space especially with their Pages platform competing directly with Vercel and Netlify.\n\n\n\nThe real question is whether Astro will stay framework agnostic or if theyll start pushing deeper Cloudflare integration. One of Astros strengths has been that you can use it with React Vue Svelte whatever and deploy anywhere. If they start optimizing specifically for Cloudflare Workers or Pages that could be great for performance but might alienate people who want to deploy elsewhere.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side Cloudflare has a pretty good track record of keeping their acquisitions open and community focused. Wrangler and Workers are still usable outside the Cloudflare ecosystem so hopefully Astro stays similarly flexible. Plus having Cloudflares resources behind it means better docs faster bug fixes and potentially some really interesting performance optimizations at the edge.\n\n\n\nOverall this feels like a win for both sides but time will tell if it stays true to what made Astro appealing in the first place.",

I think that coding is not literally for me. I'm burnt out from this job, I'm burnt out from this career itself, there is no joy here tbh. I almost feel like I'm a machine who needs to go at some place from mon-fri do this and that and then spend my weekends in anxiety that omg wtf am I doing with my life.\n\n\nI'm a very creative guy, I've tried music, singing, writing in the past. Also, I'm thinking to be a technical writer because I just love writing, bit coding is really hard for me I feel like an imposter and I don't want to do a job which is as fucked as me not feeling a passion to do what I'm doing.\n\n\nIt would be a great help if there are people who can guide me the jobs in tech or outside of it that actually involves very less/no coding at all and is pretty a good one to invest in.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so so much everyone, for your genuine responses, I'm really getting clarity and you know what I think my role should look like it should be where I'm the lead, where I'm the visionary leader, where I divide tasks, manage teams, I think I'd love something like this.

I got laid off 7 months ago and have only had 3 interviews, making it to final two twice but not getting the job. \n\nI have also felt like a complete imposter the entire time, barely staying afloat. I’ve been laid off from every dev job I’ve had so not only is the imposter syndrome stressful but I feel like there is no job security and the future looks much more bleak.\n\nI’m turning 40 years old this year and have been feeling totally lost. I started my dev career when I was 30, after skipping college and hopping around between low wage entry level office jobs, with all signs pointing to this career in web development being in demand and super stable well into the future. \n\nMy 25 year old friend manages a coffee shop in my neighborhood so my fallback has been to start a new career as a barista at 40 years old. Woof.\n\nHowever my luck has changed somewhat recently. Luckily my wife is a very talented senior shoe designer that is beloved by everyone at her company. The VP for the costing department has been struggling to fill a position for a Senior Costing Analyst and is willing to train the right person. After researching the role I discovered plenty of skills that translate from dev to this role and it sounds pretty interesting to me. I generalized my resume to cater to the position and had a chat with the VP and it’s looking pretty promising and pays well. I’m having to learn excel which is a simple breeze compared to programming. \n\nSo my advice would be take advantage of any networking you can and do some research into open positions that sound like something you could generally be interested in. There are so many jobs out there that I had no clue even existed. After learning programming I feel like learning anything else is possible and probably a lot easier. You just gotta find someone willing to take a chance on you.\n\nGood luck!",

I can do this with ai in a few minutes...\" ... Yeah, this is quite a lot that almost every frontend dev has to deal with these days.\n\nPersonally I'm trying to keep design and dev in balance because creativity is something you can't just toggle on/off or force. So when ever I feel drained, I'm diving more into dev, once I'm tied of dev and feeling creative again, I'm jumping back into design. A benefit of doing my own thing and working only with clients I want to work with. \n\nIf you're in a corporate world, try agency. Simply because being a dev/designer in a company and doing things only for basically one client can be super exhausting. In am agency, you have multiple clients but also tighter deadlines and might have to deal with people who don't have the suggest clue about your work... Can be draining as well\n\n\nWhat you can try is focusing on something specific. Like building pages for a specific CMS. \nI've used to create/develop things for Joomla, WordPress, dipped my toes into TYPO3 but then switched entirely to HubSpot around 8 years ago. \nBest decision ever to be honest",

I looked at pages that had designs I liked, tried redesigning them with my own touch and thinking about how I'd slice then into assets for a table structure. Back then it wasn't that hard, as there was no such thing as responsiveness, fancy css or fancy js stuff. Even something like jQuery wasn't a thing at first. Every websites was basically just a big static table tag.\n\nAnd at it's core this approach hasn't changed. \nTables got replaced by divs or semantic tags. Css frameworks like bootstrap and tailwind became a thing to provide predefined and reusable css classes so you don't need to write everything from scratch every time. \nBut in the end, it's still the same. It just got fancier and easier to start & repeat. \n\nmy recommendation would be to start with the basics like HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. You don't need to master each of these languages, but a good foundation is very helpful. Also look into three atomic design principles by Brad Frost. This should boost your coding approach immensely. \n\nThe very first job i got was a freelance job in a marketing-like agency where I did basically everything. Designing stuff for internal purposes, building and maintaining the website of a sub company of the agency... At some point I landed a freelance job in a design agency and got hired by one of it's clients as a developer a few months later.",

It may even be code, but in a different way, like running a consultancy or maybe something like digital art or even more out in left field.\n\nBut find the field that makes it feel like work isn't work. For me, working in web development was that thing, but no one career is for everyone.",

It wasn't for you.\n\nSome people fairly pointed out design - good designers with dev background are gems and can single-handedly carry below average teams through projects. With that said, I'm not convinced this changes a ton. It's for sure better than web dev, but you're still more or less facing the same sentiment of being a commodity.\n\nIt just depends on how that sits with you. When you say \"creative, music, singing\" it makes me think you're not a person that should be working on commodities... at the same time, you then mention technical writing, which is kind of the opposite. Bit conflicted on what to advise here, lmao. But FWIW, technical writing is cool. My journey went \"studying > nope, not being a dev > writing gig > project manager > product manager\". Still write a lot so I can relate to not wanting to be a dev and wanting to write. It *might* be worth a shot but I'm not sure technical writing is a good fit for someone that appears to be very creative.",

So many older coders just don’t know how to use AI or get the most out of it. But you have high school students building million dollars applications weekly that would take the top engineers at Google years to develop just a year ago. Claude is just better. Sorry. If you have a powerful AI workflow and know what you’re doing, there is actually nothing that humans are better at in every field, not just engineering. If this wasn’t true, i wouldn’t have been able to build a billion dollar business in sub 2 years with a team of 4. Every VC in the U.S. is begging to get in our Series A round next month. Why if AI is just hype? 4 people. Imagine. So the only valuable convos moving forward, for me at least, are convos with other engineers about their AI workflow and stack. Asking a question about coding is borderline embarrassing and actually would be grounds for not getting hired and fired at my company. It’s actually part of our interview process. We are specifically testing for how proficient programmers are with AI and rapidly weeding out anyone that is still that narcissistic and egoistical that they think they’re better than AI. I kid you not. It’s in our interview process as a trick question. It reveals everything if you agree with the comment above and yeah, pro tip, you’ll struggle to get hired anywhere if you don’t fully embrace AI. Queue the downvotes but I’m legit trying to help. People need to adapt. AI is not replacing you. It’s just displacing you. We are hiring dozens of coders right now but only those with an AI-first mindset.",

I'd push people towards answering with high quality answers, and would reward those that provide canonical and combined sources for questions - have them merge instead of close, but with two threads and a canonical \"right\" answer if they both apply.\n\nFrom there I'd redo all the cool shit they used to be known for, real community shit with an updated feel, like:\n\n* A yearly tech conference, with cheap tickets, solid speakers, and dates around the world.\n\n* Lean into chat again, creating logs that can be cross-referenced. Maybe embed it into Discord, but with full logs that are then referenced via the site?\n\n* Bring back the job board, but lower the costs and make it cheap for start-ups to post jobs. Maybe acquire LeetCode or build a competitor that people can use for hiring? I'd also lean into Pramp-esque video chat and videos to allow people to run mock interviews, learn about complex topics, etc.\n\n* Open the platform to universities.

The main reason is that modern vanilla JavaScript has caught up to what jQuery made easy.

Some WordPress themes and plugins still rely heavily on it. For new projects though most teams have moved to modern frameworks or just vanilla JS. The browser APIs are so much better now that the abstraction jQuery provided isnt as necessary.\n\n\n\nIf youre learning web dev I wouldnt prioritize jQuery. Focus on understanding vanilla JavaScript first and then pick up a modern framework like React or Vue. Youll pick up jQuery quickly if you ever need it since its just a simpler API wrapper around the DOM.",

No developer I've worked with ever knew nor questionied how the magic of some frameworks works - like Vue's proxy or Laravels automatic dependency injection. And no employer ever cared that I know how to develop these things myself. \n\nIn a past job we had very strict bandwidth limitations. I'm talking about limits like 100 KBs of initial load including all assets, so in practise we had like 10 KB left for our code. Common libraries would've taken a lot of that already. I've developed our own little \"jQuery\", our own animation library, and our own basic \"Vue\" specifically for our usecases. Devs, especially juniors, didn't need to figure out these things repeatedly themselves anymore and could spend more time actually coding for the project rather than google how to write an animate function in JavaScript.\n\nWhen I left that job, the only thing that interviewers asked was how much experience I have working in their 0815 stack specifically. It was always easy to show them my knowledge and experience right then and there, but coding the same thing 255 times each month, the same kind of API endpoint, the same kind of UI element, became depressing pretty quickly. From what I've gathered, creativity and deeper-than-surface-level knowledge is rarely asked for. Reasonable - why pay for skill that you don't need in your company?\n\nYour overengineered web app beats every single (frontend) web developer I've ever met by multiple magnitudes already. But that level of skill and knowledge isn't even remotely needed in most companies.",

Deep knowledge of the browser just *amplifies* what I can do with them. I've tried and worked with a lot of frameworks throughout my career. This particular project is built with Svelte plus a few pragmatic hacks -- for example, it shows a boot log immediately and only switches to the desktop once everything is ready. It hides latency without an ugly preloader. And this part is obviously not framework-based.\n\nAnd yeah, I'll be honest: the HR side of things is pretty depressing. Repeating how many years I've used React to people who can only process yes/no answers is draining, especially when that experience barely reflects what I actually know or enjoy doing.\n\nThanks for the compliment -- I really appreciate it.

      "text": "I’ve been coding and steadily improving my skills since around 2014, and I don’t know… lately I’m just tired, I think about starting a new project or creating something cool, but it's so hard to stay motivated after creating a few solo projects in the past 2 years and not being able to get a single client or anyone at all who appreciates, and finds useful what I've created.\n\n\n\nEverything feels insanely saturated. Every niche has 50 clones, every “simple app idea” already exists, and the vibe around building stuff has gotten so weird. Now there’s “vibe coding,” where people who never really bothered learning a language are pumping out half-baked apps because they saw a tiktok about “making money with A.I\", on top of that, there are whole courses being sold on how to “create apps and get rich” without knowing how to code. It’s like a big circus.\n\n\n\nI’m not even mad at people for trying to improve their situation, but it’s hard not to feel depressed when you’ve put years into learning the craft and the whole market feels like it’s getting noisier and more shallow at the same time. Not to mention the people rooting against you, and saying that you'll be replaced, that you should watch out for A.I so you don't end up homeless... The same motherfuckers who used to go around saying that I.T is the profession of the future and that's where the money is.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else hit this wall? If you got past it, what helped? Changing what you build, changing where you work, taking a break, anything?",

Very little I'm doing today couldn't be done with technology made a decade ago, with the added bonus of much more stability. It's not that I don't use AI, I do in some capacity, but it's but like hanging out with a bunch of friends who are obsessed with a TV show you have no interest in. I'm just really tired of hearing about it.\n\nI'm trying to lean into that. Leave the technical decisions to the young guns, they can pick whatever crap they collectively agree on, if they are uninterested in my default sensible / boring suggestions. Instead I focus on requirements, and what will best help the user. I think that kind of makes me a technical ba? Whatever.\n\nI also no longer code outside of work that much, though I admit AI is helping there. I would much rather hang out with my partner, watch movies, play videogames, learn piano, go outside.",

              "text": "Very similar in POV and time.\n\nI have opinions. I have things I don't really want to work in. But most times that really hasn't mattered. Either the client or the company I work for has dictated it. And I don't really see a reason to use some of the short list of big players that have established themselves.\n\nI've never really coded outside of work. I like coding but similar to your I like solving problems. And I've never had a problem so unique and important that making something myself was the only solution.\n\nAs far as AI - my company has been mandating it. Started out as using the AI Assistant in JetBrains. Which was pretty good. Great for rubber ducking. Debugging vague problems. Filling in some gaps that I have.\n\nWe have now moved on to more agentic coding per leadership. Claude Code is now part of my every day life.\n\nI hate to say it but it has put a little spark back in me. It's something new. Something shiny. Something that can be scripted and customized. I've always loved automation. Removing tedium. Not some new framework or language that's mostly the same thing as the last one.\n\nThere is a feature our product needs. It's not high priority or particularly complicated. It would just take time. But I have a solution in mind. A solution that I probably wouldn't get to do normally because of the time investment. But I really want to tackle it because I know I can architect it and Claude will spit it out in 10 minutes 80% of the way there and how I would have done it.\n\nI learned that you can a great deal of functionality with MCP servers. Found there are already several that can tie into our ticketing system's API. I could put in a slash command and I could pick a ticket, make a new branch, and pull in context.\n\nIt reminds me of when a company I worked for had priced themselves out of WordPress work but weren't pulling in the numbers form the bigger clients. So they decide to invest in a couple robust, developer friendly WordPress builders. I was offended. I know it's just WordPress but I still took pride in the way I did it.\n\nWhat I found out is that it removed a lot of the boring stuff. It allowed me to focus on the handful of important features. Turns out I didn't actually like fussing about making template files and admin forms. I liked solving problems.",

AWS certs, obviously. A+ cert as practice then Sec+ based on what was available locally. 100+ resumes (at that time) later with no responses, I'm 100 pages into the A+ book and I just think \"is this what you're supposed to do with your life?\"\n\nIt didn't help that the propaganda for vibe coding had hit a fever pitch while the deleterious effects hadn't yet become apparent. So I was feeling concerned at that point that vibe coders could actually replace real coders (though my experiences with the two dunces in my office who were doing it should have clued me in).\n\nSo I walked away - Sec+ book still in its wrapper. Sorry if you wanted a motivational story about getting back into this specific field, OP.\n\nI've still got my side gig, it's covering the bills. I have summers off, so I spent half of last summer converting my garage into a shop, doing woodworking, charcuterie/cutting boards. Hopefully moving into furniture this summer.\n\nI'm still coding, though. Working on a Unity game, aiming to have it in Early Access by summer. I have a couple niche website ideas I keep telling myself I'm going to put together and try to monetize.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I'm changing what I build, *and* taking a break from for working for someone else.",

A job for me without creativity/some flexibility will always leave me feeling stale and well redundant. \n\nI understand easier said than done for some people.

Websites will still request geo permissions on load, the only thing this dumb button does is allow the website to request geo permissions after the browsers has blocked it after asking too many times and the user saying \"no\" every time. It's a recourse after getting blocked from being abusive with your spam. One that can easily get abused, too. If this ain't a dark pattern tool, I hope someone can explain it to me.\n\nEdit: I hope I'm misunderstanding the meeting notes, because it's either that or this people have lost their fucking minds.\n\n> If we wanted developers to migrate en masse, we could do all sorts of things to existing APIs to make them less valuable.\n> Example: could give you location only within a state with API vs. button. With camera, you only get lower resolution. Sticks are easy.\n\nAnd apparently removing prompts was considered before some pushback? WTF are they smoking?",

Previously, if you denied the browser prompt, I had no way to ask you again because the browser won't show the prompt.\n\nSites get around this by first showing you a fake prompt then only showing you the real one if you hit allow. This allows them to spam their own prompt until you allow. I think the browsers are making a mistake in not allowing sites to re-request because bad actors just use this loophole to spam you anyway while good ones that show the real prompt are stuck if you hit deny then change your mind. This new element is partly an attempt to solve that problem but it's a problem of their own making.\n\nGood devs already don't show the prompt until the user clicks a relevant button so I'm not sure what problem this solves. Especially as I suspect good devs will continue to use the old API as it allows their choice of styling and text (e.g. showing a rangefinder icon instead of \"Get location\" text that could differ from browser to browser). It was very interesting to look at the case studies because the designs shown are easily replicable with current API and good sites use these patterns already.\n\nIt might have been better if this new element was the way the API had worked from the beginning but that ship has sailed. This feels like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Unless they plan on deprecating the old imperative API but that seems extremely unlikely.",

Even on Chrome the button is not in any way obvious that it would be used to enable location (assuming the user even understands that they need to do that). It is just a generic settings icon.\n\nThat being said I do think it's slightly silly that they prevent sites from requesting permission after denial 3 times (presumably to prevent them spamming the user) but now there's nothing to stop a site effectively achieving the same result by spamming a dialog with this button in it. Might as well have allowed to re-request permission for all the difference it makes, which would indeed make this element unnecessary.",

Now teams can work more independently, performance improves a bit because teams optimise it. \n\nThen someone decides they need a separate scaling service to deal with performance. It’s hitting the DB too hard, it needs parallel processing, GPUs, whatever. It makes sense to split it off. \n\nRepeat this until we have a microservices architecture. \n\nThen the honeymoon phase ends and we need to refactor code and alter data schemas. It takes forever. It’s difficult. Maintenance is hard across different languages, frameworks and design patterns. Debugging call stacks across network protocols sucks. It’s expensive.\n\nHalf the team who worked on the original services have left. The other half aren’t touching the services nearly as much as when they built them. \n\nNew features are being built in a single service as much as possible so they don’t need to negotiate with another team or refactor yet another system. Or even for performance reasons, they don’t want an n + 1 problem when they could just do a DB join. \n\nPeople start leaning more into monoliths again. But this time we do it properly. We’ll use a faster language, we can spawn threads to handle parallel CPU-intensive processes and scale horizontally. More and more gets merged in.\n\nThen this becomes difficult because some processes are hogging CPU time and some are thrashing disk, some are destroying DB performance and the sharding mechanism isn’t working too well because now we’re relying on eventual consistency and need to factor that in to every single new feature we make. \n\nSo we start to break it into smaller systems again. \n\nIt goes in cycles because:\n1. Priorities change over time. \n2. Technologies evolve. New languages, tooling, better hardware. \n3. Some companies have thousands of employees. Some have a handful. They come and go and have different goals and opinions. \n4. The world was sold on cloud, zero downtime, infinite scalability and microservices. Because the big dogs need it and do it. 90% of the world really doesn’t need to but were sold it and regretted it. Now we’re being sold on simplicity of just hosting a VPS. But it’s not going to be the solution for everyone.",

Then orgs scaled, teams needed autonomy, and microservices became an HR strategy as much as a tech one. Serverless popped because ops pain was high. Then the bill + debugging pain hit. Now we’re back to “modular monolith” because most teams just need coherent boundaries + one deployable.  \n  \nMy current rule of thumb:  \n  \n\\- **Monolith until you have a proven scaling/team boundary problem.**  \n\\- Optimize for **debuggability and delivery speed**.  \n\\- Microservices are fine when you have strong platform tooling and real ownership.  \n  \nWhat’s interesting is how tools are collapsing the stack again. Stuff like **Manus web builder** basically lets a solo dev describe an app in plain English and get a working full-stack system with **auth, database, backend**, and even **analytics/notifications**. That’s “monolith thinking” by default.  \n  \nBut the key is it also supports **code export**, so if you later need to split services or move to your own architecture, you’re not trapped in the initial abstraction.  \n  \nSo yeah, endless circle… but maybe the lesson is: build the simplest thing that won’t punish Future You.",

People are going from old legacy monoliths, to microservices, but once back to mostly monoliths, people are not going back to microservices.\n\nWhat most \"back to reality\" people are doing is taking the empty promises of microservices and making them real. \n\nKeeping things like container systems like docker so that postgres is way tidier. \n\nBut, often having only a few monoliths which work together to make a whole. Each monolith is internally much more modular. \n\nBut, crap like Kafka is going out the window, in that the services which once consumed kafka, are now all bundled together, and just do things internally; at speeds 1000x faster than any kafka type crap.\n\nOne other thing which old monoliths often already did was be a collection of C++ (or whatever), some scripts, and maybe a few other languages.\n\nNow, with containers, it is so much easier to really use whatever the hell language you want. Some part of the monolith which isn't too demanding might now be a pile of python scripts. \n\nBut, sometimes there are places where rapidly developed and poorly tested logic still needs to run. So, people run a V8 engine in C++ which allows for a bunch of js scripts to do this. Or maybe a wasm running module. \n\nBut, by keeping monolith in mind, people are realizing they can draw the architecture on a napkin instead of a windowless room of whiteboards. Also, keep it on even a single server with other redundant servers, where the \"cloud\" system was running into the 10k+ per month in hosting charges.\n\nAnother cloud thing which many sensible people went back to is just boring hosted servers. Cheap, easy to provision, do require more skills than an online cert course gives, but something simple.",

Then some companies realized that having dozens of people working on the same monolith (forcing all your teams to use the same language, the same tech stack, and be in sync to push interdependent changes) was hard, and that they could leverage http APIs to have each team work on a different piece that could be versioned independently and use their own tech stack.\n\nThen hobbyist and students saw that Google was doing micro services and started doing that on projects that never needed them in the first place since they were developed by a single team. Some of these people went on to create startup or work at agencies thinking that micro service was the only way to do web development.\n\nThen these people realized the added complexity and overhead was not worth it and they started using monolith (for the first time), and now we end up in a state where structures that need micro services use them, and those that don't just use the most straightforward approach.",

          "text": "I know I'm like a broken record in this sub, but I think it's because it's difficult with a large web framework when you have a hydration step. You can deliver a page instantly via SSR but when you need to download and parse megabytes of HTML/JS to then re-hydrate the state, you've got a great TTFB but your TTI (Time to Interactive) is terrible.\n\nThere's obviously other things as well like optimisation of images and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) which sadly aren't the default and path of least resistance. This means that a developer needs to understand and care about optimisation to first deliver something and THEN optimise it as a secondary step.\n\nQwik is a different react-based framework that makes the correct/optimal way the path of least resistance and this optimisation is part of the first step, not as a secondary measure. There is no hydration step, you resume what was already delivered via SSR and it makes it simple to maintain those 100 scores. You don't have to download AND parse megabytes of JS before the page is interactive, it's interactive after 1kb of JS: [https://qwik.dev/](https://qwik.dev/)\n\nYeah you can say a lot of large websites don't have great lighthouse scores and are hugely successful: amazon, facebook, blah blah, but they don't need to worry about SEO because they have a HUGE amount of backlinks and SEO Juice already flowing to them. When you don't have that, the smaller things make more of a difference. It's obviously not THAT big of a deal in the grand scheme of things when the effort is high to achieve 100, but if you can just use a resumable framework like Qwik, then you don't need to worry about it anymore. Also, it's basically just react, it's not that hard.",

If we optimized purely for those metrics, we’d all ship plain HTML with a couple headings — but that’s not how most real products work.\n\nCore Web Vitals still matter (they’re good UX signals and can be a ranking factor), but they’re usually not the #1 driver.

          "text": "It's irrelevant to ranking after you are past about the 80-90% range. SEO is about 3 main things: content/keyword relevance, back links, and page load speed. (This is assuming your site is being properly crawled and indexed which is the bare minimum to even show up in Google.) Everything else is minor. As stated by Google for years, content is king. It's the most relevant thing. Without valuable content, no one gives a shit about your site. Next is load speed, does your page load quickly enough that you don't have a high bounce rate so that users actually consume your content? (And somewhat related time on page, do people leave after 5-10 seconds? AKA they probably aren't consuming your content in any meaningful way.) And then third is are others linking to your content or are other external sites driving traffic to your content? This helps solidify the signals that your content is worthwhile.\n\nImproving these 3 things has the greatest improvement for search results. Anything else is nice but doesn't always guarantee results. Wasting time optimizing for a few lighthouse points costs the client money for a low ROI, if any ROI instead. Focus on the basic technical SEO stuff if there are issues (reduce page load, blocking scripts, meta tags, alt tags on images, links crawlable and indexable, etc.), then once you get to a decent point, shift focus on the initial 3 points I mentioned. \n\nEven google.com only has a 36 for performance in lighthouse, 87 in accessibility, 96 in best practice, and 54 in SEO. So clearly those rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. Your KPIs shouldn't be based on lighthouse scores. Your site loading 100ms faster doesn't mean jack if it doesn't improve revenue.",

Instead of chasing a perfect score, they invest their time and effort into improvements carrying more tangible business value, for example, UX, conversions, or new features. Going from 90 to 100 usually requires disproportionate sacrifices. Sometimes, gaining those last few points means one has no choice but to take away vital tools like analytics or heavy delays in their loading that might limit certain sets of visibility and decision-making. At this point, the optimization starts to hurt more than it helps. So, rather than optimizing for perfection, many teams aim for good enough performance that balances speed, functionality, and insight.",

The honest answer is that a perfect 100 PageSpeed score and actual SEO performance aren't as directly correlated as you'd think.\n\nMost high-converting, well-ranking sites sacrifice some PageSpeed points for tracking scripts, A/B testing tools, chat widgets, and third-party integrations that drive actual business results. A site scoring 85 with proper analytics and conversion tools often outperforms a stripped-down 100-score site.\n\nGoogle's ranking algorithm is more nuanced than just speed scores. Core Web Vitals matter, but they're one of hundreds of ranking factors. A site with great content, strong backlinks, and good user engagement will outrank a faster but less useful site every time. Google cares more about the actual user experience than the lab score.\n\nGoogle's ranking algorithm is more nuanced than just speed scores.

      "text": "I’m a junior software engineer and i was always against vibe coding. For the past two years, I never turned on GitHub Copilot or copied code without understanding it or double checking with the documentation and reddit/stackoverflow for best practices. I didn’t trust AI because it often gave outdated answers. Even when the code worked, it wasn’t always the best approach with the latest versions. Most tools didn’t even recognize that Next.js 15 had been released until very recently.\n\nI recently joined a startup. Our team mostly consists of junior engineers, with only two senior engineers. At my previous company, strict rules prohibited the use of AI, and code reviews were tough. Here, it’s the opposite...everyone uses AI. The office actually requires it, and everyone gets the Pro version. PRs are reviewed by ONLY AI and they have built 2 big systems and maintaining it without much downtime. Most of them have no idea how they have built the module assigned to them its a mess yet works somehow. \n\nI usually work with the latest versions of technologies, so I read the documents. When I joined, I noticed many issues...older versions being used, outdated patterns, and methods that were no longer ideal. Even a recent project that started with AI didn’t use new features like the React Compiler or the latest setup. It relied on older Next.js 15-style configurations.\n\nSo, I decided to test this out by fully building a web app using AI. Ngl it was great and everything worked (yes after too many iterations). But then I started seeing problems. It didn’t use any proper packages—no ORM, no React Query. I had already installed date-fns, yet it wrote custom date-formatting functions instead of using the library. That’s when a bigger question struck [me.AI](http://me.AI) models learn from existing data. It takes time  a year or more for them to fully understad new versions and best practices. Most vibe coders don’t really understand the framework, don’t know the best practices, and don’t recognize which packages are actually needed for the job.\n\nIf this keeps going, I honestly don’t know what happens to web development or people like me. I came into this field with real passion..I wanted to solve complex problems and build complex sytems...but now I just feel fed up. At work I see people finishing tasks 10x faster because they let AI do everything while doomscrolling, while I’m sitting there actually thinking, learning, and trying to follow best practices, and it makes me feel like I’m the stupid one holding onto the old way. I’m scared that this mindset will get me laid off.I hate looking at code I don’t understand, not knowing why it’s written that way or whether it’s even correct. Any advice would really help. I’m honestly confused and trying to figure this out.",

As a senior dev, I’m facing similar issues.\n\nI don’t use LLMs as much, for many of the same reasons you describe - pulling code for different versions of a framework at once, misusing libraries or writing overlapping functions, ignoring standards, etc.\n\nLike you, I am often uncomfortable with using code I don’t have at least some level of understanding of how it works, the context around it and the choices that went into it. I know with this kind of LLM usage, there _are_ no decisions going into it, because that’s not how it works.\n\nI’m the type who, when given a new codebase, insists on learning it from top to bottom as much as possible, and trying to get the context of the decisions that guided it.\n\nFrankly, I’m never going to apologize for being that way. I chose this career in part because I love taking an engineering approach to building great end products and solving problems robustly.\n\nI think you’re very similar.\n\nIMO, that’s a good thing, not something to be beaten out of us. We’re the ones that will be still moving software forward, and creating the data that LLMs need to remain useful.\n\nThe problem isn’t you, or your mindset. The problem is that the dev world is full right now of managers desperate to commoditize dev work and grow profits, combined with a field filled with devs who generally lack this kind of systems thinking and engineering mindset and are frankly just basking in their moment where they suddenly feel able to contribute more broadly than they could have before.\n\nAnd those are the people who have convinced themselves and each other they no longer need people like you or me.\n\nBut that won’t last. LLM coding and agents will be tools in the toolbox from now on, of course, but the insistence that the engineering mindsets are no longer needed won’t last.\n\nSo, my advice? Do what you have to to keep the job, but also keep learning and diving deep as much as possible. Don’t let that part of you die, because it WILL be necessary sooner than you think.",

Also workflow (plan, implement, simplify, security-check) and context management are extremely important for the end-result. Also these tools sometimes get stuck on fairly simple things or extremely over-engineer everything so vibe coding remains the joke it is, it is not comparable with the results of an experienced software engineer and in my opinion there is no shortcut to these experience. It is more like when you started learning programming and write a small script and thought \"now I can do just everything\", the more you learn the more you know that you don't know shit in many areas.\n\nCode-review using only AI is incredibly dumb, if you have a CI stage that catches obvious mistakes early: Great!

And altough I'm very excited on these tools I starting to hate see these vastly overestimated numbers which bring business people to expect that overall productivity improvement from their teams, there are several posts on reddit about this issue. So please do us all a favor and do not take part in the hype, if you really measured that: Great! But I doubt it. Also people have the tendency to sell oneself the new workflow (\"it is new so it must be much more productive). And to emphasize, yes, it is great, but it is nowhere near 10x to 20x overall.\n\nIf you use LLMs it is extremely important what you prompt, working on a good spec can take it's time. It is more like programming the LLM to spit out the right code and not just some code: You do not write this yourself anymore but you have to think of many edgecases beforehand to get a good result that than can be tweaked to a result that is acceptable.\n\nOh and if they doom scroll they don't do multiple tasks in concurrency, this is where the fun begins and you can still fry your head easily with this.",

Most vibe coders don’t really understand the framework, don’t know the best practices, and don’t recognize which packages are actually needed for the job.\n\nOn the other hand, frameworks were created to make developers job easier and their code more maintainable. If you give up on writing code yourself and let AI rewrite everything from the requirements everytime, it doesn't need a framework, libraries or an ORM. It can just hard code everything. It will be an unreadable mess without any consistency, but if no human ever reads it who cares ?\n\nIf you hate this and you don't want this to be your job, maybe look for work in a more mature company. Startups need to deliver a MVP fast so it makes sense for them to leverage AI and not care about code quality, more established companies that have had their solution in production for years tend to be more prudent with AI and expect their developers to actually be accountable for the code they push.",

LLMs are not all knowing oracles and shouldnt be treated as such they are powerful tools but they are just that, tools.

(context7, fetch, deepwiki, grep, gitmcp, etc.)\n- setup system prompts and markdown docs for the llm to reference instead of it interpreting your colleague's prompts differently every time. In these you can also explicitly tell the AI to always find the most relevant documentation using the MCPs it has access to.\n- setup more markdown docs, this time to give the AI examples of what the code style should look like. Write an example of how you would add a new feature by hand. Tell it what design patterns you prefer.\n- setup skills and commands that act as \"prompt templates\" (or functions if you will) that everyone should use instead of just prompting away. This will reduce the randomness of the results a bit.\n- make sure your Jira tickets, user stories, epics, etc are well written and clear, with user acceptance tests too.\n- UML is making a \"comeback\" with these tools. Making a few architecture diagrams before starting the slop goes a long way. The more you prepare, the less shitty or random it can get. A database diagram is super useful even without AI tools. Create flow diagrams and activity diagrams. If you work in an OOP setting, making a domain model in UML is even better. You can even go down to class diagram and sequence diagram level to add more guard rails to make sure the AI doesn't hallucinate. If you use plantUML or mermaid to create your diagrams then the AI can read the source markup instead of just analyzing the picture, enhancing the accuracy of the results. \n- Make everyone do TDD. If the tests don't pass, can't commit or open a PR. \n- setup traditional code quality workflows and pipelines. Use tools like sonarqube, codacy, liners, strict type checking, combined with a pre-commit hook that prevents pushing if it doesn't pass.\n- last but not least, try to standardise how the AI is used. To get more consistent results and less vibe-slop, everyone should use AI in the same way. You don't want someone to just ask the AI to \"fix it\" or make it better\". You should have prompt templates for most of the development tasks like adding a new feature, refactoring, analysis, debugging, documenting, testing, etc.\n\n*Tldr : garbage in = garbage out.*\nTry to make sure the garbage going is at least well defined and passes the sniff test.",

What is still valuable and will be for a long time is being able to read code line by line, digesting and understanding it. This is more valuable than ever because AI tools aren't intelligent - they unknowingly build bugs and bad practices into software because their goal is to make the software work today, they don't think long term about maintainability or developer experience. \n\nUnfortunately you only really get good at dissecting code via writing code - it's the only way to imo because writing code relies on you having to think, read, and do - all at the same time. It's this that will create the necessary pathways in the brain that are required to be able to read code effectively. \n\nI'm fortunate to have come up in the web dev scene before AI. I'm almost two decades in. I use AI tools as if they're my rubber duck (look it up). \n\nI've dabbled in pure vibe coding, AI assisted coding, and AI in plan only mode. They all save me time but cost me dearly in knowledge - it's use it or lose it scenario in terms of experience. \n\nCurrently I'm using AI on my phone instead of in my IDE. I use it in voice/ conversation mode - I'm finding this is the sweet spot. I speak my thoughts openly and Gemini responds with advice and suggests concepts to help me tackle the problem. I'm still having to think, write, and do. \n\nMy advice to you is you need to eat. If your current job says you need to use AI, then use it. But when you do side projects outside of work, don't use AI at all. Hand write everything. This, over time, will put you ahead of AI only devs but will keep you on par when it comes to using AI to code. \n\nOvertime, the benefit will be that you will be able to code review the AI manually before it goes up the pipeline - meaning you'll be a better AI coder, because you can actually code.",

Usually 2 of us did the homework checking and we each had \\~2 hours allocated for it per week. We only spent more time on someone if they were really promising, which was about 30-40 applicants.\n\nA portfolio like this is really cool and I imagine it was a fun project, but unless your homework code was top-notch this would've meant very little and we might've spent about 30 seconds clicking around before jumping to the next person.\n\n(I think this probably sounds pretty cruel when you are trying to find a job, getting rejected in a couple of minutes, but from our perspective being a small team + senior developer time being pretty expensive it was just not viable to spend hours every week for very little return. To save myself a bit it was policy to always write a couple of helpful pointers to justify the rejection as ghosting a candidate without explanation is just wrong. No AI slop either, these were actual hand-written notes.)",

      "text": "I want to share an honest experience here so you guys can avoid this and do proper research about companies beforehand. This is my and others combined experience regarding this organisation.\n\nThe company is run by a single person with around 12-15 employees. Its a startup so not a lot of expectations but some things are straight out bizzare.\n\n\n\nWork Culture context:\n\n* Monday to Saturday working\n* 10 to 7:30 (almost everyday stretching upto 8:00 - 8:30 minimum)\n* Saturday (10 to 4:00) stretching upto 4:30 - 5:00 sometimes\n* Its a 2 BHK room as a workplace\n* No seperate washrooms for boys and girls\n* No mirror in washroom etc.\n\n\n\nWhen you join it seems fine for a few days but after a week or two things get worse for you, for example:\n\n1. Every single day the working hours stretches upto 8 - 8:30 because the owner here likes to review the work we are doing, it feels like he purposely comes out late from his room most often after 7:30 - 7:45 and then reviews work one by one talking to each of the employee, till our time comes he expects us to wait in the office itself until review is done, and also we need to add daily status email and fill in gitlab on top of this unnecessary review.\n\n2. Sometimes work is assigned in second half of the day and that needs to be done the same day making it hard for us to leave on time, even if the client might have sent the email and stuff 2-3 days back the employees here recieve it at the last moment expecting it to be done.\n\n3. There are very less people around 12-15 employees only, and here most of only freshers fresh out of college are being hired, the old employees either leave once they recieve their bonus because of the working conditions or are being fired for wierd reasons. \n\n4. I have also noticed once the new employees the freshers get hired the owner kind of stops speaking softly with the old employees, and finds more problems in the work or anything else as he have someone else now as replacements.\n\n5. The employees here are not supposed to chat or have a laugh in the morning hours, or in afternoon and stuff like that, then the employees recieve emails regarding behaviour and code of conduct saying what is acceptable and what is not.\n\n6. One incident where a guy was fired because he was sick and instead of calling the owner on phone to ask for leave he just put in a email taking sick leave (like in normal companies this is absolutely acceptable), but here the owner fired him because of that reason and then later called everyone in his office to say that you are supposed to call on phone for leaves otherwise strict action will be taken like this and other similar stuff.\n\n7. Also the owner expects you to be on time in the morning, if you are late for 3 days in a month even if you are waiting till late hours then too your 1 day salary will be deducted, even if you have to wait late upto 8 - 8:15 that is not considered.\n\n8. There is grace period for arrival given of 15 - 30 mins so you can come upto 10:30 after that it will be considered as half day. Everytime the rules change sometimes its half day after 2:00 sometimes its at 11:00 and what not, it gets wierd.\n\n9. There are no seperate washrooms for girls and the boys, there is no mirror in the washroom to look into, we need to look up in the showers head reflection to fix ourselves, and definitely its worse for the girls because of that.\n\n10. For developers its much more worse, there is one senior guy (the only senior guy) who writes his entire code using ChatGPT, and later acts like how his work finished in a few hours and why others take so much time, later other developers have to debug that code cause he broke the functionality built by other developers, when asked he will say \"Chotasa hi fix hai, mereko kam hai, khud karo (Its a small fix, I am busy so do it yourself)\". And he is like the owners favourite because he delivers his job fast but causing others to spent more time to fix it for him and no one can't even complain.\n\n\n\nAnd Honestly thats not everything, there is no proper management of anything at all, there are no proper coding standards, no proper documentations to refer, no proper code reviews, no proper testing - if it works and does not break then ship it thats all. The codebase looks like mess, there is so much redundancy and single files having 9k-10k lines of code and functions instead of seperating them.\n\n\n\nThe problem is most of the people working here are freshers, hence they don't say anything about all this stuff. They need to have that job in order to keep family happy. But leaving late everyday, overworking and burnout is real. I have also see that the people joining here mostly abandon the job within the few months or days itself else are stuck because of family issues and 90 days of notice period.\n\n\n\nAlso the issue is the old employees who worked here or were here have not added reviews on platforms like glassdoor or ambition box at all. And I cannot say much here cause there are so less people already in the office so I can only state the most generic stuff here.\n\n\n\nI have read horrible stuff on reddit here regarding jobs, some might say that this is normal in IT companies but I wanted to share this for freshers as the hiring might start sometime later.\n\n\n\nI suggest all of the freshers and people who are searching for a job to first review the company properly no matter what, try to connect with old employees to ask them why they left, or connect with working employee to understand the culture cause in the long term it is going to matter.\n\n\n\nAlso a request to people to leave honest reviews about workplaces so it can help avoid falling into this again.\n\n\n\nCompany Name: **SaffireTech** (Mumbai, India)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis post is based on multiple experiences and observations shared by current and former employees, combined with my own. It is not intended to defame any individual or organization. Others may have had different experiences.",

If talent was finite this situation would never exist.\nAnd to make it further worst India has no proper industry, to employ the number of graduates it produces each year in full capacity, so even chemical engineers are completing there for dev jobs. \n\n\nOn top of that there are many paths — those who actually did go through exams like JEE still have to compete against those who didn't. These second type of degrees will just pick anyone from street, so long as 12 years of prior education is there they will allow them anyway.\n\n\nChina prevents such situations by having one path for one role, and choke it early so by the time people graduate they have enough jobs for at least those that graduate. \n\n\nOfcourse you can't really compare india with China interns of employment. Because China is extremely well managed and has a huge industry, even if working conditions are 996 style.",
