      "text": "I started my automation journey 1 year ago with Make and N8N on Upwork where I made my first $7K online before landing a FTE job in an automation agency.\n\nLet's be honest. Back then it was golden... which is crazy since I am just talking about 2025, but essentially there was high demand, low supply - just knowing that tools like Make or N8N exist made you stand out, at least that was my experience.\n\nBut now with shiny tools like Claude Code, Antigravity and all these other \"build by prompting\" tools, the now \"old school\" visual automation builders are slowly losing the hype it once had. Not to mention a lot of creators in the space are making videos like \"\\[xyz tool\\] just killed N8N\". Even the google searches are reflecting this very fact.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye5wo92zsdgg1.jpg?width=2548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb9a05b4817a84c440327d6211fdaeb9d310e61\n\nAnd honestly, that makes sense when you think about it. N8N's popularity skyrocketed because of AI Agents - it landed in front of an untapped market of non-coders. But the reality is that n8n is not an AI company first, so once more “powerful” AI tools emerged it was just more attractive for non-coders to switch or learn that instead. After all, to use n8n efficiently and unlock its full potential, you have to learn all the technicalities around it - webhooks, APIs, error handling, databases.\n\nSo the decline we are seeing is essentially just a natural market correction. The “attention” that is leaving N8N are people that were never the right automation user anyway. People that jumped on the hype train just because it was hot and automated just for the sake of automation, left and people that stayed are the ones that see the true value of no-code visual automation builders.\n\nIt's not really n8n / zapier / make vs Claude Code / Antigravity. It's just different products for different use cases and markets. I use Claude Code for building nodox.ai but for example my internal notifications run on n8n - I can tweak them in 30 seconds without touching code or redeploying.\n\nAutomation is here to stay and if you are interested in learning n8n - just start. I believe it’s one of the best ways to get into tech if you don’t have a technical background.\n\nAnyway, that's my take. Curious what you guys think.",

It’s hard to answer your question about what n8n can be used for because it can be basically used for anything😂😂 So it’s like, any app. All apps have a purpose. n8n’s purpose is to create workflow automations using a multitude of different apps. For example, say if you want to get an alert every time someone fills out a form you have set up on a channel(website, paid ad, social post) when someone fills out the form, you get an alert to wherever you direct the response to go to. So let’s use Slack in this example. You get the alert in Slack someone filled out the form. You get the details (name, email, …). Now you can end the automation there. That can be done through n8n. But say if you don’t want the automation to stop there. After you get the details from the from you can save those details. So now comes the option to think about where to store the details.🤔 Google Sheets, Airtable, Vector Database.. whatever. You can maybe add something like sending the person back an email or text message or a phone call whatever! After the first step of getting the details from the form you can basically add multiple steps. That would be what they consider the logic of the workflow. Does this help? Because I can go on and on😂😂 Stay tuned boss because it’s about to get out of this world",

My biggest tip is not to \"think in what to automate\", that'll get you stuck. \n\nBegin by analyzing your current workflow: \n\nWhat are several steps you're doing over and over again? \n\nExample:\n\nYou are going to a certain site (Let's take GitHub which is used to host code online) and you navigate often to the code review page of an organization. \n\nYou'll likely bookmark or expect the browser history to do the autocomplete for you. \n\nWell, how about we map that URL with a command called \\`me gh\\`? You'd write something simple (I use Alfred for MacOS) and whenever I write \\`me gh\\` in the spotlight it opens it for me. \n\nIt saves me several seconds every time I do it (Especially since I can launch it wherever I am)\n\nIn case of companies, begin by analyzing their flows. See what they do very often. \n\nDecompose it into steps:\n\n  \nExample:\n\nIf Email from IT comes, then we need to notify everyone that we will need to leave the computer. \n\nWell, first step? Detect the email from IT (What can you do to identify it? Read the subject, or the email)\n\nThen, detect the body of the email (This is where you can use an LLM like ChatGPT), and classify it into whether it needs a notification or not.\n\nAfterwards, you can send the email/message to your team members. \n\nIt takes some practice, and the most powerful phrase:  \n\n\n\"Strive for progress not perfection\"\n\n  \nYou iterate over these workflows over and over again, and you'd be surprised how far you'll get. \n\n  \nThere's also Gall's law (That mentions that complex systems came from simpler ones). So always start small, and iterate!",

That makes n8n automation creators essential for any company. Be ready to seize the first opportunity and always respect each client’s privacy and needs.

Now as for this new AI agent experience through Claude Code, OpenAi Codex, Antigravity… It is definitely a step up for non technical people and also developers alike. I was just telling my buddy. Machines/Computers started out with the command prompt and commands to give instructions to the machine. Then we spent decades trying to make computers user friendly for non technical people. GUI put the personal computer on the map. No code platforms like n8n, Make and Zapier simplified the core concepts at bringing key functionalities of machines to non technical people. Now we have coding assistants and it seems like we have come to the final frontier and basically come full circle. I am a prime example of being AI educated because I learned everything from scratch using artificial intelligence platforms and tools. To be able to follow along and understand what’s actually happening in the backend has blown my mind. I don’t think n8n is dead. Tools like n8n still have a place for now in a developer’s toolbox.

I still don’t understand everything but i understand that data is the life blood of the workflow. So understanding the intended solution lets you know what you want to do with that data. In between the trigger and the last action a lot can happen. So understanding the paths to a solution is the key for me. I don’t let the technical details confuse me anymore. That’s where the coding agents help out. I let them figure all that out😂😂 I just need the details or description of the problem then I let AI get to it!",

Cold emails, Upwork projects, the whole pipeline.\n\nThe #1 lesson that changed everything: **never use the word \"automation\" in your pitch.**\n\nHere's why - I was sending 200 cold emails a week. Response rate? About 1.5%. Most replies were \"not interested\" or \"we're good.\"\n\nThen I reframed everything around **time saved** instead of technology.\n\nBefore:\n\"I'll automate your lead generation with n8n workflows\"\n\nAfter:\n\"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2 hours.\"\n\nSame exact service. Completely different response.\n\nWhat actually worked for me:\n\n1. **Lead scraping + enrichment pipeline** - Google Maps → email enrichment → cold email sequence. What used to take 5 hours manually now runs in 30 min.\n\n2. **Competitor comment mining** - Scraping LinkedIn post comments from competitors → building warm lead lists. These people already care about your space.\n\n3. **Proposal generation** - Template-based proposals that auto-fill client data. 2 hours → 15 minutes.\n\nThe ROI pitch that works: \"For every $1 you spend, you get back $X in saved labor costs per month.\"\n\nBusiness owners don't care about n8n, webhooks, or API integrations. They care about:\n- How many hours they get back\n- How much money they save\n- How fast they see results\n\nTarget businesses doing $3M-10M/year revenue. They have real pain points and actual budget. Stop pitching solopreneurs who do everything themselves.\n\nHappy to share specific workflow details if anyone's interested.",

      "text": "Hey all - figured it was time to actually join the community instead of just Googling my way through problems.  \n  \nI've been using n8n pretty much every day for the past year, both at my day job (AI automations) and for my own SEO side business. Built probably 500+ workflows at this point from super-complex to minute.  \n  \nA few things I wish someone had told me earlier:  \n  \nError handling is everything. My early workflows looked clean until something failed at 2am and I had no idea why. Now I build in fallbacks for basically every HTTP node.  \n  \nBreaking big workflows into smaller reusable pieces made my life way easier.  For example I had a project to make comments for a Google Business Profile comment reply automation that got super intricate early on. I broke it into 3 different flows, and used Supabase to be the workbench where everything came together, which leads me to my next comment....\n\nDATABASES ARE EVERYTHING - It's imperative for anyone who wants to get good at n8n to learn how to create and manipulate databases, even if that means using Claude with an MCP to build and manage the tables quickly and efficiently. \n\nSelf-hosting was worth the hassle. Cloud is fine for simple stuff but once you're running things constantly, having full control is a game changer.\n\nHave fun - build something at the weekend that makes it fun.  This weekend is Moltbot+n8n time.  Giggety. ",

Those are the lessons everyone learns after a few painful 2am failures 😅\n\nBig +1 on:\nFallbacks for every HTTP node, retries + status-based branching saves more workflows than any advanced AI logic.\nSplitting large systems into orchestrator + worker flows. Debugging and scaling becomes way more predictable.\nDatabases being non-optional once you care about state, idempotency, or audit logs. n8n really levels up once you add Postgres/Supabase.\n\nAlso fully agree on self-hosting. Cloud is fine for light use, but once workflows are always-on, webhook-heavy, or cost-sensitive, full control makes a huge difference (timeouts, memory, custom nodes, cron reliability).\nWe see this a lot with teams running self-hosted n8n (since we moved to OpenHosst with their optimized architecture for n8n we haven't faced such issues), the shift usually isn’t about “more features,” it’s about stability and predictability in production.\n\nMoltbot + n8n weekend builds sound like exactly the right kind of chaos 😄\n\nGreat post, this kind of real-world perspective helps the whole community.",

Same with simplifying the agent logic instead of stacking frameworks.\nI’m curious what setups others are using that actually feel fast in production\nSTT, LLM choice, TTS, self-hosted vs cloud, n8n configs, anything that made a noticeable difference.\nNot selling anything, just comparing real-world setups.

The key is in the orchestration: linking a robust STT (Speech-to-Text) like Deepgram, using an LLM (like GPT-4o) for the brain/logic, and then pushing it through a low-latency TTS (Text-to-Speech) like ElevenLabs or Vapi.\n​The real magic happens when you use n8n to handle the 'Function Calling'—allowing the voice agent to actually check a database or book a meeting while still on the call.\n​I've been working on some advanced workflows for this recently.

We have since then moved to a bunch of dedicated tools inside our company for various tasks we used to have N8N do! Here are the ones that ended up working better\n\n* Outbound marketing: We earlier had an N8N automation but now we have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point\n* Meeting notes and action items: Again we tried setting up an automaton using N8N but since then moved to use specific tools like Otter to transcribes everything. It can also create action items, assign owners, update CRM, salesforce etc! You can even connect it to gamma to create after call presentations automatically\n* Blogs: We had an automation using N8N for both SEO and writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are much better since it's able to self improve based on google results now!\n\nThat's all I can think of rn! Curious what other tools others are using :)",

I also use a local LLM on what used to be my game system (but now it’s the AI system with an nvidia chip). I love using n8n for the workflow visibility and ease of use, but I am considering porting the entire system to be all python because I feel like I can trust the python more. Things are less abstracted than with n8n. The gui is nice, but I can also build a web gui using flask to control the automations. I’ve been thinking about converting also because I’d like to turn this into a possible business one day if I can get it all working how it needs to. For something with customers, I don’t fully trust that n8n won’t suddenly break on me after an update. However, the workflows will look really great for my current purpose (in a slide deck)",

      "text": "I've spent the last year building AI agents for B2B sales teams — from 2-person startups to 50+ sales rep organizations. Over 100 agents/automations deployed across the full sales cycle.\n\nSome were game-changers. Some were waste of time. Here's what actually works, broken down by where it sits in the pipeline.\n\nPRE-OUTREACH: Know more than your prospect expects\n\n1. Lead Enrichment Agent\n\n* Pulls LinkedIn profile, latest posts, comments, company news\n* Identifies tech stack, recent hires, funding rounds\n* Builds a lead dossier in 30 seconds that would take an SDR 20 minutes\n\n2. ICP Scoring Agent\n\n* Scores leads against your ideal customer profile automatically\n* Flags high-intent signals (job postings, tech changes, funding)\n* Prioritizes your pipeline so reps work the hottest leads first\n\n3. Personalized Icebreaker Agent\n\n* Reads the lead's last 5 LinkedIn posts + company news\n* Generates 3 hyper-specific openers — not \"I saw your company is growing\" garbage\n* Actually references something the prospect cares about\n\nOUTREACH: Send less, land more\n\n4. Sequence Builder Agent\n\n* Creates multi-touch sequences tailored to persona + industry\n* A/B tests subject lines and CTAs automatically\n* Adjusts tone based on whether it's a CEO, VP, or end user\n\n5. Campaign Reporting Agent\n\n* Daily/weekly automated reports: open rates, reply rates, booked meetings\n* Flags underperforming sequences before you waste a full week\n* Compares performance across segments so you double down on what works\n\nPRE-MEETING: Walk in prepared, not winging it\n\n6. Meeting Prep Agent - 2 hours before every call, delivers a one-pager to the rep:  \n\n* Lead summary (role, company, pain points)\n* Likely objections based on company profile and industry\n* Competitor intel (what else they might be evaluating)\n* Suggested talking points and questions\n* Reps stopped \"doing research\" for 15 min before calls. Now it's done for them.\n\n7. Automated Scheduling Agent\n\n* Handles the back-and-forth of booking meetings\n* Syncs with CRM + calendar\n* Sends confirmations + reminders automatically\n\nPOST-MEETING: Where most teams drop the ball\n\n8. Proposal Generator Agent\n\n* Listens to the meeting transcript (or takes structured notes)\n* Generates a tailored proposal within 30 minutes of the call ending\n* Includes pricing, scope, timeline — pre-filled based on what was discussed\n* Rep reviews, tweaks, sends. Instead of spending 2 hours writing from scratch.\n\n9. CRM Auto-Update Agent (My personal favorite one)\n\n* Updates deal stage, notes, next steps after every interaction\n* No more \"can everyone please update Salesforce\" emails from management\n* Pipeline is always current without reps doing data entry\n\n10. Follow-Up Agent\n\n* Sends personalized follow-ups based on meeting outcome\n* Adjusts timing and content based on engagement signals\n* Escalates stale deals to managers automatically\n\nResults across our implementations:\n\n* Average 2x increase in meetings booked per rep\n* Proposal turnaround: from multiple hours → 20 minutes\n* CRM accuracy: from \\~40% → 95%+ (because humans aren't doing the entry)\n* Reps spend 60%+ more time actually selling instead of admin work\n\nThe pattern:\n\nThe teams that got the biggest results didn't just automate random tasks. They automated the boring stuff that steals selling time — research, data entry, scheduling, reporting — and let their reps focus on the only thing AI can't do yet: building relationships.\n\nHappy to answer questions in the comments.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently self-hosted n8n on my Oracle Cloud free tier VM (1GB RAM) with a custom domain. (Yes I could've got more but had trouble creating VM on Ampere shape and did not worked for me at all...). Anyways built my first automation - a Discord bot that transcribes Instagram Reels using Groq Whisper, saves to Google Sheets, and sends the transcription back to Discord.\n\nBut I'm hitting some walls and would love advice from experienced self-hosters.\n\n**My setup:**\n\n* Oracle Cloud Free Tier (1GB RAM Ubuntu VM)\n* Custom domain with SSL\n* Docker containers (5 total):\n   * n8n (main automation)\n   * PostgreSQL (database)\n   * Redis (queue/cache)\n   * SearXNG (self-hosted search)\n   * Caddy (reverse proxy + SSL)\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. **WhatsApp Integration** \\- I looked into WAHA but it needs 700MB+ RAM (almost my entire server). I tried running it on a separate server but it still takes 850+ MB. How do you handle WhatsApp automations without the official API? (The Business API seems problematic if I want to use my personal number). *Please don't say Telegram...instead tell me your solution (since I wanna make a bot to detect if the number is a scam/fraud and AI replies to him. would be a fun project lol)*\n2. **Discord** \\- I hit the 2000 char message cap - found a workaround by sending in chunks, but curious how others handle this.\n3. **Image Generation** \\- Is there a free image generation API as good as Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)? Google Cloud offers credits but they expire. Looking for something \"always free\" with no trial period.\n4. **LinkedIn** \\- All the nodes seem to need LinkedIn API access which requires a company page or approved app. Any workarounds for personal account automation?\n5. **General advice** \\- What's your go-to stack for self-hosted n8n integrations? Any must-have community nodes for low-resource setups?\n6. **Your Free-Tier Stack** \\- If you're running n8n purely on free tools like 0$ (no trials, no expiring credits), what services do you use? Would love to know your complete stack.\n\n**What I've learned so far:**\n\n* RapidAPI has decent free tiers for Instagram scraping (500 req/month)\n* Groq's free Whisper API works surprisingly well for transcription\n* For AI/LLM stuff: GroqCloud, Gemini API, and Manus API all have solid free tiers.\n* For storage: Google Drive.\n\n**Quick note**: This is just for my personal use — no clients, no business, just automating my own stuff on a shoestring budget.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your workarounds and setups, especially from those running n8n on limited resources. **Feel free to DM me** if you'd rather share privately - happy to exchange notes!\n\n**TL;DR:** Running n8n on a 1GB RAM server and looking for free-tier alternatives for WhatsApp (WAHA too heavy), image generation, and LinkedIn automation — what's your budget-friendly 0$ stack?\n\nThanks.",

I’ve been learning n8n for 2 weeks now, and I built 3 workflows where it collects leads from a webhook (I used fake leads and pinned them), saves them into a Google Sheet, and notifies the owner. Next, using a Google Sheets trigger, an AI analyzes and scores the lead, classifies it as hot, warm, or cold, and updates the same row in the sheet. Then, in the last workflow, it sends the right follow-up based on the lead’s category while also updating the lead’s status. I built this with the guidance of chatgpt, and I’d appreciate any feedback and tips to improve my knowledge and skills so I can eventually earn money from this skill.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vgbxsz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c90afc4f87d176d23a21a0226e793a51f83dc3ae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkwrouz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dd9a6c10856c958f0f2791db44366ec751422aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls8wbuz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=40aa4a4a02bbd0c6ea5a08ddd52bc06568ba0293\n\n  \n",

Start building the habit of naming your nodes to be more descriptive so that it's easier to read - not just for others but also for you. If you do this well then the workflow itself serves as a documentation. For example I don't know what happens in the 'if' nodes, would need to click on it and open it first. Not sure what you were trying to do with the wait nodes but at least add how long it waits.\n2. If you are using AI only for simple tasks like classification, don't use an AI Agent node. In N8N AI Agent nodes have extra prompt wrappers so it would take more tokens for no reason. Use LLM Chain node instead.\n\nOne thing that I preach on the internet is \"Stop watching tutorials. Start building.\" and you are clearly doing that, so big kudos! The next step is keep building real solutions to real problems. I'd recommend going on Upwork, and look for automation job posts, see if you can create a demo based on the job requirements. Once you are consistently able to solve these, don't get stuck building non stop, start earning by applying for these jobs. That's how I got started.",

If so, I'd love pointers, and if not, I'd also love to hear which features would make this a must-have for your workflows\n\n\n\n",

It’s the tool that moves data around (e.g., \"When email comes in -> Send to Slack\"). It’s free to self-host and visual.\n* The Brain (Intelligence): ChatGPT API / Claude. This is what processes the data.\n\n2. How to learn (The Build Method) What NOT to do: Do not watch 40 hours of  theory\" tutorials. You will quit. What TO do: Build a Toy Project that solves a problem *you* actually have.\n\n  \nsome examples\n\n* Level 1: Build a workflow that sends you a Telegram message every morning with the weather. (Teaches you APIs).\n* Level 2: Build a bot that reads your emails and summarizes them. (Teaches you AI).\n* Level 3: Build an autonomous agent.\n\n3. Realistic Timeline\n\n* Week 1-2: You will feel stupid. Nothing will work. (Normal).\n* Month 1: You can build basic bots for yourself.\n* Month 3: You are ready to take on a free client (a friend/family business) to build a portfolio case study.\n* Month 6: Marketable as a freelancer.\n\n4. Visual Inspiration To give you a target to aim for, here is a full breakdown of a Research Agent I built. It runs autonomously, scrapes news, filters it, and reports back. :[https://youtu.be/mOnbK6DuFhc](https://youtu.be/mOnbK6DuFhc)\n\nGood luck, lad.",

After each step, pause the video, and do it on your computer.\n- After that, you will have the basics to do your own projects\n\n2 When you have a question => ask to ai (chatgpt or claude)\n- when you have a bug, DON’T GIVE UP. Just ask ai what is the problem and how to fix it (with a copy of the error message and a screenshot of your n8n workflow to give it context). You must adopt a problem solver mindset because bugs will happen and are normal. Just don’t give up when something does not work, try again until it does.\n\n3  Do your own projects\n- Pick a simple task you often do\n- Then ask ai how to do it with n8n\n- Implement it, and fix the bugs\n- If you don’t have ideas of project, there are tons of videos on youtube showing automation examples => check the ones of Nick Saraev and Nate herk\n- Bonus: If you have the ambition to do it as a freelancer (or for your career) in the future, you can go talk to small business owners, tell them you are learning automation and you would be glad to automate one of their tasks for free. You will learn real business use cases like that and get some testimonials in exchange.

If you struggle with impostor syndrome and don’t feel confident enough to charge, you can do it for free for the first clients. If you fail, you have no pressure.

That last one will bite you hard when stuff breaks in production.\n\nTimeline-wise, you'll probably spend a week or two just getting comfortable with the interface and basic workflows. By month two you'll be building useful stuff and starting to see patterns. Around month 3-6 you'll be ready for more complex work and taking on clients if that's your path.\n\nFor finding clients, start by automating your own stuff first. Document what you build. Share your wins and fails. People hire automators who can show what they've actually built, not what they could theoretically build.",
