That data loop is gold for deciding where to double down on acquisition spend.\n\nRe: the $6k quote - honestly not even that overpriced for an agency that does not have internal n8n expertise. The ongoing maintenance, debugging, and iteration is where the real time sink is. You just shifted that cost to yourself, which only makes sense if you have the bandwidth and interest to maintain it.\n\nAppreciate you sharing the gist.

That's the easy part that everyone obsesses over\n\nThe hard part nobody talks about? Getting inside someone's head and figuring out what irrational buttons to push to make them say yes\n\nNot logic, not ROI, not \"this saves you money\"\n\nIt's psychological tricks, social proof, artificial scarcity, whatever the fuck makes humans do illogical things\n\nAND I FUCKING HATE THAT THIS IS TRUE\n\nI learned APIs and webhooks and error handling\n\nI should've learned why people pay more for things that sound fancy than things that actually work\n\nI should've learned why \"exclusive community\" sells better than \"this solves your problem\"\n\nI should've learned that price = perceived value regardless of actual value\n\nBut nobody fucking talks about this part\n\nEveryone's posting workflows and tutorials like that's the bottleneck\n\nTHE REAL BOTTLENECK\n\nIt's not your n8n skills\n\nIt's understanding that business owners don't make rational decisions\n\nThey make emotional ones and justify them later with logic\n\nAnd if you're selling with logic you're playing the wrong game\n\nMeanwhile gurus are playing the emotion game and winning\n\nAM I THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS?\n\nOr is everyone else just better at psychology and not admitting it?\n\nBecause right now it feels like I learned the wrong fucking skill entirely\n\nBeing good at n8n is worthless if you can't get people to buy\n\nAnd getting people to buy has nothing to do with how good your workflows are\n\nIt's all psychology and sales tactics and I'm shit at both\n\nSo what's the point of being good at the actual work?",

The absolute most important thing is to land on the right team, what you will need is mentors, people who are willing and able to show you the ropes.  \nThey will hire on attitude rather than technical competence, your job is not to explain the product, it's to get told no 100 times until someone says yes.   \nTo understand the role better check out The Sales Development Playbook by Trish Bertuzzi  \nBeing a bdr/sdr sucks, who you surround yourself with will make all the difference, starting at some kind of agency that provides it as a service could be a good starting point although the pay will likely be low",

Maybe there are some gurus who make this money but honestly, someone who makes 100,000s of views on youtube most likely does not have a running business but youtube is the profitable business.\n\nFor sure some people make this kind of money but they just qualify better customers. I think your customer just do not have enough budget or not enough digital literacy.\n\nMaybe also you just dont make it big enough. Marketing and Sales is in the end always a little lie or a strong simplification of things. And it is never a good idea to give away something for free.\n\nI dont sell N8N workflows. But how I sell my tech solutions:\n\n\\- Understand the problem and draft with them a \"solution\"\n\n\\- Show them what have been worked for others\n\n\\- Sell a mini implementation and use the time to bump up the use-case. There is always more hidden and you just need find the angel how you fit in.\n\nHowever, make sure that your potential leads are qualified right. If you try to improve workflows for some small businesses (night shops, restaurants) your ticket size might be too small or you have not yet find the right way to explain them a potential value..",

Clients forget what they asked for, workflows break months later, you need to remember why you built it that way.

      "text": "Most companies think they need a moonshot AI initiative to see real ROI.  \n  \nThey don't.  \n  \nThe biggest wins come from very practical (and often boring) use cases. The ones that remove bottlenecks, kill manual work, and make workflows predictable.  \n  \nHere's what's consistently delivering results for our clients:  \n  \n1/ Document Extraction & Parsing  \nAI reads PDFs, contracts, invoices. Extracts structured data. Pushes it into your CRM, ERP, or database. No human retyping.  \n  \n2/ Data Cleaning & Organization  \nDuplicate detection. Categorization. Format standardization. If your team spends hours \"cleaning things up\" — this is a massive unlock.  \n  \n3/ Workflow Automation + AI Reasoning  \nTraditional automation handles rigid rules. AI handles the gray area. Combine LLM decision-making with trigger-based workflows in n8n, Make, or Zapier. Operations start running themselves.  \n  \n4/ Knowledge Agents  \nYour company sits on years of SOPs, manuals, and docs nobody reads. AI agents search, summarize, and answer questions across all of it. Instantly.  \n  \n5/ Customer Support  \nAI support agents now handle 30-80% of inquiries. Same inputs every time: FAQs, policies, product data, past tickets. Humans only touch edge cases.  \n  \n6/ Data Enrichment & Research  \nPull missing fields. Categorize leads. Enrich CRM records with Clay or custom agents. Removes hours of manual research from sales and ops teams.  \n  \n7/ Reporting & Insight Generation  \nInstead of scrolling dashboards, AI reads your data, spots patterns, and generates weekly executive summaries. Like adding an analyst to the team.  \n  \n8/ Document Generation  \nReports. Product briefs. Training materials. AI fills the structure using your real data. Same quality. Fraction of the time.  \n  \n9/ Sales Team Agents  \nMeeting prep, CRM auto-updates, proposal generation. Three agents that save 5+ hours per rep per week. Cut proposal time by 80%. They pay for themselves in week one.  \n  \nThe pattern is simple.  \n  \nFind the repetitive data work your team does every week.  \nReplace it with AI + workflows.",

      "text": "If you've been using the HTTP Request node to call Claude's API in your n8n workflows, you know how quickly the API costs add up — especially if you're running multiple automations daily.\n\nI found a way to use your existing Claude Pro subscription ($20/month) as a personal API endpoint that you can call directly from n8n. No separate API billing, no usage-based charges.\n\nHere's how it works at a high level:\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* Spin up a small VPS (DigitalOcean $6/month droplet works fine)\n* Install Claude Code SDK and authenticate with your Pro account\n* Run a lightweight FastAPI server that exposes a `/generate` endpoint\n* Secure it with a simple API key header\n\n**Connecting to n8n:**\n\n* Use the HTTP Request node\n* POST to [`http://your-server-ip:3001/generate`](http://your-server-ip:3001/generate)\n* Pass your prompt in the request body\n* Add your custom API key in the headers\n* That's it — Claude responds just like the official API\n\nI've been running this for my own content generation and automation workflows and it handles everything — writing, summarization, data extraction, you name it.\n\nFull step-by-step setup walkthrough here if you want to follow along: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O\\_Aq7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O_Aq7E)\n\nHappy to answer any questions if you try setting this up.\n\n**A word of caution:** This is great for personal projects and experimentation, but I wouldn't recommend using this for heavy client work or production-level automations. Anthropic will likely notice if you're pushing heavy usage through this — my estimate is anything beyond $200-$400 worth of equivalent API usage could get flagged, and there's a real chance your account gets blocked. Use it wisely for your own smaller workflows and testing. For serious client/production work, stick to the official API.",

I have found that the connection needs me to use a new n8n api key the next time, but that’s easy to do real fast. Also, code doesn’t retain the connection the next time so I’ll just run that command if needed.",

Curious how stable it’s been for you over time and whether you’ve hit any friction with longer workflows?\n\nNice write-up 👌",

      "text": "Been grinding in the automation space for a long time now. Here's what actually moves the needle vs. what sounds good on paper:\n\n1. Start embarrassingly small\n\nYour first workflow should take 10 minutes to build, not 10 hours. I burned weeks overcomplicating things when a basic \"new form submission → auto reply\" would've taught me twice as much.\n\n2. Document everything in public\n\nEvery single automation you build is content waiting to happen. The screenshots, the lessons, the stuff that broke. All of it becomes proof that you know what you're doing. I land more clients from sharing my process than from polished demos.\n\n3. Learn the HTTP Request node before anything else\n\nI mean it. Half the \"limitations\" people complain about in n8n vanish once you can write custom API calls. It handles everything the native nodes can't. It's the one skill that changes the game.\n\n4. Drop the \"automation expert\" title\n\nEveryone uses it. Try this instead: \"I help \\[specific industry\\] eliminate \\[specific pain point\\].\" Being specific attracts people who will pay premium because you described their exact problem.\n\n5. Saying no makes you more money\n\nI passed on a $500 project last month because it didn't fit my niche. That same client came back two weeks later with a $3K project that was a perfect match. Holding your line creates value.\n\n6. Error handling separates beginners from pros\n\nEverybody shows the clean version. The real ones build for when APIs crash, data formats shift, or users submit garbage. If you're not planning for chaos, you're not ready for production.\n\n7. Post your failures, not just your wins\n\n\"Here's how I accidentally broke a client's workflow and what I learned from it\" outperforms \"Look at this flawless automation\" every single time. Being real builds trust faster than being perfect.\n\n8. Recurring revenue beats one time builds\n\nClients pay once for the setup. They pay monthly for \"keep it running and make it better.\" Maintenance contracts will always outperform project work.\n\n9. Other automators are your best referral source\n\nThey're not competition. Help people in communities, answer questions, share what you know. Half my inbound clients come from other builders sending people my way.\n\n10. Automate your own stuff first\n\nNothing proves you know automation like having your own lead gen, content pipeline, and client onboarding fully automated. Walk the talk.\n\nSpeaking of which, I genuinely love building n8n workflows. It's one of my favorite things to do. If you've got a project you need built, I'll probably take it on. Most workflows I'll do for $50, bigger ones around $100, and even the complex multi day builds top out at $200. I just enjoy the work and I'd rather keep the barrier low so more people actually get automated.\n\nBonus: The automators making real money talk about outcomes, not nodes. \"Saved 15 hours a week\" lands way harder than \"Built a 47 step workflow.\"\n\nWhat's been your biggest learning curve with automation? Curious what trips people up vs. what clicks right away.",

Built two things so far:\n\n1. **Screenshot → calendar event:** I send a screenshot (flight booking, concert ticket, etc.) to a Telegram bot, it extracts the info and creates an Outlook event. Simple, not life-changing, but a solid first build.\n2. **Meeting reminder automation:** Sends reminders to participants who haven't responded to tomorrow's meetings. After accidentally blasting a few dozen emails to last month's contacts due to a broken filter... it now works and is live.\n\nThen I hit a wall. I wanted to pull my LinkedIn post analytics into a dashboard automatically. Seemed straightforward. It wasn't:\n\n* LinkedIn's API doesn't give you the data you actually want\n* Scraping gets you blocked\n* OneDrive integration failed due to licensing issues\n* Google Drive with self-hosted n8n apparently isn't stable\n\nAfter 1.5 days of troubleshooting, I realized I could have just built the whole thing manually in Excel.\n\nWhich brings me to my actual question: **How do you decide what's worth automating?** Do you have a mental framework or threshold? How do you deal with hitting platform limitations that turn a 30-minute idea into a multi-day rabbit hole?\n\nWould love to hear from people who've been through this learning curve.  \nAre there any projects you thought they were great and had a good learning curve? What would you recommend building?\n\nThanks in advance!",

For LinkedIn analytics specifically, you're better off with a purpose-built tool or a simple manual dashboard than trying to scrape it through n8n.

You can use Claude or similar, and there is even a long section in the course dedicated to coding which helped me understand enough about JavaScript / JSON. \n\nI also felt like I'm out of my league when I started learning n8n, but I believe anyone can learn. Especially that you can problem solve and create code when needed with the help of Claude / GPT.\n\nFor motivation if you need, here are some things I built with zero coding knowledge:\n\n- A weekly customised newsletter with news from the AI and SEO industry.\n\n- An workflow for labeling all my 9000+ emails and helping me clean my inbox.\n\n- A finance tracker where I type or speak into telegram app the spendings and incomes and sends the details into a Google sheet where it further calculates differences from incomes/spendings.\n\n- An AI invoice automation that scans monthly pdf invoices from my Google drive and uploads details into notion as well as sending me an automated email with the invoices sum totals and breakdown. \n\n- A workflow that scrapes Google and creates content with self-checks steps that also formats and uploads the content in Google drive + internal linking process integrated. (This is not specifically in the course but I couldn't do it without what I learned in the course).\n\n- An AI chat agent that I integrated on my website that I fed it with my own knowledge about SEO to give personalised SEO answers directly to site visitors.\n\n+ Many more that I built but don't personally need like a CV summariser, automated customer support messaging with sentiment analysis and sentiment-aware replies. Or AI video generation and automated posting on social media. \n\nAfter you start learning you will understand why coding isn't really needed.",

Personally I don't think you will be able to learn one small service as good as selling it, without knowing to do a lot more than just that one small service. \n\nThere are always caveats in my experience. Almost every workflow I did in the course required some adjustments to make it work for my own scenario. N8n is updating and things change. Or the other tools you connect with N8N change and you need to find workarounds by yourself or by looking for info online or asking LLM. \n\nEven if you want to sell it I think every client will have something slightly different. Maybe one uses notion, the other uses Asana instead. And notion and Asana they might have different ways to connect with n8n. And you will need to know both. \n\nI think you just need to start first and then decide what questions to ask.   \n\nAnd I think having expectations and doubts will hurt the learning process. \n\nIn short, the course is not what you want. But then again I don't think you understand what you want. Because it seems you have ideas about automation that are not true. Automations are like open ended tools. \n\nYou use ai agents with detailed prompts, and you refine and improve the prompts. And then there are updates from the tools you connect with N8N that might change how they connect or change settings and interface. That's why I believe you need to know as much as possible to be able to do any one single automation and do it well. \n\nPersonally, I'm strange and I need to learn something new constantly to make my days feel less boring and more productive. I didn't start with expectations. And I think that is a benefit as your mind is better set to learning that way.",

      "text": "Sharing a workflow I built that automates most of my job search process.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. **Scrapes LinkedIn jobs** via Apify (100 listings per run, filtered by keywords)\n2. **Loads my base resume** from Google Docs\n3. **AI filters for fit** - GPT-4.1-mini checks if I'm actually qualified. Returns true/false\n4. **Customizes resume per job** - GPT-4.1 rewrites keywords, skills, bullets to match each job description\n5. **Creates new Google Doc** with the customized resume, sets sharing permissions\n6. **Finds hiring manager email** via AnyMailFinder (decision-maker lookup by domain)\n7. **Drafts personalized email** in Gmail with the custom resume link\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nMost resumes get killed by ATS keyword filtering before a human ever sees them. The only way to beat it is to tailor each application. But doing that manually takes 30+ minutes per job.\n\nNow it takes about 90 seconds of review per application.\n\n**Stack:**\n- n8n (orchestration)\n- Apify (LinkedIn scraper)\n- OpenAI GPT-4.1 / 4.1-mini\n- Google Docs/Drive API\n- AnyMailFinder\n- Gmail\n\n**What actually works:**\n- AI for filtering and rewriting = huge time saver\n- Human review before sending = keeps quality high\n- Targeting hiring managers directly = better response rate than applying through portals\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup.",

That probably saves a ton on API costs across 100 listings.   \n  \nCurious how you're handling the AnyMailFinder step when it can't find a decision-maker email though. Do you fall back to applying through the portal, or just skip those entirely?   \n  \nAlso wondering if you've hit any issues with Apify and LinkedIn as they tend to rotate their DOM structure pretty often and I've had scrapers break overnight.",
