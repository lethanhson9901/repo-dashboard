Some things just work magically once you give it an API key, but others requires tedious manual debugging.\n\nMy question: **Is this basically just n8n with a chat interface?**\n\nFrom what I can tell, it’s a local-first AI agent and handles basically the same auth/integrations we do in n8n (reading emails, calendar checks, web browsing), but instead of us dragging nodes to define the *exact* logic, the LLM decides which \"tool\" to call dynamically.\n\n* Pros:\n   * Have \"memory\" and proactive triggers (like morning briefings) out of the box without building complex workflows.\n   * Tools/Skills\n   * Vibe coding (Canvas)\n* Cons: Less granular control than a flexible n8n workflow?\n\nHas anyone here tried running it alongside n8n? I'm currently spinning it up on Docker to test, but curious if anyone has dug into the code to see if it's doing anything unique or if it's just a fancy wrapper for tool-calling.",

A raspberry Pi will be fine. Mac minis are so your bot has access to iCloud apps(iMessage,Notes,etc)the hardware could also power a local model to offload some tasks.\n- you need to use Claude Max plan to get the most out of this. all the hype is folks using their $200/mo plan. \n- other models have various degrees of effectiveness, but nothing compares to opus. The cheaper you get, the more you sacrifice. I’m using Claude pro and burn through limits in 15mins.\n- there are security concerns that you need to be aware of. Not meant for your average person, tech savvy individuals should be using this as they will have the know how to patch/plan around them.\n-if you’re tech savvy and looking to build a business, you likely can justify the ROI on buying $200 plan from Anthropic or OpenAI \n\nFor everyone else, you’re either an enthusiast and don’t care about ROI or you’re caught up in the hype.\n\nI will say its potential feels greater than N8N. I was hoping I could do enough for my $20/m plan to justify jumping to $200/m but I’m not there yet… yet",

          "text": "From playing with it a bit, it’s not just an n8n wrapper, but it’s also not a drop-in replacement either.\n\nI’d frame it like this: n8n is great when you want deterministic, debuggable workflows where every step is explicit. Clawdbot/Moltbot sits one layer above that, more “intent => execution”, where the LLM decides which tool to call. That’s powerful, but also where unpredictability and manual debugging start to creep in.\n\nRunning them side by side actually makes sense. Let the agent handle fuzzy, exploratory tasks (research, triage, light browsing, proactive triggers), and push anything critical or repeatable into n8n via webhooks or APIs. Treat the agent as a planner, not the executor.\n\nIf you’ve worked with tools like ZennoPoster, the contrast becomes clearer. ZennoPoster is the opposite end of the spectrum: very explicit, very deterministic, browser-level automation where you control every click, delay, and condition. It’s heavier to build, but once it’s stable, it runs the same way every time. Agents like Clawdbot trade that determinism for flexibility and speed of setup.\n\nWhere people usually hit friction with agent-first setups is browser actions at scale. Logins, scraping, long-running sessions, that’s where silent blocks and CAPTCHAs appear and flows stall without obvious errors. In production systems, teams often treat CAPTCHA handling as infrastructure rather than agent logic, and tools like CapMonster Cloud are commonly recommended there to keep unattended automations moving.\n\nSo yeah, there’s hype, but it’s not empty hype. Clawdbot is useful if you design around its probabilistic nature and pair it with deterministic layers (n8n, ZennoPoster-style flows) instead of expecting it to replace them outright.",

You want to always lock down passing secure keys between things like webhooks between services of course but you can make additional trees of checks to further validate and keep those onion layers going. \n\n\nLLM only when you can't determine next course of action. I've been slowly building out a diagnostic sort of server manager with orchestrator and there is a whole lot of data I can get ahead of the LLM along with transforming data for lower token usage and dumbing the data down. This allows me to then pick a more appropriate sized model for the situation, reduce tokens, and just keep footprints smaller which is great. \n\n\nFinally, parallelism is one of design choices that I wish n8n would have spent more time on from the first iteration. It can be done but it's a bit convoluted right now. The implementation of tasks was a good idea but it's sort of bolted on. Specific nodes or handling within existing nodes would have been much preferred rather than the mess of subworkflows and subworkflows of those workflows. While it still works. It could be a lot easier.\n\n\n JavaScript and python are sort of natural choices but bash is also right there and offers maybe newer users a more natural progression. So I hope we see that in the future. \n\n\nThe extended logging metric systems they have that bolt on are very enterprise to setup. I think a lot more could be done with the current execution and testing to not turn it into a sluggish sqlitedb but still provide more useful data about executions.\n\n\nTheir documentation chatbot is one of the best I've used for any product. Whomever set that up understood the task. It stays narrow and includes forum community posts. Other companies need to take note. It might be one of their best ideas for onboarding people to the product.\n\n\nCareful with other people's workflows from their site, while there is a ton of interesting stuff. A lot of them were created by people that really don't understand any sort of security or least privileged access. It's a bit scary that some of the top workflows can be quite dangerous if you don't already know what you are doing. So use them for ideas but don't just import them and expect them to be safe.",

An AI agent will perform much better that way. To be honest, on its own, it really struggles with n8n workflows.\nHowever, the trade-off is that you have to build everything else yourself—your deployment, your infrastructure, and so on. Plus, you have to manage your connectors and credentials for all the different APIs you're using.\nAnd that’s where n8n is actually quite strong; a huge part of the heavy lifting is already done. It handles credentials for OpenAI and Claude, and makes it easy to interact with external services like Gmail, Notion, etc.\nAs for my component, it’s there to bridge the gap between these two worlds. n8n is great because managing credentials and OAuth is much easier to do manually; but when it comes to building complex workflow structures or making bulk edits, you want to do that via code. It’s ten times faster.\nWhile standalone agents do struggle with JSON workflows, my component provides them with all the necessary tools to be highly efficient—just as efficient as if they were manipulating Python code directly.",

      "text": "I recently spoke with N8N about an on-premise license. I like the product and what the team is building, but the business model genuinely confused me.\n\nThe Community Edition (source-available / fair-code license) allows unlimited executions when self-hosted. The paid on-prem license, however, introduces execution and workload limits — even though customers already pay for hardware, electricity, networking, and operations. Paying more but getting less doesn’t make sense.\n\nLicense restrictions are fine — limited workloads are not. A paid version should never reduce core capabilities compared to the free version. Paid should always equal Free + More.\n\nA more logical model would cap the number of workflows, active plugins, or reserve advanced plugins for higher tiers — not executions in a self-hosted setup.\n\nI also found multiple Reddit threads/users who reverted to the Community Edition, not because Pro is bad, but because the licensing constraints feel arbitrary.\n\nN8N has a strong product and community. Revisiting the on-prem licensing model could significantly improve trust and adoption.\n\nExample, we've been using [Thingsboard.io](http://Thingsboard.io) more than 10 years now for our IoT Deployments. the tiered license makes sense, the perks you get by paying makes sense.\n\nAnyone here facing the same with N8N?",

So you still have to get customers somehow, but the fulfillment is way faster and robuster with this method, which enables you to handle a lot more clients. And if something brakes you can fix it with a single prompt and keep going.\n\nBasically you focus on getting clients as usual, but there is one addition: clients love speed, so you can promise crazy delivery times like 1-2 days, which gets you the deal or lets you charge higher prices.\n\nSo can promise great guarantees, also you can work for free on the first project with a new client and crush it. Wouldn’t really cost you a lot of time and makes your client happy, so he wants more.\n\nThe other option would be charging to teach people on how to create agentic workflows and replace the headache of working with freelancers.",

It's like I said \"timeshare\" or \"pyramid scheme\"\n\n\n\nAnd here's what drives me fucking insane\n\n\n\nThese are business owners who RISKED EVERYTHING to start their company\n\n\n\nThey took loans, they bet on themselves, they fought to build something\n\n\n\nBut NOW? Now that they could actually SCALE that thing they built?\n\n\n\n\"Nah bro, we're good with spending 15 hours a week on bullshit manual tasks\"\n\n\n\nWHAT THE FUCK?\n\n\n\nYou had balls to start a business but not to optimize it? Make it make sense\n\n\n\nHere's the reality NOBODY talks about\n\n\n\nBuilding the automation? Easy as fuck, n8n makes it stupid simple\n\n\n\nYou want me to connect 5 APIs and automate your entire sales pipeline? Give me 2 days\n\n\n\nBut getting someone to admit they waste time, trust me to fix it, and actually FUCKING PAY for it? That's the impossible part\n\n\n\nShow them the math: \"You spend €1,500/month in wasted time, this costs €2,000 ONCE, payback in 1.3 months, after that it's pure profit\"\n\n\n\nTheir response? \"Seems expensive\"\n\n\n\nBRO THE MATH, LOOK AT THE FUCKING MATH\n\n\n\n\"We'll think about it\"\n\n\n\nTranslation: No\n\n\n\nAnd you know what's wild? People in tech GET IT immediately\n\n\n\n\"Oh you automated that? ROI in 3 months? Sick, let's do it\"\n\n\n\nBut normie business owners? Sheep, actual fucking sheep\n\n\n\nThey follow each other doing the SAME inefficient bullshit because \"that's how it's always been done\"\n\n\n\nOne guy told me, I shit you not, \"If it was that good, everyone would be doing it\"\n\n\n\nMY BROTHER IN CHRIST, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE\n\n\n\nTo make you the one who DOES IT FIRST\n\n\n\nBut no, comfort zone too strong\n\n\n\nThe first time most of them hear \"automation\" they panic\n\n\n\nLike I'm about to replace their entire team with robots\n\n\n\nNo dude, I'm trying to make your life EASIER\n\n\n\nFree up time so you can actually GROW instead of drowning in admin\n\n\n\nBut they can't see it\n\n\n\nThey're so deep in the day-to-day bullshit that they literally CANNOT imagine it being different\n\n\n\nIt's like showing color to someone who's been colorblind their whole life\n\n\n\nSo when I see these posts: \"Just closed 5 clients this week! Automation is the future!\"\n\n\n\nI call bullshit\n\n\n\nEither you're lying, you have connections like family or friends who trust you already, you're selling to tech companies which is easy mode, or you got lucky with 1-2 clients and now you're acting like you cracked the code\n\n\n\nThe REAL game? Contact 100 companies, 5 respond, 2 take meetings, 1 MAYBE buys\n\n\n\nAnd that ONE takes 3 months to close because they need to \"discuss internally\" which means asking their cousin who \"knows computers\" if it's legit\n\n\n\nI'm not quitting, I believe in this shit\n\n\n\nAutomation WORKS, the value is REAL\n\n\n\nBut I'm so fucking tired of people pretending the hard part is building\n\n\n\nBuilding is the EASY part\n\n\n\nThe hard part is finding someone who admits they have a problem, explaining value in terms they understand and not tech jargon, getting them to trust you, actually closing the fucking deal, and not losing your mind when you get ghosted for the 47th time\n\n\n\nTHAT'S the game\n\n\n\nNot \"knowing n8n\"\n\n\n\nIf you're making bank, good for you, genuinely\n\n\n\nBut PLEASE stop acting like it's easy and everyone's just lazy\n\n\n\nShare your ACTUAL process, where do you find clients, how do you get responses, what do you say that makes them give a shit, how do you close\n\n\n\nBecause \"I built cool stuff and clients came\" is NOT helpful, it's hopium\n\n\n\nAnd for everyone grinding like me, you're not alone\n\n\n\nThis shit is HARD\n\n\n\nYou're not failing because you're bad at n8n\n\n\n\nYou're struggling because convincing humans to change is fucking brutal\n\n\n\nKeep going but stop believing the bullshit success porn on YouTube\n\n\n\nReality: Building automations is 20% of the work, selling them to people who don't get it is 80% of the work\n\n\n\nAnyone who tells you different is selling you a course\n\n\n\nFuck the fake positivity\n\n\n\nThis is hard, acknowledge it\n\n\n\nThen keep grinding anyway\n\n\n\n/endrant\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. If you're about to comment \"skill issue bro\" then congrats, you're exactly the type of person this post is about, go fuck yourself!",

When computers were just becoming popular you had to convince small and medium businesses that there was value in purchasing the software. This was done by demos and hell that has even evolved today with just having a free tier. Doing that for automations isn’t easy but if the automations you are selling truly take 2 days to get setup tell the client how about a 30 day trail. Sure some might not convert but some will. You can also keep the non converts low by asking qualifying questions. Find clients who are on the edge and give them a free trail. This also assumes you are not just charging for setup but have a monthly fee which is usually the better option for small businesses.",

With each new client you can tell the next prospect, we've got X companies using this already, here's their feedback after 3, 6, 12 months. Here is the information I need from you, with a small one time setup fee we'll get you ready and setup in X days. A lot of businesses struggle with cashflow, they have rent, staff, insurance, licenses, expenses, tax and a huge list of other outgoings. Give them something that works for them without the fear of investing a large sum for a result they can't yet see.\n\nI considered not even sending this because cash is tight for me but maybe this is what I need to do as well. Give it a go, won't hurt to try.\n\nMicro transactions and longevity are what will keep your business thriving long term. A client of mine sent me an audio file which had a prewritten script spoken by an AI generated voice, tailored to his business and the services he provides on his website. Even that alone made him want it.",

The workflows themselves are great; it’s the *lack of a clean interoperability boundary* that hurts once you want systems to collaborate.\n\nThe goal here wasn’t to turn workflows into smarter agents, but to turn them into *good citizens* in a multi-agent environment:\n\n* no rewrites\n* no custom glue per integration\n* clear contracts at the edges\n\nUsing A2A felt like the right abstraction because it keeps the workflow logic intact while standardizing how things talk to each other.\n\n“n8n as a backend for multi-agent systems” is a really nice way to put it, that’s very much the direction I’m exploring. Still early, and I’m sure there are rough edges, so feedback like this is super helpful.",

Cleaning them manually would've taken weeks. So I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire enrichment process.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls contacts from Google Sheets (name, company, existing data)\n\n\\* Finds current LinkedIn profiles for each contact\n\n\\* Scrapes full profile data (email, phone, job title, location)\n\n\\* Enriches company information (official website, company phone, company email)\n\n\\* Gathers additional intel (company size, LinkedIn company page)\n\n\\* Updates all records back to Google Sheets automatically\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What would take 30-40 hours of manual research now runs completely automated. Process 500+ contacts in 30-60 minutes while you focus on actual selling.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"John Smith\" at \"Acme Corp\" (stale record from 2021)\n\n\\- Results: Fresh LinkedIn URL, verified work email, direct phone number, current job title, company website, company contact info, employee count\n\n\\- All data automatically updated in your CRM/sheet\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The workflow runs in batches of 10 contacts\\*\\* to maintain API stability and avoid rate limits. Perfect for overnight enrichment runs.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams cleaning hundreds of outdated CRM records before campaigns\n\n\\* RevOps maintaining data quality across large contact databases\n\n\\* Marketing enriching event attendee lists with complete contact info\n\n\\* Recruiters updating candidate databases with current employment data\n\n\\* Business development building complete prospect profiles at scale\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 500+ contacts per execution without issues.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json)",

I can process 50-200+ potential partners from a single post.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: Viral post from an industry leader (10,000+ engagements)\n\n\\- Results: 187 profiles enriched in 12 minutes\n\n\\- Data retrieved: Name, LinkedIn URL, follower count, company email, headline, location, company size, influence score\n\n\\- Output: 43 high-priority prospects (70+ influence score) with verified emails ready for outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How the scoring works:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Follower analysis\\*\\* – Scores 0-50 points based on audience size\n\n2. \\*\\*Connection depth\\*\\* – Adds 0-25 points for network reach\n\n3. \\*\\*Headline matching\\*\\* – Identifies creators, consultants, coaches, founders (0-25 points)\n\n4. \\*\\*Priority ranking\\*\\* – Automatically flags high (70+), medium (45-69), and low prospects\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Affiliate managers finding partners who already engage with competitor content\n\n\\* SaaS companies recruiting influencers who've engaged with industry thought leaders\n\n\\* Agency teams building prospect lists from viral posts in target verticals\n\n\\* Partnership managers identifying high-value creators based on engagement behavior\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with posts that had 500+ reactions and it handles them perfectly.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow1230.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow1230.json)",

Not anymore.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIf you're in B2B sales, companies posting certain job titles are gold – they're actively investing in specific areas. I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire research process from LinkedIn job posts to enriched contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Scrapes LinkedIn for companies posting specific job titles (e.g., \"Customer Success Manager\", \"DevOps Engineer\")\n\n\\* Extracts company names from job postings and deduplicates the list\n\n\\* Enriches each company with verified websites, direct phone numbers, company emails, and employee counts\n\n\\* Outputs complete sales intelligence to Google Sheets with hiring signals attached\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 3-4 hours of manual research now runs automatically. I can process 40-50 companies in 4-6 minutes with complete contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"Sales Development Representative\" + \"San Francisco\" + last 7 days\n\n\\- Results: 47 companies enriched in \\~5 minutes. Each record includes company website, phone, email, employee count, job titles they're hiring for, and LinkedIn profile\n\n\\- The workflow marks each with a hiring signal (\"Hiring 3 positions\") so you know their investment level\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*SaaS sales teams\\*\\* – Find companies hiring SDRs/AEs (they're investing in growth = need your sales tools)\n\n\\* \\*\\*DevOps/Infrastructure vendors\\*\\* – Target companies posting DevOps/SRE roles (they're scaling infrastructure)\n\n\\* \\*\\*HR tech providers\\*\\* – Identify companies with multiple open positions (recruiting pain points)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Recruitment agencies\\*\\* – Build targeted lists of companies actively hiring in specific verticals\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 50-100+ companies per run. Google Sheets trigger means you just add a row with your search criteria and it runs automatically.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json)",

      "text": "So there have been a couple things I’ve used in n8n cloud to get around some rules/keep executions low. \n\nThese are some I’ve done:\n\n1. Sub-Workflow still only count as the 1 main execution. \n\nThis one has been HUGE! So you can have 1 sub workflow or 50 running off a trigger and it will still only count as 1. So you can have a time based trigger that will trigger 50 other workflows and have it all run as 1 execution\n\n2. Evaluation node can be used to batch process 1000s of things all under a “test” execution so it doesn’t count towards monthly execution counts. \n\nAnother huge one. We have used this node linked to a spreadsheet that contains order numbers. This then passes through to a http request body and runs through a bunch of things. Writhing various workflows. If things break over a weekend and need to be reprocessed we fill in the spreadsheet with the orders we need to reprocess as a batch and hit go. Bang, 100s of things done without burning through executions and without manually doing a heap of leg work\n\n3. Use an event gateway for webhook spam\n\nThis one I’ve been playing around with. Experienced people probably already know about it, but you can set up an in between for your webhooks that can essentially asses them and choose weather or not to pass them on to n8n or not. So things like event based webhooks (Xero, Gorgias for example) that send 1000 webhooks a god damn second can be filtered before burning executions. \n\nThese are some helpful tips for those of you that use n8n cloud. It’s probably rudimentary stuff, but I felt pretty clever when I found these tricks out. \n\nAny cool stuff anyone else has figured out I’d love to hear it! ",
