This is my take on it ...\n\ntl;dr: OP is using n8n as an mcp integration lay (gateway) between claude and the the other services (google mail, analytics etc).\n\nOP is set up all the services in n8n. n8n takes care of the authentication, connection and messaging channel to the services. N8n then provides an endpoint (url) with which to interact with the services. This endpoint (url) is them provided to claude as part of a settings file. OP then prompts claude the workflow above, claude works with the other services (via n8n), and generates a blog post.\n\nAs suggested elsewhere in the comments, there are other ways of integrating those services into claude. MCP gateways are becoming a thing. Here's a good article what looks into this in more depth: [https://medium.com/@crivetimihai/mcp-gateway-the-missing-proxy-for-ai-tools-2b16d3b018d5](https://medium.com/@crivetimihai/mcp-gateway-the-missing-proxy-for-ai-tools-2b16d3b018d5)\n\nEdit: On further research, the two mcp gateways that keep coming up are LiteLLM and Bifrost.",

An AI agent will perform much better that way. To be honest, on its own, it really struggles with n8n workflows.\nHowever, the trade-off is that you have to build everything else yourself—your deployment, your infrastructure, and so on. Plus, you have to manage your connectors and credentials for all the different APIs you're using.\nAnd that’s where n8n is actually quite strong; a huge part of the heavy lifting is already done. It handles credentials for OpenAI and Claude, and makes it easy to interact with external services like Gmail, Notion, etc.\nAs for my component, it’s there to bridge the gap between these two worlds. n8n is great because managing credentials and OAuth is much easier to do manually; but when it comes to building complex workflow structures or making bulk edits, you want to do that via code. It’s ten times faster.\nWhile standalone agents do struggle with JSON workflows, my component provides them with all the necessary tools to be highly efficient—just as efficient as if they were manipulating Python code directly.",

You want to always lock down passing secure keys between things like webhooks between services of course but you can make additional trees of checks to further validate and keep those onion layers going. \n\n\nLLM only when you can't determine next course of action. I've been slowly building out a diagnostic sort of server manager with orchestrator and there is a whole lot of data I can get ahead of the LLM along with transforming data for lower token usage and dumbing the data down. This allows me to then pick a more appropriate sized model for the situation, reduce tokens, and just keep footprints smaller which is great. \n\n\nFinally, parallelism is one of design choices that I wish n8n would have spent more time on from the first iteration. It can be done but it's a bit convoluted right now. The implementation of tasks was a good idea but it's sort of bolted on. Specific nodes or handling within existing nodes would have been much preferred rather than the mess of subworkflows and subworkflows of those workflows. While it still works. It could be a lot easier.\n\n\n JavaScript and python are sort of natural choices but bash is also right there and offers maybe newer users a more natural progression. So I hope we see that in the future. \n\n\nThe extended logging metric systems they have that bolt on are very enterprise to setup. I think a lot more could be done with the current execution and testing to not turn it into a sluggish sqlitedb but still provide more useful data about executions.\n\n\nTheir documentation chatbot is one of the best I've used for any product. Whomever set that up understood the task. It stays narrow and includes forum community posts. Other companies need to take note. It might be one of their best ideas for onboarding people to the product.\n\n\nCareful with other people's workflows from their site, while there is a ton of interesting stuff. A lot of them were created by people that really don't understand any sort of security or least privileged access. It's a bit scary that some of the top workflows can be quite dangerous if you don't already know what you are doing. So use them for ideas but don't just import them and expect them to be safe.",

I like the product and what the team is building, but the business model genuinely confused me.\n\nThe Community Edition (source-available / fair-code license) allows unlimited executions when self-hosted. The paid on-prem license, however, introduces execution and workload limits — even though customers already pay for hardware, electricity, networking, and operations. Paying more but getting less doesn’t make sense.\n\nLicense restrictions are fine — limited workloads are not. A paid version should never reduce core capabilities compared to the free version. Paid should always equal Free + More.\n\nA more logical model would cap the number of workflows, active plugins, or reserve advanced plugins for higher tiers — not executions in a self-hosted setup.\n\nI also found multiple Reddit threads/users who reverted to the Community Edition, not because Pro is bad, but because the licensing constraints feel arbitrary.\n\nN8N has a strong product and community. Revisiting the on-prem licensing model could significantly improve trust and adoption.\n\nExample, we've been using [Thingsboard.io](http://Thingsboard.io) more than 10 years now for our IoT Deployments. the tiered license makes sense, the perks you get by paying makes sense.\n\nAnyone here facing the same with N8N?",

So it's very clear the answer is: They don't care about Pro/Business on-prem.\n\nThey care about (and in order):\n\n* n8n.io - Aka the cloud\n* OnPrem Enterprise\n\nAnything not on that list, are \"whatever\". Speaking as someone who has worked in and around SaaS for a long time, onprem is extremely expensive to deal with (as compared to multi-tenant SaaS). The only time it's \"worthwhile\" is when a customer is willing to pay you BIG bucks.\n\nOtherwise they want to push you to the cloud. Because they you are reoccurring revenue with a potential to upsell AND not nearly as expensive to deal with.",

So you still have to get customers somehow, but the fulfillment is way faster and robuster with this method, which enables you to handle a lot more clients. And if something brakes you can fix it with a single prompt and keep going.\n\nBasically you focus on getting clients as usual, but there is one addition: clients love speed, so you can promise crazy delivery times like 1-2 days, which gets you the deal or lets you charge higher prices.\n\nSo can promise great guarantees, also you can work for free on the first project with a new client and crush it. Wouldn’t really cost you a lot of time and makes your client happy, so he wants more.\n\nThe other option would be charging to teach people on how to create agentic workflows and replace the headache of working with freelancers.",

Cleaning them manually would've taken weeks. So I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire enrichment process.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls contacts from Google Sheets (name, company, existing data)\n\n\\* Finds current LinkedIn profiles for each contact\n\n\\* Scrapes full profile data (email, phone, job title, location)\n\n\\* Enriches company information (official website, company phone, company email)\n\n\\* Gathers additional intel (company size, LinkedIn company page)\n\n\\* Updates all records back to Google Sheets automatically\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What would take 30-40 hours of manual research now runs completely automated. Process 500+ contacts in 30-60 minutes while you focus on actual selling.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"John Smith\" at \"Acme Corp\" (stale record from 2021)\n\n\\- Results: Fresh LinkedIn URL, verified work email, direct phone number, current job title, company website, company contact info, employee count\n\n\\- All data automatically updated in your CRM/sheet\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The workflow runs in batches of 10 contacts\\*\\* to maintain API stability and avoid rate limits. Perfect for overnight enrichment runs.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams cleaning hundreds of outdated CRM records before campaigns\n\n\\* RevOps maintaining data quality across large contact databases\n\n\\* Marketing enriching event attendee lists with complete contact info\n\n\\* Recruiters updating candidate databases with current employment data\n\n\\* Business development building complete prospect profiles at scale\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 500+ contacts per execution without issues.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json)",

      "text": "I used to deploy n8n on my local machine the hard way: manually installing Node.js, pulling the source, wrestling with Docker containers (which ate up gigabytes of space), and tweaking configurations. It was a hassle.\n\nThat frustration led me to build **n8n Desktop** — a native, self-contained app packaged with **Tauri**. Now I can ditch Docker and have a truly click-and-run experience.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Self-contained installer**: The app **automatically downloads and sets up** the required Node.js runtime and n8n resources on first launch. No manual dependency deployment needed — it handles everything for you.\n* **Native & Lightweight**: Built with Tauri/Rust, it's tiny and uses minimal system resources.\n* **Runs offline**: Your workflows and data stay on your machine. Perfect for self-hosted enthusiasts.\n* **Auto-start on boot** (configurable): Keeps your workflows always running.\n\n**Direct Download Links (v1.0.1):**\n\n* **Windows (.exe)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe)\n* **macOS - Apple Silicon (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)\n* **macOS - Intel (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64.dmg)\n\n**Important Installation Notes:**\n\n1. **For Windows Users**: I only have a Mac for development, so **the Windows version is untested**. Please use it at your own discretion and report any issues you encounter!\n2. **For macOS Users**: Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer account, you may see a “damaged” error on first launch. To fix this:\n   * Open **Terminal**.\n   * Copy and paste the following command, then press **Enter**: bashsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/n8n-desktop.app\n   * Enter your **administrator password** (it won‘t show as you type) and press **Enter** again.\n   * You should now be able to open the app normally from your Applications folder.\n\n**Source Code & All Builds:**\n\n* **GitHub Release Page**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1)\n* **Main Repository**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop) (Stars and feedback are welcome!)\n\n**Screenshot of the app:**  \n[https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app\\_screen\\_short.png](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app_screen_short.png)\n\n**Why Tauri?** I chose Tauri over Electron for its superior performance and smaller bundle size. The core is still the fantastic n8n, but now it feels like a true desktop citizen.\n\nThis is an open-source side project I use daily. I'd love to get your feedback, bug reports, or contributions.\n\n",

This inherently increases both user reliance on your specific product, and risk to the end user.\n\nWe already have entire communities of people who barely know how to scrape together a line of JSON, flailing about wildly running n8n insecurely in all sorts of ways. By adding a desktop wrapper yes you've lowered the bar for people to run, but at the same time increased their ignorance about what it actually takes to run production-ready environments.\n\nAre you going to be there to pick up the pieces when someone idiotic enough decides to install your software on a desktop in a commercial business and it all goes tits up?\n\nYes it's their fault, but soon enough they'll point the finger at you.\n\nI'm not trying to gatekeep n8n here, but there are real world effects to adding a presentation wrapper to a complex software product like n8n. Because when shit hits the fan the user will look to you to fix it.\n\nMaking things easier does not always make them better.",

Not anymore.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIf you're in B2B sales, companies posting certain job titles are gold – they're actively investing in specific areas. I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire research process from LinkedIn job posts to enriched contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Scrapes LinkedIn for companies posting specific job titles (e.g., \"Customer Success Manager\", \"DevOps Engineer\")\n\n\\* Extracts company names from job postings and deduplicates the list\n\n\\* Enriches each company with verified websites, direct phone numbers, company emails, and employee counts\n\n\\* Outputs complete sales intelligence to Google Sheets with hiring signals attached\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 3-4 hours of manual research now runs automatically. I can process 40-50 companies in 4-6 minutes with complete contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"Sales Development Representative\" + \"San Francisco\" + last 7 days\n\n\\- Results: 47 companies enriched in \\~5 minutes. Each record includes company website, phone, email, employee count, job titles they're hiring for, and LinkedIn profile\n\n\\- The workflow marks each with a hiring signal (\"Hiring 3 positions\") so you know their investment level\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*SaaS sales teams\\*\\* – Find companies hiring SDRs/AEs (they're investing in growth = need your sales tools)\n\n\\* \\*\\*DevOps/Infrastructure vendors\\*\\* – Target companies posting DevOps/SRE roles (they're scaling infrastructure)\n\n\\* \\*\\*HR tech providers\\*\\* – Identify companies with multiple open positions (recruiting pain points)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Recruitment agencies\\*\\* – Build targeted lists of companies actively hiring in specific verticals\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 50-100+ companies per run. Google Sheets trigger means you just add a row with your search criteria and it runs automatically.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json)",

I can process 50-200+ potential partners from a single post.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: Viral post from an industry leader (10,000+ engagements)\n\n\\- Results: 187 profiles enriched in 12 minutes\n\n\\- Data retrieved: Name, LinkedIn URL, follower count, company email, headline, location, company size, influence score\n\n\\- Output: 43 high-priority prospects (70+ influence score) with verified emails ready for outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How the scoring works:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Follower analysis\\*\\* – Scores 0-50 points based on audience size\n\n2. \\*\\*Connection depth\\*\\* – Adds 0-25 points for network reach\n\n3. \\*\\*Headline matching\\*\\* – Identifies creators, consultants, coaches, founders (0-25 points)\n\n4. \\*\\*Priority ranking\\*\\* – Automatically flags high (70+), medium (45-69), and low prospects\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Affiliate managers finding partners who already engage with competitor content\n\n\\* SaaS companies recruiting influencers who've engaged with industry thought leaders\n\n\\* Agency teams building prospect lists from viral posts in target verticals\n\n\\* Partnership managers identifying high-value creators based on engagement behavior\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with posts that had 500+ reactions and it handles them perfectly.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow1230.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow1230.json)",
