      "text": "I have been using n8n for client work for a while now. Not hobby projects. Actual businesses paying real money to automate real workflows.\n\nAnd after doing this for long enough I have noticed some patterns that nobody in this community seems to talk about.\n\nFirst thing. Most founders have no idea what they actually want to automate. They come to me saying they want to \"automate their business\" which is the equivalent of going to a mechanic and saying \"fix my car.\" I spend the first week just watching them work and finding the one repetitive task that is quietly eating 3 hours of their day. That is where the money is.\n\nSecond thing. n8n is incredible until it isn't. The moment you start chaining more than 15 nodes together in a single workflow you are building a debugging nightmare. I have inherited workflows from other freelancers that look like circuit diagrams. Nobody can read them. Nobody can fix them when they break at 2am. I always split complex workflows into smaller ones that talk to each other. Boring but it works.\n\nThird thing. Everyone wants AI in the workflow now. Every single client asks if we can \"add AI\" somewhere. Sometimes it makes sense. Most of the time a simple IF condition does the same job faster and cheaper with zero hallucination risk. I have saved clients hundreds of dollars a month in API costs just by replacing an LLM call with a basic regex filter.\n\nThe actual stuff businesses pay for is not glamorous. Lead enrichment. Invoice parsing. Slack alerts when something goes wrong in the database. Syncing two tools that do not talk to each other natively.\n\nSimple problems. Boring solutions. Solid recurring revenue.\n\nAnyone else finding that the simplest automations are the ones clients renew contracts for every year?\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

Most of my client work is either a flat project fee upfront or a monthly retainer if they want me to maintain and expand the workflows over time. I stopped doing hourly a while back. Hourly billing punishes you for being fast and efficient which makes no sense.\n\nFor hosting, self hosted n8n on a cheap VPS. DigitalOcean or Hetzner usually. Hetzner especially if the client is in Europe. A 6 dollar box handles most small to mid sized workflow loads without breaking a sweat.\n\nI only use n8n cloud for clients who absolutely refuse to think about infrastructure or have a compliance reason to keep everything managed. It gets expensive fast so I try to avoid it unless the client insists and is willing to pay for it.\n\nThe setup is boring but it works and it never goes down.",

                  "text": "Just out of curiosity, is there a big reason you use n8n rather than Microsoft Power Automate?\n\nThe reason I ask is that if the organisation already has a Microsoft enterprise license (which seems like most companies these days), then surely all you need to do is get their IT team to set you up with a service account where you could hold all of these automations in the web version of power automate, which would be no extra cost. If you want to add HTTP actions for API calls, you might need the premium Power Automate license to be acquired for the service account, which I think is something like £11/$15 per month, but with that you can run everything cloud-based on Microsoft’s servers with zero setup. \n\nI’m not super experienced in the field so I may have got some assumptions wrong / not understand enough about the pros/cons of each automation platform out there, but would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the above",

I run 52 active workflows on a self-hosted n8n instance and the ones that cause the most trouble are always the monoliths I haven't broken up yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n  On the AI point — completely agree. I went through a phase of throwing LLM calls at everything. Ended up replacing most of them with Code nodes doing regex or simple string matching. The ones where AI actually earns its cost are lead enrichment (extracting names from messy HTML) and content repurposing. Everything else is better served by a filter or a switch node.\n\n  One gotcha nobody warned me about: n8n's splitInBatches node swapped its output order in v2.6.x. Output 0 became \"done\" and Output 1 became \"loop\" — the opposite of what it was before. Had 4 workflows silently producing wrong results before I caught it. Always pin your version and test after upgrades.\n\n  What's your error handling strategy? I use a dedicated error workflow that catches failures across all 52 workflows and sends a Slack-style alert. Curious if you've found a better pattern for the 2am breaks.",

If you search the CloudFlare Developer Docs for \"Service Tokens\" it describes how it works. Basically you create an Access Policy to allow access with Service Tokens (in addition to authenticated user), then create a Service Token and pass CF-Access-Client-Id and CF-Access-Client-Secret HTTP headers with the values they generate for a specific token and pass it with every request, instead of requiring login or having to pass a cookie that results from the authentication, as a way to app-auth rather than requiring interactive browser auth.\n\nIf the link works here, this page describes the details: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/)\n\nInterestingly, that page describes a couple of ways you can either use a service token to get an expiring JWT that can be passed in as a Cookie header instead until it expires, or a way to combine the client ID and secret into an Authorization header. However, you have to have an Allow (user-based) policy in addition to a Service Auth policy to allow those to work; otherwise you must pass the service token on all requests: \"If your Access application only has Service Auth policies, you must send the service token on every subsequent request. You can only use the JWT if the application has at least one Allow policy.\"\n\nSo a few options, but honestly the simplest and most straightforward is just to allow users to define custom headers and matching values (I'd allow any headers so other systems can work, though auto-fill for the CF ones would certainly be appreciated!) and just send both headers with every application request and call it a day.\n\nMaking it easy to either type the header names or select previously typed ones, and making it easy to paste in the ID and secret values (and ideally saving state while swapping back and forth between a password manager or the CF page on a mobile app/browser) without losing the place (some systems close the login forms as soon as you move away and lost other data!) is a key usability thing for getting long header names and complex secrets actually into the app, on the usability side!",

Managing n8n workflows on mobile has always been a hassle, so having a dedicated app that connects directly to the instance without needing proxies is a smart move. Being able to activate or deactivate workflows and check logs quickly from your phone could save a lot of time and frustration, especially when you're out and a client needs a fix ASAP. I'd love to hear more about how you handle authentication and security since it connects directly to n8n instances. Also, do you plan to add any notification features for failed executions or other alerts? I'm definitely going to give it a try and see how it fits into my workflow.

      "text": "The past few weeks I’ve been experimenting a lot with “vibe coding” – basically working with a bunch of AI agents and just switching between them to build small experimental projects.\n\nAt first it felt super powerful, but I’ve realized it’s draining me like crazy.\n\n**My day kind of looks like this now:**  \nI have multiple windows/tabs open, I keep switching between them, and whenever I see an AI has “stopped” or is waiting, I quickly throw in a new instruction. If I’m not giving them work, I feel like I’m “wasting” compute. When they generate artifacts with errors, I either report the issue back to the AI or ask it to debug itself, again and again.\n\nA lot of what the AI produces is outside my current knowledge, so I just reply AI fast and then try to point it in some direction. I’m like a supervisor (knowing little) trying to keep every powerful agent busy than a dev actually building and learning. \n\nBy the end of the day, my brain feels tired. I’ve been “busy” for hours, but I don’t feel like I actually achieved much or leveled up my skills. It’s just constant task-switching and telling AIs what to do.\n\n**Before vibe coding, my process was very different:**  \nI would carefully design a n8n workflow, read the API docs, debug errors myself, and really understand what was going on. Every day felt like real progress and growth. When something finally worked, the sense of achievement was huge. Now it feels… shallow in comparison.\n\nI’m starting to feel that this current way of working is not sustainable. I probably can’t keep going like this for long.\n\nI think part of the problem is that AI raised my expectations way too fast. Now I expect to build a brand-new website with a backend in two days, even though before AI I never would’ve thought that was realistic for me.\n\n**So I’m changing my approach:**\n\n* Slowing down my pace\n* Sticking with one main task instead of juggling 5 AI “personas”\n* When the AI is thinking or generating, I don’t rush to another window — I stay with the same task and think more deeply about the problem, the architecture, the edge cases, etc.\n\nThis has already made me feel a lot calmer. I get more time for deep thinking, I actually understand more, and the output quality is higher. It feels less like “herding AIs” and more like actually building something again.\n\nCurious if anyone else has gone through this with vibe coding / agent workflows?  \nHow do you balance using AI aggressively without burning out or losing the feeling of real progress?",

      "text": "n8n recently shipped \"AI Workflow Builder\" ([https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/)) where you describe what you want in plain English and it generates the workflow for you.\n\nZapier launched Agents in beta doing essentially the same thing. OpenAI dropped AgentKit with a visual agent builder at DevDay. And n8n 2.0 now lets you turn any workflow into a \"tool\" that an AI agent can call on its own when it decides it needs to.\n\nThe direction is pretty clear. \\~Two years from now, most people won't be dragging nodes around a canvas. They'll describe what they want and an agent will build it, test it, and probably fix it when it breaks.\n\nSo what actually happens to the skill of building automations? Right now knowing how to wire up a webhook to a database to an API is valuable because it's hard enough that most people can't do it. But if a prompt gets you 80% of the way there, does the remaining 20% become the only thing that matters? Things like knowing which edge cases will break in production, understanding rate limits, designing error handling that doesn't silently fail.\n\nI keep going back and forth on this. Part of me thinks the \"automation builder\" role just shifts from construction to architecture. You stop being the person who builds the workflow and start being the person who knows what the right workflow even is. The other part of me looks at how fast these tools are improving and wonders if even that gets automated away.\n\nCurious where you all land on this. Are you already using the AI builder features in your daily work? Has it actually replaced manual building for you or is it more of a starting point you still heavily edit?",

On their own it's going to be people like you still.\n\nI find it fun to vibe code/automate/ build things but there is still some complexity behind it that most people aren't going to take the time to figure out\n\n e.g supabase has 4 separate API keys took me like a hour my first time to figure out which one just view which ones edit rows etc.\n\nLet alone just building a process in general in my recent project I was uploading like 50+ ranging from 2-50mb each compressed folders and n8n would crash with to much data so had to figure out the loop node then the code node would crash with to much data figure out the set node getting it to filter correctly and update correctly I'm not smart but I'm not dumb either still took me like 3 days with all the crashes and errors and changing the flow to get it functional. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is long story short is I don't think much well change because \n1) people are lazy would rather pay someone to do \n2) people trust others who are experts or know more \n3) if they do start I bet alot give up after the first 3 failures and having to restart \n4) some people already don't trust AI let alone trust it enough to fully build something for their/a company that involves sensitive data or any data in general really\n5) alot of AI don't like you posting API keys in them at least that I have seen/done Gemini and open ai both would say delete the key you pasted it here it's exposed (I have to assume that they would fix that but well that be public then? Well that be used to train new models still?) \n\nJust my opinion I'm a landscaper personally I just like to build things for fun just started a few months ago just something to do after work.\nI personally plan to experiment around with n8ns Agent soon just to see what it's all about",

That's the kind of stuff no AI prompt is going to solve for you because you don't even know what to ask until you're already stuck. And yeah, 3 days of crashes and flow changes to handle large file uploads is exactly the gap between \"AI built me a workflow\" and \"I have a workflow that actually works\".   \n  \nI guess the real solution long term is agent-to-agent communication. Like Supabase has its own agent, n8n has its own agent, and they just talk to each other. The n8n agent asks the Supabase agent which key it needs, gets the right permissions, configures the connection. No more digging through docs for an hour. We're not fully there yet but that's clearly where it's heading.   \n  \nAlso respect for doing this after landscaping shifts, that's a solid hobby upgrade.",

Shift requirement calculator — Looks at bookings for each location, calculates how many people we need and when.\n\n3. Auto-assignment — Matches available staff to required shifts based on location, role, and hours. Draft schedule ready by 5am.\n\n4. Conflict checker — Flags double-bookings, overtime issues, or people scheduled during requested time off. Runs before anything gets published.\n\n5. Schedule publisher — Pushes the approved schedule to our team app. Everyone sees their week without someone manually updating a shared calendar.\n\n6. Swap request handler.  Staff can request shift swaps. Workflow checks if it's valid, notifies the other person, updates the schedule if both agree.\n\n7. No-show alert - If someone hasn't checked in 15 minutes after shift start, manager gets a ping. Simple but saved us twice already.\n\n8. Weekly hours reconciliation that compares scheduled hours vs actual, flags discrepancies before payroll.\n\nWhat's different now\n\n\n\nNobody runs scripts manually anymore. Nobody imports CSVs. Nobody spends their first hour playing Tetris with a spreadsheet.\n\n\n\nThe ops coordinator who used to own the morning routine now focuses on actual problems — short-staffed days, training gaps, site issues. The mechanical stuff just happens.\n\n\n\nThe biggest lesson learned\n\n\n\nEarly on, I used n8n's built-in Google Sheets nodes. Seemed obvious right? we're reading and writing sheets, use the Sheets node.\n\n\n\n**BIG Mistake.**\n\n\n\nThe integrated nodes were flaky. Random timeout issues, weird edge cases with formatting, inconsistent behaviour with larger datasets. I spent more time debugging node quirks than actual logic problems.\n\n\n\nEventually I ripped them out and switched to raw HTTP requests against the Google Sheets API.  This is my **PRO-TIP -** steer clear of integrated nodes if they're not doing what you need.  A properly defined http request is much better for exploring an API. \n\n\n\nNight and day difference. More reliable, more control, better error handling. I could see exactly what was being sent and returned.\n\n\n\nPro tip: If you're building anything serious in n8n, don't assume the integrated nodes are your best option. HTTP Request nodes talking directly to APIs are often more comprehensive and way more predictable. The integrated nodes are convenient for quick stuff, but when reliability matters, go direct.\n\n\n\nWould I do it again?\n\n\n\nImmediately. The old system was a single point of failure disguised as \"how we've always done it.\" Now there's version control, error logs, and I can actually see what's happening.\n\n\n\nPlus I don't get panicked calls when someone's on holiday and forgot to run the script.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with n8n. If you're replacing janky Apps Scripts with proper workflows, happy to compare notes.\n\n",

I’m at the point where I want to transition from just \"tinkering\" to actually making good money as an automation consultant/developer.\n\n​For those of you already successfully billing clients or running a business around n8n: What is the roadmap to high-ticket mastery?\n\n​I’d love to get your insights on:\n\n​Essential Tech Stack: Beyond n8n, what are the \"must-have\" tools? (e.g., PostgreSQL for data persistence, Supabase, Docker for scaling, or specific APIs like OpenAI/Anthropic?)\n\n​High-Value Skills: What specific tasks are clients actually willing to pay a premium for? (Is it complex CRM migrations, custom API wrappers, AI-driven agents, or something else?)\n\n​The \"Secret Sauce\": Are there specific programming languages that take your workflows to the next level? I’m assuming JavaScript/TypeScript for Function nodes is a given, but what else?\n\n​Business Model: Do you find more success with project-based builds, monthly maintenance retainers, or building \"Automation-as-a-Service\" products?\n\n​I'm ready to put in the work, I just want to make sure I'm practicing the right scales. Any advice, \"gotchas,\" or resources you wish you knew when you started would be massive.\n\n​Thanks in advance! 🛠️",

      "text": "Hey guys!! I’m a day late 😅 but as promised, and especially for u/Wild-Lama-474 who asked for the restaurant version, here’s the AI voice agent workflow I mentioned earlier.\n\nI originally built this around the same time as my dental receptionist agent while experimenting with AI voice automation. It was mainly a learning project, but instead of letting it sit unused in my n8n workspace, I figured it might actually help people building similar systems or learning automation.\n\nThis one is designed for **restaurant table bookings** and includes a full backend automation system for managing reservations automatically.\n\n[Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/kjbf1grce9kg1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbf406c8a8f6e27ef67ef8161286f14bb9f0a90b)\n\n[Dedicated frontend to view bookings](https://preview.redd.it/mnr1pupde9kg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28c355041f12d73e043cdb2d474647803b5907a)\n\n# 🔧 Workflow Overview\n\nThis is a **complete table booking automation system** built around four main workflows:\n\n# 🟦 1. Booking System (Main Flow)\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook (POST request for booking)\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Receives booking requests from the voice agent/web app\n* Automatically creates **date-specific Google Sheets** if they don’t exist\n* Assigns tables intelligently\n\n**Table Assignment Logic:**\n\n* Checks for available tables (`Not booked` status)\n* Same-day bookings → assigns first available table\n* Future bookings → uses **time-gap logic** so multiple bookings can exist per table safely:\n   * 90-minute booking slots\n   * Minimum 30-minute buffer between bookings\n\n**Data stored per booking:**\n\n* name\n* contact\\_number\n* guests\n* booking\\_time\n* booking\\_date\n* table\\_id\n* status\n\n# 🟩 2. Cancellation System\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook\n\n**Process:**\n\n* Finds the matching booking\n* Updates status → `Not booked (Cancelled)`\n* Clears customer info while keeping table availability intact\n\n# 🟧 3. Rescheduling System\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook\n\n**Two-step logic:**\n\n1. Creates or updates booking on the new date\n2.

The first execution that writes the booking effectively “wins”, and the other person is asked to book again for some other day.\n\nSince this was a POC and intentionally kept DB-less, I accepted the small race-condition risk instead of adding locking via Postgres or a transactional store.",

In reality? It’s a **maintenance nightmare.**\n\nHere’s what I learned the hard way:\n\nThe problem with standalone custom software\n\nWhen you sell one of these:\n\nYou’re not just selling a build\n\nYou’re accidentally selling lifetime responsibility\n\n* APIs change.\n* Integrations break.\n* Security updates are needed.\n* Auth methods expire.\n* Databases need care.\n* Logs need watching.\n* Infrastructure needs patching.\n\nAnd every time something breaks…\n\nyou’re the one they call.\n\n\n\n# My CRM disaster\n\nI once built a custom CRM automation for a shitty CRM called SuperOffice:\n\n* Connected to the CRM platform via API\n* Synced with Airtable\n* Had custom logic\n* Ran on the client cloud (Azure)\n\n\n\nWhat happened:\n\n**APIs started failing**\n\n* Airtable sent constant error notifications\n* Random edge cases popped up\n* Customer expected fixes… forever\n\nAnd the real mistake?\n\n👉 I didn't charge maintenance fees.\n\nSo I eventually had to tell them:\n\n“I can’t maintain this anymore, or we need to get paid for maintenance (they refused cuz the project cost a lot.”\n\nNow I no longer maintain it, and the client started ghosting me, and I just burned my cards with them due to bad expectation management.  \n\n\nAlso, this is the part nobody talks about enough.\n\nWhen you host:\n\nYou’re responsible for:\n\n* Server updates\n* Library vulnerabilities\n* Auth security\n* API key storage\n* Data protection\n* Downtime\n* Logs\n* Backups\n\n\n\nThat’s not “automation work.”\n\nThat’s software operations.  \n\n\n**And clients don’t want to pay SaaS-level prices…**\n\n**…but expect SaaS-level reliability.**\n\n\n\nWhy this model breaks **at scale**\n\nLet’s say you get:\n\n**10 clients**\n\nEach pays maintenance\n\nEach system is unique\n\n\n\nNow you have:\n\n* 10 workflows and databases\n* 10 infra configs\n* 10 potential failure modes\n* 10 different clients pinging you\n\n>even if you're taking 200$ for the 10 customers, that's 2000, but then also all of these could fail at the same time. If you're by yourself, you cannot get new customers and add them to this loop unless you need to hire somebody and just keep paying them to manage these servers.  And at this rate, you cannot hire full-time employees because you cannot afford them, so you end up hiring some shitty developer from Upwork who's unreliable and they bail on you at the time of need...\n\n\n\n**What I do now instead**\n\nI changed my offer completely:\n\nI now:\n\n* Build automations inside their stack\n* Deploy on their infra (or SaaS tools they own)\n* Train their team\n* Provide:\n   * Docs\n   * Debug help\n   * Limited guidance for their team, no maintenance support (ex: 5h/month)\n\n\n\nSo:\n\n* They own it\n* They maintain it\n* I support strategically\n* I don’t babysit systems forever\n* Much more sustainable.\n\n\n\n**My rule going forward**\n\nI will never again:\n\n❌ Build standalone micro-SaaS for a single client\n\n❌ Host custom apps for them\n\n❌ Be responsible for their infra long-term\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Custom standalone automations = hidden SaaS business\n* Without SaaS pricing\n* Without SaaS team\n* Without SaaS margins\n\n\n\nIf you’re selling automations:\n\nLearn from this before you build your first “custom CRM” for €2k and regret it 😅\n\nHappy to hear if others made the same mistake or am I the dumbass in this story...

      "text": "I have a task to evaluate n8n for my company since it's the alleged super awesome workflow management tool with NATIVE AI capabilities. Great!  \nI wrote terraform code to provision the infra and run the community version (2.8.3) as docker container on an instance behind a load balancer in a Dev AWS account. Some observations:\n\n\\- Apparently there is no way to automatically setup the owner user as part of the deployment so in 2026 I am expected to ClickOps this out via the UI in the browser.  \n\\- Same goes to the API key that I need to setup so I can use the rest API.  \n\\- There are 2 AWS credential types - IAM and AssumeRole. The IAM one supports Bedrock which I want to use for the NATIVE AI CAPABILITY but this credential requires either using the extremely bad practice of hardcoding access and secret keys (my company directly bans that) or use temporary credentials via session token that will expire in few hours but is HARDCODED... Read that again: HARDCODED TEMPORARY CREDENTIALS. So every few hours I have to go and manually update the credential :D. The Assume Role one uses roles with External ID (as is the best practice) but it only support subset of the stuff IAM supports!?!  \n\\- Ok so I will just setup something to automatically update the IAM credential every hour. After all this is what n8n is all about. I tried to use the n8n create credential node (after manually provisioning the api key) but it simply says forbidden (although the api key definitely works for GET operations)!  \n\\- I resorted to postman to get any kind of meaningful information and it says that what I am providing as json in the data key in the payload does not conform to the expected schema. Of course the schema is described nowhere so I don't have any idea what should I provide for a correct call.\n\nI just spent a whole day just trying to automate simple n8n installation and configuration. Nothing can be provisioned programatically. The API is useless. Everything is apparently expected to be done manually in 2026. There is no adequate documentation to facilitate any of the above. The simple task of just setting up AI agent in AWS is so far a complete failure unless I just click something out that will work for 3 hours.....\n\nI simply have no words........",

          "text": "Here is what Claude tells us:\n\nThis is a classic \"evaluate new tool\" nightmare, and the frustration is completely valid. Let me break down each problem with practical workarounds:\n\n---\n\n**1. Owner user setup (the ClickOps problem)**\n\nn8n does support environment variables to bootstrap the owner account. Set these in your Docker/Terraform config:\n\n```\nN8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true\nN8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin@yourcompany.com\nN8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=yourpassword\n```\n\nOr for the newer \"user management\" flow, these env vars skip the setup wizard:\n```\nN8N_SETUP_OWNER_EMAIL=admin@company.com\nN8N_SETUP_OWNER_PASSWORD=yourpassword\nN8N_SETUP_OWNER_FIRST_NAME=Admin\nN8N_SETUP_OWNER_LAST_NAME=User\n```\n\nThis can all go in your Terraform `environment` block on the container definition — no clicking required.\n\n---\n\n**2. API key bootstrapping**\n\nThere's no env var for this one unfortunately, but you can work around it by hitting the internal API *as the owner user* with basic auth to create the API key programmatically. Do this in a `local-exec` provisioner or a small bootstrap Lambda/script after the container is healthy:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-n8n-host/api/v1/user/api-key \\\n  -u admin@company.com:yourpassword \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nNow you have your API key without touching the browser, and it can be stored in Secrets Manager.\n\n---\n\n**3. The Bedrock credentials mess (this is the real pain)**\n\nThe correct answer here is **EC2 instance role / ECS task role** — but n8n's IAM credential type doesn't support that natively, which is the genuine gap you've hit.\n\nYour best options, in order of sanity:\n\n- **Use the AssumeRole credential type**, even though it has a reduced feature set. For Bedrock specifically, check whether the actions you need (InvokeModel, etc.) are in the supported subset — they often are, even if the UI implies otherwise. The External ID + role approach is the right one anyway.\n\n- **Sidecar approach**: Run a small sidecar container (or a cron on the instance) that fetches fresh credentials from the instance metadata service and updates the n8n credential via API on a schedule (every 30–45 mins). This is essentially solving n8n's gap with n8n itself, or with a simple script.\n\n- **AWS credentials file mount**: Mount a credentials file into the n8n container from a volume that a separate process refreshes. n8n's underlying AWS SDK will pick it up if the env var `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` points to it. Hacky but functional.\n\n---\n\n**4. The \"Forbidden\" on credential creation via API**\n\nThis is a known n8n quirk — the API key needs the right *scope*. When you create the API key (even manually), make sure it has full access, not read-only. The GET operations work because read scope is default; credential write operations need explicit permission. If you created it with limited scope, recreate it with full scope.\n\n---\n\n**5. The credential schema mystery**\n\nFor creating an AWS IAM credential via the REST API, the payload shape n8n expects is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"AWS Bedrock Creds\",\n  \"type\": \"aws\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n    \"accessKeyId\": \"AKIA...\",\n    \"secretAccessKey\": \"...\",\n    \"sessionToken\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor AssumeRole the type is `aws` with additional fields:\n```json\n{\n  \"customEndpoints\": false,\n  \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n  \"accessKeyId\": \"\",\n  \"secretAccessKey\": \"\",\n  \"sessionToken\": \"\",\n  \"temporaryCredentials\": false,\n  \"assumeRole\": true,\n  \"roleArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/your-role\",\n  \"externalId\": \"your-external-id\",\n  \"roleSessionName\": \"n8n\"\n}\n```\n\nThe schema is reverse-engineerable from n8n's GitHub repo under `packages/nodes-base/credentials/` — each credential type has a TypeScript file that defines exactly what fields are expected.\n\n---\n\n**The honest summary**\n\nn8n is genuinely weak on GitOps/IaC-first deployment. It was built UI-first and the programmatic surface was bolted on later. The credential management story for AWS specifically is a known community complaint. That said, the combination of env var bootstrapping + a small post-deploy script + the AssumeRole approach gets you to a fully automated, non-ClickOps deployment — it just takes about a day of yak shaving to figure out (which you've now done).\n\nWhether that's acceptable for your company's standards is a fair evaluation finding to document.",

It is the only way to get 100% control over the logic, but the learning curve is still vertical. If you are not careful, your state management becomes a nightmare.\n\nCrewAI: The best for multi-agent orchestration. If you need one agent to research and another to write, this is the easiest way to set it up. It has matured a lot since last year but it still occasionally struggles with agents getting stuck in loops if your prompts aren't perfect.\n\nZapier Central: Good for people who just want to set and forget. It connects to everything, but it is expensive for high-volume tasks. It feels more like a smart assistant than a true autonomous agent.\n\nTwin.so: This is a newer one I have been using. It’s 100% no-code platform that has quietly exploded. The community has already built 150k+ agents. It uses browser agents that navigate websites like a human would (clicking, logging in, scrolling). It’s specialized for the stuff that usually breaks Zapier like legacy portals, internal tools, or sites with no API.\n\nn8n: My favorite for visual flows. The new agent nodes are decent, but self-hosting is still a bit of a pain for beginners. Great if you want to keep your data private and not pay per-task fees.\n\nFirecrawl: If you just need clean data for your RAG, this is the winner. It turns any website into markdown for your LLM. It is not an \"agent builder\" per se, but it is an essential part of the stack for most agents I build.\n\nVellum: Still one of the fastest ways to go from idea to production for text-based agents. Very clean UI and handles complex logic better than the pure no-code stuff.\n\nAutoGPT: Still feels more like a research project than a business tool. Great for a weekend project, but I would never put it in front of a client. It still burns credits way too fast.\n\nI am not trying to sell anything, most of my projects end up using a mix of these (usually n8n + Twin + a custom script).\n\nWhat am I missing? I am looking for a few more to test before the end of Q1.",

The gap I keep seeing across all these tools is what happens when things break mid chain. Most either crash or silently continue with bad data.\n\nStill in MVP phase but DM me if you want to hear more about the approach. I think it fills a gap in your list.",

You can have the most sophisticated orchestration logic but if your agent's web search tool returns messy HTML or truncated markdown, the downstream reasoning falls apart.\n\nI've found the biggest quality lift comes from cleaning up what goes into the agent, not tuning the agent itself. Structured extraction from web pages instead of dumping raw text cuts token usage by 80% and dramatically improves reasoning accuracy because the model isn't wading through nav bars and cookie banners to find the actual content.",

It gives you a persistent environment where your custom scripts are native, not an afterthought. Plus, it handles complex orchestration (the stuff that makes CrewAI loop) much more predictably because you have full control over the execution context.",
