That’s just not what I’m seeing.\n\nI’ve worked with 14 clients using n8n, and only ONE of them actually asked for an AI agent. And even then, it was more curiosity than a real business need.\n\nNobody is excited to:\n\nBook meetings through a Telegram bot\n\nReplace simple forms with “AI conversations”\n\nAdd complexity where a Calendly link or form already works perfectly\n\nThere are way easier, cheaper, and more convenient solutions for 90% of the use cases being hyped on Twitter/YouTube.\n\nn8n is first and foremost an automation tool, not an “AI agent factory”.\n\nIts real power is:\n\nConnecting broken systems\n\nAutomating workflows that don’t already have a clean solution\n\nEliminating boring manual processes\n\nHandling edge cases that SaaS tools don’t cover\n\nSlapping “AI” on top of everything is, in my opinion, a bad approach. Businesses don’t buy AI. They buy solutions to annoying problems.\n\nIf a problem is already solved well with:\n\nForms\n\nCRMs\n\nWebhooks\n\nSimple automations\n\nThen forcing an AI agent into it just makes it worse.\n\nI’m far from an n8n expert, so maybe I’m wrong — but from real client work, the demand is clearly for solid automation, not fancy AI buzzwords.\n\nFocus on problems that don’t have an easy solution.\n\nThat’s where n8n actually shines.\n\nCurious if others here are seeing the same thing or if my experience is just an outlier.",

You’re right, forcing AI where it doesn't belong is just bad engineering.\n\nHowever, I look at n8n as the **'Visual Backend'** for the next decade. Whether you're building a simple CRM sync or a complex agent, n8n is essentially the nervous system that connects everything. The reason it’s the 'bomb' is that it handles the plumbing that makes *any* logic, AI or not, actually work.\n\nI think we are currently in the **'Messy Middle'** of a massive transition:\n\n* **Past:** Simple, linear automation (If this, then that).\n* **Present:** Solving 'annoying problems' with broken systems (The solid work you’re doing now).\n* **Future:** Autonomous tasks where a virtual assistant performs digital work on your behalf.\n\nWe’re in the 'electricity' phase. When it first came out, people were skeptical and 'knocker-ups' still had jobs waking people up. Some chose to stay in the dark, but the tech evolved regardless.\n\nThe 'AI Agents' of the future won't be annoying WhatsApp bots; they will be **Local/Sovereign AI**. We're moving toward tailor-made, open-source assistants running locally that have access to knowledge a business simply couldn't offer otherwise.\n\nn8n is the best tool to bridge that gap. We can stand out by not just 'slapping AI on things,' but by using n8n to segregate all these scattered platforms into one unified, intelligent system. You're right that businesses buy solutions, but soon, the best solutions will be the ones that can think and act across all their tools simultaneously.",

          "text": "This is a refreshingly grounded perspective that challenges hype, and your core insight is valuable—n8n's strength lies in solving real automation problems rather than forcing AI into every use case. Your experience with 14 clients provides solid anecdotal evidence. To strengthen this further, consider: (1) Sharing specific examples of the automation wins you *did* see—this would make your argument more concrete and actionable for readers trying to decide what to build; (2) Acknowledging that AI agents *do* have legitimate use cases (customer support at scale, complex multi-step workflows, personalized interactions) even if they're rarer than the hype suggests—this makes your critique more balanced and credible.\n\nOn the workflow/automation angle: you're right that many hyped solutions overcomplicate things, but consider exploring where n8n + AI *could* add real value without the buzzword trap—like using LLMs for intelligent data extraction, dynamic routing based on content analysis, or handling edge cases in existing workflows. This positions n8n as a *pragmatic* tool that uses AI when it genuinely solves a problem, rather than rejecting it outright.\n\nFinally, your call for \"focus on problems that don't have an easy solution\" is excellent advice. You might amplify this by encouraging readers to audit their current workflows first—identify the manual, repetitive, or error-prone steps—before deciding what tool to use. This problem-first approach is exactly how n8n delivers ROI. Your skepticism is healthy; just pair it with concrete examples of what *does* work, and you'll have an even more persuasive and helpful post.",

For discovery, I’ll track mentions in places like Reddit and pipe them into a Notion board; ScrapeBee, Zapier, and Pulse all help with monitoring and triaging signals so I’m only building flows where there’s clear pull.\n\nMain point: n8n wins as quiet infrastructure, not as a flashy chatbot factory.",

What used to take hours of copy-pasting now happens in minutes with a single message.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"Scrape 50 marketing managers in San Diego\"\n\n\\- Results: 50 LinkedIn profile URLs automatically found and exported to Google Sheets\n\n\\- The AI understands variations like \"CEOs\" → \"CEO\" and handles missing details gracefully\n\n\n\nIf you don't specify a number, it defaults to 10 leads. The workflow processes requests in batches of 10 to stay efficient.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams building prospecting lists for specific territories\n\n\\* Recruiters finding candidates by role and location\n\n\\* Marketing teams identifying decision-makers in target industries\n\n\\* Business development researching competitors' leadership teams\n\n\\* Partnership teams finding potential collaborators in specific niches\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – you can request anywhere from 10 to hundreds of profiles depending on your needs.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow3211.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow3211.json)",

I wanted to share my first **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** setup.\n\n**The Problem:** I wanted an AI agent that doesn't \"hallucinate\" and actually knows my specific business data. **The Solution:** A flow that connects my documents to a vector database.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Data Ingestion:** I can upload files via a form or just drop them into a specific **Google Drive** folder.\n2. **Vectorization:** n8n takes the files, chunks the text, and stores them in a Vector Store (acting as the AI's long-term memory).\n3. **The Agent:** When I ask a question, the agent searches this database first to provide an accurate, fact-based response.\n\n**Why this matters for business:** Imagine automated customer support that actually reads your latest PDFs or an internal tool that knows every contract detail without a human having to search for it. It's a game changer for productivity.\n\nI've attached a short video of the workflow in action.\n\n**I'm curious:** Are you guys using n8n for RAG? What vector databases are you finding the most stable for production?\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone is interested!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbe3po/video/pte0t8h1u0dg1/player\n\n",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI run a small automation company and I’m looking for someone comfortable with n8n and AI automations to join the team as a freelancer/contractor.\n\nIt’s totally fine if you’re newer to this. Curiosity, ability to pick things up quickly, and actually wanting to learn matter more than years of experience. This is a good fit if you want to build real automation skills, understand how projects are scoped and delivered in the real world, get some client exposure, and potentially take on more responsibility over time.\n\nMost of the time I’ll handle the high-level architecture and client direction, and you’ll help build and implement workflows in n8n. That said, I’m not looking for someone who needs constant hand-holding or just executes tasks blindly. The goal is to reduce workload on my side, not add more. I’m happy to guide, review, and unblock you, but I need someone who can think independently, make reasonable decisions, and flag issues or improvements without being prompted. If you have ideas or see a better way to do something, I want to hear it.\n\nYou’ll be working on real client projects using tools like Zoho, ClickUp, Slack, Typeform, GHL, Instantly, Stripe, etc. Down the line you may also join client calls when it makes sense.\n\nYou should be comfortable with n8n, APIs, JavaScript for data transformations, Postgres/SQL, LLMs. The ability to quickly learn new tools is essential. Good English and availability during UK hours are required.\n\nBeyond the technical side, understanding how companies operate is just as important. You’re not just wiring nodes together, you’re solving real business problems. If you care about building workflows that are reliable, maintainable, and don’t break after two runs, we’ll likely work well together.\n\nPlease submit your application through this form: [ https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4 ](https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4)\n\nCompany website: [ https://innovaquest.ai ](https://innovaquest.ai)\n\nCompany name: InnovaQuest",

I've started tinkering with n8n in the last few weeks and can feel the potential, but I'm deliberately staying away from the usual \"AI YouTube empire / SaaS moonshot\" content that floods YouTube.\n\nMy only goal right now is modest but concrete:\n\nBuild simple, reliable automations that solve boring, repetitive problems for real people/small businesses → eventually charge enough to cover my personal basics.\n\nCurrent reality check:\n\nbeginner with n8n + AI nodes\n\nNo budget for paid tools/ads/team\n\nComfortable with Google Sheets, Excel, basic CRMs, data cleanup, maybe simple REST APIs once I learn them\n\nI want practical, low-risk use cases — not lottery-ticket ideas\n\nand, For a commerce/finance background person, where do you see n8n realistically fitting into future skills & opportunities? Better internal finance ops roles? Freelance reporting/ops automation? Micro-consulting for small CA offices / traders / e-commerce sellers? Or is it mostly a nice-to-have side-tool?\n\nIf more context about my current skill level or interests would help you give better pointers, just ask — happy to answer.\n\nThanks in advance for any no-BS, grounded input. Not chasing get-rich-quick, just trying to turn spare hours into something that pays for coffee without wasting months on dead-end hype.\n\nAppreciate you.",

(This is my personal experience)\n\nOnce you understood these most mid-tier concepts, then you can try out some internal financial operation (FinOps) concepts to see how does this work? Approach someone for free at first (since you're a commerce student, get a help from a professor, or maybe your colleague), and get their feedback, and go with constant feedback loop. then you can understand the market demand.\n\nOnce you analyzed the demand, pivot the strategy. Once you have enough knowledge to maintain a workflow and market yourself. you can easily make some bucks.\n\nJust try to showcase your work, ah you can try here as well, but most of the demos are not worth it in my opinion. so go with youtube, tiktok, and write a medium or blog about the journey, and what problem you're going to solve.\n\nGood luck, if you have any clarifications or hiccups, feel free to share.",

Love the tool, no question.\n\nBut I gotta ask - has anyone else been messing around with Claude Code lately?\n\nI tried the whole n8n + Claude MCP thing that was going around here, but honestly it ate through tokens like crazy and the workflows it generated weren't great. Then I tried just using the Claude API for building stuff, but once my projects got bigger, the costs were getting stupid.\n\nEventually just bit the bullet and got the $100/month Max plan. Way better - I'm building a small SaaS and not even close to hitting limits.\n\nHere's what's weird though - a lot of the automation ideas I used to build in n8n, I'm now just describing them to Claude Code and it's... building actual apps? With UIs and everything? And they run faster than my workflows used to.\n\nI'm not trying to say \"ditch n8n\" or promote anything - genuinely want to know if others have noticed this too. Like, are these tools just for different things? Should I be thinking about them differently?\n\nWhat's your take?",

I really want to start badly, but I don’t know what the right entry point is or what I should focus on first without burning out.\n\nFor those of you who learned n8n:\n\n\t•\tWhere did you start?\n\n\t•\tDid you already know APIs/JSON, or did you learn them along the way?\n\n\t•\tAny beginner-friendly resources or a simple roadmap you’d recommend?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

The fastest way to learn is just building workflows for real tasks, even if they're simple at first.\n\nOnce you've got the basics down, level up by learning how data flows between nodes, understanding when to use code nodes versus built-in functions, and practicing error handling. The mistake most beginners make is jumping into complex API integrations and JSON manipulation when we really just need to understand how to connect services and pass data between them first.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into agentic workflows, learning how to chain AI calls together using n8n is where things get really powerful.

Of course there is a lot yet to learn but you will learn as you go.\n\nI highly recommend looking at Nick Saraev channel on Youtube after you learn the basics. There you will learn about the business model and learn about the real problems that needs to be solved not the flashy trend workflows. That way you will learn new things in n8n and nodes, and the most important you will learn about the business and how to sell those systems you built (and that is like 70% of the work).",

Images and text are handled as separate objects internally, which is why media libraries lose the associated product code. Most Chrome extensions work by DOM scraping and are unstable or unsafe.\n\nThe only production-safe way I’ve seen this solved is by using WhatsApp Business API (directly or via Twilio). In that setup, each message arrives as a single payload: image + caption + metadata. From there you can route everything through n8n to:\n\t•\tdownload the image\n\t•\textract or validate the product code\n\t•\tgenerate PDFs or structured records\n\t•\tforward the result to an API or database\n\nThere is a technical breakdown of this exact document-extraction pattern (files, images, OCR, AI structuring, conditional routing). WhatsApp just becomes one of the ingestion channels:\n\nhttps://aistartmeup.com/n8n-extract-text/",

      "text": "I started studying automation in January of last year to work for a friend who accepted a marketing position but knew nothing about automation and needed to use it every day.\n\nI spent about 3 months with him doing this type of service, studying, learning, and applying. After 3 months, I made a mass mailing incorrectly, and instead of sending emails to 1000 leads, I sent them to about 50,000. The loss was quite high, and my friend wasn't very happy with the company anymore and ended up leaving after this mishap.\n\nI have ADHD and use cannabis, so lack of concentration is something that bothers me a bit during the day. So I created a checklist to prevent problems like this from happening again (so far, it's working). When I left that company, I thought about selling AI agents, and that's exactly what I did. I got a law firm to pay for my service, and I've had that contract active ever since. It's an AI agent for customer service and appointment scheduling that closes about 25 clients on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had much success working on a contract basis because I'm not a very good salesperson, and people in my city don't value that kind of service very much. Because of that, I had to look for a job.\n\nLast October I started a full-time job at an English language school. The pay is reasonable, and I learn a lot every day. So far, I've implemented an agent to assist students who have problems with the platform, an AI agent to respond to WhatsApp leads, and several HR automations, from candidate analysis to the entire hiring process that was previously done manually. I'm very happy with the service delivery; I've already managed to save about 830 hours of work per month that previously required a person to be available to do.\n\nI see many people here wondering if it's possible to make money with automation, and the answer is yes. You'll hardly make money selling workflows, but it's a very valuable service that companies are only now starting to seek. Selling services didn't work out the first time, but I'm already working on my second attempt this year, and I think everything will work out. If you are technically good and dedicated to delivering a quality service that will make a difference, there's certainly a place for you in the market.",

      "text": "Let’s be honest for a second: **Generative AI for end-to-end scheduling is a recipe for disaster in a professional environment.**\n\nI run an automation course with over **1,900 students**. For months, I’ve been delaying the release of our \"AI Scheduling Module.\" Why? Because I refuse to teach my students a solution that I know will fail them (and their clients) at least 5% of the time.\n\nI’ve tried everything in **n8n**:\n\n* Advanced Prompt Engineering\n* Direct Tool Calling with Google Calendar/Cal.com\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n* Multi-step verification loops\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good the model is. AI is probabilistic. It \"hallucinates\" time zones, it misses double-booking logic, or it simply fails to confirm a slot correctly.\n\n**The \"Human Error\" Fallacy:** People often say, *\"Well, humans make mistakes too.\"* Sure, but the market is significantly less tolerant of a machine's failure. If an AI messes up a CEO's calendar or double-books a high-ticket consultation, it doesn't look like a \"mistake\"it looks like a broken, amateur system. For professional services, 99% isn't enough. It has to be 100%.\n\n**The only solution that actually works 100% of the time:** After months of testing, I’ve concluded that the only \"pro\" way to do this is a hybrid model:\n\n1. **AI for Pre-qualification:** Let the AI handle the lead gen, answer questions, and build rapport.\n2. **Deterministic UI for Booking:** Once the lead is ready, the AI drops a link (Cal.com, tidycal, etc.) for the user to pick a slot.\n\nIt might not look as \"magical\" as a full chat-to-calendar booking, but it’s the only way to ensure the data is right every single time.\n\n**I want to hear from you:** Am I being too cynical, or are you guys also struggling with the reliability gap in conversational scheduling? Has anyone *actually* deployed a 100% fail-proof conversational booking system in production, or are we all just chasing a ghost?",

For the actual 'writing to the database' part, `if/else` and deterministic logic are king.\n\nThe reason people try to force AI into this is the **unstructured conversational layer** that comes before the booking. A simple script can't easily handle a lead saying:\n\n*'I’m travelling next week, but I might be free Thursday afternoon if my flight isn't delayed. Also, does your service cover VAT for European companies?'*\n\nAI is great for:\n\n1. **Contextual Qualification:** Understanding if the lead is even worth a meeting.\n2. **Handling Objections:** Answering those 'by the way' questions before the booking.\n3. **Intent Extraction:** Identifying that the user *wants* to book even when they don't use a specific keyword.\n\nMy argument is that we should use AI for that messy human interaction, but the second it’s time to actually pick a slot, we should hand it over to a deterministic system (the 'if/else' world). Trying to make the AI perform the logic of 'find slot -> check timezone -> verify conflict -> write' is where the 5% failure rate kills the UX.",

And this is why a lot of CEO's fail their projects. \n\nI don't know if you're an engineer or not, I'll try to do this argument without assuming it:\n\nWhen you study engineering for making a technical tool, you start by knowing that the user will ALWAYS get wrong the tool, so you have to do it like is for a child learning to read and even then, there's still probability of misusing. So, why in all hell you will allow the user to write \"I'm traveling next week...\".\n\nWhy in hell you will allow something like that? You study the booking process to the bone and automate it so the user receives a message like \n- \"Hi, *name*, which booking you want today? *Flight *Hotel *Uber\"\n- User just click button \n- Another message \"Please write the country\" \n- User write the country\n- You completely assume user will write wrong the country name, so you sanitize with model\n- \"To confirm, you have indicated country ****\"\n- User clicks *yes\n- \"Do you want to know information on VAT for this particular booking to *country?\"\n- User click yes\n- Model will start searching on it with a hell of a good prompt so you don't allow hallucination because there's no conversation before that...\n\nAnd so and so on, this is just the tip of the iceberg, so when you create a tool, ANY TOOL, no matter what, you have to assume that user is a stupid dumbass, ALWAYS. So stop creating tools that have to work with a message that was written by a stupid person. \n\nYour 5% failure it's because you're allowing the user, meaning you because I'm assuming you are the test case, to write whatever the hell he wants and not expect failure. \n\nThat's basic engineering process that you need to know before creating a tool...",

For outreach, I’ve chained this kind of flow into Instantly and Apollo; Pulse for Reddit plus Phantombuster has been nice for testing similar audience capture on Reddit/Twitter without drowning in noise.\n\nSo yeah: move from “cool scrape” to “clean, queryable pipeline” and this becomes a serious asset.",

      "text": "If you're running n8n self-hosted, update immediately. Cyera Research Labs has disclosed a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to take complete control of n8n instances without credentials, affecting approximately 100,000 servers globally.\n\n# What's the issue?\n\nThe vulnerability exploits a Content-Type mismatch bug in how n8n processes Form webhook requests. The middleware that parses HTTP requests decides which parser to use based on the Content-Type header, but the \"Form Webhook Node\" doesn't properly validate this header before processing files. An attacker can change the Content-Type from multipart/form-data to application/json and send a crafted payload that completely overrides the req.body.files object, including the file path that n8n will process.\n\nThis enables arbitrary file reads from the system, but critically, it also exposes the local SQLite database (/home/node/.n8n/database.sqlite) and the configuration file containing the encryption secret. With these files, an attacker can forge a valid admin session cookie and authenticate without credentials. Once inside, they simply create a workflow with the \"Execute Command\" node to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n# Why this is dangerous\n\nN8n acts as the central nervous system for automation infrastructure, connecting Google Workspace, OpenAI, payment processors... Compromising an n8n instance means gaining access to many stored credentials, OAuth tokens, and secrets, becoming a single point of failure that exposes your entire digital infrastructure.\n\n# Mitigations - Immediate action required\n\nUpdate to n8n v1.121.0 or later as soon as possible. No official workarounds exist for this vulnerability. Additionally, avoid exposing n8n directly to the internet without VPN or additional authentication, and require authentication on all public forms. If you suspect prior compromise, rotate all credentials stored in n8n.\n\n**Important note**: This vulnerability primarily affects **self-hosted deployments** (Docker, manual installation). n8n Cloud instances are not exposed in the same way.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported on November 9, 2025, patched on November 18, and the CVE was assigned on January 6, 2026. Full technical analysis available at: [https://www.cyera.com/research-labs/ni8mare-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-in-n8n-cve-2026-21858](https://www.cyera.com/research-labs/ni8mare-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-in-n8n-cve-2026-21858)\n\nIt's worth taking a look; it's very well explained and easy to understand...",

      "text": "\\*The text was made with the help of AI; everything is real. I just used it to make it better to read\\*  \nHi everyone! I’ve been lurking in this community for a while (big fan of Nate’s content, especially the \"Agency Trap\" video), and I finally decided to share my situation to get some perspective from those who have walked this path before.\n\n**🧑‍💻 The Context (Where I am now)** I’m 18 years old, living in Brazil. Currently, I’m splitting my day between two very different realities:\n\n1. **The \"Safe\" Job:** An internship at a swimming school. It pays the bills (\\~$200/mo), but it’s soul-sucking. I spend my mornings counting inventory (literally counting swim caps) and doing random manual tasks. Zero learning curve.\n2. **The \"Dream\" Job:** I work as a contractor for a small local Tech Company. I build automations using n8n, Typebot, OpenAI, and Evolution API (WhatsApp). I’ve already built some cool stuff, like a full RAG AI Agent for a Pie Shop that handles audio, video, and text orders via WhatsApp.\n\n**🚧 The Crossroads** Right now, my income is split 50/50 between these two. But the internship is draining my energy and time that I could be using to level up my hard skills. I’ve decided to quit the internship next month to go **all-in** on automation. It’s scary because I’m losing the \"guaranteed\" income, but I live with my parents (low expenses), so I feel like now is the time to take risks.\n\n**🚀 The Master Plan (Next 3-6 Months)** Here is the strategy I drafted. I’d love to know if I’m being delusional or if this makes sense:\n\n* **1. The \"Intrapreneur\" Pivot:** Instead of trying to start a full-blown \"Agency\" from scratch (and falling into the trap of doing admin work instead of coding), I plan to leverage my position at the Tech Company. I have a network of business owners (leads). My plan is to warm them up, pass them to my company’s sales team, and take a commission + get paid to build the implementation. This lets me focus on **building** and learning, while having a safety net.\n* **2. The \"Productized\" Freelancer:** I plan to hit the global market (Fiv3rr/Upwork) to leverage the currency difference (earning in USD while living in BRL is a cheat code).\n   * *Strategy:* Instead of selling \"I will do n8n automation,\" I want to sell specific outcomes. E.g., \"I will build a WhatsApp AI Receptionist for Restaurants.\"\n   * *Portfolio:* I’m recording case studies of my past projects (like the Pie Shop bot) to use as video proof.\n* **3. Content Creation:** I’m reviving my YouTube channel. Not to be a \"guru,\" but to document the process. One video showing *how* I solved a specific business problem with n8n, serving as a portfolio piece to send to potential clients.\n\n**❓ My Questions for You Veterans:**\n\n1. **Fiv3rr/Upwork:** Is it still viable for beginners? I see people selling complex workflows for $50, which scares me. Is there room for high-ticket ($500+) if the offer is good?\n2. **The Skill Gap:** I’m comfortable with n8n and basic JS. What is the *one* hard skill you wish you learned earlier that gave you the biggest ROI? (SQL? Python? Sales?)\n3. **General Advice:** If you were 18 again, with time to learn but limited budget, what would you focus on in the first 30 days after quitting your day job?\n\nThanks for reading this wall of text. The content here has been a game-changer for me. Any feedback—good or bad—is appreciated!\n\n  \n\\*The text was made with the help of AI; everything is real. I just used it to make it better to read\\*",

Unfortunately the YouTube crowd dont live in the real world...automating social media, email campaigns, rag agents, etc arent what paying clients want.

I'm not sure how you'd go about leaning without direct experience. All I'll say is, expect the weird ;) I cant believe how some businesses operate in the 21st century! Dont expect clean software stacks, dont expect organised data. \n\n3 - General advice, dont quit your day job. Focus on this in your spare time. I feel like you need a reality check..the YouTubers will tell you that there is money to be made in this field, and there is - however NONE of those people make a dollar selling automation services. They are content creators, they want you hooked on their channels, they want you to click their links, join their paid groups... there have been people here who have been scammed out of thousands from these people. Dont believe a word they say. Steer clear of social media automations, you wont build these in real life, 9/10 it's going to be boring data automations. Focus on sales and building your own sales funnel, direct outreach to businesses, dont undersell yourself but dont charge stupid money for a workflow - sell a delivered project with a retainer/maintenance plan and charge per day ie $300 a day to deliver the project.",

              "text": "Man, this comment is **gold**. Thank you. It’s refreshing to hear some practical encouragement amidst the \"doom and gloom\".\n\nThe point about **Scoping** hit home hard. I definitely have a habit of looking at a project and thinking \"easy, 5 hours\" and then spending 20 hours handling edge cases and bugs. I’m going to treat Project Estimation as a core skill to learn alongside Sales, just like you suggested.\n\nI also agree 100% on the focus. My adjusted plan is to lean heavily into the Tech Company role first (since I already have the leads and the relationship) to stack those wins and case studies. Only once I have a solid folder of 'proof' will I aggressively target Upwork/Fiverr. Doing everything at once sounds like a recipe for burnout.\n\nAppreciate the push. I’m taking the shot!",

          "text": "Honestly dude, for 18 this is a solid plan. Way more coherent than what I was thinking at that age. I'll bite on your questions.\n\n1. **Fiverr/Upwork**: It's viable but brutal. The $50 gigs are a race to the bottom you can't win. Your productized approach is the only way. \"WhatsApp AI Receptionist for Restaurants\" is perfect. Price it at $500+ by showing the math: \"This saves your staff 10 hours a week of phone duty.\" You're selling an outcome, not hours. Tbh, I found better clients on LinkedIn by just posting case studies.\n\n2. **Skill Gap**: Sales. 100%. Not \"sales\" as in sleazy pitches, but learning how to discover a business's actual pain points and translate them into a technical solution. Your \"intrapreneur\" pivot is smart because it forces you into that conversation. SQL/Python are great, but communication pays the bills first.\n\n3. **First 30 days**: I'd spend it solely on building 2-3 killer public case studies (like your pie shop bot) and doing outreach. Don't get lost in tutorial hell. Start conversations with those business owner leads *immediately*.\n\nAlso, re: WhatsApp automationbeen there. Building custom flows with Evolution API is cool but can become a maintenance headache. I started using Popcorn AI for some client projects because it handles the whole commerce side inside WhatsApp, which clients love. Not perfect for everything, but it let me focus on the broader automation strategy instead of rebuilding a checkout system every time.\n\nYour biggest risk is time management after quitting. Structure your days like a real job. Good luck man, rooting for you.",

Usually, I'd agree 100%.\n​However, the internship is strictly \"manual\" labor (counting inventory, responding to DMs) with almost zero learning curve or transferable skills. Since I'm 18, living with my parents, and have very low expenses, I feel like the opportunity cost of staying there is too high.\n​I'm basically trading 30 hours a week for a small paycheck, when I could be using those 30 hours to upskill in automation and potentially earn more in the long run. If there's ever a time to take a calculated risk and potentially earn $0 for a month, I figure it's now while I have a safety net!",

O estágio (Manta), que é operacional/braçal e consome muita energia.\n2. Um contrato PJ numa empresa de Tech (Nexen), que **já paga todas** minhas despesas mensais (já que moro com os pais e tenho custo BEM baixo, so faculdade, onibus, parcela do celular, e internet, ainda sobra uns trocados so com o salario do PJ).\n\nA estratégia de sair do estágio não é para dar um tiro no escuro total, mas sim para ficar apenas com a renda da Nexen (que já é o meu \"seguro\") e usar as 6-8 horas que vão sobrar do estágio para escalar novos projetos. Ou seja, eu não vou ficar descoberto financeiramente, apenas vou trocar hora de trabalho braçal por hora de estudo/prospecção.\n\nFaz sentido pra você ou ainda acha arriscado demais mesmo considerando a idade?",

Look for restaurants, pet shops or whatever is close to you and test it there. Learn the needs of your client. Start small. Well the product and offer monthly maintenance for a fee.

Speaking at a reputable conference or organization will require a real story, about business functions and departments.
