Many servers will block or throttle direct SMTP connections, which could cause false negatives and skew your confidence scores.\n\n**Missing operational considerations:** The post doesn't address deliverability vs. validity (a mailbox can exist but reject mail), logging/audit trails for compliance, or how you're handling the Microsoft API's rate limits and authentication. For production use, you'll need monitoring, error handling, and a way to track which checks failed and why.\n\n**Better alternative framing:** Rather than positioning this as a complete replacement, consider it a *complementary tool* for low-volume verification. Commercial services handle infrastructure complexity (IP reputation, bounce management, legal compliance) that a self-hosted workflow doesn't solve—they're solving a different problem than just the technical check.",

      "text": "Just wrapped up a project for a telecom reseller in the US who works with vendors like Twilio and partners like CDW. Thought I'd share the breakdown because telecom billing automation is genuinely complex and I don't see many people talking about it specifically.\n\nTheir workflow was a mess. Everything scattered across emails, manual quote creation, spreadsheets everywhere. They were literally digging through emails to start every quote. No visibility into usage overages. No way to track margins properly. Invoicing took forever because everything was manual data entry.\n\nThey knew it was broken but didn't think automation could handle the complexity. Usage based billing mixed with subscriptions, multiple vendor tiers. Every quote needed different calculations depending on the customer, the service type, whether it was monthly or annual. They'd tried to figure it out themselves and gave up.\n\nSo I put together a detailed document showing exactly how I'd solve it. Workflow blueprints, logic diagrams, everything mapped out. Showed them how the pricing engine would work, how quotes would generate automatically, how everything would connect to their accounting system. Once they saw that, they were in.\n\n**Here's what I actually built using n8n:**\n\nWeb forms that capture leads automatically so they stop losing inquiries in email chaos. A pricing engine that calculates three tier costs... vendor to reseller to end customer, with the complex telecom billing logic baked in. It generates two different PDF quotes from one source because CDW needs annual bundled pricing while customers want detailed line items.\n\nOCR that pulls data from purchase orders and invoices straight into QuickBooks so nobody's retyping everything. Real time margin tracking so they actually know if they're making money on deals. The system also flags usage overages automatically. Before this they'd miss billable usage all the time because nobody was checking.\n\nEverything connects. Lead comes in, quote generates, customer signs, purchase order comes through, invoice creates itself, margins calculate in real time. One unified system instead of ten different tools and processes.\n\n**Stack:** n8n, Google Sheets, QuickBooks API, Avalara for tax, Gemini for OCR. Nothing exotic.\n\nThey were skeptical about Google Sheets as the CRM but once I showed them how it worked for their volume they got it. Sometimes simple is better than fancy.\n\nTook about five weeks of actual building plus two weeks of testing. Spent a week before that in multiple meetings just understanding their process. Where things broke down. What they'd already tried. That part matters more than people think. Most automation fails because people jump straight to building without really understanding what the business needs.\n\nThey're saving somewhere around fifteen to twenty hours a week. Already talking about expanding it... automated email sequences, vendor performance tracking, revenue forecasting.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the technical side, the pricing logic, or how I structured the discovery process if anyone's curious.",

A single hallucinated decimal point is a nightmare.\n​I actually got so paranoid about this exact issue when building workflows that I ended up creating a dedicated extraction engine called ParserData just to act as a safety net. It handles the dynamic vision extraction but forces strict schema validation and mathematical checks before passing the payload to the next node.\n​Still, massive props to OP for mapping out telecom billing that logic is notoriously brutal to automate!",

A plumber who missed 3 calls while under a sink and lost $2k? He'll pay for a lead capture + notification flow. A 5-person SaaS team whose support queue goes unread on weekends? They'll set up email routing in a day.What you're really describing is 'automation-ready' vs 'automation-naive' businesses. Size is just a loose proxy for that.The bigger lesson you've hit: lead with the pain, not the technology. Never say 'AI automation' to a small business owner. Say 'you'll never miss a customer again.' The businesses that need automation already know they have a problem — your job is just to connect your solution to that specific problem.",

      "text": "The past few weeks I’ve been experimenting a lot with “vibe coding” – basically working with a bunch of AI agents and just switching between them to build small experimental projects.\n\nAt first it felt super powerful, but I’ve realized it’s draining me like crazy.\n\n**My day kind of looks like this now:**  \nI have multiple windows/tabs open, I keep switching between them, and whenever I see an AI has “stopped” or is waiting, I quickly throw in a new instruction. If I’m not giving them work, I feel like I’m “wasting” compute. When they generate artifacts with errors, I either report the issue back to the AI or ask it to debug itself, again and again.\n\nA lot of what the AI produces is outside my current knowledge, so I just reply AI fast and then try to point it in some direction. I’m like a supervisor (knowing little) trying to keep every powerful agent busy than a dev actually building and learning. \n\nBy the end of the day, my brain feels tired. I’ve been “busy” for hours, but I don’t feel like I actually achieved much or leveled up my skills. It’s just constant task-switching and telling AIs what to do.\n\n**Before vibe coding, my process was very different:**  \nI would carefully design a n8n workflow, read the API docs, debug errors myself, and really understand what was going on. Every day felt like real progress and growth. When something finally worked, the sense of achievement was huge. Now it feels… shallow in comparison.\n\nI’m starting to feel that this current way of working is not sustainable. I probably can’t keep going like this for long.\n\nI think part of the problem is that AI raised my expectations way too fast. Now I expect to build a brand-new website with a backend in two days, even though before AI I never would’ve thought that was realistic for me.\n\n**So I’m changing my approach:**\n\n* Slowing down my pace\n* Sticking with one main task instead of juggling 5 AI “personas”\n* When the AI is thinking or generating, I don’t rush to another window — I stay with the same task and think more deeply about the problem, the architecture, the edge cases, etc.\n\nThis has already made me feel a lot calmer. I get more time for deep thinking, I actually understand more, and the output quality is higher. It feels less like “herding AIs” and more like actually building something again.\n\nCurious if anyone else has gone through this with vibe coding / agent workflows?  \nHow do you balance using AI aggressively without burning out or losing the feeling of real progress?",

      "text": "n8n recently shipped \"AI Workflow Builder\" ([https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/)) where you describe what you want in plain English and it generates the workflow for you.\n\nZapier launched Agents in beta doing essentially the same thing. OpenAI dropped AgentKit with a visual agent builder at DevDay. And n8n 2.0 now lets you turn any workflow into a \"tool\" that an AI agent can call on its own when it decides it needs to.\n\nThe direction is pretty clear. \\~Two years from now, most people won't be dragging nodes around a canvas. They'll describe what they want and an agent will build it, test it, and probably fix it when it breaks.\n\nSo what actually happens to the skill of building automations? Right now knowing how to wire up a webhook to a database to an API is valuable because it's hard enough that most people can't do it. But if a prompt gets you 80% of the way there, does the remaining 20% become the only thing that matters? Things like knowing which edge cases will break in production, understanding rate limits, designing error handling that doesn't silently fail.\n\nI keep going back and forth on this. Part of me thinks the \"automation builder\" role just shifts from construction to architecture. You stop being the person who builds the workflow and start being the person who knows what the right workflow even is. The other part of me looks at how fast these tools are improving and wonders if even that gets automated away.\n\nCurious where you all land on this. Are you already using the AI builder features in your daily work? Has it actually replaced manual building for you or is it more of a starting point you still heavily edit?",

On their own it's going to be people like you still.\n\nI find it fun to vibe code/automate/ build things but there is still some complexity behind it that most people aren't going to take the time to figure out\n\n e.g supabase has 4 separate API keys took me like a hour my first time to figure out which one just view which ones edit rows etc.\n\nLet alone just building a process in general in my recent project I was uploading like 50+ ranging from 2-50mb each compressed folders and n8n would crash with to much data so had to figure out the loop node then the code node would crash with to much data figure out the set node getting it to filter correctly and update correctly I'm not smart but I'm not dumb either still took me like 3 days with all the crashes and errors and changing the flow to get it functional. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is long story short is I don't think much well change because \n1) people are lazy would rather pay someone to do \n2) people trust others who are experts or know more \n3) if they do start I bet alot give up after the first 3 failures and having to restart \n4) some people already don't trust AI let alone trust it enough to fully build something for their/a company that involves sensitive data or any data in general really\n5) alot of AI don't like you posting API keys in them at least that I have seen/done Gemini and open ai both would say delete the key you pasted it here it's exposed (I have to assume that they would fix that but well that be public then? Well that be used to train new models still?) \n\nJust my opinion I'm a landscaper personally I just like to build things for fun just started a few months ago just something to do after work.\nI personally plan to experiment around with n8ns Agent soon just to see what it's all about",

That's the kind of stuff no AI prompt is going to solve for you because you don't even know what to ask until you're already stuck. And yeah, 3 days of crashes and flow changes to handle large file uploads is exactly the gap between \"AI built me a workflow\" and \"I have a workflow that actually works\".   \n  \nI guess the real solution long term is agent-to-agent communication. Like Supabase has its own agent, n8n has its own agent, and they just talk to each other. The n8n agent asks the Supabase agent which key it needs, gets the right permissions, configures the connection. No more digging through docs for an hour. We're not fully there yet but that's clearly where it's heading.   \n  \nAlso respect for doing this after landscaping shifts, that's a solid hobby upgrade.",

Clients don't pay for the speed; they pay for the guarantee and reliability.\n\nAI may be amazing at creating sophisticated workflows but it does not replace the learned experience and intuition of an expert that ***knows*** where it could go wrong.\n\nAlso this may seem ironic since I needed AI's assistance in writing this comment but I simply used it to refine my analogy and then that's where I added my personal touch.",

I’m at the point where I want to transition from just \"tinkering\" to actually making good money as an automation consultant/developer.\n\n​For those of you already successfully billing clients or running a business around n8n: What is the roadmap to high-ticket mastery?\n\n​I’d love to get your insights on:\n\n​Essential Tech Stack: Beyond n8n, what are the \"must-have\" tools? (e.g., PostgreSQL for data persistence, Supabase, Docker for scaling, or specific APIs like OpenAI/Anthropic?)\n\n​High-Value Skills: What specific tasks are clients actually willing to pay a premium for? (Is it complex CRM migrations, custom API wrappers, AI-driven agents, or something else?)\n\n​The \"Secret Sauce\": Are there specific programming languages that take your workflows to the next level? I’m assuming JavaScript/TypeScript for Function nodes is a given, but what else?\n\n​Business Model: Do you find more success with project-based builds, monthly maintenance retainers, or building \"Automation-as-a-Service\" products?\n\n​I'm ready to put in the work, I just want to make sure I'm practicing the right scales. Any advice, \"gotchas,\" or resources you wish you knew when you started would be massive.\n\n​Thanks in advance! 🛠️",

      "text": "I want to share the one type of automation I’ll never build or sell again:\n\n**Standalone, self-hosted custom software** for a single client (think custom CRM, custom chatbot, or micro-SaaS just for them).\n\nIt sounds profitable on paper. In reality? It’s a **maintenance nightmare.**\n\nHere’s what I learned the hard way:\n\nThe problem with standalone custom software\n\nWhen you sell one of these:\n\nYou’re not just selling a build\n\nYou’re accidentally selling lifetime responsibility\n\n* APIs change.\n* Integrations break.\n* Security updates are needed.\n* Auth methods expire.\n* Databases need care.\n* Logs need watching.\n* Infrastructure needs patching.\n\nAnd every time something breaks…\n\nyou’re the one they call.\n\n\n\n# My CRM disaster\n\nI once built a custom CRM automation for a shitty CRM called SuperOffice:\n\n* Connected to the CRM platform via API\n* Synced with Airtable\n* Had custom logic\n* Ran on the client cloud (Azure)\n\n\n\nWhat happened:\n\n**APIs started failing**\n\n* Airtable sent constant error notifications\n* Random edge cases popped up\n* Customer expected fixes… forever\n\nAnd the real mistake?\n\n👉 I didn't charge maintenance fees.\n\nSo I eventually had to tell them:\n\n“I can’t maintain this anymore, or we need to get paid for maintenance (they refused cuz the project cost a lot.”\n\nNow I no longer maintain it, and the client started ghosting me, and I just burned my cards with them due to bad expectation management.  \n\n\nAlso, this is the part nobody talks about enough.\n\nWhen you host:\n\nYou’re responsible for:\n\n* Server updates\n* Library vulnerabilities\n* Auth security\n* API key storage\n* Data protection\n* Downtime\n* Logs\n* Backups\n\n\n\nThat’s not “automation work.”\n\nThat’s software operations.  \n\n\n**And clients don’t want to pay SaaS-level prices…**\n\n**…but expect SaaS-level reliability.**\n\n\n\nWhy this model breaks **at scale**\n\nLet’s say you get:\n\n**10 clients**\n\nEach pays maintenance\n\nEach system is unique\n\n\n\nNow you have:\n\n* 10 workflows and databases\n* 10 infra configs\n* 10 potential failure modes\n* 10 different clients pinging you\n\n>even if you're taking 200$ for the 10 customers, that's 2000, but then also all of these could fail at the same time. If you're by yourself, you cannot get new customers and add them to this loop unless you need to hire somebody and just keep paying them to manage these servers.  And at this rate, you cannot hire full-time employees because you cannot afford them, so you end up hiring some shitty developer from Upwork who's unreliable and they bail on you at the time of need...\n\n\n\n**What I do now instead**\n\nI changed my offer completely:\n\nI now:\n\n* Build automations inside their stack\n* Deploy on their infra (or SaaS tools they own)\n* Train their team\n* Provide:\n   * Docs\n   * Debug help\n   * Limited guidance for their team, no maintenance support (ex: 5h/month)\n\n\n\nSo:\n\n* They own it\n* They maintain it\n* I support strategically\n* I don’t babysit systems forever\n* Much more sustainable.\n\n\n\n**My rule going forward**\n\nI will never again:\n\n❌ Build standalone micro-SaaS for a single client\n\n❌ Host custom apps for them\n\n❌ Be responsible for their infra long-term\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Custom standalone automations = hidden SaaS business\n* Without SaaS pricing\n* Without SaaS team\n* Without SaaS margins\n\n\n\nIf you’re selling automations:\n\nLearn from this before you build your first “custom CRM” for €2k and regret it 😅\n\nHappy to hear if others made the same mistake or am I the dumbass in this story...

I use it to host an automation suite like ui path. \n\nIn theory I will be self hosting, but I don't see how the infrastructure becomes such an issue as security and updates and patching will be standard Microsoft updates.\n\nManaging API keys and credentials will be done within ui paths credential store. \n\nI guess my plan may differ in that my goal is to find clients who don't self host and basically run their entire company remotely. This means all their work is Internet facing which makes automation it within my environment feasible.\n\nI see the issues you ran into and this is something I've thought about a lot, thanks for sharing. \n\nI'm thinking of self hosting a server and managing as many automations as I can from it. I specifically want to avoid onsite customers. \n\nBut I will not connect to their systems or host their local apps. It'll limit business but that's ok.",

      "text": "For two years, our operations team ran on duct tape.\n\n\n\nEvery morning, someone had to:\n\n\n\n• Run a Google Apps Script to pull shift data\n\n• Export a CSV from one system\n\n• Import it into another\n\n• Manually check for conflicts\n\n• Send out the daily assignments\n\nMiss a step? Everything downstream breaks. Person on holiday? Hope they left good notes.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't anyone's fault. The system grew organically. One script here, one CSV export there. Before you know it, you've got 45 minutes of manual clicking that nobody fully understands anymore.\n\n\n\nWhat broke it\n\n\n\nThe person who wrote most of the Apps Scripts left. Documentation was... sparse. Suddenly we're reverse-engineering JavaScript from 2019 trying to figure out why the shift assignments aren't matching the availability sheet.\n\n\n\nThat's when I thought: what if this just ran itself?\n\n\n\nThe 8 workflows\n\n\n\n1. Availability sync — Pulls staff availability from our HR system every night. No more CSV exports.\n\n2. Shift requirement calculator — Looks at bookings for each location, calculates how many people we need and when.\n\n3. Auto-assignment — Matches available staff to required shifts based on location, role, and hours. Draft schedule ready by 5am.\n\n4. Conflict checker — Flags double-bookings, overtime issues, or people scheduled during requested time off. Runs before anything gets published.\n\n5. Schedule publisher — Pushes the approved schedule to our team app. Everyone sees their week without someone manually updating a shared calendar.\n\n6. Swap request handler.  Staff can request shift swaps. Workflow checks if it's valid, notifies the other person, updates the schedule if both agree.\n\n7. No-show alert - If someone hasn't checked in 15 minutes after shift start, manager gets a ping. Simple but saved us twice already.\n\n8. Weekly hours reconciliation that compares scheduled hours vs actual, flags discrepancies before payroll.\n\nWhat's different now\n\n\n\nNobody runs scripts manually anymore. Nobody imports CSVs. Nobody spends their first hour playing Tetris with a spreadsheet.\n\n\n\nThe ops coordinator who used to own the morning routine now focuses on actual problems — short-staffed days, training gaps, site issues. The mechanical stuff just happens.\n\n\n\nThe biggest lesson learned\n\n\n\nEarly on, I used n8n's built-in Google Sheets nodes. Seemed obvious right? we're reading and writing sheets, use the Sheets node.\n\n\n\n**BIG Mistake.**\n\n\n\nThe integrated nodes were flaky. Random timeout issues, weird edge cases with formatting, inconsistent behaviour with larger datasets. I spent more time debugging node quirks than actual logic problems.\n\n\n\nEventually I ripped them out and switched to raw HTTP requests against the Google Sheets API.  This is my **PRO-TIP -** steer clear of integrated nodes if they're not doing what you need.  A properly defined http request is much better for exploring an API. \n\n\n\nNight and day difference. More reliable, more control, better error handling. I could see exactly what was being sent and returned.\n\n\n\nPro tip: If you're building anything serious in n8n, don't assume the integrated nodes are your best option. HTTP Request nodes talking directly to APIs are often more comprehensive and way more predictable. The integrated nodes are convenient for quick stuff, but when reliability matters, go direct.\n\n\n\nWould I do it again?\n\n\n\nImmediately. The old system was a single point of failure disguised as \"how we've always done it.\" Now there's version control, error logs, and I can actually see what's happening.\n\n\n\nPlus I don't get panicked calls when someone's on holiday and forgot to run the script.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with n8n. If you're replacing janky Apps Scripts with proper workflows, happy to compare notes.\n\n",

One-off, no-memory/no-context stuff.\n\nMy experience: I tell Claude Code to build an n8n automation tool that replaces Fyxer, saving me money every month. This includes an Anthropic AI integration so AI is calling itself after some algorithm stuff and guardrails. Then I have it synchronize various manual business processes in minutes that would've taken me a week to code. All the while any code is written in my preferred language, in my style, using reference libraries from my Git repo that've been in my code for years. None of the final project uses AI, but the code itself is easily maintained in there.\n\nThe latter is lifechanging. I still need to review, troubleshoot, and sometimes stop and redirect AI from going down a rabbit hole. But, the bullsh\\*t is just gone. I'm getting stuff done in minutes that would normally be a very late night after the normal work day is done.\n\n",

Claude Code edits and builds n8n Workflows which use Anthropic's API to classify email. All additions took about 15 minutes with some testing.

Done.\n\n **Catch-All Verification** — This is the one nobody else does right. While other tools mark catch-all domains as \"unknown\" and leave you guessing, Tomba actually verifies them. That's 30-40% of B2B emails other tools just… skip.\n\n **LinkedIn Enrichment** — Pull contact data straight from LinkedIn profiles. No more copy-pasting between 5 tabs.\n\n**📱 Phone Finder** — Yes, mobile numbers too. In the same workflow.\n\n **Email Verifier** — 97%+ accuracy. Not \"we think it's valid\" — actually verified.\n\nAnd the price? Tomba starts at a fraction of what you'd pay for Snov, Apollo, or Hunter for the same volume.\n\nNow connect that to n8n and you've got:\n\n→ Lead scraping → enrichment → verification → CRM push → All automated. All in one flow. No code.\n\nThe kicker? We tested Tomba head-to-head against 6 major competitors. **81.9% valid email discovery vs. the next best at 75.2%.** Most sat under 50%.\n\n  \nReal data. Same input. No human touch. Full transparency.\n\nWe ran a head-to-head test using the same 5000-line input file across multiple email-finding tools. No manual cleanup. No tweaks. Just raw results exported as full sheets.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1QhhHadxscI\\_3YcUBlKyHIpMPiwsulU53euK1-9u8Ed4/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1QhhHadxscI_3YcUBlKyHIpMPiwsulU53euK1-9u8Ed4/edit)\n\nIf you're building outbound workflows in n8n and you're NOT using Tomba, you're literally paying more for worse data.\n\nGo plug it in. Thank me later. 🚀\n\n  \nGitHub link [https://github.com/tomba-io/n8n-nodes-tomba](https://github.com/tomba-io/n8n-nodes-tomba)",

SMTP probing connects to the mail server to verify if the specific recipient exists without sending a full email. These build on MX checks for more thorough validation.\n\n## Syntax Validation\nUse regex to catch obvious errors like missing @ or invalid characters before deeper checks.\n\n- Basic regex: `r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'`\n- Python example:\n  ```\n  import re\n  regex = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$')\n  def is_valid_syntax(email):\n\n      return bool(regex.match(email))\n  ```\n\n  This flags invalid formats like \"user@.com\" but passes \"user@example.com\".\n\nLibraries like `email-validator` (`pip install email-validator`) handle edge cases better:\n\n```\n\nfrom email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError\ntry:\n    validate_email('test@example.com')\nexcept EmailNotValidError:\n    pass\n```\n\n## SMTP Probing\nConnect to the MX server (port 25), simulate SMTP commands (EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO), and check the response code (250 = accepts recipient).\n\n- Python example (requires `dnspython` and `smtplib`):\n\n  ```\n  import smtplib\n  import dns.resolver\n  import socket\n\n  def smtp_probe(email):\n      domain = email.split('@')\n      mx_records = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, 'MX')\n      for mx in sorted(mx_records, key=lambda x: x.preference):\n          try:\n              mx_host = str(mx.exchange).rstrip('.')\n              server = smtplib.SMTP(timeout=10)\n              server.set_debuglevel(0)\n              server.connect(mx_host, 25)\n              server.helo('example.com')\n              server.mail('test@example.com')\n              code, _ = server.rcpt(email)\n              server.quit()\n              if code == 250:\n                  return True\n          except:\n              continue\n      return False\n  ```\n\n  Returns True if any MX accepts the RCPT TO.\n\n## Best Practices\nLayer checks: syntax > MX > SMTP probing; use timeouts to avoid hangs. SMTP probing risks blacklisting if overused, so limit rate (e.g., 1/sec) or use APIs like ZeroBounce. Always follow with double-opt-in emails for confirmation.",

Whether it is building a social media generation and scheduling engine or a system to scrape data from PDFs and Gmail for weekly client reports, the foundational problem I see is always the same.\n\nFounders view automation as a magic solution to a disorganized business. They believe that writing a script or deploying an agent will somehow fix a fundamentally broken process. This is a delusion. Automation does not create order. It only accelerates whatever process already exists. If your manual workflow is chaotic, automating it will simply generate chaos at scale.\n\nI see founders asking for complex AI workflows for ideation and content generation before they have even proven their content actually converts. I see businesses trying to automate data tracking and reporting when they do not even know what metrics matter to their clients. They want the code to make the difficult strategic decisions for them. Code cannot do that. Code only executes logic. If your underlying business logic is flawed, the output will just be faster garbage.\n\nBefore you spend a single dollar on automation you must map every step of your manual process. You must execute it by hand until the outcome is entirely predictable and profitable. Only then do you introduce code to remove the friction.\n\nAutomation is not a strategy. It is a utility. It exists strictly to buy back your time. Stop looking for software to run your business for you. Fix your broken systems in reality first, and only then use code to make them invisible.",

It means you haven’t figured out the logic yet. You’re still discovering it through trial and error.\n\nWhen you automate an undiscovered process, you don’t get consistency. You get a locked-in version of whatever logic you happened to code on the day you built it. Now it’s consistent AND wrong, and changing it costs you three times as much as the original build.\n\nThe test I use before recommending anyone automate anything: can you write down every step, every decision point, and every edge case in 15 minutes? If you hesitate on any of it, the process isn’t ready. You’re still learning it.\n\nRun it manually until it’s boring. Until you’re annoyed that you have to do it again. That’s when you automate, not because the automation will improve the process, but because the process no longer needs your attention to run correctly.\n\nThe irony is that the founders who are most desperate for automation are always the ones whose processes would break it immediately.",

      "text": "I wanted to share my honest feedback as I’ve been using n8n for a while in workflows and thought I’d give a try at a n8n review. I’ll try to cover what I personally liked, what I think are some upsides and downsides of using it.\n\nMy overall impression is that n8n is definitely a powerhouse. Feature-wise, it’s probably one of the most complete workflow automation tools I’ve tested. Looking at the comparison, it checks almost every box - visual builder, audit trails, secrets management, scalability, logs, EU hosting, no training on customer data, error handling, integrations, triggers, scheduling.\n\nThat said, I would not call it beginner friendly. I think it sits somewhere between a full developer tool and a no-code automation platform, which is both a blessing and a curse and what I personally consider both its strength and weakness.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Flexibility.** This is where n8n really shines in my opinion. While it does offer templates, they’re not the core focus. You’re not boxed into restrictive setups like with some other automation tools - you can add custom JavaScript logic, work directly with APIs, and build fairly complex workflows with conditions, branching and retries.  If you’re self-hosting, you gain even more control over your own data and infrastructure, and you can manage costs more directly.\n* **Scalability.** When you understand how n8n works, you can scale it incredibly well. It supports logs, audit trails, error handling, event triggers and scheduling - so it’s clearly built for more serious use cases. You can build internal tools on top of it, automate high-volume processes and avoid the ceilings that simpler tools might hit. It scales beautifully for technical teams.\n* **Infrastructure & compliance.** With secrets management, EU hosting options and a no-training-on-customer-data approach, it checks important boxes for teams that care about governance and control.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Steep learning curve.** Let’s not kid ourselves - even though it has a visual builder, if you’re not a technical person, it’s still a steep learning curve. It assumes you understand APIs, logic flows and how systems connect. Error handling is there and quite robust, but the way errors surface isn’t always obvious if you’re new. You might still find yourself trying to understand what went wrong.\n* **UI.** It is decent for small workflows, but once things get bigger, the UI can feel more cluttered and I find it harder to debug visually.\n\nAnother downside is also that if you self-host, you’re the sole person responsible for keeping things running smoothly, handling updates and security patches. That gives control, but it also adds responsibility.\n\nFor sure there are more pros and cons, but I wanted to keep this n8n review somewhat concise and to the point, as well as highlight the things that impressed me and discouraged me personally.\n\nSo, for me n8n makes sense if you want customization, maximum control, are quite a technical person and are comfortable with technical concepts. Also, if you’re building or want to build high-volume, complex workflows.\n\nWhere it falls through a bit is accessibility to a wider team. It’s not super quick to master and it’s not the most polished tool compared to some others. At least that’s from what I’ve tested.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve also been looking into alternatives for [best workflow automation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopAutomationTools/comments/1qukmiw/best_ai_workflow_automation_tools/), especially for more AI-driven cases. Tools like Zapier or nexos.ai seem to prioritize clarity and speed over deep infrastructure wiring. While you may give up some flexibility and control compared to n8n, you may gain ease of use - and with nexos.ai especially, a more AI-native and no-code oriented approach.\n\nI am curious how others feel about n8n and do you agree with my n8n review? Are you using it alongside other tools, standalone or have switched to alternatives like nexos.ai, Zapier or similar?",

This however may not a design decision of n8n but a consequence on depending on external services and how they work.\n\nThen again, I am still a beginner regarding n8n. Right now I am working on building a safe n8n server with proper SSL and reverse proxies and everything.\n\nNot even thinking about AI right now.",
