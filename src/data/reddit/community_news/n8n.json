If you do not hit those usage minimums, they will just delete your instance and send you an email with no chance to backup or anything. I would highly recommend setting up a SSH backup script to grab your SQLite file of your entire n8n instance and encryption key so that you can restore your n8n instance into another docker instance if that happens to you.",

I automated it.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI was doing competitive intelligence research and manually collecting employee data was killing me. Visiting hundreds of profiles one by one? No thanks.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Input a single company name (e.g., \"Salesforce\", \"HubSpot\", \"Stripe\")\n\n\\* Finds the company's LinkedIn profile automatically\n\n\\* Pulls ALL employee LinkedIn URLs from that company\n\n\\* Enriches each profile in batches of 10 with full details\n\n\\* Saves everything to Google Sheets with name, title, email, phone, location, skills, headline, and experience\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take days of manual research now runs completely automated. Process 100-500+ employees per company while you sleep.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInput: \"Salesforce\"\n\n\\- Results: 500+ enriched employee profiles in automated batches\n\n\\- Data retrieved: Full names, job titles, verified emails, direct phone numbers, locations, LinkedIn profiles, skills lists, professional headlines\n\n\\- Output: Complete database in Google Sheets ready for analysis\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The workflow runs in batches:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Company Discovery\\*\\* – Converts company name to LinkedIn URL\n\n2. \\*\\*Employee Extraction\\*\\* – Pulls complete employee list from company page\n\n3. \\*\\*Batch Enrichment\\*\\* – Processes employees in groups of 10 with 2-second delays\n\n4. \\*\\*Database Building\\*\\* – Saves enriched profiles to Google Sheets automatically\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Competitive intelligence teams mapping competitor org structures\n\n\\* Sales teams building targeted prospect lists by company\n\n\\* Recruiters creating talent pools from specific companies\n\n\\* Market researchers analyzing team composition and growth\n\n\\* Business development identifying decision-makers at target accounts\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with companies ranging from 100 to 500+ employees.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow7032.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow7032.json)",

      "text": "I recently spoke with N8N about an on-premise license. I like the product and what the team is building, but the business model genuinely confused me.\n\nThe Community Edition (source-available / fair-code license) allows unlimited executions when self-hosted. The paid on-prem license, however, introduces execution and workload limits — even though customers already pay for hardware, electricity, networking, and operations. Paying more but getting less doesn’t make sense.\n\nLicense restrictions are fine — limited workloads are not. A paid version should never reduce core capabilities compared to the free version. Paid should always equal Free + More.\n\nA more logical model would cap the number of workflows, active plugins, or reserve advanced plugins for higher tiers — not executions in a self-hosted setup.\n\nI also found multiple Reddit threads/users who reverted to the Community Edition, not because Pro is bad, but because the licensing constraints feel arbitrary.\n\nN8N has a strong product and community. Revisiting the on-prem licensing model could significantly improve trust and adoption.\n\nExample, we've been using [Thingsboard.io](http://Thingsboard.io) more than 10 years now for our IoT Deployments. the tiered license makes sense, the perks you get by paying makes sense.\n\nAnyone here facing the same with N8N?",

      "text": "I wanted to share something interesting I’ve been noticing while working on a small automation project.\n\nI built an n8n automation to handle Google reviews end to end. Initially, this was just an experiment to see if the workflow even made sense in the real world.\n\nBut what surprised me was how receptive Indian businesses have been to this idea.\n\nA lot of local businesses here genuinely want a structured way to manage reviews. Not to fake anything, but to avoid chaos. Missed reviews, unmanaged negative feedback, and no time to reply consistently are very common problems.\n\nHere’s what the system does in simple terms:\n\nCustomers are asked for feedback through a link.\n\nIf the rating is 3 stars or below, the feedback is stored privately so the business can address it internally.\n\nIf the rating is 4 or 5 stars, the customer is guided to leave a public review on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nOn top of that:\n\nIt tracks who clicks the review link and who doesn’t\n\nKeeps everything logged in one place\n\nAutomatically replies to new Google reviews using AI\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many Indian business owners don’t want more tools, dashboards, or complexity. They want something that quietly works in the background and improves their online reputation without daily effort.\n\nI can’t speak much about how foreign businesses would react to this, but locally, there’s genuine interest and adoption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/636a4qc31aeg1.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=be305629b3c148d1529f337219b81486d676b4c9\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone else seeing similar behavior in their region?\n\nAre there any obvious downsides or ethical concerns I should think about?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives.\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants, I can also break down how the workflow is built in n8n.",

For outreach, I’ve chained this kind of flow into Instantly and Apollo; Pulse for Reddit plus Phantombuster has been nice for testing similar audience capture on Reddit/Twitter without drowning in noise.\n\nSo yeah: move from “cool scrape” to “clean, queryable pipeline” and this becomes a serious asset.",

It was a hassle.\n\nThat frustration led me to build **n8n Desktop** — a native, self-contained app packaged with **Tauri**. Now I can ditch Docker and have a truly click-and-run experience.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Self-contained installer**: The app **automatically downloads and sets up** the required Node.js runtime and n8n resources on first launch. No manual dependency deployment needed — it handles everything for you.\n* **Native & Lightweight**: Built with Tauri/Rust, it's tiny and uses minimal system resources.\n* **Runs offline**: Your workflows and data stay on your machine. Perfect for self-hosted enthusiasts.\n* **Auto-start on boot** (configurable): Keeps your workflows always running.\n\n**Direct Download Links (v1.0.1):**\n\n* **Windows (.exe)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe)\n* **macOS - Apple Silicon (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)\n* **macOS - Intel (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64.dmg)\n\n**Important Installation Notes:**\n\n1. **For Windows Users**: I only have a Mac for development, so **the Windows version is untested**. Please use it at your own discretion and report any issues you encounter!\n2. **For macOS Users**: Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer account, you may see a “damaged” error on first launch. To fix this:\n   * Open **Terminal**.\n   * Copy and paste the following command, then press **Enter**: bashsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/n8n-desktop.app\n   * Enter your **administrator password** (it won‘t show as you type) and press **Enter** again.\n   * You should now be able to open the app normally from your Applications folder.\n\n**Source Code & All Builds:**\n\n* **GitHub Release Page**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1)\n* **Main Repository**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop) (Stars and feedback are welcome!)\n\n**Screenshot of the app:**  \n[https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app\\_screen\\_short.png](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app_screen_short.png)\n\n**Why Tauri?** I chose Tauri over Electron for its superior performance and smaller bundle size. The core is still the fantastic n8n, but now it feels like a true desktop citizen.\n\nThis is an open-source side project I use daily. I'd love to get your feedback, bug reports, or contributions.\n\n",

      "text": "I started studying automation in January of last year to work for a friend who accepted a marketing position but knew nothing about automation and needed to use it every day.\n\nI spent about 3 months with him doing this type of service, studying, learning, and applying. After 3 months, I made a mass mailing incorrectly, and instead of sending emails to 1000 leads, I sent them to about 50,000. The loss was quite high, and my friend wasn't very happy with the company anymore and ended up leaving after this mishap.\n\nI have ADHD and use cannabis, so lack of concentration is something that bothers me a bit during the day. So I created a checklist to prevent problems like this from happening again (so far, it's working). When I left that company, I thought about selling AI agents, and that's exactly what I did. I got a law firm to pay for my service, and I've had that contract active ever since. It's an AI agent for customer service and appointment scheduling that closes about 25 clients on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had much success working on a contract basis because I'm not a very good salesperson, and people in my city don't value that kind of service very much. Because of that, I had to look for a job.\n\nLast October I started a full-time job at an English language school. The pay is reasonable, and I learn a lot every day. So far, I've implemented an agent to assist students who have problems with the platform, an AI agent to respond to WhatsApp leads, and several HR automations, from candidate analysis to the entire hiring process that was previously done manually. I'm very happy with the service delivery; I've already managed to save about 830 hours of work per month that previously required a person to be available to do.\n\nI see many people here wondering if it's possible to make money with automation, and the answer is yes. You'll hardly make money selling workflows, but it's a very valuable service that companies are only now starting to seek. Selling services didn't work out the first time, but I'm already working on my second attempt this year, and I think everything will work out. If you are technically good and dedicated to delivering a quality service that will make a difference, there's certainly a place for you in the market.",

Now, AI classifies resumes according to HR criteria and generates a score. If it's below 7, it's disqualified; if it's above, it moves on to the next phase.\n\nThere are 5 hiring stages: scheduling group interviews, individual interviews, tests, documentation, company culture presentation, and training. There are other automations that send templates for candidates to follow through these stages.\n\nSending you a template won't help because everything is very personalized. What I advise you to do is sit down with the department for 2 days and see everything they do, create a document, and then spend at least 1 week trying to think of ways to automate it. It will definitely work. If you are having difficulties with any specific process, you can contact me privately.",

There’s no nice, user‑friendly interface out of the box.Right now my options are basically hack together forms that hit n8n webhooks, build small custom dashboards in React / Retool / Bubbl, or manually trigger things for them in the n8n UI (which obviously doesn’t scale). None of these feel great.Unless I am missing something. \n\nSo I’m curious how you all are handling this in practice. \n\nThanks in advance.",

So we made it agentic, where the agent orchestrates the nodes. The agent has some instructions to do this.\n\n\\- Then the next reality we discovered was exactly this. Most users don't interact with n8n because the UI doesn't work for consumers. You need to do the bulk iterative work and populate the outcome in a google sheet. But there needs to be some follow up actions which you may wanna perform on some select rows. We realized that our agentic approach already has the foundations for this. And we are currently solving this.\n\nI would love to share the solution with you and get some feedback",

It works but becomes a second full-time job maintaining it, and clients still get confused. Honestly felt like I was building two systems: one to do the work, and another to let people use it.\n\nWhat finally clicked for me was using a platform specifically designed for client delivery. I’ve been trying CoordinateHQ lately—it gives clients a simple portal to view progress and trigger certain workflow steps without seeing any of the backend n8n complexity. They just get an email link, no passwords. It’s not a perfect fit for every use case but it cut out like 80% of my manual hand-holding.\n\nMight be worth looking at something similar if you’re spending too much time on the interface layer.

Not anymore.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIf you're in B2B sales, companies posting certain job titles are gold – they're actively investing in specific areas. I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire research process from LinkedIn job posts to enriched contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Scrapes LinkedIn for companies posting specific job titles (e.g., \"Customer Success Manager\", \"DevOps Engineer\")\n\n\\* Extracts company names from job postings and deduplicates the list\n\n\\* Enriches each company with verified websites, direct phone numbers, company emails, and employee counts\n\n\\* Outputs complete sales intelligence to Google Sheets with hiring signals attached\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 3-4 hours of manual research now runs automatically. I can process 40-50 companies in 4-6 minutes with complete contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"Sales Development Representative\" + \"San Francisco\" + last 7 days\n\n\\- Results: 47 companies enriched in \\~5 minutes. Each record includes company website, phone, email, employee count, job titles they're hiring for, and LinkedIn profile\n\n\\- The workflow marks each with a hiring signal (\"Hiring 3 positions\") so you know their investment level\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*SaaS sales teams\\*\\* – Find companies hiring SDRs/AEs (they're investing in growth = need your sales tools)\n\n\\* \\*\\*DevOps/Infrastructure vendors\\*\\* – Target companies posting DevOps/SRE roles (they're scaling infrastructure)\n\n\\* \\*\\*HR tech providers\\*\\* – Identify companies with multiple open positions (recruiting pain points)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Recruitment agencies\\*\\* – Build targeted lists of companies actively hiring in specific verticals\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 50-100+ companies per run. Google Sheets trigger means you just add a row with your search criteria and it runs automatically.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json)",
