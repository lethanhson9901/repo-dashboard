      "text": "I spent a year **brute-forcing** my way through n8n, thinking the goal was to build the \"coolest\" AI agents as fast as possible. I was wrong. If I were starting over today, I’d do it completely differently to avoid the \"crisis of meaning\" where everything breaks and you want to quit.\n\nHere is the step-by-step framework to go from a beginner to a professional Automation Engineer.\n\n**1. Stop Starting with AI**\n\nThe biggest mistake is trying to run before you can walk. **Do not start with AI; start with workflows**.\n\n• **Deterministic Workflows:** These are rule-based and predictable. You know the inputs, you know the outputs, and they run the same way every time.\n\n• **The ROI is in the \"Boring\" Stuff:** Standard workflow automation alone can deliver **30% to 200% ROI** in the first year and save 25% to 40% in labor costs. Most small businesses don't even have these basics in place yet.\n\n**2. Master the \"Technical Trinity\"**\n\nYou need to stop guessing and start knowing how data moves. There are three technical pillars you must master:\n\n• **JSON & Data Types:** This is the language of automation. It’s not \"code\"—it’s just **pairs of keys and values** (like Color: Blue, Size: Medium). Once you can read JSON, you can navigate any data structure.\n\n• **APIs & HTTP Requests:** This is the **most important skill** you will ever learn. Native n8n nodes are just \"pre-packaged\" HTTP requests. If you learn how to read API documentation, you can connect n8n to **any platform**, even if a native node doesn't exist yet.\n\n• **Webhooks:** Learn how to let other tools trigger your workflows in real-time (like a form submission or a new Slack message) rather than having n8n \"check\" for updates.\n\n**3. Learn \"Context Engineering\" (Not Just Prompting)**\n\nLLMs don't know your business or your clients; they are just predicting the next word.\n\n• **Prompting vs. Context:** Prompting is telling the model what to do. **Context Engineering** is giving the model the \"subject matter expertise\" it needs to think correctly.\n\n• **The Cheat Sheet Analogy:** A system prompt is like studying the night before an exam, but **good context is like having a cheat sheet during the exam**. Always provide the \"cheat sheet\" (data/details) at the exact moment the AI needs it.\n\n**4. Think Like a Process Engineer (Sharpen the Axe)**\n\nMost people jump straight into the n8n canvas and start dragging nodes, which leads to messy, fragile workflows.\n\n• **Map it on Paper First:** If you can’t explain a process on paper, you can’t automate it.\n\n• **The Four Pillars:** Only automate tasks that are **Repetitive, Time-consuming, Error-prone, or Scalable**.\n\n• **The 6-Hour Rule:** To paraphrase Lincoln, if you have six hours to chop down a tree, spend the first four **sharpening the axe** (planning the process).\n\n**5. Escape \"Tutorial Hell\"**\n\nYou cannot learn automation by watching videos; you have to get your hands dirty.\n\n• **The 15-Node Rule:** About **90% of all workflows** rely on the same 15 core nodes. Master those (If nodes, Loops, etc.), and you can build almost anything.\n\n• **Fail Fast:** Your first version **will break**. Build Proof of Concepts (POCs) and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), break them on purpose, and use the failure as data to build \"guard rails\".\n\n• **Audit Logs:** Feed your execution data into a Google Sheet or Airtable to find patterns in errors and ensure your system stays stable over time.\n\n**6. Sell ROI, Not Nodes**\n\nIf you want to turn this into a business, stop using tech jargon like \"JSON\" or \"Agentic workflows\" with clients. They don't care.\n\n• **The Three Things Clients Care About:** Time saved, money saved, and better quality work.\n\n• **Collect Data:** Once a system is live, track its performance. Showing a client real numbers after three months is how you build a long-term partnership rather than just being a \"builder\".\n\n**The bottom line:** Master the boring, rule-based fundamentals first. Once those are stable, \"sprinkle\" in AI to handle decisions. That is how you build systems that actually last.",

I am a college student trying to get a degree in Physics but i have always been into AI and automation businesses so i decided to buy a course on Udemy which i saw so far was the best option and i am glad that i bought it cause it is super useful. I am currently hosting n8n on Hostinger and i definitely agree with you understanding JSON, Data Manipulation, APIs etc. is a must and since i started my journey on n8n and i figured all of it by myself which is a “win” for me i guess. My question to you is sometimes when i am watching videos from the course i try to do it by myself with the instructions pdf which the video has and when i get error on a node i copy the link and directly send it to ChatGPT to help me understand what is wrong with and then i fix it. Am i doing it in the wrong way or should i keep get some help from AI whenever i feel stuck and lost in the nodes i get errors?\nI would like to hear your thoughts and suggestions(since i am a beginner and just started this journey a month ago). Thank you once again for the tips you have given.",

Maybe 1-2% either ignore or decline without comment.

      "text": "# hey guys been building automations for like a year now (started as a hobby, now doing some client work) and wanted to share some stuff i wish someone told me earlier. nothing groundbreaking but these literally save me hours every week\n\n# 1. PIN YOUR DATA PLEASE \n\nok this one changed my life. when you're testing workflows with webhooks or expensive API calls, you can click the little pin icon on any node's output. it basically freezes that data so you don't have to keep triggering the webhook or burning through API credits while testing downstream nodes.\n\nlike i was working on this AI image gen workflow with a paid API and kept racking up charges just to test my logic. now i just run it once, pin the output, and iterate on everything else without spending a dime. game changer.\n\n**pro tip:** press `P` on your keyboard when a node is selected to pin/unpin data instantly\n\n# 2. SHIFT+S = sticky notes everywhere\n\ni used to build these massive workflows and come back 2 weeks later like \"wtf does this do??\"\n\npress `Shift+S` anywhere on the canvas and you get a sticky note. i use them to explain WHY i did something, not just what it does. also you can use markdown in them which is sick\n\nmy color system:\n\n* yellow = warnings or important notes\n* blue = AI/LLM stuff\n* green = data transformation\n* red = error handling\n\nhonestly just pick whatever works for you but COLOR CODE YOUR NODES TOO. makes debugging so much easier\n\n# 3. the secret test mode nobody talks about\n\ninstead of running your whole workflow every time, you can test individual nodes. like if you have 10 nodes and only want to test node #7, just click it and hit the \"Test step\" button (or ctrl+enter).\n\nBUT HERE'S THE TRICK: this only works if the previous nodes have data. so pin data on the nodes before it, then you can test that one node over and over without running the entire workflow. saves SO much time\n\n# 4. the command bar is actually insane (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K)\n\ni see so many people clicking around menus when you can just hit Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on mac) and search for literally anything. want to add a node? Ctrl+K. open a workflow? Ctrl+K. check your executions? Ctrl+K.\n\nonce you get used to it you barely touch your mouse\n\n# 5. error workflows = sleep better at night\n\nthis one's more advanced but set up a workflow with an \"Error Trigger\" node that catches fails from your other workflows. mine sends me a slack message with the error details whenever something breaks.\n\nbefore this i'd have workflows silently failing and not know until a client was like \"hey this stopped working 3 days ago\" lol. now i know immediately and can fix stuff before anyone notices\n\n# 6. execution history is your time machine\n\nif a workflow fails or does something weird, go to the executions tab and click on that specific run. you can see EXACTLY what data was at each node. i use this for debugging constantly.\n\nyou can even right-click on an old execution and do \"copy to editor\" to recreate that exact scenario and test fixes\n\n# 7. organize your workflows with projects\n\nif you're doing client work or have multiple use cases, use the projects feature to group related workflows. i have projects for \"Client A\", \"Client B\", \"Personal Automation\", etc.\n\nmakes it way easier to find stuff and you can set different permissions if you're working with a team\n\n\n\nanyway that's what i got. sorry for the wall of text but genuinely hope this helps someone. i literally discovered most of this by breaking stuff and googling error messages at 2am lmao\n\nwhat are your favorite tips? always down to learn more",

Como meu projeto trabalha com dados massivos, **200, 400 mil caracteres a cada geração**, precisei adaptar um controle sofisticado.\n\nO meu projeto no N8N, o browser não consegue rodar, mesmo com controle diluído fragmentado e sofisticado dá timeout no chrome.

I just rebuilt it anyway more for an experimentation. \n\nWith custom nodes, there is creative freedom to use whatever library we need and build custom business logic on top of it.\n\nTesseract.js might be better than the node I’ve built right now. But who knows.... if the community gets their hands on this open-source project and contributes value, this could become an all-rounder node. At least there’s a possibility (blindly being positive lol).\n\nAnd this was more like an learning & experiment project for me... so nothing serious 🤝",

      "text": "This is my first post on Reddit :)\n\nOver the past few months, I started building something for myself.\n\nI’m not particularly tech-savvy. I used n8n, Notion (as a database), Telegram, and OpenAI models. I got a paid ChatGPT subscription and learned everything on the go. I treated ChatGPT as my learning partner throughout this process.\n\nIt began as a simple note-taking setup. I was trying to keep my thoughts, ideas, and work notes in one place. Over time, it slowly evolved into a workflow-first system that helped me capture things easily, remember them over time, and reflect more clearly.\n\nI was curious about one question: *What if machines could work alongside us, helping with memory, structure, and reflection, without replacing human judgment?*\n\nThe system I ended up with does four simple things:\n\n* Captures inputs from different places (notes, messages, calendar, email, URLs, etc.)\n* Processes and structures them\n* Helps me recall relevant past context when I need it\n* Sends daily and weekly reflections so I don’t lose track of patterns\n\nI used this system for a couple of months, and it genuinely helped reduce my cognitive load. I found myself showing up more prepared for complex discussions, and it helped me learn faster as well.\n\nI built it mainly to bring order and continuity to my work and personal life. At some point, it started working exactly as I hoped, so I paused the build there. It showed me the possibilities of AI-driven workflows, and also made me realize there are probably better and simpler ways to build this. I’m planning to evolve it further soon. Maybe an Aurora 2.0.\n\nI’m sharing this mainly to learn from others:\n\n* Has anyone here built something similar for themselves?\n* How do you think about memory, reflection, or personal systems?\n* Where do you feel machines help vs. get in the way?\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper if useful. I’m open to sharing the JSONs and documentation so others can take it further or adapt parts of it into their own systems.\n\n**Update**: I just created a public link to access the JSONs and the documentation.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1txCSwzk7P4uN5uypzyrdeutgGAEh1m63?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1txCSwzk7P4uN5uypzyrdeutgGAEh1m63?usp=sharing)",

This utilizes embedding models for semantic search + power of knowledge graph for retreival. And since it is temporal, the data retreived will be episodic and up to date.\n\nI also want to explore using Postgres (with puppygraph or Apache Age or pgRouting instead of Neo4j) and create a system like graphiti myself.\n\nTool: Graphiti MCP with Neo4j locally\n\n3.

You're not helping and most job seekers on reddit have likely already read the exact \"advice\" you posted many years ago at this point,\n\nIt's just so egotistical. Accept that if you're on LinkedIn and you work at a corporation and you're a manager, you are likely to be messaged cold and move on; if people get ignored, then so be it.

      "text": "A few weeks ago I posted about a “YouTube to newsletter” workflow i created. It was pretty popular in this sub that week so a week later, i turned it into an app. Posted about that here as well. I won’t mention the apps name as I think I’ve talked about it enough in this sub but it’s currently ranked #4 on PH. Just an example of things you can use n8n for besides building a consulting agency. \n\nI think a lot of n8n users focus on starting an agency to sell services to business but that’s not the only approach there is when it comes to making money with this stuff. N8n is a great way to build a POC and validate an idea. If you’re creative enough you can use it to build multiple profitable micro saas apps. \n\nMy app hasn’t made any money yet but I think the future is promising based on all the feedback. \n",

That’s a huge validation for the 'n8n as a Backend' approach. 🚀\n\n\n\nYou’ve touched on a vital point: n8n isn't just a tool; it's a rapid prototyping engine. Using it to build a Micro-SaaS or a POC (Proof of Concept) is incredibly smart because it slashes development time and costs.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don't see it as 'Agency vs. SaaS.' I see it as Infrastructure for Business.\n\n\n\nSaaS is great for scaling a single solution to many (like your YouTube-to-newsletter app).\n\n\n\nAgencies are essential for businesses that need bespoke logic, legal compliance, and managed security—things a Micro-SaaS usually doesn't cover.\n\n\n\nActually, the most successful people I’m seeing for 2026 are building 'Productized Agencies'—using the same infrastructure they use for their apps to provide managed services to high-ticket clients.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, whether you build an app or an agency, owning the infrastructure (like a managed n8n instance) is what gives you the edge. Best of luck with the PH launch! It's an inspiration for the community.\"",

I use Skrapp's an email finder API for this. It fits perfectly here because you can pass that extracted name and company straight into their endpoint to get the verified work email.

If you haven't, it works by sending your question to 4 different LLMs. Each response gets ranked and synthesized into one final answer.\n\nYou might think having 4 LLMs is overkill, but I actually find myself asking multiple LLMs the same question when I need a definitive answer without hallucinations. So the LLM Council is something I use from time to time.\n\nThe problem with Karpathy's project is that it's tedious to set up and rerun. You have to keep two command prompts running at all times (backend + frontend), and the conversation sits outside of Claude, which is my primary LLM. If I want to continue the discussion with Claude, I have to copy and paste the verdict and manually feed it context. Not super seamless.\n\nSo I rebuilt the LLM Council in n8n and connected it to Claude using n8n's instance-level MCP. This way, I can ask Claude to execute the workflow, get the verdict straight in the UI, and continue the conversation seamlessly.\n\nThe n8n version works the same way Karpathy built it:\n\n* **Stage 1:** Each LLM answers the question independently.\n* **Stage 2:** Each LLM gets all the answers anonymized and ranks them based on accuracy, clarity, and depth.\n* **Stage 3:** The original question, rankings, and answers are sent to a chairman LLM to synthesize the final answer.\n\nI created a YT video talking more about the LLM Council and how the n8n automation works [https://youtube.com/shorts/UM-FlzvJLsg?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/UM-FlzvJLsg?feature=share)\n\nHere's the workflow link:

      "text": "There is a massive amount of \"he-said, she-said\" in this sub about building a SaaS on top of n8n. Some people say you need to cough up for an Embed license the second you charge a customer. Others say you can do whatever you want if you self-host.\n\n\n\nBoth are wrong.\n\nI’ve been digging through the official forums and specifically looking at replies from Jan (n8n founder) to clarify the Sustainable Use License (SUL). If you’re building a product, here is the playbook to stay legal and avoid a surprise bill.\n\n# The \"Whose Credentials\" Rule\n\nThe single most important factor is whose API keys n8n is using. Jan’s logic follows a \"Chef\" analogy:\n\nThe Green Zone (Standard SUL)\n\nThe Chef (n8n) uses the restaurant’s ingredients (Your company’s API keys) to cook a meal and hands it to the waiter (Your Frontend).\n\n* **The Model:** Your SaaS acts as a service provider. You use your OpenAI key or your SendGrid key to process a request and return a result.\n* **Identity:** It doesn’t matter if your users \"Login with Google\" to your app. As long as those user tokens aren't being passed into n8n nodes to act on their behalf, you are 100% fine.\n\nThe Red Zone (Embed License Required)\n\nThe Chef asks the customer for their house keys (User OAuth Tokens), drives to their home, and cooks in their personal kitchen.\n\n* **The Model:** If your SaaS \"manages the user's inbox\" or \"posts to the user's Twitter\" by putting their credentials into an n8n node, you need a commercial agreement.\n* **The Loophole:** You cannot bypass this by using a generic HTTP Request node to send user tokens. Jan was clear: if n8n connects to a user’s service at runtime, it’s a restricted use case.\n\n# The \"External Connection\" Strategy (The Workaround)\n\nThis is how you build a powerful SaaS without needing the Embed license immediately. You handle the \"connection\" layer outside of n8n.\n\n**The Architecture:**\n\n1. **App Side:** Your custom code handles OAuth and stores the tokens.\n2. **The Handover:** Your app fetches the data (the email text, the lead info) and sends **only the raw data** to an n8n webhook.\n3. **Processing:** n8n does the logic/AI and returns the result to your app.\n4. **Execution:** Your app (not n8n) uses the user’s token to push the final action.\n\nBecause n8n never \"leaves the restaurant\" to touch the user's account directly, this counts as internal processing.\n\n# The Roadmap (Q1 2026)\n\nJan recently mentioned they are working on a shift for Q1 2026. The goal is to allow Enterprise licenses to cover these multi-user credential cases, as long as you aren’t white-labeling the n8n UI.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\n* **MVPs:** You’re allowed to test and build.\n* **Public Launch:** If n8n touches user keys, call Sales.\n* **Data Processing:** If n8n uses your keys or just processes data your app fetches, you’re good to go.\n\nAll of this is pulled from Jan’s direct replies on the forums. Stop guessing and build the right architecture from day one.",

Keep it simple.”\n\nFor the **text**, I usually generate it separately (I use Claude, but anything works):  \n– describe the workflow  \n– focus on the user problem  \n– keep it short\n\nThen I paste that content back into Gemini and ask it to fill the site.\n\n# Hosting\n\nSince it’s just static files, I host it using **DigitalOcean App Platform**:  \n– push files to GitHub  \n– connect repo to App Platform  \n– site goes live\n\nNo servers, no droplets.\n\nIf I want to change anything later, I just edit the GitHub files and it auto-updates.\n\n# Why I like this approach\n\n• fast  \n• no frontend stress  \n• good enough for sharing or validation  \n• works well with n8n-style tools\n\nI made a short video showing this flow end-to-end, but honestly the steps above are the whole thing.\n\n And here is a link to the video if you'd like a more in-depth tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA)\n\nIf anyone here is doing something similar (or better), I’d like to know how you handle landing pages for n8n projects.\n\nPS: English isn't my first language, so I've used ChatGPT to polish this post and write it professionally.",

I did come across it multiple times while researching free hosting options.\n\nThe main reason I went with DigitalOcean is my typical use case: once a landing page is live, I usually run Facebook ads and drive paid traffic to it. Based on what I’d read earlier, GitHub Pages is great for static sites, but I wasn’t fully confident about performance under ad-driven traffic spikes, especially in terms of speed, load handling, and auto-scaling.\n\nWith DigitalOcean, I get peace of mind around traffic surges, auto-balancing, and predictable performance when ads suddenly push a lot of users to the page.\n\nThat said, if GitHub Pages can handle high traffic reliably with good performance (especially via CDN), I’m absolutely open to using it. In fact, I’m planning to give GitHub Pages a proper try this weekend and test it under real conditions.\n\nAlways happy to optimize for simpler and cheaper setups if they genuinely hold up in production.",

Actually, this tutorial focuses on creating a landing page to showcase your n8n workflows rather than integrating directly with n8n itself.\n\nThe landing page is generated using Gemini and hosted on DigitalOcean, which means it operates independently without requiring a direct n8n connection for the basic setup.\n\nIf you do need to connect to n8n, that would typically be for specific use cases like payment processing or user registration management. However, those integrations would be implemented on a case-by-case basis depending on your specific requirements.\n\nHope this clarifies things!",

Can be dangerous when feed into an LLM, especially now with deep fakes, ect. \n\nn8n makes this disturbingly easy—just chain the nodes.\n\nYou can cross-reference public data (addresses, employment, social connections) soo easily. \n\nCreate all sorts of social chaos.\n\nOnce you automate data aggregation, the barrier to abuse drops to zero.\n\nn8n is powerful because it makes complex automations accessible. \n\nWhich makes this stuff unprecedented in terms of what it can do for any 18 yr old autist in his bedroom. \n\nMaybe I'm just messed up for thinking about this as a concept for fun, but it's just so much more interesting than building basic workflow automations for small internal systems. \n\nKinda random post but think is a very underrated concept of N8N ",

              "text": "gracias pero, mi Español no es bueno,\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ax7_QNZZ-pk?si=rPtpzJvr1sO23HzP\n\n\n TL;DR - [ English ] inglés transcript\n\n\nThis video explains how to create and deploy a free Artificial Intelligence (AI) API using Bun, a fast JavaScript runtime, and leverage the free tiers of various AI services like Grock and Cerebras (0:00). The goal is to build an extensible API that avoids subscription fees and credit card requirements.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:\n\n\nIntroduction to Free AI Services: The video highlights how to utilize the free tiers of services like Grock (up to 60 calls/minute) (0:29) and Cerebras (30 requests/minute) (0:45), as well as mentioning Gemini and Open Router for additional free access (0:50). The strategy is to combine these free tiers to extend overall usage (0:47-0:50).\n\n\nSetting up Bun: The first step involves installing Bun on your system, which is a straightforward command-line process (1:08-1:29). After installation, `bun init` is used to create a basic project structure (1:33-1:43).\n\n\nCreating a Basic API with Bun: The video demonstrates how to create a minimal API using `Bun.serve` to listen on a port (e.g., 3000) and respond to requests (1:58-2:32). It also covers setting up `package.json` scripts for easy development and server restarting (3:13-3:25).\n\n\nDeploying the API to Production with Hostinger and Coolify: The creator uses Hostinger VPS (a sponsor) (3:39) and Coolify (4:15), an alternative to services like Vercel or Heroku, for deployment. The process involves installing Coolify on the VPS (4:25-5:03), configuring an `nixpacks.toml` file to guide Coolify on building the Bun project (6:04-6:40), and linking the GitHub repository for automatic deployment (6:42-7:08). The video demonstrates how to access the Coolify panel, connect a repository, and deploy the application (7:13-9:01), including tips on viewing deployment logs (9:04-9:54).\n\n\nIntegrating AI Services (Grock & Cerebras):\nGrock Integration: The video shows how to get an API key from Grock (11:57) and use its SDK to make chat requests (10:29-12:31). The code structure is then refactored to create a reusable `GrockService` function that adheres to a common `AIService` interface (12:38-16:02), utilizing async generator functions with `yield` for streaming responses (14:44-16:02).\nCerebras Integration: Similar to Grock, the process involves obtaining an API key from Cerebras (21:50-22:08) and integrating its SDK into a `CerebrasService` (22:08-23:14).\nImplementing Service Rotation: The core of the free tier strategy is implemented by creating a `get next service` function that cycles through the available AI services (Grock, Cerebras, etc.) using a round-robin approach (16:24-17:19). This ensures that requests are distributed among different services, maximizing the use of their free allowances.\n\n\nAPI Enhancements and Testing: The API is modified to handle POST requests to a `/chat` endpoint (17:21-18:40), streaming responses back to the client as the AI models generate them (18:41-20:07). The video demonstrates testing the API locally using `curl` and observing the service rotation in the console logs (19:31-24:05).\n\n\nConfiguring Environment Variables for Deployment: The API keys for Grock and Cerebras are added as environment variables in Coolify to securely manage credentials in production (25:05-26:02). A redeploy is then performed to apply these changes (25:39-25:45), and the deployed API is tested (26:32-27:10).\n\n\nThe video concludes by reiterating the benefits of building such an API for cost savings and flexibility in using various AI models (27:23-27:52), and encourages viewers to like and subscribe (28:17-28:29).",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm writing this post because I want to do things right from the start and I'd like to hear opinions from people with more experience than me.\n\nI'm 18 years old, I'm not currently studying for a degree or working a traditional job. I don't come from a family with connections or money, and everything I want to build depends 100% on me. My goal isn't to get rich quick, but to learn a real skill, one that's in demand, that isn't dependent on trends, and that will allow me to generate a sustainable income in the coming years.\n\nI've been researching entrepreneurship, online businesses, AI, automation, digital services, etc., for a while now. I've tried things, learned tools, and done small projects, but now that the year is starting, I want to focus on just ONE skill and take it seriously for the next 12–24 months.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is exactly this:\n\n• A skill that can be learned from scratch\n\n• That doesn't require a university degree\n\n• That has real demand in business\n\n• That allows you to sell services, not just rely on social media\n\n• That scales over time (improving prices, clients, systems)\n\n• That isn't completely dead or saturated\n\nI don't mind working long hours or learning difficult things.\n\nWhat I do want to avoid is wasting years jumping from one trend to another.\n\nThat's why my question is very clear:\n\n👉 If you were 18 years old today, starting from scratch, what skill would you learn this year to actually make money in 2025–2026? And if you can, I would greatly appreciate it if you could explain it step by step, for example:\n\n• What specific skill\n\n• Why that one and not another\n\n• What to learn first\n\n• What tools to use\n\n• How to get the first clients\n\n• How realistically does it take to start earning anything\n\n• Typical mistakes I should avoid\n\nI'm not looking for answers like \"do what you love\" or \"be consistent.\"\n\nI'm looking for sound judgment, experience, and a realistic perspective, even if it's harsh.\n\nThank you so much to anyone who takes the time to reply.\n\nI'm here to learn and build something meaningful.",

          "text": "I’m 18 too, no degree, no job background, no connections — so I’ll just share what actually worked for me, not what sounds good on YouTube.\n\nWhat ended up making sense was AI-based problem solving + micro-SaaS, but not the “build an app and pray” kind. More like: find a real business headache, build a small focused system around it, and sell it as value, not hype.\n\nThe biggest thing I learned is this:\nskills that last aren’t tools, they’re systems and frameworks you build for yourself and keep refining over years. Tools change, trends die — systems compound.\n\nFor me, the direction that keeps growing is micro-SaaS that creates real value instead of dependency. Stuff businesses actually rely on daily, not “growth hacks”. Things like internal tools, workflows, automation, CRM-like systems, ops tools, etc.\n\nHow I approached learning (roughly):\n\nFirst, I focused on systems thinking — understanding how businesses actually operate and building action-based frameworks around them.\n\nTech-wise: React for frontend (works everywhere), backend basics (Java / Python), and Python especially for automation (still learning, deep curve) also nowadays there's this new very niched trend of using n8n as backend wraped in react frontend and selling through deploying on the client's device. \n\nSince you can't legally sell n8n workflows as your own backend, but you can surely provide producterized service by deploying n8n workflows on your client's device, and yes it is scalable (I have seen very less people try it, but its very cost effective, thank me later for this info).\n\nThen understanding how AI / LLMs actually work, not just APIs — and applying them only where they make sense and focusing on OPENSOURCE LLMs, if you strategically use them, you might aswell won't incur much costs and build great useful stuff not just typical bloated GPT-Wrappers.\n\nEverything I build is small, specific, and tied to a real use case\nClient-wise, it’s simpler than people think. When you’re clearly solving a painful problem in a niche, you speak from leverage. That confidence alone wins trust. You’re not begging for clients — you’re offering relief.\n\nImportant reality check though: the learning curve is steep. I started messing with this stuff around 14, and it took me 4–5 years to build systems that actually work for me today. There’s no shortcut — just compounding effort. And when I started back when I was 14, AI was not as hyped and developed as it is today, plus I had never heard about Micro-SaaS and n8n, slowly these thing exploded right infront my eyes, but trust me, these ain't missed opportunities, these are opportunities of today, and they are gonna be relevant for atleast a decade.\n\nIf you truly learn and build something great, you're gonna make a solid income, and even when these fade away slowly, you're gonna be in the loop easily for even the next 1 and a half decade, we can claim this from the fact that remember the 2010s and specifically late 2010s to early 2020s were all about large-scale SaaS, Dropshipping, Digital Products etc? eventually these niches got very saturated but the ones established in these niches still have a solid income, same gonna repeat with n8n and AI\n\nOne mistake I made: I waited too long to document my journey. I thought I needed to “know enough” first. That never happens. Start documenting early — this decade is going to be heavily about personal brands, whether people like it or not.\n\nIf your only goal is future stability + leverage, I’d honestly recommend a balanced approach:\n\nBuild a solid income skill like micro-SaaS / AI problem solving\nOn the side, explore personal passions without pressure\nIn the end, still try multiple things and see what clicks — but if you’re asking purely about future-proof skills, this is where I’d place my bet.\n\nHope that helps, and respect for thinking this clearly at 18.",

Yes everyone can create a n8n workflow but 99% of them don't even have the slightest idea on how to effectively use n8n, the most effective way I found was using it with a combination of python automations, and wrapping them around my own coded frontends, the end goal is not to sell a n8n automation but to sell a framework which solves a problem for your client like cutting costs or making a task efficient, average businesses don't care whether you are using n8n or any other form of automation, they care that you provide them a solution to their pain points\n\nUse n8n as a utility as a tool, don't fall for the overhyped thesis of random youtube creators, no one rarely anyone is selling just random n8n workflows, what I personally learned is these workflows always gotta be part of a bigger solution, system or Framework \n\nAs for outreach, I have my own personalised outreach System deployed on my device, I don't use the typical tools like Mailchimp or Instantly, instead I use my on device platform and pay no SaaS fees, it manages detailed profile and intent based lead generation for me, also does personalised outreach and onboarding.\n\nAbout your idea of voice agents for dentistry, it's a solid idea, I have seen case studies of such type of solutions working in the U.S. and E.U. markets, if you are gonna be working on that, I would advise you to emphasise on the \"benefits\" and ROI of the voice agents for dentists, kinda saving time, Automated bookings etc, they shall understand that more, rather then n8n itself.\n\nRemember n8n is a tool, businesses are buying solutions, not because there's n8n in the backend, but because n8n enables you to provide that solution.\n\nAlso I personally focused on perfecting the solution for 1 client at a time, I mainly work with automated outreach systems and AI CRMs, 2 soloprenuer startups signed up with me through this exact mindset and that basically covered my entire future college expenditure for a whole year through their payments.\n\nCheers, goodluck, I'll be happy to provide more info",

Learn to learn and work really hard, additionally make errors a lot of them with other peoples money. So based on this I will just tell you my route and it worked pretty well, I applied for a trainee role basically 0 money, in a cloud consulting company. Then I worked my butt of learned a lot about architecture in the cloud, network, and APIs. I am leading a small team now that basically modernizes applications, secures apis and integrates them…\n\nAgain study, learn, work your ass off you will get there.\n\nDon’t fall for those scams of easy money, I would not suggest becoming an entrepreneur so young, you don’t know enough! Watch the guys in the company and be curious they will teach you everything then you will have enough knowledge to open a company.",

Right now I'm searching for a job with it. Instead of reading through hundreds of job postings in order to find some detail about the job that eliminates it as a possibility, I just put the stuff I'm looking for in a job into an n8n workflow. It scrapes linkedin and a couple other job boards, does some programmatic filtering on stuff like salary and location requirements, then the remaining job postings are fed with my resume into an LLM which I ask to rate how good a fit the job is to the resume. I get out a rating that I use to sort the results so I read the best matches which meet my criteria first, and I get alerts on my phone so I know quickly when a new job is posted. Basically 99% of this was coded by ChatGPT. It saves me from checking job postings every day and cuts down on how much I read by like 97%. All of my job preferences are hard-coded into it because I don't give a shit about making it generalized and usable by other people in order to make money off of it, and I intend to throw it away when I get a job I like. It's running locally and I use Groq free tier for the LLM so it costs nothing.\n\nThis is basically the utility of n8n for the average person.

One of which was adopted from my colleague who told me about n8n.\n\nAs a parent of elementary/middle schoolers, we get a lot of emails from teachers, schools, school districts, etc.\n\nMany of them are irrelevant or repetitive, which makes sifting through the noise a tedious endeavor, and I often miss things.\n\nThe workflow reads the emails, parses out relevant info, and automatically adds events to a shared family calendar.\n\nThe other is one I created. My youngest occasionally will eat a hot lunch at school if they like what’s on the menu that day… or I’ll make them a lunch to bring. The lunch menu is online and accessible in JSON form via a relatively simple API. The workflow runs each evening, checks the following day’s lunch options, then sends it to ChatGPT to create a fun limerick poem about tomorrow’s lunch choices. I then have it send the poem as a Pushover notification to our phones.\n\nIt’s been a fun way to start a conversation, which ultimately may lead to me getting 10 extra minutes of sleep if I don’t have to make a lunch.",

These files contain simple descriptions for entities, people, areas, and acts as context for the AI.\n\nSo when I send a query the LLM references it against my Memory Index and follows the wikinks through to gain context. If the query requires device control it references the current states and outputs a Json command back to HA.\n\nIf it requires a Google Search it goes and does that for me in context to my home address if it needs that context.\n\nThere's also a file in the Memory folder containing the last 10 queries and summaries of all previous queries, so it gains context from those files too.\n\nNext step is ironing out a pet peeve of mine with current AI in HA, which is that I cannot ask about previous entity states. So I'm planning on adding files that contain updated past states of entities so I can ask for example how cold the house was last night or when my son left to catch the bus to school.\n\nShare your Json mate, it might help supercharge the development of my project.",

Technically it could just live in a couple of folders, but I like being able to edit the files on my phone in the app.\n\nWhen I started playing with it, the query went to a Gemini Node in N8n which directed it to the Cli but I didn't like having it going through Gemini twice, doubling the token count so I spent time removing the AI in N8n, then structured my files and promp in such a way so as to minimise the token count as much as possible.\n\nSo the idea of it building context when needed by going through the \"Memory\" index, increases the tokens needed, but only when the query requires it.",

      "text": "# Alright so hear me out. been working with n8n for about a year now and honestly the job application process is so broken. you find a decent job on linkedin and literally 200 people already applied in like 3 hours. your resume just gets lost in the void.\n\nspent the last few weeks building this workflow that actually personalizes your resume for EACH job and sends emails directly to HR people. tested it with a few of my friends and the response rate is actually nuts compared to normal applications.\n\n# what it actually does\n\nbasically you give it your base resume and it:\n\n* scrapes linkedin for jobs you want\n* uses ai to figure out which jobs match your skills\n* rewrites your entire resume for each specific job (this part is crazy)\n* finds the HR person's email at each company\n* writes a personalized email for each recruiter\n* sends everything automatically\n\nthe whole point is that most people send the same generic resume to 100 companies. this makes it look like you wrote a custom resume just for them.\n\n# how i built it\n\n**getting the jobs** starts with either a manual trigger or schedule trigger, whatever you prefer. then theres a google docs node that grabs your base resume.\n\nnext part uses the apify community node (you gotta download it from community nodes if you dont have it). i use the linkedin job scraper actor. you literally just paste your linkedin job search url and it pulls all the jobs. apify gives you $5 free credit which is enough to test this out properly.\n\ni added a limit node set to 10 jobs because processing 100 at once takes forever and costs more in api calls. you can bump it up once you know it works.\n\n**filtering the garbage** this is where it gets interesting. openai node (im using gpt 4.1 mini cause its cheap) reads each job description and scores it against your skills. i have it pull out company name, job description, and salary info.\n\nthen theres a code node that restructures everything because the ai output is kinda messy. after that a filter node removes jobs that arent relevant AND jobs without a company website. learned this the hard way - linkedin has so many fake job posts from companies with no website. saved me from applying to like 3 scams already.\n\n**resume customization part** ok this is the coolest part. i use claude (anthropic) to completely rewrite your resume based on each job description. it takes your base resume and the job requirements and tailors it specifically.\n\nbut here's the thing - ai outputs everything in html format which looks horrible in a document. so theres a markdown converter node that fixes the formatting.\n\nthen it creates separate google docs for each company (named like \"YourName - CompanyName Resume\"). i had to use an http request node with the patch method to actually update the docs because the native google docs node doesnt handle updates well. took me ages to figure that out.\n\n**finding recruiters and sending** hunter node searches each company's domain and finds hr department emails. this is where i hit rate limits during testing cause im on the free tier lol. but it works.\n\ncouple code nodes to clean up the email data, then another openai call to write a personalized outreach email for each recruiter. finally gmail node sends everything.\n\n# stuff i learned building this\n\n* mixing different llms (openai and claude) actually works fine. you dont have to stick to one\n* hunter free tier is limited so dont spam test it like i did\n* the markdown conversion step is CRITICAL. without it your resumes are unreadable\n* google cloud console oauth setup for google docs is annoying but you only do it once\n* apify has tons of scrapers, just pick the cheapest linkedin one that works\n\n# does it actually work\n\nbeen running this for like 3 weeks now. one of my friend got 4 interview callbacks in 2 weeks which is way better than the zero they were getting before. another client said an hr person specifically mentioned how their resume was \"perfectly aligned\" with the role.\n\ni think it works because youre doing what 95% of applicants dont do - actually customizing your application and reaching out directly instead of just hitting the linkedin easy apply button.\n\n# the video\n\nmade a full walkthrough video showing every single node and how to set everything up. goes through the api connections, shows it running live, all that stuff. ill drop the link in the comments.\n\nhappy to answer questions if anyones trying to build this. theres definitely ways to optimize it more but this is what ive been using and its been solid.\n\nalso if you have ideas for making this better let me know cause im always trying to improve my workflows\n\n**Youtube video:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdMv4nNrL7g**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdMv4nNrL7g)\n\n**Workflow Link:** [**https://docs.google.com/document/d/126J7uBheGVeCiNfOVlT\\_CHVISlpekKNEU49zn4Ue4lk/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/126J7uBheGVeCiNfOVlT_CHVISlpekKNEU49zn4Ue4lk/edit?usp=sharing)",

I am also a backend dev and this is what threw me off: price, accordying to their policies, if you earn any money through any kind of sales, you gotta speak with n8n sales and they charge a lot. Concurrency, idk how it is on better tiers, but on the free one it was terrible. Also the building blocks, i have 16gb of ram (i know its the bare minimum today) and had to run it on a box or all my comouter grinded to a halt. Leave n8n for people who have no technical background or really small tasks, but never for production. Me personally, I would give maybe chatgpt the json with all the nodes (or section by section if too big) and ask it to formulate a plan pr do it directly in cursor/antigravity by hsving the file in a workspace. Great that you wanna lower costs, and great that you wanna ride this wave which is not in the end yet, but differentiate yourself from the rest that can code and buold with proven tools, where you can add security, logging, idempotencd and the like without so much hassle and later keep growing and expanding without having your future devs (if it gets to that) having to scramble around the spaghetti that n8n can become. Dont get me wrong, its a fun and interesting little tool, but I think there are much better alternatives if you have programming experience (and now 10x it with the correct llms)\n\nEdit: you mean you wanna copy and paste (create a new workflow) for each new user? That already seems like overhead and technical debt. It would be much better to have your program containeraized and allow for customization for each user",

In the project instructions, include things like:\n\"ALWAYS use n8n version 1.x\"\n\"Before suggesting a node, verify that it exists in your Notion documentation\"\n\"Don't use deprecated nodes like X, Y, Z\" (list the ones that have given you problems)\n2. The trick that works best for me: before asking him to create a complete flow, I ask him to first list the nodes he's going to use and confirm that they exist. This way, you catch the errors before he generates 50 faulty nodes.\n\n3. Be explicit about versions. Claude sometimes mixes n8n 0.x and 1.x syntax. At each prompt, remind him: \"I'm using n8n version [your version].\"\n\n4. Divide and conquer. Instead of asking for complete flows, ask for small blocks. A trigger + 2-3 nodes. Test it, it works, then move on to the next block.\n\nThe reality is that even with MCPs, Claude needs guidance. MCPs help, but they're not magic.",

I investigated the capabilities of Claude Code and made that transition two weeks ago. Claude Code uses much of the same material I built into my \"stack\" for Claude Desktop, but it also allows me to spawn sub-agents to run work directly on my n8n workflows and Supabase tables.",

When I need to add a new notification channel, I add it once and all 12 workflows get it.\n\n\n\nThe trick is designing sub-workflows with clear inputs and outputs. They need to be self-contained enough to work in different contexts.\n\n\n\nI treat them like API endpoints. Input data goes in, processed result comes out, no side effects or dependencies on parent workflow context.\n\n\n\nThis is how you scale n8n from individual workflows to a proper automation platform.\n\n\n\nWho else is using sub-workflows this way? Any patterns or gotchas you've discovered?",

Check submissions and scores.\n\nYour workflow will not be useful in real life scenario because its too simple.\n\n- If you only score CVs against a job description, you'll get over 60% false-negatives because lots of candidates don't have their CVs perfectly aligned with your job description, even if they're totally qualified. \n\nWe added screening questions on our frontend that ask candidates the exact questions that need to be answered to clarify and enhance their submission scoring. Those answers are linked to screening criteria for AI, such as must-have key requirements that get injected into the LLM prompt like \"make sure they have at least 2 years experience in accounts receivables using Odoo accounting.\"\n\nThe same CVs that scored very low first time .. scored 90%+ the second time with screening ai and dynamic prompts.\n\nMoreover our workflow is split into 2 sub workflows parts.\n\n- The CV processing workflow involves extracting data from PDF and DOCX files, flattening it into raw data, qualifying it as a CV, and storing it in a structured JSON format within the database.\n\n- The second workflow involves an hourly AI screening process, operating between 8 AM and 5 PM. This process evaluates each CV, generates scores and results, and sends appropriate emails. Unsuccessful candidates receive a thank-you letter detailing the reasons for their non advancement, while successful candidates receive an acceptance email and notification to expect a follow-up call within few days.\n\nIt works very smooth. False-negatives are way below 5% \n\nI recommend you enhance your CV screening to something similar. Its very easy.",

Validating that its a CV and saving it in the database. No screening happening yet. It also makes sure every candidate has a unique ID to avoid duplication and maintains histroical data.\n\n- Every hour: another workflow scans if there are CVs ready for validation.

This workflow is therefore essential for my potential business, and I need a lot of room for scalability. However, the n8n embed license is quite expensive, and as I have seen in other discussions, scalability with n8n has certain limitations. Therefore, I was considering hiring someone to write this Python code for me. \n\nDo you think this is a good idea, or should I stick with n8n with queue mode and pay for their embed license? Which of these alternatives will cost me less money, and what are the advantages and disadvantages at the production level if I want a lot of room for scalability?   \n ",

It serves as my CMS to maintain records manually and provides an easy method to query and update the data. So nothing special there. I think I had to make a module once for Drupal to call a N8N webhook to embed nomic queries to hit my backend qdrant db once.  The latest version of Drupal has a module to integrate qdrant now I think directly, but I am sure that is best when in the same server. I don’t want to expose my qdrant directly to the public so something like N8N authenticated wekhooks is a nice way to test out the workflow end to end. \n\nThis r/n8n, so some of this is not related 😎",

I had used another iPaSS before n8n and when I was let go I enjoyed it as well so this lead me to n8n. I played around with and picked it up quickly. Put it on my resume and got the job. The thing I have found tons of companies are using n8n software (iPaSS) to perform integration and automation. They do this because they don’t want to write code and just want something simple. So it is quick to setup and quick to launch. \n\nThat said the approach I used was to make automations I was interested and believe or not that is what helped get me the job because it was interesting to my interviewers. \n\nMost jobs that I dealt with don’t talk about n8n because it is open source. The risk is too much for big companies. However iPaSS are all the same just with a different coat of paint. \n\nKeep learning and making. Try other tools, they have demos. I wouldn’t spend much time on them. Just try them so you understand them and can say you have used them. They will be the same as n8n but just a little different.",

This solves a big n8n gap: there’s no native way to correlate executions across webhooks and sub-workflows. \n* It correlates using: \n   * timestamp proximity\n   * user / request IDs\n   * webhook URL patterns\n   * request/response metadata\n* Result: a full “execution story” from the initial trigger → downstream workflows → failure point.\n* **get\\_failed\\_executions** \n   * Aggregated view of what broke recently, across *all* workflows.\n* **analyze\\_execution\\_error** \n   * AI-assisted forensic analysis: why it failed, patterns across executions, and concrete next steps.\n\n# Why MCP + AI?\n\nBecause once execution data is structured and traceable, an AI can:\n\n* walk you through what actually happened\n* spot systemic issues (rate limits, bad credentials, retries)\n* suggest fixes instead of just dumping logs\n\nRepo here:  \n[https://github.com/EchoSilo/n8n-debug-mcp](https://github.com/EchoSilo/n8n-debug-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Where this gets really powerful\n\nIf you’re using **Claude Code** and add **n8n-skills**:  \n[https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills)\n\nYou effectively get an **AI n8n engineer + debugger**:\n\n* Claude already knows **correct n8n syntax, patterns, validation rules**\n* The skills teach Claude how to **use n8n-mcp tools properly**\n* This MCP server gives Claude **deep execution traces and correlations**\n\nSo instead of:\n\n>“Here are some logs, good luck”\n\nYou get:\n\n* “Here’s the full execution chain”\n* “This node failed because credentials were revoked”\n* “This failure pattern appeared 4 times in the last hour”\n* “Here’s exactly what to fix next”\n\nIn practice:  \n**n8n-mcp + n8n-skills + this debug MCP** turns Claude into a *trace-aware workflow debugger*, not just a workflow generator.\n\nStill early, but usable.

Webhooks tend to scale better once volume increases.\n* How are you handling idempotency (e.g. avoiding duplicate products if a message is retried)?\n* Do you persist state anywhere (DB/table) so you can replay or debug failed runs later?\n\nFor production use, adding retries + a dead-letter path for failures can make this rock solid.  \n  \nCool project—happy to dig deeper if you’re open to feedback.",

Although, since it's a lengthy workflow and the user has an option to use the abort command in case of any mistake so i thought it won't be an issue that way.\n3. Well, the state only persists till completion of the product. It is done through a data table. In which the state is changed with every step and then it gets reset to the starting stage which helps in avoiding complications in terms of retrieval by the telegram bot.\n\nFor the retry part, there's a message to proceed and cancel before finally creating the product and in between too there's an abort command.\n\nI am sure, it can be made better. Open for discussion regarding the same.",

                  "text": "That makes sense 👍 — using webhooks + a conversational “abort” path is a smart UX choice, especially for long workflows.\n\nGiven what you described, one small improvement that could help as usage grows is adding a lightweight idempotency guard at the *very start* of product creation (even just a hash of product name + timestamp or external ID stored in the data table). That way, if a webhook fires twice or a message gets retried, you won’t accidentally create duplicates.\n\nYour state machine approach in the data table sounds solid. If you ever want to go further, a simple “finalized / failed” flag plus a dead-letter branch for unexpected errors can make debugging much easier without complicating the happy path.\n\nOut of curiosity, are people using this more for one-off product creation, or are you seeing batch-style usage yet?",

      "text": "Everyone uses Merge to combine data from multiple branches. Usually just Append mode which stacks items on top of each other.\n\n\n\nBut there are other modes that solve specific problems way more elegantly:\n\n\n\nMerge By Position - combines items based on their order. Item 1 from input A merges with item 1 from input B. Perfect when you have parallel processes generating related data.\n\n\n\nMerge By Key - joins data based on matching field values, like a database join. If both inputs have a customer ID field, it merges items where the IDs match.\n\n\n\nMultiplex - creates combinations of items from both inputs. Every item from A pairs with every item from B. Useful for generating test scenarios or configuration combinations.\n\n\n\nThe key is understanding which mode matches your data relationship:\n\n\n\nAppend when data is independent and you just want it all in one place\n\nMerge By Position when data is related by processing order\n\nMerge By Key when data is related by identifier\n\nMultiplex when you need all possible combinations\n\n\n\nI spent way too long fighting with Append mode before realizing Merge By Key existed and solved my problem instantly.\n\n\n\nThe node documentation explains these but seeing them in actual workflow context makes more sense. That's why when I build example workflows I try to use different merge modes to show when each one applies",

      "text": "If you build complex n8n workflows, you know that documenting them is often the first thing that gets skipped. I created a custom Gemini Gem to automate this process, turning raw JSON exports into structured documentation specifically formatted for **n8n Sticky Notes**.\n\n# 🎯 The Documentation Technique\n\nThe process is straightforward:\n\n1. **Download** your workflow JSON from n8n.\n2. **Upload** it into the Gemini Gem.\n3. **Copy-paste** the output directly into n8n. Because it’s exported as raw Markdown, it automatically formats perfectly inside the Sticky Note.\n\n# ⚙️ How it Works\n\nThe Gem provides a high-level overview first, then enters an **interactive mode**. It asks which part of the workflow you want to document, and you simply provide a screenshot of a specific cluster of nodes. Documenting every single node is tedious and often unnecessary. Grouping makes more sense because:\n\n* **Functional Context**: It explains what a *set* of nodes achieves together (e.g., \"URL Extraction & Deduplication\") rather than describing repetitive technical steps.\n* **Modular Documentation**: It breaks the documentation into digestible \"blocks\" that are easier for teammates to follow without getting overwhelmed by the entire workflow at once.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5sxmlo4bbag1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=72150eb5e6f45e2a3460208449c68b9f2729ccbe\n\n# 🚀 Sample Output (Markdown ready for n8n)\n\n>\\### 🧠 AI Analysis & Data Cleaning  \n  \n\\*\\*Function:\\*\\* Uses GPT-4o to evaluate lead relevance based on specific \"Golden Window\" indicators.  \n  \n\\*\\*Configuration:\\*\\* - \\*\\*Model:\\*\\* gpt-4o.  \n\\- \\*\\*Temperature:\\*\\* 0.1 for high accuracy.  \n\\- \\*\\*Format:\\*\\* JavaScript node cleans output to ensure it's spreadsheet-ready.\n\n\n\n# 🛠️ The Gemini Instructions \n\nTo create this yourself, start a new Gem in Gemini and paste these instructions into the \"System Instructions\" section. This is what tells the AI how to handle your n8n JSON files.\n\n\\--\n\n>You are an expert technical writer for n8n. Your goal is to provide documentation that is formatted specifically for n8n Sticky Notes.\n\n>CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE:\n\n>You must wrap your entire response inside a single Markdown code block (using triple backticks \\`\\`\\`). This prevents the Gemini interface from rendering the symbols, allowing the user to copy the \"raw\" markdown.  \n\n\n>Phase 1: The Overview\n\n>When a user uploads an n8n JSON file, immediately output the high-level documentation in this format:\n\n>\\### 🎯 Purpose\n\n>\\[Write a clear, plain-language summary of the workflow's goal.\\]\n\n>\\### ⚙️ How It Works\n\n>\\* \\[Summarize the logic flow using bullet points.\\]\n\n>\\* \\[Mention trigger intervals and data movement.\\]\n\n>\\### 🔑 Requirements\n\n>\\* \\[List all necessary credentials and API keys.\\]  \n\n\n>Phase 2: Interactive Grouping\n\n>After outputting the Phase 1 overview, exit the code block and ask:\"Which group of nodes would you like to document first? Please provide a screenshot or a list of node names.\"  \n\n\n>Phase 3: Group Documentation\n\n>When the user provides a group, output the documentation in this exact format:\n\n>\\### \\[Emoji\\] \\[Group or Node Name\\]\n\n>\\*\\*Function:\\*\\* \\[Simple explanation of what this group/node does.\\]\n\n>\\*\\*Configuration:\\*\\* - \\[Key setting 1\\]\n\n>\\- \\[Key setting 2\\]  \n\n\n>Formatting Rules (Strict):\n\n>Headings: Start main sections with ### followed by exactly one relevant emoji.\n\n>Spacing: ALWAYS include one empty row space between a heading and the content below it.\n\n>The \"Configuration\" Line Break: The label Configuration: must be on its own line. You must move to a new line before starting the first bullet point.\n\n>Bullets: Every item under \"Configuration\" MUST start with a - on a new line.\n\n>Scannability: Use \\*\\* to bold key terms and variables.\n\n>Plain Speak: Explain things clearly for a non-technical audience.\n\n  \nFeedback of course welcome on what would improve this :) ",

I've been working with ConnectSafely's workflow for sending AI-personalized LinkedIn connection requests: [https://n8n.io/workflows/11420-send-ai-personalized-linkedin-connection-requests-from-google-sheets-with-gemini/](https://n8n.io/workflows/11420-send-ai-personalized-linkedin-connection-requests-from-google-sheets-with-gemini/) (Shoutout ConnectSafely!)\n\nThe workflow itself is working great - it pulls prospects from Google Sheets, fetches their LinkedIn profiles, generates personalized messages with Gemini, and sends the requests. Really slick setup.\n\nWhere I'm getting stuck is customizing the AI prompt to match my specific use case. I'm in B2B SaaS and want the messages to sound more conversational and less \"salesy\" - right now they're decent but feel a bit templated if that makes sense? Also trying to figure out the best way to handle rate limiting without getting flagged by LinkedIn.\n\nHas anyone experimented with different prompt engineering approaches for outreach messages? Or found that sweet spot for timing between requests? Would love to hear what's worked for you. Any resources on making AI-generated messages sound more human would be super helpful too.\n\nFeel free to drop suggestions here or shoot me a DM - always down to learn from folks who've been at this longer than me!",

The difference I've noticed is that this workflow pulls the person's full LinkedIn profile data BEFORE generating the message. So Gemini isn't just working with a name and title - it's seeing their recent activity, career history, skills, etc.\n\nThe key is customizing the system prompt with your own context and voice. Out of the box it's decent, but once I tweaked it to match how I actually talk and what I'm genuinely looking for in connections, the messages got way better. Had a few people actually reply saying \"this felt like a real message\" which was the goal.\n\nIt's not magic but it's definitely a step above the generic \"I'd love to add you to my network\" garbage.",

I'd recommend starting with like 5-10 test prospects to see how the messages look before scaling up.

Same document every time, just different names and dates. Was getting tired of opening Word, filling in the blanks, saving as PDF, emailing it. \n\nSpent a weekend building this in n8n and figured I'd share it since document automation seems to come up a lot here. What it does is you trigger it with a webhook or form submission with the person's details. \n\nWorkflow generates a personalized NDA as a Word document and emails it to them automatically. Takes about thirty seconds from trigger to delivered document. The trick was the document generation part since n8n doesn't have native PDF or Docx support. \n\nI'm using CustomJS for that piece which has n8n nodes specifically for document stuff. Works pretty cleanly once you get it set up. \n\nTemplate is published on the n8n community site. You'll need to install the CustomJS nodes and add your own API credentials, but otherwise it should be plug and play. Not perfect but it's saved me a bunch of time. If anyone uses it and has suggestions for improvements, let me know. Always looking to make these templates better.\n\n  \nlink: [Here](https://n8n.io/workflows/9406-generate-and-email-custom-nda-documents-from-web-form-submissions/)",

I know a fair but of python so I am fairly technical and kinda demoralised how I was not able to get such a basic thing to work. I have been so excited about discovering n8n and have hit this roadblock / dampener. To be fair Genini and ChatGPT kept giving me advice that pertains to older versions of n8n. Any advice to get this working would be appreciated. GPT suggested I can use Execute Code node but I don't see that in n8n. The Code node (JavaScript / Python) returns some error when I try a simple python line like print(1). ",

They gave me some of their reports of past orders, that consists of large PDF files where te projects are explained in detail. These pdfs are very big and contains both text and image but I want to focus on the text side.  \nThe RAG should do this,:  \nI give a prompt like \"tell me all the reports that talk about projects of bridges of 50 meters\"  \nThe sistem then gives me the title of the documents that talk about it and gives me a brief summary\n\nI've been using a standard agentic n8n RAG, but I have problems with retrieving the title of document. The system knows i've worked on a project with a bridge from the document I gave to it but can't find the title, probably because it loses the title while embedding the document.\n\nI've used ollama and qdrant becuase I'm doing everything locally because I can't put the data on public AI models.\n\nAny tip would be much appreciated.  \nThanks in advance",

Generate embeddings for the text only, but keep the title in your vector database so it can be retrieved alongside search results. When dealing with large PDFs, split them into chunks and include the title in each chunk’s metadata. Use the metadata in your workflow to display the correct document titles along with summaries. The key is storing titles separately from embeddings to avoid losing them during retrieval.",

Now I'm working on automation, and I've noticed my workflows are pretty straightforward, usually around 10 nodes max. Meanwhile, I see other people building these massive workflows that feel like they have 30+ nodes, easy.\n\nIt makes me a little uneasy when I see super complex workflows. My instinct is always to break things into separate, smaller workflows instead. But now I'm wondering: am I missing something? Is there actually a good reason to have one giant workflow that does everything, rather than splitting it into multiple smaller ones?",
