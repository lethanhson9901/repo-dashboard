For outreach, I’ve chained this kind of flow into Instantly and Apollo; Pulse for Reddit plus Phantombuster has been nice for testing similar audience capture on Reddit/Twitter without drowning in noise.\n\nSo yeah: move from “cool scrape” to “clean, queryable pipeline” and this becomes a serious asset.",

I've started tinkering with n8n in the last few weeks and can feel the potential, but I'm deliberately staying away from the usual \"AI YouTube empire / SaaS moonshot\" content that floods YouTube.\n\nMy only goal right now is modest but concrete:\n\nBuild simple, reliable automations that solve boring, repetitive problems for real people/small businesses → eventually charge enough to cover my personal basics.\n\nCurrent reality check:\n\nbeginner with n8n + AI nodes\n\nNo budget for paid tools/ads/team\n\nComfortable with Google Sheets, Excel, basic CRMs, data cleanup, maybe simple REST APIs once I learn them\n\nI want practical, low-risk use cases — not lottery-ticket ideas\n\nand, For a commerce/finance background person, where do you see n8n realistically fitting into future skills & opportunities? Better internal finance ops roles? Freelance reporting/ops automation? Micro-consulting for small CA offices / traders / e-commerce sellers? Or is it mostly a nice-to-have side-tool?\n\nIf more context about my current skill level or interests would help you give better pointers, just ask — happy to answer.\n\nThanks in advance for any no-BS, grounded input. Not chasing get-rich-quick, just trying to turn spare hours into something that pays for coffee without wasting months on dead-end hype.\n\nAppreciate you.",

Charge per setup + a small monthly fee.\n\n\n\n– Reconciliation helpers: automate matching payment confirmations to invoices and send a daily “exceptions” sheet or email for humans to fix.\n\n\n\n– Compliance reminders for small CA offices: n8n watches a Google Sheet of clients and due dates, fires WhatsApp/Email via APIs, and logs who got what.\n\n\n\n– Simple CRM hygiene: dedupe contacts, enrich with basic data, tag by last activity, then send a weekly “follow-up list.”\n\n\n\nTo land first clients: talk to 5–10 small firms you already know (family CA, local traders, ecom sellers), audit their boring tasks, and offer 1 fixed-scope automation for cheap or free in exchange for a testimonial.\n\n\n\nOn tools: I bounce between Make and Zapier for quick tests, then move long-term flows to n8n; I’ve also used Pulse and a few similar tools to scan Reddit for very specific “I wish I could automate X” posts and validate ideas before building anything heavy.\n\n\n\nYou build a tiny portfolio of 3–5 rock-solid automations, write them up in simple language, and your “coffee money” comes from retainers: “I keep this running and tweak things when your process changes.” That’s the main play here.",

Well, I would say, **Master the basics first**.\n\nn8n opportunity grows with your understanding of data flow, not just individual nodes. The more patterns you recognize, the more problems you'll spot. I hope this resources would help you to give a head start.\n\n\\- n8n Workflow, nodes and data-flow: [https://theowllogic.com/n8n-workflow-nodes-data-flow](https://theowllogic.com/n8n-workflow-nodes-data-flow)  \n\\- Webhooks in n8n for beginners: [https://theowllogic.com/webhook-in-n8n-explained](https://theowllogic.com/webhook-in-n8n-explained)  \n\\- How to handle API rate limit: [https://theowllogic.com/how-to-handle-api-rate-limits-in-n8n](https://theowllogic.com/how-to-handle-api-rate-limits-in-n8n)  \n\\- How to handle errors like a pro: [https://theowllogic.com/handle-errors-in-n8n](https://theowllogic.com/handle-errors-in-n8n)\n\nI had to say this, you can't be comfortable when you're get into tech (automation), Don't get too much comfortable with nodes, each and every nodes are different kind of pain, You've to feel that every pain, inside and out - get comfortable being uncomfortable.  (This is my personal experience)\n\nOnce you understood these most mid-tier concepts, then you can try out some internal financial operation (FinOps) concepts to see how does this work? Approach someone for free at first (since you're a commerce student, get a help from a professor, or maybe your colleague), and get their feedback, and go with constant feedback loop. then you can understand the market demand.\n\nOnce you analyzed the demand, pivot the strategy. Once you have enough knowledge to maintain a workflow and market yourself. you can easily make some bucks.\n\nJust try to showcase your work, ah you can try here as well, but most of the demos are not worth it in my opinion. so go with youtube, tiktok, and write a medium or blog about the journey, and what problem you're going to solve.\n\nGood luck, if you have any clarifications or hiccups, feel free to share.",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI run a small automation company and I’m looking for someone comfortable with n8n and AI automations to join the team as a freelancer/contractor.\n\nIt’s totally fine if you’re newer to this. Curiosity, ability to pick things up quickly, and actually wanting to learn matter more than years of experience. This is a good fit if you want to build real automation skills, understand how projects are scoped and delivered in the real world, get some client exposure, and potentially take on more responsibility over time.\n\nMost of the time I’ll handle the high-level architecture and client direction, and you’ll help build and implement workflows in n8n. That said, I’m not looking for someone who needs constant hand-holding or just executes tasks blindly. The goal is to reduce workload on my side, not add more. I’m happy to guide, review, and unblock you, but I need someone who can think independently, make reasonable decisions, and flag issues or improvements without being prompted. If you have ideas or see a better way to do something, I want to hear it.\n\nYou’ll be working on real client projects using tools like Zoho, ClickUp, Slack, Typeform, GHL, Instantly, Stripe, etc. Down the line you may also join client calls when it makes sense.\n\nYou should be comfortable with n8n, APIs, JavaScript for data transformations, Postgres/SQL, LLMs. The ability to quickly learn new tools is essential. Good English and availability during UK hours are required.\n\nBeyond the technical side, understanding how companies operate is just as important. You’re not just wiring nodes together, you’re solving real business problems. If you care about building workflows that are reliable, maintainable, and don’t break after two runs, we’ll likely work well together.\n\nPlease submit your application through this form: [ https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4 ](https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4)\n\nCompany website: [ https://innovaquest.ai ](https://innovaquest.ai)\n\nCompany name: InnovaQuest",

Initially, this was just an experiment to see if the workflow even made sense in the real world.\n\nBut what surprised me was how receptive Indian businesses have been to this idea.\n\nA lot of local businesses here genuinely want a structured way to manage reviews. Not to fake anything, but to avoid chaos. Missed reviews, unmanaged negative feedback, and no time to reply consistently are very common problems.\n\nHere’s what the system does in simple terms:\n\nCustomers are asked for feedback through a link.\n\nIf the rating is 3 stars or below, the feedback is stored privately so the business can address it internally.\n\nIf the rating is 4 or 5 stars, the customer is guided to leave a public review on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nOn top of that:\n\nIt tracks who clicks the review link and who doesn’t\n\nKeeps everything logged in one place\n\nAutomatically replies to new Google reviews using AI\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many Indian business owners don’t want more tools, dashboards, or complexity. They want something that quietly works in the background and improves their online reputation without daily effort.\n\nI can’t speak much about how foreign businesses would react to this, but locally, there’s genuine interest and adoption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/636a4qc31aeg1.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=be305629b3c148d1529f337219b81486d676b4c9\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone else seeing similar behavior in their region?\n\nAre there any obvious downsides or ethical concerns I should think about?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives.\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants, I can also break down how the workflow is built in n8n.",

      "text": "Let’s be honest for a second: **Generative AI for end-to-end scheduling is a recipe for disaster in a professional environment.**\n\nI run an automation course with over **1,900 students**. For months, I’ve been delaying the release of our \"AI Scheduling Module.\" Why? Because I refuse to teach my students a solution that I know will fail them (and their clients) at least 5% of the time.\n\nI’ve tried everything in **n8n**:\n\n* Advanced Prompt Engineering\n* Direct Tool Calling with Google Calendar/Cal.com\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n* Multi-step verification loops\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good the model is. AI is probabilistic. It \"hallucinates\" time zones, it misses double-booking logic, or it simply fails to confirm a slot correctly.\n\n**The \"Human Error\" Fallacy:** People often say, *\"Well, humans make mistakes too.\"* Sure, but the market is significantly less tolerant of a machine's failure. If an AI messes up a CEO's calendar or double-books a high-ticket consultation, it doesn't look like a \"mistake\"it looks like a broken, amateur system. For professional services, 99% isn't enough. It has to be 100%.\n\n**The only solution that actually works 100% of the time:** After months of testing, I’ve concluded that the only \"pro\" way to do this is a hybrid model:\n\n1. **AI for Pre-qualification:** Let the AI handle the lead gen, answer questions, and build rapport.\n2. **Deterministic UI for Booking:** Once the lead is ready, the AI drops a link (Cal.com, tidycal, etc.) for the user to pick a slot.\n\nIt might not look as \"magical\" as a full chat-to-calendar booking, but it’s the only way to ensure the data is right every single time.\n\n**I want to hear from you:** Am I being too cynical, or are you guys also struggling with the reliability gap in conversational scheduling? Has anyone *actually* deployed a 100% fail-proof conversational booking system in production, or are we all just chasing a ghost?",

For the actual 'writing to the database' part, `if/else` and deterministic logic are king.\n\nThe reason people try to force AI into this is the **unstructured conversational layer** that comes before the booking. A simple script can't easily handle a lead saying:\n\n*'I’m travelling next week, but I might be free Thursday afternoon if my flight isn't delayed. Also, does your service cover VAT for European companies?'*\n\nAI is great for:\n\n1. **Contextual Qualification:** Understanding if the lead is even worth a meeting.\n2. **Handling Objections:** Answering those 'by the way' questions before the booking.\n3. **Intent Extraction:** Identifying that the user *wants* to book even when they don't use a specific keyword.\n\nMy argument is that we should use AI for that messy human interaction, but the second it’s time to actually pick a slot, we should hand it over to a deterministic system (the 'if/else' world). Trying to make the AI perform the logic of 'find slot -> check timezone -> verify conflict -> write' is where the 5% failure rate kills the UX.",

And this is why a lot of CEO's fail their projects. \n\nI don't know if you're an engineer or not, I'll try to do this argument without assuming it:\n\nWhen you study engineering for making a technical tool, you start by knowing that the user will ALWAYS get wrong the tool, so you have to do it like is for a child learning to read and even then, there's still probability of misusing. So, why in all hell you will allow the user to write \"I'm traveling next week...\".\n\nWhy in hell you will allow something like that? You study the booking process to the bone and automate it so the user receives a message like \n- \"Hi, *name*, which booking you want today? *Flight *Hotel *Uber\"\n- User just click button \n- Another message \"Please write the country\" \n- User write the country\n- You completely assume user will write wrong the country name, so you sanitize with model\n- \"To confirm, you have indicated country ****\"\n- User clicks *yes\n- \"Do you want to know information on VAT for this particular booking to *country?\"\n- User click yes\n- Model will start searching on it with a hell of a good prompt so you don't allow hallucination because there's no conversation before that...\n\nAnd so and so on, this is just the tip of the iceberg, so when you create a tool, ANY TOOL, no matter what, you have to assume that user is a stupid dumbass, ALWAYS. So stop creating tools that have to work with a message that was written by a stupid person. \n\nYour 5% failure it's because you're allowing the user, meaning you because I'm assuming you are the test case, to write whatever the hell he wants and not expect failure. \n\nThat's basic engineering process that you need to know before creating a tool...",

Imagine telling a client: *'Hey, our AI is great! It only messes up your schedule once every 20 or 100 appointments.'* That’s not an 'operational enhancement'; that’s a reputation killer.\n\nRegarding **HITL (Human-In-The-Loop)**: If I have to hire a human to babysit the AI and verify every single checkpoint, I haven't scaled the business I've just added a layer of expensive complexity. The goal of automation is to remove the bottleneck, not to create a new one where a human has to constantly click 'Approve'.\n\nThe 'AI Pre-qualification + Deterministic Link' combo gives you:\n\n1. **0% hallucination risk** on the final booking.\n2. **100% scalability** without human intervention.\n3. **Professional UX** where the user feels in control.\n\nIn the professional world, reliability isn't a 'value proposition'—it's a requirement.

Which has been the industry standard for years. The AI chatbot is doing what a 4-field intake form does, just with more latency and maintenance overhead.\n\nThe only scenario where conversational booking genuinely adds value is voice/phone, where you can't drop a link.

If it guesses wrong, you lose the client.\n2. **The 'Change of Mind' Loop:** In a chat, users change their minds mid-sentence. *'Book me for 10 AM... wait, make it 11 AM... actually, is there a slot after lunch?'* LLMs often struggle to maintain the 'source of truth' in long, messy conversations, leading to corrupted data entry.\n3. **Implicit Intent:** A user might say *'I'm free after my 2 PM meeting.'* An AI has to guess when that meeting ends. A calendar link makes the user take responsibility for the slot.\n\nYour suggestion of 'confirmation emails' and 'error-handling links' just proves my point: if you need a safety net for when the AI fails, then the AI-led booking is the weak link.\n\nI’d rather provide a **100% fail-proof experience** by using AI for what it's best at (qualifying and chatting) and a deterministic UI for what it's best at (booking data). 95% accuracy is a 100% failure in the professional world.",

If each of them deploys this to just 10 clients, and each client has 100 appointments, we are talking about **nearly 2 million interactions**. A 0.5% failure rate (your 5 in 1000) means **10,000 broken appointments**. That’s 10,000 angry customers and 1,900 students overwhelmed with support tickets and reputation damage.\n\n**This is exactly why I’ve been delaying the module.** In professional automation, 'mostly works' is a liability at scale.\n\n**That being said, I’m 100% serious about learning:** If you’ve managed to reduce hallucinations to that level using a pure conversational flow (scheduling, rescheduling, and deletion) without a deterministic bridge, I want to see it.\n\n**Here is my offer:** If you can share a video demonstration of your workflow handling complex, messy human inputs and show me the logic that guarantees this 99.5% reliability, **I will personally pay you for a masterclass.** I’m not here to be right; I’m here to find the best solution for my students.\n\nIf your solution is truly that robust, you shouldn't just be commenting—you should be teaching it.

If you have 2 million entries, you certainly shouldn't use N8N to manage the service flow. Low-code tools don't handle large volumes of requests well.\n\n\nFor the reality you mentioned, I believe there are no problems. If you want something closer to 100% accuracy, just spend a little more and add a verification LLM with access to a RAG with at least 500 examples of successful conversations (which isn't expensive either). As I mentioned, the problem wasn't with the scheduling flow or a failure in interpreting information; it was simply a hallucination like any other, which can happen in all LLMSs at any point in the conversation.\n\n\nFurthermore, when it comes to AI, nothing will ever be 100% reliable. Anthropic knows this, as do OpenAI and Google. The issue isn't that AI... Making fewer mistakes (which I also believe to be true) is the consistency and speed with which she executes tasks, and that's what truly matters to serious companies.

      "text": "I started studying automation in January of last year to work for a friend who accepted a marketing position but knew nothing about automation and needed to use it every day.\n\nI spent about 3 months with him doing this type of service, studying, learning, and applying. After 3 months, I made a mass mailing incorrectly, and instead of sending emails to 1000 leads, I sent them to about 50,000. The loss was quite high, and my friend wasn't very happy with the company anymore and ended up leaving after this mishap.\n\nI have ADHD and use cannabis, so lack of concentration is something that bothers me a bit during the day. So I created a checklist to prevent problems like this from happening again (so far, it's working). When I left that company, I thought about selling AI agents, and that's exactly what I did. I got a law firm to pay for my service, and I've had that contract active ever since. It's an AI agent for customer service and appointment scheduling that closes about 25 clients on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had much success working on a contract basis because I'm not a very good salesperson, and people in my city don't value that kind of service very much. Because of that, I had to look for a job.\n\nLast October I started a full-time job at an English language school. The pay is reasonable, and I learn a lot every day. So far, I've implemented an agent to assist students who have problems with the platform, an AI agent to respond to WhatsApp leads, and several HR automations, from candidate analysis to the entire hiring process that was previously done manually. I'm very happy with the service delivery; I've already managed to save about 830 hours of work per month that previously required a person to be available to do.\n\nI see many people here wondering if it's possible to make money with automation, and the answer is yes. You'll hardly make money selling workflows, but it's a very valuable service that companies are only now starting to seek. Selling services didn't work out the first time, but I'm already working on my second attempt this year, and I think everything will work out. If you are technically good and dedicated to delivering a quality service that will make a difference, there's certainly a place for you in the market.",

Way better - I'm building a small SaaS and not even close to hitting limits.\n\nHere's what's weird though - a lot of the automation ideas I used to build in n8n, I'm now just describing them to Claude Code and it's... building actual apps? With UIs and everything? And they run faster than my workflows used to.\n\nI'm not trying to say \"ditch n8n\" or promote anything - genuinely want to know if others have noticed this too.

Images and text are handled as separate objects internally, which is why media libraries lose the associated product code. Most Chrome extensions work by DOM scraping and are unstable or unsafe.\n\nThe only production-safe way I’ve seen this solved is by using WhatsApp Business API (directly or via Twilio). In that setup, each message arrives as a single payload: image + caption + metadata. From there you can route everything through n8n to:\n\t•\tdownload the image\n\t•\textract or validate the product code\n\t•\tgenerate PDFs or structured records\n\t•\tforward the result to an API or database\n\nThere is a technical breakdown of this exact document-extraction pattern (files, images, OCR, AI structuring, conditional routing). WhatsApp just becomes one of the ingestion channels:\n\nhttps://aistartmeup.com/n8n-extract-text/",

There’s no nice, user‑friendly interface out of the box.Right now my options are basically hack together forms that hit n8n webhooks, build small custom dashboards in React / Retool / Bubbl, or manually trigger things for them in the n8n UI (which obviously doesn’t scale).

So we made it agentic, where the agent orchestrates the nodes. The agent has some instructions to do this.\n\n\\- Then the next reality we discovered was exactly this. Most users don't interact with n8n because the UI doesn't work for consumers. You need to do the bulk iterative work and populate the outcome in a google sheet. But there needs to be some follow up actions which you may wanna perform on some select rows. We realized that our agentic approach already has the foundations for this. And we are currently solving this.\n\nI would love to share the solution with you and get some feedback",

      "text": "If you're running n8n self-hosted, update immediately. Cyera Research Labs has disclosed a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to take complete control of n8n instances without credentials, affecting approximately 100,000 servers globally.\n\n# What's the issue?\n\nThe vulnerability exploits a Content-Type mismatch bug in how n8n processes Form webhook requests. The middleware that parses HTTP requests decides which parser to use based on the Content-Type header, but the \"Form Webhook Node\" doesn't properly validate this header before processing files. An attacker can change the Content-Type from multipart/form-data to application/json and send a crafted payload that completely overrides the req.body.files object, including the file path that n8n will process.\n\nThis enables arbitrary file reads from the system, but critically, it also exposes the local SQLite database (/home/node/.n8n/database.sqlite) and the configuration file containing the encryption secret. With these files, an attacker can forge a valid admin session cookie and authenticate without credentials. Once inside, they simply create a workflow with the \"Execute Command\" node to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n# Why this is dangerous\n\nN8n acts as the central nervous system for automation infrastructure, connecting Google Workspace, OpenAI, payment processors... Compromising an n8n instance means gaining access to many stored credentials, OAuth tokens, and secrets, becoming a single point of failure that exposes your entire digital infrastructure.\n\n# Mitigations - Immediate action required\n\nUpdate to n8n v1.121.0 or later as soon as possible. No official workarounds exist for this vulnerability. Additionally, avoid exposing n8n directly to the internet without VPN or additional authentication, and require authentication on all public forms. If you suspect prior compromise, rotate all credentials stored in n8n.\n\n**Important note**: This vulnerability primarily affects **self-hosted deployments** (Docker, manual installation). n8n Cloud instances are not exposed in the same way.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported on November 9, 2025, patched on November 18, and the CVE was assigned on January 6, 2026. Full technical analysis available at: [https://www.cyera.com/research-labs/ni8mare-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-in-n8n-cve-2026-21858](https://www.cyera.com/research-labs/ni8mare-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-in-n8n-cve-2026-21858)\n\nIt's worth taking a look; it's very well explained and easy to understand...",

      "text": "\\*The text was made with the help of AI; everything is real. I just used it to make it better to read\\*  \nHi everyone! I’ve been lurking in this community for a while (big fan of Nate’s content, especially the \"Agency Trap\" video), and I finally decided to share my situation to get some perspective from those who have walked this path before.\n\n**🧑‍💻 The Context (Where I am now)** I’m 18 years old, living in Brazil. Currently, I’m splitting my day between two very different realities:\n\n1. **The \"Safe\" Job:** An internship at a swimming school. It pays the bills (\\~$200/mo), but it’s soul-sucking. I spend my mornings counting inventory (literally counting swim caps) and doing random manual tasks. Zero learning curve.\n2. **The \"Dream\" Job:** I work as a contractor for a small local Tech Company. I build automations using n8n, Typebot, OpenAI, and Evolution API (WhatsApp). I’ve already built some cool stuff, like a full RAG AI Agent for a Pie Shop that handles audio, video, and text orders via WhatsApp.\n\n**🚧 The Crossroads** Right now, my income is split 50/50 between these two. But the internship is draining my energy and time that I could be using to level up my hard skills. I’ve decided to quit the internship next month to go **all-in** on automation. It’s scary because I’m losing the \"guaranteed\" income, but I live with my parents (low expenses), so I feel like now is the time to take risks.\n\n**🚀 The Master Plan (Next 3-6 Months)** Here is the strategy I drafted. I’d love to know if I’m being delusional or if this makes sense:\n\n* **1. The \"Intrapreneur\" Pivot:** Instead of trying to start a full-blown \"Agency\" from scratch (and falling into the trap of doing admin work instead of coding), I plan to leverage my position at the Tech Company. I have a network of business owners (leads). My plan is to warm them up, pass them to my company’s sales team, and take a commission + get paid to build the implementation. This lets me focus on **building** and learning, while having a safety net.\n* **2. The \"Productized\" Freelancer:** I plan to hit the global market (Fiv3rr/Upwork) to leverage the currency difference (earning in USD while living in BRL is a cheat code).\n   * *Strategy:* Instead of selling \"I will do n8n automation,\" I want to sell specific outcomes. E.g., \"I will build a WhatsApp AI Receptionist for Restaurants.\"\n   * *Portfolio:* I’m recording case studies of my past projects (like the Pie Shop bot) to use as video proof.\n* **3. Content Creation:** I’m reviving my YouTube channel. Not to be a \"guru,\" but to document the process. One video showing *how* I solved a specific business problem with n8n, serving as a portfolio piece to send to potential clients.\n\n**❓ My Questions for You Veterans:**\n\n1. **Fiv3rr/Upwork:** Is it still viable for beginners? I see people selling complex workflows for $50, which scares me. Is there room for high-ticket ($500+) if the offer is good?\n2. **The Skill Gap:** I’m comfortable with n8n and basic JS. What is the *one* hard skill you wish you learned earlier that gave you the biggest ROI? (SQL? Python? Sales?)\n3. **General Advice:** If you were 18 again, with time to learn but limited budget, what would you focus on in the first 30 days after quitting your day job?\n\nThanks for reading this wall of text. The content here has been a game-changer for me. Any feedback—good or bad—is appreciated!\n\n  \n\\*The text was made with the help of AI; everything is real. I just used it to make it better to read\\*",

It sounds like you went through the wringer, and I respect the hustle to bounce back as a Data Analyst.\n\nI think I might have buried the lead in my post: I actually **already have** the \"tech job\" part covered (or at least started).\n\nI currently hold two positions:\n\n1. The Internship (manual labor at a swimming school).\n2. A Contractor Role at a local Tech Company (building n8n flows).\n\nMy \"survival number\" is very low since I live with my parents, and the **Tech Company role alone covers my expenses**. So, I’m not jumping into the void with $0 income. I’m quitting the manual labor internship specifically to double down on the Tech role and use the extra 30 hours/week to upskill and freelance on the side.\n\nDoes that context change your perspective, or do you still think it's too risky given your experience? Keep in mind I'm 18 years old, so even if I do go through a struggle, I think it's the best time to risk doing so",

Upwork, expect to be competing with 50 other offers for a project, but to be honest, there are so few N8N only gigs, you need to have a wider skillset to make it work and they are often more on the complex side. \n\n2 - Business experience. Unfortunately the YouTube crowd dont live in the real world...automating social media, email campaigns, rag agents, etc arent what paying clients want. If you want to engage with real businesses you need to have an idea about what small/medium sized businesses do on a day to day basis, what the pain points are.. I'm not sure how you'd go about leaning without direct experience. All I'll say is, expect the weird ;) I cant believe how some businesses operate in the 21st century! Dont expect clean software stacks, dont expect organised data. \n\n3 - General advice, dont quit your day job. Focus on this in your spare time. I feel like you need a reality check..the YouTubers will tell you that there is money to be made in this field, and there is - however NONE of those people make a dollar selling automation services. They are content creators, they want you hooked on their channels, they want you to click their links, join their paid groups... there have been people here who have been scammed out of thousands from these people. Dont believe a word they say. Steer clear of social media automations, you wont build these in real life, 9/10 it's going to be boring data automations. Focus on sales and building your own sales funnel, direct outreach to businesses, dont undersell yourself but dont charge stupid money for a workflow - sell a delivered project with a retainer/maintenance plan and charge per day ie $300 a day to deliver the project.",

I’m already noticing that real businesses usually need boring data plumbing (ERP -> CRM) rather than flashy AI agents. And yes, dealing with messy, unorganized data is a nightmare I need to prepare for.\n\nHowever, I need to clarify the \"Don't quit your day job\" part. The job I'm quitting isn't a corporate role where I'm learning business logic. It's an internship at a swimming school where I spend my days counting inventory (swim caps), replying to Instagram DMs, and making Canva posts.\n\nOn top of that, I lose hours (literally) every day on a crowded bus commuting there. It’s draining my sanity and time without teaching me anything about the \"real business world\" you mentioned.\n\nBy quitting, I’m shifting my full focus to my **other** current role (contractor at a local Tech Company), where I actually face those \"messy software stacks\" and learn sales. I figure trading the swim school for more hours at the Tech Company is a net positive for my skills, even if it's riskier financially.",

Sell the outcome, not the tool. The people selling complex workflows for $50 are racing to the bottom and burning out. Let them. Your competition isn't the $50 guy, it's the client not knowing this solution exists. The video case studies are smart, I'd use them from day 1.\n\nHighest ROI skill Everyone's saying sales and they're right, but I'll add something very specific. S*coping*. Learning to accurately estimate what something will take and communicating that clearly prevents 90% of project disasters. Bad scoping kills freelancers faster than bad code. Bad communication I general.\n\nFirst 30 days Don't spread thin across Upwork + YouTube + the tech company hustle all at once. Pick one channel, get it working, then add another. Probably the tech company path first since you already have the relationship and leads. Stack a few wins there, get case studies,*then* hit Upwork with proof. At least for me, when I do multiple things at once, nothing gets done well.\n\nYou're 18 with low expenses and a safety net. This is exactly when to take the shot. Worst case you learn a ton and go get a job in a year with way better skills. Im all for it though.

The $50 gigs are a race to the bottom you can't win. Your productized approach is the only way. \"WhatsApp AI Receptionist for Restaurants\" is perfect. Price it at $500+ by showing the math: \"This saves your staff 10 hours a week of phone duty.\" You're selling an outcome, not hours. Tbh, I found better clients on LinkedIn by just posting case studies.\n\n2. **Skill Gap**: Sales. 100%. Not \"sales\" as in sleazy pitches, but learning how to discover a business's actual pain points and translate them into a technical solution. Your \"intrapreneur\" pivot is smart because it forces you into that conversation. SQL/Python are great, but communication pays the bills first.\n\n3. **First 30 days**: I'd spend it solely on building 2-3 killer public case studies (like your pie shop bot) and doing outreach. Don't get lost in tutorial hell. Start conversations with those business owner leads *immediately*.\n\nAlso, re: WhatsApp automationbeen there. Building custom flows with Evolution API is cool but can become a maintenance headache. I started using Popcorn AI for some client projects because it handles the whole commerce side inside WhatsApp, which clients love. Not perfect for everything, but it let me focus on the broader automation strategy instead of rebuilding a checkout system every time.\n\nYour biggest risk is time management after quitting.

So I get where you come from. Brazilians like Tech, and innovation. If you build a N8N routine, that works as an assistant that  answers WhatsApp messages and plans appointments or handles questions before they forward the call, for a small company ( A ready product, where you just add other values) and then sell them , for starters, you could do way better.  Look for restaurants, pet shops or whatever is close to you and test it there. Learn the needs of your client. Start small. Well the product and offer monthly maintenance for a fee. When you have  some clients, and you won't need a lot, quit your job. I did the same. For me it was similar. I  had a wife who supported me, until it was working well.",

          "text": "My advice is to leverage your internship. Ask your manager to show you what the inventory information is used for.\nIs this for accounting purposes? Cost of goods sold analysis, or job costing?\n\n Use this scenario: if you were to build a competitor to your current company, how could you build automations to cut existing roles? How can you build lean businesses using automations? \n\nAs a business owner myself, I can tell you that the only way you could pitch me is through a referral or if I attended a conference where you spoke. Speaking at a reputable conference or organization will require a real story, about business functions and departments. At the end of the day businesses (medium sized is where your market lives) want you, not n8n.\n\n Honestly, I'd leave the whole n8n portion out of it and just market yourself as a systems engineering firm or ai consultancy.",
