Still n8n has the option for pdf text extraction. I just rebuilt it anyway more for an experimentation. \n\nWith custom nodes, there is creative freedom to use whatever library we need and build custom business logic on top of it.\n\nTesseract.js might be better than the node I’ve built right now. But who knows.... if the community gets their hands on this open-source project and contributes value, this could become an all-rounder node. At least there’s a possibility (blindly being positive lol).\n\nAnd this was more like an learning & experiment project for me... so nothing serious 🤝",

We're just doing the same amount of work, slightly faster, and then filling the gaps with more busywork.\n\nHere's what's bugging me:\nEveryone online is like \"AI automation will 10x your productivity!\" but I'm not seeing it translate to anything meaningful. We respond to tickets faster but customers aren't happier. \n\nWe update the CRM automatically but deals aren't closing faster. We're generating reports nobody reads in half the time.\n\nIt feels like we automated the easy stuff that doesn't actually matter and now I'm not sure what to do next.\n\nFor people who've actually seen real results:\nWhat did you automate that actually moved the needle on something that matters (revenue, retention, whatever)?\n\nHow do you figure out what's worth automating vs what's just... fine to keep doing manually?\n\nAm I measuring this wrong? Like should I be looking at different stuff?\n\nI'm not trying to trash AI automation - I genuinely think there's something here - I just feel like I'm missing the plot.\n\nAnyone else been in this spot? \nWhat did you do differently?",

If a business isn't optimising their prices (either lower to get higher volume or higher because there is headroom) then money is being left on the table.\n\n\nDoesn't technically require AI but AI can make price optimisation easier (e.g. often need to include competitor pricing and market sentiment to understand pricing).\n\n\nIt's easy to work solely on repeatable tasks and saving time but you need to have the buy-in to eventually make headcount redundant to realise those savings (and I'm genuinely concerned that when companies start to go more AI then AI companies will ramp up their token cost and suddenly your wage bill isn't under your control anymore - your business will collapse if you don't pay the AI racketeers)",

Most teams automate for efficiency first because it is easy to measure, but efficiency alone rarely moves revenue or retention.\n\nThe pattern I see is this: if an automation does not directly change a customer decision or an internal decision, it just creates speed without leverage. Faster ticket responses do not help if the underlying issue is expectation setting. Cleaner CRM data does not help if it is not used to change follow ups or offers.\n\nThe automations that actually move the needle usually sit closer to decision points. Things like qualifying leads differently, changing what happens after a key customer action, or forcing clearer next steps for sales and success teams.\n\nA simple test is to ask: if this automation disappeared tomorrow, would a customer notice or would revenue change? If the answer is no, it is probably convenience automation, not growth automation.",

See if you can create flows or automations that would make their job redundant. Take the amount your company saves and ask your boss for a 20% cut as a bonus. \n\nOne of my clients has an agency do lot of manual work, for hundreds of euros per day. I’m trying to automate that. \n\nI don’t know what business your in, but you can also sell (or provide for free) an add on that is powered by AI. Example : I’m creating a NotebookLM with the whole project for a client. It’s regularly updated. They can ask it any question with instant answer instead of waiting for me or going through docs.",

Since people need support for courses that have already been sold, it allows me to provide support without paying additional salaries that would generate more profit. \n\n3.

          "text": "Reddit Response - r/n8n Automation ROI Question\nYou're not crazy - you diagnosed it yourself: \"We automated the easy stuff that doesn't actually matter.\"\nThe issue is you're measuring activity (tickets touched, CRM updated, reports generated) instead of outcomes (revenue, retention, conversion). Most automation advice online optimizes for the wrong thing.\nWhat Actually Moves the Needle\n1. Lead Response Speed\nThis is the highest ROI automation most businesses ignore. Stats show responding to inbound leads within 5 minutes makes you 21x more likely to qualify them. Most companies respond in 42+ hours.\nOne automation - webhook catches lead, AI sends immediate personalized response, human gets notified with context - can increase conversion 30-50%. Not \"time saved\" - actual revenue.\nCost: ~$50-100/month (n8n + Twilio + AI API)\n2. Context-Aware Routing (Not Just Speed)\nYour observation that \"we respond to tickets faster but customers aren't happier\" is telling. Speed without intelligence is just fast noise.\nWhat works: AI classifies urgency AND intent, high-value leads get immediate human attention, low-value gets automated nurture. Your team stops wasting time on tire-kickers and focuses on closeable deals.\n3. Behavior-Triggered Follow-Up\n\"CRM updates automatically but deals aren't closing faster\" = CRM is updated, but nobody's acting on it.\nInstead of arbitrary \"day 3 check-in\" sequences, trigger based on behavior:\nNo response in 48 hours → different approach\nOpened email 3x but didn't reply → phone call\nVisited pricing page → sales gets alert NOW\nThis 2-3x close rates on existing pipeline because you're reaching people at decision moments.\n4. Alerts, Not Reports\n\"Generating reports nobody reads in half the time\" - reports answer questions nobody asked.\nSwitch to alerts:\n\"Deal stalled 2 weeks\" → notification to owner\n\"Customer mentioned competitor\" → escalation\n\"Unusual pattern detected\" → investigation\nInformation delivered at the moment someone can act on it, not filed in a folder.\nThe Framework\nAutomate:\nRevenue-adjacent touchpoints (lead response, follow-up, conversion moments)\nPattern detection humans miss (sentiment shifts, churn signals)\nSpeed-sensitive actions where timing matters\nIntelligence routing (right person to right problem)\nDon't Automate:\nReports for reporting's sake\nData entry disconnected from decisions\n\"Productivity\" metrics measuring motion not progress\nTasks that give people information they won't act on\nHow to Measure It\nStop tracking \"time saved\" and start tracking:\nLead-to-qualified conversion rate\nAverage deal velocity (days from first touch to close)\nResponse time on high-intent actions\nRevenue per lead source\nIf automation improved something and revenue didn't move, you automated the wrong thing.\nThe 10x productivity claim isn't wrong - it's just that most people apply it to busywork instead of revenue. You correctly identified that. Now point it at the stuff that actually matters.",

      "text": "There is a massive amount of \"he-said, she-said\" in this sub about building a SaaS on top of n8n. Some people say you need to cough up for an Embed license the second you charge a customer. Others say you can do whatever you want if you self-host.\n\n\n\nBoth are wrong.\n\nI’ve been digging through the official forums and specifically looking at replies from Jan (n8n founder) to clarify the Sustainable Use License (SUL). If you’re building a product, here is the playbook to stay legal and avoid a surprise bill.\n\n# The \"Whose Credentials\" Rule\n\nThe single most important factor is whose API keys n8n is using. Jan’s logic follows a \"Chef\" analogy:\n\nThe Green Zone (Standard SUL)\n\nThe Chef (n8n) uses the restaurant’s ingredients (Your company’s API keys) to cook a meal and hands it to the waiter (Your Frontend).\n\n* **The Model:** Your SaaS acts as a service provider. You use your OpenAI key or your SendGrid key to process a request and return a result.\n* **Identity:** It doesn’t matter if your users \"Login with Google\" to your app. As long as those user tokens aren't being passed into n8n nodes to act on their behalf, you are 100% fine.\n\nThe Red Zone (Embed License Required)\n\nThe Chef asks the customer for their house keys (User OAuth Tokens), drives to their home, and cooks in their personal kitchen.\n\n* **The Model:** If your SaaS \"manages the user's inbox\" or \"posts to the user's Twitter\" by putting their credentials into an n8n node, you need a commercial agreement.\n* **The Loophole:** You cannot bypass this by using a generic HTTP Request node to send user tokens. Jan was clear: if n8n connects to a user’s service at runtime, it’s a restricted use case.\n\n# The \"External Connection\" Strategy (The Workaround)\n\nThis is how you build a powerful SaaS without needing the Embed license immediately. You handle the \"connection\" layer outside of n8n.\n\n**The Architecture:**\n\n1. **App Side:** Your custom code handles OAuth and stores the tokens.\n2. **The Handover:** Your app fetches the data (the email text, the lead info) and sends **only the raw data** to an n8n webhook.\n3. **Processing:** n8n does the logic/AI and returns the result to your app.\n4. **Execution:** Your app (not n8n) uses the user’s token to push the final action.\n\nBecause n8n never \"leaves the restaurant\" to touch the user's account directly, this counts as internal processing.\n\n# The Roadmap (Q1 2026)\n\nJan recently mentioned they are working on a shift for Q1 2026. The goal is to allow Enterprise licenses to cover these multi-user credential cases, as long as you aren’t white-labeling the n8n UI.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\n* **MVPs:** You’re allowed to test and build.\n* **Public Launch:** If n8n touches user keys, call Sales.\n* **Data Processing:** If n8n uses your keys or just processes data your app fetches, you’re good to go.\n\nAll of this is pulled from Jan’s direct replies on the forums. Stop guessing and build the right architecture from day one.",

Keep it simple.”\n\nFor the **text**, I usually generate it separately (I use Claude, but anything works):  \n– describe the workflow  \n– focus on the user problem  \n– keep it short\n\nThen I paste that content back into Gemini and ask it to fill the site.\n\n# Hosting\n\nSince it’s just static files, I host it using **DigitalOcean App Platform**:  \n– push files to GitHub  \n– connect repo to App Platform  \n– site goes live\n\nNo servers, no droplets.\n\nIf I want to change anything later, I just edit the GitHub files and it auto-updates.\n\n# Why I like this approach\n\n• fast  \n• no frontend stress  \n• good enough for sharing or validation  \n• works well with n8n-style tools\n\nI made a short video showing this flow end-to-end, but honestly the steps above are the whole thing.\n\n And here is a link to the video if you'd like a more in-depth tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA)\n\nIf anyone here is doing something similar (or better), I’d like to know how you handle landing pages for n8n projects.\n\nPS: English isn't my first language, so I've used ChatGPT to polish this post and write it professionally.",

I did come across it multiple times while researching free hosting options.\n\nThe main reason I went with DigitalOcean is my typical use case: once a landing page is live, I usually run Facebook ads and drive paid traffic to it. Based on what I’d read earlier, GitHub Pages is great for static sites, but I wasn’t fully confident about performance under ad-driven traffic spikes, especially in terms of speed, load handling, and auto-scaling.\n\nWith DigitalOcean, I get peace of mind around traffic surges, auto-balancing, and predictable performance when ads suddenly push a lot of users to the page.\n\nThat said, if GitHub Pages can handle high traffic reliably with good performance (especially via CDN), I’m absolutely open to using it. In fact, I’m planning to give GitHub Pages a proper try this weekend and test it under real conditions.\n\nAlways happy to optimize for simpler and cheaper setups if they genuinely hold up in production.",

Actually, this tutorial focuses on creating a landing page to showcase your n8n workflows rather than integrating directly with n8n itself.\n\nThe landing page is generated using Gemini and hosted on DigitalOcean, which means it operates independently without requiring a direct n8n connection for the basic setup.\n\nIf you do need to connect to n8n, that would typically be for specific use cases like payment processing or user registration management.

              "text": "gracias pero, mi Español no es bueno,\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ax7_QNZZ-pk?si=rPtpzJvr1sO23HzP\n\n\n TL;DR - [ English ] inglés transcript\n\n\nThis video explains how to create and deploy a free Artificial Intelligence (AI) API using Bun, a fast JavaScript runtime, and leverage the free tiers of various AI services like Grock and Cerebras (0:00). The goal is to build an extensible API that avoids subscription fees and credit card requirements.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:\n\n\nIntroduction to Free AI Services: The video highlights how to utilize the free tiers of services like Grock (up to 60 calls/minute) (0:29) and Cerebras (30 requests/minute) (0:45), as well as mentioning Gemini and Open Router for additional free access (0:50). The strategy is to combine these free tiers to extend overall usage (0:47-0:50).\n\n\nSetting up Bun: The first step involves installing Bun on your system, which is a straightforward command-line process (1:08-1:29). After installation, `bun init` is used to create a basic project structure (1:33-1:43).\n\n\nCreating a Basic API with Bun: The video demonstrates how to create a minimal API using `Bun.serve` to listen on a port (e.g., 3000) and respond to requests (1:58-2:32). It also covers setting up `package.json` scripts for easy development and server restarting (3:13-3:25).\n\n\nDeploying the API to Production with Hostinger and Coolify: The creator uses Hostinger VPS (a sponsor) (3:39) and Coolify (4:15), an alternative to services like Vercel or Heroku, for deployment. The process involves installing Coolify on the VPS (4:25-5:03), configuring an `nixpacks.toml` file to guide Coolify on building the Bun project (6:04-6:40), and linking the GitHub repository for automatic deployment (6:42-7:08). The video demonstrates how to access the Coolify panel, connect a repository, and deploy the application (7:13-9:01), including tips on viewing deployment logs (9:04-9:54).\n\n\nIntegrating AI Services (Grock & Cerebras):\nGrock Integration: The video shows how to get an API key from Grock (11:57) and use its SDK to make chat requests (10:29-12:31). The code structure is then refactored to create a reusable `GrockService` function that adheres to a common `AIService` interface (12:38-16:02), utilizing async generator functions with `yield` for streaming responses (14:44-16:02).\nCerebras Integration: Similar to Grock, the process involves obtaining an API key from Cerebras (21:50-22:08) and integrating its SDK into a `CerebrasService` (22:08-23:14).\nImplementing Service Rotation: The core of the free tier strategy is implemented by creating a `get next service` function that cycles through the available AI services (Grock, Cerebras, etc.) using a round-robin approach (16:24-17:19). This ensures that requests are distributed among different services, maximizing the use of their free allowances.\n\n\nAPI Enhancements and Testing: The API is modified to handle POST requests to a `/chat` endpoint (17:21-18:40), streaming responses back to the client as the AI models generate them (18:41-20:07). The video demonstrates testing the API locally using `curl` and observing the service rotation in the console logs (19:31-24:05).\n\n\nConfiguring Environment Variables for Deployment: The API keys for Grock and Cerebras are added as environment variables in Coolify to securely manage credentials in production (25:05-26:02). A redeploy is then performed to apply these changes (25:39-25:45), and the deployed API is tested (26:32-27:10).\n\n\nThe video concludes by reiterating the benefits of building such an API for cost savings and flexibility in using various AI models (27:23-27:52), and encourages viewers to like and subscribe (28:17-28:29).",

These files contain simple descriptions for entities, people, areas, and acts as context for the AI.\n\nSo when I send a query the LLM references it against my Memory Index and follows the wikinks through to gain context. If the query requires device control it references the current states and outputs a Json command back to HA.\n\nIf it requires a Google Search it goes and does that for me in context to my home address if it needs that context.\n\nThere's also a file in the Memory folder containing the last 10 queries and summaries of all previous queries, so it gains context from those files too.\n\nNext step is ironing out a pet peeve of mine with current AI in HA, which is that I cannot ask about previous entity states. So I'm planning on adding files that contain updated past states of entities so I can ask for example how cold the house was last night or when my son left to catch the bus to school.\n\nShare your Json mate, it might help supercharge the development of my project.",

This is important if the users talk to the bot in a conversational manner. For instance a small AI analysis node to determine if the user has likely finished his idea and hence a response should be crafted or if it should wait, aggregate the messages and then craft a response, this can save tokens and make the user experience much better. I implemented this with a time window where it checks for new messages after 30 secs before sending the prompt to the bot, it then either gets sent to a do nothing node or to the bot. So essentially only the last message executes the bot. A condition can also be set up like i said, with a timeout of course, that defaults to aggregating all pending messages.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI got the idea for this side project because a friend of mine wants to start a business and needs to submit a proper business plan for banks and other institutions. He told me his biggest pain is not the writing itself, but not knowing where to start. There are tons of templates out there, but none that he can adapt directly to his idea without making major structural changes first. Most templates feel either too generic or too rigid.\n\nThat’s what triggered the idea of building an AI-powered business plan generator that creates a solid, structured first draft based on a small set of meaningful inputs. The goal is to give founders something they can immediately work with, refine and customize, instead of fighting a template.\n\nThe backend for the MVP is already mostly done and wired together. The current stack looks like this:\n\n* n8n as the backend orchestration layer for the MVP\n* Gemini for writing and structuring the individual business plan chapters\n* [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) for scraping competitor websites and similar businesses\n* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for early research and reasonable benchmark numbers\n* [Json2Doc](https://json2doc.com/) to generate the final output as PDF and DOCX with complex formatting, tables and charts\n* [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) to send the finished document to the user via email after generation\n\nThe product itself is meant to be simple from the user’s perspective. Users answer a short set of high-impact questions and receive a complete, editable business plan draft. Example inputs would be: Problem and target customer Core product or service Revenue model Key competitors Go-to-market approach High-level costs and growth goals\n\nWhat’s still missing: A simple and trustworthy step-based frontend Form (best case with integrated payment functionality) and a secure and maintainable overall setup\n\nHow would you approach the frontend and payments for something like this? And if you’ve created a business plan recently, I’d love to hear what was painful or what you wish a tool like this would do better.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI realized I was wasting way too much time scrolling through junk news sites and RSS feeds, so I decided to build a \"Personal AI Editor\" to filter the noise for me.\n\nThe goal was simple: **Only show me news that actually matters to my specific interests, and summarize it so I don't have to clickbait.**\n\nI built this using **n8n** (self-hosted), and I wanted to share the logic in case anyone else wants to clean up their information diet.\n\n**The Workflow Stack:**\n\n* **Orchestrator:** n8n\n* **Filtering:** OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini is cheap and fast for this)\n* **Research:** Tavily API (for searching/summarizing)\n* **Delivery:** Gmail (SMTP)\n\n**How it works (The Logic):**\n\n1. **Ingest:** The workflow pulls headlines from my favorite RSS feeds every morning.\n2. **The \"Editor\" Agent:** I send each headline to OpenAI with a prompt describing my specific interests (e.g., \"AI automation,\" \"Node.js updates,\" \"Local LLMs\"). The AI assigns a **relevance score (0-10)** to each item.\n3. **The Filter:** A simple `If` node drops anything with a score below 7.\n4. **The Deep Dive:** For the high-scoring items, I pass them to **Tavily**. It searches the web for that topic and writes a concise summary (so I don't have to visit the ad-filled news site).\n5. **The Delivery:** It compiles the summaries into a single email digest and sends it to me once a day.\n\n**One major headache I ran into:** I kept getting \"Connection Lost\" errors because the AI generation took too long. I learned (from reddit community only) you have to configure **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** or adjust the timeout settings in n8n/Node.js to keep the connection alive during long research tasks.\n\n**The Result:** Instead of checking 10 sites, I get 1 email with \\~5 items.\n\nI made a full video walkthrough explaining the setup and sharing the code if you want to build it yourself: (https://youtu.be/mOnbK6DuFhc). Its a low code approach, and prompts and code (JavaScript) is made available, along with the workflow JSON in git ([Git](https://github.com/sojojp-hue/NewsSummarizer))\n\nLet me know if you have questions about the prompt engineering or the SSE setup—happy to help!",

      "text": "I have been running an AI company for almost three years and despite media generation (image, videos and 3d models) was our main focus, we touched different areas since our small team was very diverse in terms of interests, focuses and expertise. \n\nI personally started taking n8n and the whole automation thing seriously in early 2025 and I will say, a good agentic system will sell much better in 2026, so do not lose hope. But there are some facts I think are worth sharing here about n8n. \n\n# Where it helps?\n\nIt's a question I always wanted to answer. My workflows usually were \"customer service automations\" or \"RAG Systems\", but let me give you best things we've ever done with n8n. \n\n* **Telegram Bots** (in general, bots in messengers). If you even developed one of those bots you know how much headache they can cause and n8n just made it much simple for me (and my team). I even recorded a whole course on automating Telegram with n8n, including channel and group management, customer support bots, RAG or even generic \"ChatGPT on Telegram\" thing. \n* **Synthetic Data**. I think one of my best works with n8n is building a flow to generate synthetic data for our small LLM which we've been developing. We've had a data problem and using OpenRouter's API, it became something fantastic. I am not exaggerating on how much time it saved us. We were asleep, it did the heavy lifting for me. \n* **Coding** (not typical $10K/Month BS, actual contribution on a codebase) was also a thing. Although I made it an independent agent later but it still is one best thing I tried. I will make a workflow like what I've done before and I will explain how will it work. It is not low code or no code at all, but it is worth a try. \n* **Market Analysis** (crypto, stock, precious metals, etc) is one big thing you can do. n8n is great at working with API's!\n\nAnd in addition to the above, it is useful for pretty much everything else. But there is one big question and it is... \n\n# Where it does not help?\n\nThere is one simple answer and this is *where you need to scale up constantly.* I don't care how great n8n was for me in past year, I still think if I need scalability, I need to do coding from scratch. \n\nHonestly, the scalability issue is not exclusive to n8n. *All no-code and low-code platforms* have the very same problem so if you want to make a \"business\" using them, keep in mind these are great *to be a part of a bigger picture* and *great to give you an MVP* so consider learning more than making flows using n8n. \n\nAt the end, happy new year 2026 to everyone and I hope your AAA's, flows and everything else work as expected for you.

I am also a backend dev and this is what threw me off: price, accordying to their policies, if you earn any money through any kind of sales, you gotta speak with n8n sales and they charge a lot. Concurrency, idk how it is on better tiers, but on the free one it was terrible. Also the building blocks, i have 16gb of ram (i know its the bare minimum today) and had to run it on a box or all my comouter grinded to a halt. Leave n8n for people who have no technical background or really small tasks, but never for production. Me personally, I would give maybe chatgpt the json with all the nodes (or section by section if too big) and ask it to formulate a plan pr do it directly in cursor/antigravity by hsving the file in a workspace. Great that you wanna lower costs, and great that you wanna ride this wave which is not in the end yet, but differentiate yourself from the rest that can code and buold with proven tools, where you can add security, logging, idempotencd and the like without so much hassle and later keep growing and expanding without having your future devs (if it gets to that) having to scramble around the spaghetti that n8n can become. Dont get me wrong, its a fun and interesting little tool, but I think there are much better alternatives if you have programming experience (and now 10x it with the correct llms)\n\nEdit: you mean you wanna copy and paste (create a new workflow) for each new user? That already seems like overhead and technical debt. It would be much better to have your program containeraized and allow for customization for each user",

If not available, client gives me credentials through a password manager (1Password or similar), never email.

They change something in their store or add a new app and the workflow breaks. Then they blame me even though it's their change that caused it. Now I include basic maintenance/monitoring in ongoing pricing.\n\nAlways separate workflows per client. Their business logic is different, their tools are different, their data needs to stay isolated. Building one app for multiple clients sounds efficient until one client needs a custom change and you break everyone else's stuff.\n\nReal advice - don't optimize for your convenience, optimize for client trust and data security.

In the project instructions, include things like:\n\"ALWAYS use n8n version 1.x\"\n\"Before suggesting a node, verify that it exists in your Notion documentation\"\n\"Don't use deprecated nodes like X, Y, Z\" (list the ones that have given you problems)\n2. The trick that works best for me: before asking him to create a complete flow, I ask him to first list the nodes he's going to use and confirm that they exist. This way, you catch the errors before he generates 50 faulty nodes.\n\n3. Be explicit about versions. Claude sometimes mixes n8n 0.x and 1.x syntax. At each prompt, remind him: \"I'm using n8n version [your version].\"\n\n4. Divide and conquer. Instead of asking for complete flows, ask for small blocks. A trigger + 2-3 nodes. Test it, it works, then move on to the next block.\n\nThe reality is that even with MCPs, Claude needs guidance. MCPs help, but they're not magic.",

I investigated the capabilities of Claude Code and made that transition two weeks ago. Claude Code uses much of the same material I built into my \"stack\" for Claude Desktop, but it also allows me to spawn sub-agents to run work directly on my n8n workflows and Supabase tables.",

Think long-running workflows, orchestration, state, retries, idempotency, failure recovery, data pipelines, ETL-ish stuff, and AI steps inside real backend systems. (what people call \"AI Automation\" & \"AI Agents\")\n\nThe problem is: whenever I search for AI Automation Engineer, I mostly find people doing no-code / low-code stuff with Make, n8n, Zapier...etc. That’s not bad work, but it’s not what I do or want to be associated with. I’m not selling automations to small businesses; I’m trying to work on enterprise / production-grade systems.\n\nWhen I search for Data Engineer, I mostly see analytics, SQL-heavy roles, or content about dashboards and warehouses. When I search for Automation Engineer, I get QA and testing people. When I search for workflow orchestration, ETL, data pipelines, or even agentic AI, I still end up in the same no-code hype circle somehow.\n\nI know people like me exist, because I see them in GitHub issues, Prefect/Airflow discussions. But on X and LinkedIn, I can’t figure out how to consistently find and follow them, or how to get into the same conversations they’re having.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n\\- What do people in this space actually call themselves online?\n\n\\- What keywords do you use to find high-code, production-level automation/orchestration /workflow engineers, not no-code creators or AI hype accounts?\n\n\\- Where do these people actually hang out (X, LinkedIn, GitHub)?\n\n\\- How exactly can I find them on X and LI?\n\nRight now it feels like my work sits between “data engineering”, “backend engineering”, and “AI”, but none of those labels cleanly point to the same crowd I’m trying to learn from and engage with.\n\nIf you’re doing similar work, how did you find your circle?\n\n\n\nP.S: I came from a background where I was creating AI Automation systems using those no-code/low-code tools, then I shifted to do more complex things with \"high-code\", but still the same concepts apply",

It serves as my CMS to maintain records manually and provides an easy method to query and update the data. So nothing special there. I think I had to make a module once for Drupal to call a N8N webhook to embed nomic queries to hit my backend qdrant db once.  The latest version of Drupal has a module to integrate qdrant now I think directly, but I am sure that is best when in the same server. I don’t want to expose my qdrant directly to the public so something like N8N authenticated wekhooks is a nice way to test out the workflow end to end. \n\nThis r/n8n, so some of this is not related 😎",

Webhooks tend to scale better once volume increases.\n* How are you handling idempotency (e.g. avoiding duplicate products if a message is retried)?\n* Do you persist state anywhere (DB/table) so you can replay or debug failed runs later?\n\nFor production use, adding retries + a dead-letter path for failures can make this rock solid.  \n  \nCool project—happy to dig deeper if you’re open to feedback.",

Although, since it's a lengthy workflow and the user has an option to use the abort command in case of any mistake so i thought it won't be an issue that way.\n3. Well, the state only persists till completion of the product. It is done through a data table. In which the state is changed with every step and then it gets reset to the starting stage which helps in avoiding complications in terms of retrieval by the telegram bot.\n\nFor the retry part, there's a message to proceed and cancel before finally creating the product and in between too there's an abort command.\n\nI am sure, it can be made better. Open for discussion regarding the same.",

                  "text": "That makes sense 👍 — using webhooks + a conversational “abort” path is a smart UX choice, especially for long workflows.\n\nGiven what you described, one small improvement that could help as usage grows is adding a lightweight idempotency guard at the *very start* of product creation (even just a hash of product name + timestamp or external ID stored in the data table). That way, if a webhook fires twice or a message gets retried, you won’t accidentally create duplicates.\n\nYour state machine approach in the data table sounds solid. If you ever want to go further, a simple “finalized / failed” flag plus a dead-letter branch for unexpected errors can make debugging much easier without complicating the happy path.\n\nOut of curiosity, are people using this more for one-off product creation, or are you seeing batch-style usage yet?",

This solves a big n8n gap: there’s no native way to correlate executions across webhooks and sub-workflows. \n* It correlates using: \n   * timestamp proximity\n   * user / request IDs\n   * webhook URL patterns\n   * request/response metadata\n* Result: a full “execution story” from the initial trigger → downstream workflows → failure point.\n* **get\\_failed\\_executions** \n   * Aggregated view of what broke recently, across *all* workflows.\n* **analyze\\_execution\\_error** \n   * AI-assisted forensic analysis: why it failed, patterns across executions, and concrete next steps.\n\n# Why MCP + AI?\n\nBecause once execution data is structured and traceable, an AI can:\n\n* walk you through what actually happened\n* spot systemic issues (rate limits, bad credentials, retries)\n* suggest fixes instead of just dumping logs\n\nRepo here:  \n[https://github.com/EchoSilo/n8n-debug-mcp](https://github.com/EchoSilo/n8n-debug-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Where this gets really powerful\n\nIf you’re using **Claude Code** and add **n8n-skills**:  \n[https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills)\n\nYou effectively get an **AI n8n engineer + debugger**:\n\n* Claude already knows **correct n8n syntax, patterns, validation rules**\n* The skills teach Claude how to **use n8n-mcp tools properly**\n* This MCP server gives Claude **deep execution traces and correlations**\n\nSo instead of:\n\n>“Here are some logs, good luck”\n\nYou get:\n\n* “Here’s the full execution chain”\n* “This node failed because credentials were revoked”\n* “This failure pattern appeared 4 times in the last hour”\n* “Here’s exactly what to fix next”\n\nIn practice:  \n**n8n-mcp + n8n-skills + this debug MCP** turns Claude into a *trace-aware workflow debugger*, not just a workflow generator.\n\nStill early, but usable. Feedback, ideas, or PRs welcome.\n\nedited: formatting for readability",
