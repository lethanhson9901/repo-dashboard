Here's some constructive feedback to strengthen your post:\n\n**Improvements:**\n1. **Complete the thought** - Your post cuts off at \"If anyone's building similar OCR + a\" - finish this sentence to provide a call-to-action or offer help\n2. **Add visual documentation** - Include workflow screenshots, before/after examples, or a diagram of the n8n pipeline to make it more concrete\n3. **Share performance metrics** - Quantify results: processing time per document, accuracy rates, cost comparison, or error rates\n4. **Provide code/template** - Share a simplified n8n workflow JSON or GitHub link so others can replicate your setup\n5. **Include failure scenarios** - Document edge cases that broke your pipeline (e.g., image quality thresholds, file format issues)\n\n**Alternative Perspectives:**\n1. **Cost analysis** - Compare Sarvam Vision vs alternatives (AWS Textract, Google Vision, Azure) in terms of pricing and accuracy\n2. **Scalability considerations** - How does this handle batch processing? What's the max document size/volume?\n3. **Error handling** - Beyond hallucination, discuss validation strategies and what happens when OCR confidence is low\n4. **Local alternatives** - Mention open-source options (Tesseract, PaddleOCR) as budget alternatives with tradeoffs\n\n**Potential Issues to Address:**\n1. **Data privacy** - Are documents sent to external APIs? Compliance implications for sensitive data?\n2. **Presigned URL security** - Add notes on expiration handling and security best practices\n3. **LLM hallucination details** - What specific techniques reduced this? (prompt engineering, validation rules, confidence thresholds?)\n4. **Maintenance burden** - How often do API changes break the workflow?\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n- Link to Sarvam Vision documentation and pricing\n- Reference similar n8n community workflows or templates\n- Suggest OCR benchmarking tools for validation\n- Recommend error monitoring/logging solutions (Sentry, LogRocket)\n- Point to LLM output validation frameworks\n\n**Minor Notes:**\n- Clarify what \"layout-aware JSON\" means for readers unfamiliar with document processing\n- Specify which LLM you used for field extraction\n- Mention the sheet platform (Google Sheets, Airtable, etc.)\n\nOverall, solid technical work - just needs polish on documentation and completeness!",

I built something similar but took a different approach fully local, no cloud APIs.\n\nMy stack is FastAPI + React with pdfplumber for PDF text extraction and xlwings for Excel generation. Instead of sending documents to an OCR API, I parse the text layer directly from digital PDFs using custom Python logic. Works out to \\~1-2 sec per document with zero API costs.\n\nThe bigger difference is what happens after extraction  my app handles the full order lifecycle: generates delivery orders from Excel templates, has a role-based approval chain (warehouse manager approves, assistant verifies), then routes to accounts with email/print support. All data stays local in JSON files, no internet needed.\n\nTradeoff is obvious though my approach breaks on scanned or handwritten docs since pdfplumber needs a text layer. For messy documents, your Sarvam Vision + Gemini combo would definitely win on accuracy.\n\nInteresting to see the n8n workflow approach vs custom code. Yours is way easier to modify without a developer, mine gives more control over business logic. Would be cool to plug something like Sarvam as a fallback for image-only PDFs in my pipeline.",

Each invoice would create its own OCR job, and I’d handle them in small batches to avoid hitting API limits. I’d track each job’s status, check when it’s complete, and retry any that fail. By using n8n’s queue mode and batching, the system can handle large volumes smoothly without crashing or slowing down.",

They’re not thinking about n8n, APIs, AI agents, or voice assistants. They care about one thing, getting new customers.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nMost of them are already on Google Maps. Maybe they run some Google Ads. If you can help them run ads better, build a basic landing page, and get qualified leads, they’ll pay you.\n\nThey don’t want automations. They want customers. The only companies that actually need AI automation are bigger ones (30–50 employees), e-commerce, SaaS, big data. That’s where n8n and custom automations make sense.\n\nTook me one year to realize I was selling a solution to the wrong customer which cause most of my pain.\n\nHow was your experience?",

A plumber who missed 3 calls while under a sink and lost $2k? He'll pay for a lead capture + notification flow. A 5-person SaaS team whose support queue goes unread on weekends? They'll set up email routing in a day.What you're really describing is 'automation-ready' vs 'automation-naive' businesses. Size is just a loose proxy for that.The bigger lesson you've hit: lead with the pain, not the technology. Never say 'AI automation' to a small business owner. Say 'you'll never miss a customer again.' The businesses that need automation already know they have a problem — your job is just to connect your solution to that specific problem.",

Here's some constructive feedback to strengthen your analysis:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- You've identified an important market segmentation insight through real experience\n- The honest reflection on a year-long learning process is valuable for others\n\n**Areas for improvement and alternative perspectives:**\n\n1. **Overgeneralization**: The blanket statement \"small businesses don't give a shit about AI automation\" may be too broad. Consider: restaurants using automated scheduling, service businesses with automated invoicing, or e-commerce shops with inventory automation. Your experience may reflect your specific niche rather than all small businesses.\n\n2. **False dichotomy**: You present this as either wanting \"automation\" OR \"customers,\" but these aren't mutually exclusive. Automation often *enables* customer acquisition (e.g., automated email follow-ups, CRM workflows). Reframe as: \"Small businesses want results, not technology for its own sake.\"\n\n3. **Deeper root cause analysis**: Beyond \"they want customers,\" explore: What's their budget? Do they lack technical literacy? Is the ROI unclear? Are implementation costs too high? Understanding the *why* behind resistance is more actionable than the resistance itself.\n\n4. **Market segment refinement**: Instead of \"small businesses\" vs. \"30-50 employee companies,\" consider segmenting by:\n   - Industry vertical (service vs. product vs. hybrid)\n   - Digital maturity level\n   - Pain point severity\n   - Budget availability\n\n5. **Potential blind spots**: Some small businesses ARE adopting automation (Zapier, Make, n8n). What differentiates the ones that do from those that don't?\n\n**Suggested resources:**\n- Jobs to be Done framework (Clayton Christensen) - helps identify true customer motivations\n- Market segmentation case studies in B2B SaaS\n- Customer discovery interview templates\n\n**Actionable next step**: Rather than abandoning n8n for this market, consider positioning it as a *means to customer acquisition*, not an end in itself.\n\nThis reframing could open new messaging opportunities.",

It remembers the credentials for infra. the public ip address for the cloud instances with the ports. so it can deploy and test as needed to my test environments. I have given it access to tools, and it deploys agents to use them.\n\n",

But once you try to truly scale AI intelligence, you hit a wall.\n\nAt a certain point, the 'visual spaghetti' turns into pure maintenance hell. One minor API change and the whole Jenga tower comes crashing down. That’s why we’ve pivoted: we still use n8n for the basic plumbing, but handle complex orchestration through agentic workflows (like Claude Code). Moving from being the 'construction worker' (pushing nodes) to the 'director' (defining goals) has slashed our debugging time. In the long run, self-correcting agents simply run circles around rigid, static workflows.",

They're not direct competitors but can work together.\n\n2. **Explore Practical Constraints**: Consider scenarios where n8n excels: non-developers need to build automations, you need enterprise-grade error handling and logging, integrations require OAuth/API key management, or workflows need visual monitoring and team collaboration.\n\n3. **Integration Complexity**: While Claude can write integration code, managing credentials, API rate limits, retry logic, and webhook handling at scale often requires a dedicated platform like n8n.\n\n**Alternative Perspectives:**\n\n- n8n provides **no-code/low-code accessibility**—not everyone has access to Claude or coding knowledge\n- **Audit trails and compliance** matter in regulated industries where you need documented workflow history\n- **Maintenance burden**: Claude-generated scripts need version control, testing, and ongoing updates—n8n handles this natively\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n- Over-relying on Claude for critical automations without proper testing and documentation could create technical debt\n- Generated code may not follow your organization's security or performance standards\n- Scaling this approach to team-based workflows becomes challenging without a centralized platform\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- Explore n8n's integration ecosystem and how it compares to building custom solutions\n- Consider hybrid approaches: use Claude for complex logic, n8n for orchestration and monitoring\n- Review case studies on automation platform ROI vs. pure code-based approaches\n\nYour experience is valuable, but the broader market suggests complementary tools serve different needs.",

You can try [this workflow template](https://n8n.io/workflows/9942-rag-powered-document-chat-with-google-drive-openai-and-pinecone-assistant/), which implements the same workflow you have + gives you the chat/search.\n\nLet me know if you have questions about either approach!

      "text": "Just wrapped up a project for a telecom reseller in the US who works with vendors like Twilio and partners like CDW. Thought I'd share the breakdown because telecom billing automation is genuinely complex and I don't see many people talking about it specifically.\n\nTheir workflow was a mess. Everything scattered across emails, manual quote creation, spreadsheets everywhere. They were literally digging through emails to start every quote. No visibility into usage overages. No way to track margins properly. Invoicing took forever because everything was manual data entry.\n\nThey knew it was broken but didn't think automation could handle the complexity. Usage based billing mixed with subscriptions, multiple vendor tiers. Every quote needed different calculations depending on the customer, the service type, whether it was monthly or annual. They'd tried to figure it out themselves and gave up.\n\nSo I put together a detailed document showing exactly how I'd solve it. Workflow blueprints, logic diagrams, everything mapped out. Showed them how the pricing engine would work, how quotes would generate automatically, how everything would connect to their accounting system. Once they saw that, they were in.\n\n**Here's what I actually built using n8n:**\n\nWeb forms that capture leads automatically so they stop losing inquiries in email chaos. A pricing engine that calculates three tier costs... vendor to reseller to end customer, with the complex telecom billing logic baked in. It generates two different PDF quotes from one source because CDW needs annual bundled pricing while customers want detailed line items.\n\nOCR that pulls data from purchase orders and invoices straight into QuickBooks so nobody's retyping everything. Real time margin tracking so they actually know if they're making money on deals. The system also flags usage overages automatically. Before this they'd miss billable usage all the time because nobody was checking.\n\nEverything connects. Lead comes in, quote generates, customer signs, purchase order comes through, invoice creates itself, margins calculate in real time. One unified system instead of ten different tools and processes.\n\n**Stack:** n8n, Google Sheets, QuickBooks API, Avalara for tax, Gemini for OCR. Nothing exotic.\n\nThey were skeptical about Google Sheets as the CRM but once I showed them how it worked for their volume they got it. Sometimes simple is better than fancy.\n\nTook about five weeks of actual building plus two weeks of testing. Spent a week before that in multiple meetings just understanding their process. Where things broke down. What they'd already tried. That part matters more than people think. Most automation fails because people jump straight to building without really understanding what the business needs.\n\nThey're saving somewhere around fifteen to twenty hours a week. Already talking about expanding it... automated email sequences, vendor performance tracking, revenue forecasting.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the technical side, the pricing logic, or how I structured the discovery process if anyone's curious.",

This is exactly the scariest bottleneck in automated accounting flows.\n\n\n​The overall n8n architecture OP built here is incredibly solid, but relying on raw foundational models to push invoice/PO line items directly into QuickBooks can definitely keep you up at night. A single hallucinated decimal point is a nightmare.\n​I actually got so paranoid about this exact issue when building workflows that I ended up creating a dedicated extraction engine called ParserData just to act as a safety net. It handles the dynamic vision extraction but forces strict schema validation and mathematical checks before passing the payload to the next node.\n​Still, massive props to OP for mapping out telecom billing that logic is notoriously brutal to automate!",

Add quantifiable outcomes - Include specific metrics: time saved per week, error reduction %, revenue impact, ROI, or customer satisfaction improvements.\n3. Include technical depth - Explain the n8n workflows/logic used. Show workflow screenshots, node configurations, or pseudocode to demonstrate the solution's sophistication.\n4. Address the challenges - Discuss obstacles encountered and how you overcame them (integration issues, data validation, edge cases).\n\n**Alternative Perspectives:**\n1. Cost-benefit analysis - What was the implementation cost vs. savings? This helps readers understand if automation was truly justified for a business of this size.\n2. Change management - How did you handle client adoption? Training, documentation, and transition challenges are often overlooked.\n3. Maintenance considerations - What ongoing support/updates does this automation require? This is crucial for long-term success.\n\n**Potential Issues to Address:**\n1. Compliance and security - Telecom involves sensitive customer data and billing information. Discuss data protection measures, compliance considerations (GDPR, SOC 2), and audit trails.\n2. Scalability - How does this solution handle growth? Can it manage 10x more customers or transactions?\n3. Vendor API reliability - What happens when Twilio or CDW APIs have downtime? Include error handling and fallback mechanisms.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n1. Link to your n8n workflow templates or GitHub repository if applicable.\n2. Reference telecom industry standards or billing frameworks that influenced your approach.\n3. Recommend similar tools (Make, Zapier, custom APIs) for comparison context.\n4. Include a call-to-action with clear next steps for interested readers.\n\n**Tone & Structure:**\nThe writing is engaging and relatable.

      "text": " Hey fellow n8n builders! 👋\n\nFor the past few weeks, I’ve been building workflows entirely orchestrated by AI (Claude/Gemini). While the official n8n MCP is an incredible structural tool, I found that an LLM reading raw n8n JSON simply obliterates the context window (a 30-node workflow gets massive!).\n\nTo solve this, I built \n\n**n8n-mcp-lite**.\n\n\n\nInstead of treating the AI like a literal n8n UI canvas requiring \\[x, y\\] coordinates and verbose connection mappings, this MCP acts as a semantic translation layer. It uses smart token-saving techniques like:\n\n* **Workflow Scanning & Focusing:** `scan_workflow` returns a \\~90% lighter Table of Contents of your workflow. You then use `focus_workflow` to zoom in and expand only the nodes you want the AI to fix!\n* **Auto-layout & Simplified Connections:** The AI can generate a workflow by simply saying \"connect Node A to Node B\". The server dynamically routes and calculates all X/Y layout positions.\n* **Built-in Knowledge & Webhook Schemas:** Pulls in payload expectations from Meta/WhatsApp schemas instantly.\n\n**It's still in the early stages**, and there are occasionally edge cases with deep multi-output routing, but the token savings and AI creation speed have been mind-blowing for me.\n\nIf you are exploring agentic automation or just want Claude to build templates for you 10x faster and cheaper, check it out and let me know what you think! PRs are welcome!  \n🔗 **Repo**: [https://github.com/LunkiBR/n8n-mcp-lite](https://github.com/LunkiBR/n8n-mcp-lite)",

It’s like having a **General Manager** (the full server) and a **Technical Lead** (the lite version) on the same team.\n\nHere is why you would want **both** and how they work together to protect your  automation.\n\n# 🏛️ The \"Dual-Tier\" n8n Orchestration\n\n# 🛠️ The Benefit of \"Lite\" for Your Setup\n\n1. **Low Latency**: Since it's \"lite,\" it's much faster for quick syntax checks. When you're in the field and the \"Job Entry\" screen lags, the Lite server can quickly ping a specific node without polling the entire 90-node workflow.\n2. **Execution Focus**: `n8n-mcp-lite` is often better at **running** a workflow with specific \"test data.\" This is perfect for our **Simulation/Audit** phase. We can use \"Lite\" to send the test payload `{ \"TripID\": 1 }` and see exactly where it stops.\n3. **Redundancy**: If your main MCP server has an \"Audience\" or JWT error (like we saw today), the \"Lite\" version usually has a simpler auth path. It’s your **Fail-Safe Bridge**.\n\n>",

I normally upgrade by changing the version in docker-compose and restarting the container. This time the upgrade broke and I ended up losing all workflows.\n\nGood thing. I had backups of my important production workflows so I restored them. **But I lost all my testing workflows, experiments, custom nodes, and custom Lang Chain nodes**.\n\nPosting this so others avoid the same situation.\n\nWhat caused the problem\n\n1. RBAC migration issue\n\nNewer versions of n8n introduced Role Based Access Control. Workflows now belong to users and are shared through new tables.\n\nOlder versions stored workflows differently. During the upgrade n8n tried to migrate my database to the new ownership system.\n\nThe logs showed an error like:\n\nSQLITE\\_ERROR: no such column T.userId  \nMigration DropRoleMapping failed\n\nBecause of this failure n8n could not convert the old workflow records to the new format.\n\n1. Database path confusion\n\nDuring troubleshooting we realized n8n can read the database from different locations depending on the Docker volume configuration.\n\nExamples:\n\n/home/ubuntu/.n8n/database.sqlite  \n\\~/n8n-docker/n8n\\_data/database.sqlite\n\nIf n8n starts with a different path, it sees an empty database and initializes a fresh installation. This can make it look like workflows disappeared.\n\n1. Skipping too many versions\n\nn8n went through a big database change between older versions and 1.x.\n\nJumping directly across many versions forces the database to run many migrations at once. If even one migration fails the database can end up in a half migrated state.\n\n1. SQLite WAL behavior\n\nSQLite uses these files:\n\ndatabase.sqlite  \ndatabase.sqlite-wal  \ndatabase.sqlite-shm\n\nSome data may sit in the WAL file until it merges with the main database. During troubleshooting the WAL was merged after some tables were recreated, which likely removed the old records.\n\nLessons learned\n\n• Always export workflows as JSON before upgrading  \n• Always take a database backup  \n• Verify the Docker volume path before starting the new version  \n• Avoid jumping many versions at once  \n• Avoid manual database edits during migration failures\n\nThis upgrade cost me my testing workflows and custom node experiments. Next time I will be more careful with backups and version upgrades. Hopefully this helps someone avoid the same issue.",

      "text": "The past few weeks I’ve been experimenting a lot with “vibe coding” – basically working with a bunch of AI agents and just switching between them to build small experimental projects.\n\nAt first it felt super powerful, but I’ve realized it’s draining me like crazy.\n\n**My day kind of looks like this now:**  \nI have multiple windows/tabs open, I keep switching between them, and whenever I see an AI has “stopped” or is waiting, I quickly throw in a new instruction. If I’m not giving them work, I feel like I’m “wasting” compute. When they generate artifacts with errors, I either report the issue back to the AI or ask it to debug itself, again and again.\n\nA lot of what the AI produces is outside my current knowledge, so I just reply AI fast and then try to point it in some direction. I’m like a supervisor (knowing little) trying to keep every powerful agent busy than a dev actually building and learning. \n\nBy the end of the day, my brain feels tired. I’ve been “busy” for hours, but I don’t feel like I actually achieved much or leveled up my skills. It’s just constant task-switching and telling AIs what to do.\n\n**Before vibe coding, my process was very different:**  \nI would carefully design a n8n workflow, read the API docs, debug errors myself, and really understand what was going on. Every day felt like real progress and growth. When something finally worked, the sense of achievement was huge. Now it feels… shallow in comparison.\n\nI’m starting to feel that this current way of working is not sustainable. I probably can’t keep going like this for long.\n\nI think part of the problem is that AI raised my expectations way too fast. Now I expect to build a brand-new website with a backend in two days, even though before AI I never would’ve thought that was realistic for me.\n\n**So I’m changing my approach:**\n\n* Slowing down my pace\n* Sticking with one main task instead of juggling 5 AI “personas”\n* When the AI is thinking or generating, I don’t rush to another window — I stay with the same task and think more deeply about the problem, the architecture, the edge cases, etc.\n\nThis has already made me feel a lot calmer. I get more time for deep thinking, I actually understand more, and the output quality is higher. It feels less like “herding AIs” and more like actually building something again.\n\nCurious if anyone else has gone through this with vibe coding / agent workflows?  \nHow do you balance using AI aggressively without burning out or losing the feeling of real progress?",

Didn't think anyone would try to replicate it in n8n.\n\nGenuinely curious how you handle the memory/context piece. One of the things that makes OpenClaw click for me is the persistent workspace — SOUL.md, daily memory files, the agent reading its own notes from yesterday. Does n8n-claw have something similar or is each workflow run stateless?\n\nAlso wondering about cost. Running through n8n means you're still hitting the same API endpoints right? The OpenClaw gateway handles rate limiting and model routing pretty elegantly, curious if you had to rebuild that logic in n8n nodes.",

(e.g., PostgreSQL for data persistence, Supabase, Docker for scaling, or specific APIs like OpenAI/Anthropic?)\n\n​High-Value Skills: What specific tasks are clients actually willing to pay a premium for? (Is it complex CRM migrations, custom API wrappers, AI-driven agents, or something else?)\n\n​The \"Secret Sauce\": Are there specific programming languages that take your workflows to the next level? I’m assuming JavaScript/TypeScript for Function nodes is a given, but what else?\n\n​Business Model: Do you find more success with project-based builds, monthly maintenance retainers, or building \"Automation-as-a-Service\" products?\n\n​I'm ready to put in the work, I just want to make sure I'm practicing the right scales. Any advice, \"gotchas,\" or resources you wish you knew when you started would be massive.\n\n​Thanks in advance! 🛠️",

In reality? It’s a **maintenance nightmare.**\n\nHere’s what I learned the hard way:\n\nThe problem with standalone custom software\n\nWhen you sell one of these:\n\nYou’re not just selling a build\n\nYou’re accidentally selling lifetime responsibility\n\n* APIs change.\n* Integrations break.\n* Security updates are needed.\n* Auth methods expire.\n* Databases need care.\n* Logs need watching.\n* Infrastructure needs patching.\n\nAnd every time something breaks…\n\nyou’re the one they call.\n\n\n\n# My CRM disaster\n\nI once built a custom CRM automation for a shitty CRM called SuperOffice:\n\n* Connected to the CRM platform via API\n* Synced with Airtable\n* Had custom logic\n* Ran on the client cloud (Azure)\n\n\n\nWhat happened:\n\n**APIs started failing**\n\n* Airtable sent constant error notifications\n* Random edge cases popped up\n* Customer expected fixes… forever\n\nAnd the real mistake?\n\n👉 I didn't charge maintenance fees.\n\nSo I eventually had to tell them:\n\n“I can’t maintain this anymore, or we need to get paid for maintenance (they refused cuz the project cost a lot.”\n\nNow I no longer maintain it, and the client started ghosting me, and I just burned my cards with them due to bad expectation management.  \n\n\nAlso, this is the part nobody talks about enough.\n\nWhen you host:\n\nYou’re responsible for:\n\n* Server updates\n* Library vulnerabilities\n* Auth security\n* API key storage\n* Data protection\n* Downtime\n* Logs\n* Backups\n\n\n\nThat’s not “automation work.”\n\nThat’s software operations.  \n\n\n**And clients don’t want to pay SaaS-level prices…**\n\n**…but expect SaaS-level reliability.**\n\n\n\nWhy this model breaks **at scale**\n\nLet’s say you get:\n\n**10 clients**\n\nEach pays maintenance\n\nEach system is unique\n\n\n\nNow you have:\n\n* 10 workflows and databases\n* 10 infra configs\n* 10 potential failure modes\n* 10 different clients pinging you\n\n>even if you're taking 200$ for the 10 customers, that's 2000, but then also all of these could fail at the same time. If you're by yourself, you cannot get new customers and add them to this loop unless you need to hire somebody and just keep paying them to manage these servers.  And at this rate, you cannot hire full-time employees because you cannot afford them, so you end up hiring some shitty developer from Upwork who's unreliable and they bail on you at the time of need...\n\n\n\n**What I do now instead**\n\nI changed my offer completely:\n\nI now:\n\n* Build automations inside their stack\n* Deploy on their infra (or SaaS tools they own)\n* Train their team\n* Provide:\n   * Docs\n   * Debug help\n   * Limited guidance for their team, no maintenance support (ex: 5h/month)\n\n\n\nSo:\n\n* They own it\n* They maintain it\n* I support strategically\n* I don’t babysit systems forever\n* Much more sustainable.\n\n\n\n**My rule going forward**\n\nI will never again:\n\n❌ Build standalone micro-SaaS for a single client\n\n❌ Host custom apps for them\n\n❌ Be responsible for their infra long-term\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Custom standalone automations = hidden SaaS business\n* Without SaaS pricing\n* Without SaaS team\n* Without SaaS margins\n\n\n\nIf you’re selling automations:\n\nLearn from this before you build your first “custom CRM” for €2k and regret it 😅\n\nHappy to hear if others made the same mistake or am I the dumbass in this story...

      "text": "Hey, \n\nI recently built a scraper to pull every single workflow published on the n8n marketplace. We now have over **8,500 workflows** created by the community. I crunched the numbers and generated some interesting charts for beginners and automation enthusiasts to see what everyone is actually building (and sharing).\n\nHere are the insights!\n\n# 1. 🔧 Top 20 Most Used Nodes\n\n*No surprises here,  Webhooks and HTTP Requests rule the world, but it's great to see AI and Telegram so prevalent!*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq3ptzumuwlg1.png?width=2766&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea3e43f1286827f6cdda9c38492bd9b7394082df\n\n# 2. 📂 What Categories Are Exploding?\n\n*AI is absolutely dominating the marketplace right now, along with Core automation and Marketing.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik5u0dxouwlg1.png?width=2770&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09d9e1a822b8c2c27c7849c7eabfdbaef595df1\n\n# 3. 🧩 Workflow Complexity\n\n*Most shared workflows are relatively simple (1-6 nodes). It shows that you don't need a huge, complex spaghetti-monster workflow to provide value to the community!*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e94jltpruwlg1.png?width=2370&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab92ad3fb816163fb3fc608c7bab2b0574d57054\n\n# 4. 👑 Top Creators\n\n*Shoutout to the power users actively sharing their work and growing the n8n ecosystem!*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdclb7jtuwlg1.png?width=2769&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a263235a6af09bb831a99ea041f3117842fc61a\n\n# 5. 📉 The Growth Curve\n\n*The exponential growth of n8n usage (and sharing) over time.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7nmxwjuuwlg1.png?width=3166&format=png&auto=webp&s=84cc3f0fad2b19125ef8cd23ff782438389d9c9a\n\n# 6. 💰 Paid vs Free Workflows\n\n*An overwhelming majority of the marketplace is completely free, making it an incredible resource for learning.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypt49i0xuwlg1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=a55551ac19f4114da7fd09b7ab0da64f057c198d\n\n# 🛠️ The Data & The Scraper\n\nFor the nerds out there: I scraped this data asynchronously using Python (`aiohttp` \\+ `asyncio`), processing the \\~8,500 workflows locally to generate these charts.\n\nIf you want to run this analysis yourself, pull the raw data for ML fine-tuning, or just want to easily search workflows, I've published the scraper as an Actor on Apify. Check it out here:\n\n👉 [**n8n Marketplace Intelligence & Analytics (Apify Actor)**](https://apify.com/scraper_guru/n8n-marketplace-analyzer)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any other data points you'd like to see analyzed from the marketplace?",

Creators just list a price and a purchaseUrl that redirects to their own S*tripe, Gu*mroad, or personal website. Because the actual transaction happens off-platform, n8n (and the scraper) has zero visibility into actual sales volume or conversion rates.\n\nThe closest proxy we have is totalViews on paid workflows, but views don't always translate to sales!\"\n\nIf you want, I can generate a chart showing the Pricing Distribution of paid workflows (e.g., how many cost $10 vs $50 vs $100+), or the Most Viewed Paid Workflows, but actual sales volume is impossible to scrape.

              "text": "Well, as an n8n developer, there are a few practical ways you can use this kind of data:\n\n1. Spotting Market Gaps (If you build/sell workflows): The data shows exactly where the market is saturated (e.g., standard AI/ChatGPT wrappers and Marketing pipelines) and where there are untapped niches. If you're building workflows to share or sell, you can find high-demand problems that don't have good templates yet. \n\n2. Pricing Strategy: 99% of the marketplace is free. If you are trying to monetize your n8n skills or sell premium templates, this data proves you need to offer extreme niche value or highly complex integrations to compete with the free ecosystem. \n\n3. Learning from the Best: By sorting for the most viewed workflows or filtering by 'Top Creators', you can reverse-engineer how the best developers structure their pipelines, handle error routing, and optimize their nodes.   \n4. Building Custom Nodes: Looking at the \"Top 20 Nodes\" shows exactly what the community relies on (Heavy HTTP/Webhook usage). If you are developing custom community nodes, you know exactly what other services you need to be compatible with.   \n\n\n5. Training AI Models (probably you don't need this): One of the main reasons I built the Apify scraper behind this data is that it automatically formats the 8,500+ workflow JSONs into Alpaca/OpenAI training formats. Developers can literally take this data and fine-tune an LLM (like Llama 3) to generate n8n workflows from text prompts!  \n  \nAnd now hopefully that makes sense :)",
