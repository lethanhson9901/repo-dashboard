If you do not hit those usage minimums, they will just delete your instance and send you an email with no chance to backup or anything. I would highly recommend setting up a SSH backup script to grab your SQLite file of your entire n8n instance and encryption key so that you can restore your n8n instance into another docker instance if that happens to you.",

      "text": "I recently spoke with N8N about an on-premise license. I like the product and what the team is building, but the business model genuinely confused me.\n\nThe Community Edition (source-available / fair-code license) allows unlimited executions when self-hosted. The paid on-prem license, however, introduces execution and workload limits — even though customers already pay for hardware, electricity, networking, and operations. Paying more but getting less doesn’t make sense.\n\nLicense restrictions are fine — limited workloads are not. A paid version should never reduce core capabilities compared to the free version. Paid should always equal Free + More.\n\nA more logical model would cap the number of workflows, active plugins, or reserve advanced plugins for higher tiers — not executions in a self-hosted setup.\n\nI also found multiple Reddit threads/users who reverted to the Community Edition, not because Pro is bad, but because the licensing constraints feel arbitrary.\n\nN8N has a strong product and community. Revisiting the on-prem licensing model could significantly improve trust and adoption.\n\nExample, we've been using [Thingsboard.io](http://Thingsboard.io) more than 10 years now for our IoT Deployments. the tiered license makes sense, the perks you get by paying makes sense.\n\nAnyone here facing the same with N8N?",

      "text": "I wanted to share something interesting I’ve been noticing while working on a small automation project.\n\nI built an n8n automation to handle Google reviews end to end. Initially, this was just an experiment to see if the workflow even made sense in the real world.\n\nBut what surprised me was how receptive Indian businesses have been to this idea.\n\nA lot of local businesses here genuinely want a structured way to manage reviews. Not to fake anything, but to avoid chaos. Missed reviews, unmanaged negative feedback, and no time to reply consistently are very common problems.\n\nHere’s what the system does in simple terms:\n\nCustomers are asked for feedback through a link.\n\nIf the rating is 3 stars or below, the feedback is stored privately so the business can address it internally.\n\nIf the rating is 4 or 5 stars, the customer is guided to leave a public review on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nOn top of that:\n\nIt tracks who clicks the review link and who doesn’t\n\nKeeps everything logged in one place\n\nAutomatically replies to new Google reviews using AI\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many Indian business owners don’t want more tools, dashboards, or complexity. They want something that quietly works in the background and improves their online reputation without daily effort.\n\nI can’t speak much about how foreign businesses would react to this, but locally, there’s genuine interest and adoption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/636a4qc31aeg1.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=be305629b3c148d1529f337219b81486d676b4c9\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone else seeing similar behavior in their region?\n\nAre there any obvious downsides or ethical concerns I should think about?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives.\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants, I can also break down how the workflow is built in n8n.",

For outreach, I’ve chained this kind of flow into Instantly and Apollo; Pulse for Reddit plus Phantombuster has been nice for testing similar audience capture on Reddit/Twitter without drowning in noise.\n\nSo yeah: move from “cool scrape” to “clean, queryable pipeline” and this becomes a serious asset.",

Cleaning them manually would've taken weeks. So I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire enrichment process.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls contacts from Google Sheets (name, company, existing data)\n\n\\* Finds current LinkedIn profiles for each contact\n\n\\* Scrapes full profile data (email, phone, job title, location)\n\n\\* Enriches company information (official website, company phone, company email)\n\n\\* Gathers additional intel (company size, LinkedIn company page)\n\n\\* Updates all records back to Google Sheets automatically\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What would take 30-40 hours of manual research now runs completely automated. Process 500+ contacts in 30-60 minutes while you focus on actual selling.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"John Smith\" at \"Acme Corp\" (stale record from 2021)\n\n\\- Results: Fresh LinkedIn URL, verified work email, direct phone number, current job title, company website, company contact info, employee count\n\n\\- All data automatically updated in your CRM/sheet\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The workflow runs in batches of 10 contacts\\*\\* to maintain API stability and avoid rate limits. Perfect for overnight enrichment runs.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams cleaning hundreds of outdated CRM records before campaigns\n\n\\* RevOps maintaining data quality across large contact databases\n\n\\* Marketing enriching event attendee lists with complete contact info\n\n\\* Recruiters updating candidate databases with current employment data\n\n\\* Business development building complete prospect profiles at scale\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 500+ contacts per execution without issues.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json)",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI run a small automation company and I’m looking for someone comfortable with n8n and AI automations to join the team as a freelancer/contractor.\n\nIt’s totally fine if you’re newer to this. Curiosity, ability to pick things up quickly, and actually wanting to learn matter more than years of experience. This is a good fit if you want to build real automation skills, understand how projects are scoped and delivered in the real world, get some client exposure, and potentially take on more responsibility over time.\n\nMost of the time I’ll handle the high-level architecture and client direction, and you’ll help build and implement workflows in n8n. That said, I’m not looking for someone who needs constant hand-holding or just executes tasks blindly. The goal is to reduce workload on my side, not add more. I’m happy to guide, review, and unblock you, but I need someone who can think independently, make reasonable decisions, and flag issues or improvements without being prompted. If you have ideas or see a better way to do something, I want to hear it.\n\nYou’ll be working on real client projects using tools like Zoho, ClickUp, Slack, Typeform, GHL, Instantly, Stripe, etc. Down the line you may also join client calls when it makes sense.\n\nYou should be comfortable with n8n, APIs, JavaScript for data transformations, Postgres/SQL, LLMs. The ability to quickly learn new tools is essential. Good English and availability during UK hours are required.\n\nBeyond the technical side, understanding how companies operate is just as important. You’re not just wiring nodes together, you’re solving real business problems. If you care about building workflows that are reliable, maintainable, and don’t break after two runs, we’ll likely work well together.\n\nPlease submit your application through this form: [ https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4 ](https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4)\n\nCompany website: [ https://innovaquest.ai ](https://innovaquest.ai)\n\nCompany name: InnovaQuest",

      "text": "I used to deploy n8n on my local machine the hard way: manually installing Node.js, pulling the source, wrestling with Docker containers (which ate up gigabytes of space), and tweaking configurations. It was a hassle.\n\nThat frustration led me to build **n8n Desktop** — a native, self-contained app packaged with **Tauri**. Now I can ditch Docker and have a truly click-and-run experience.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Self-contained installer**: The app **automatically downloads and sets up** the required Node.js runtime and n8n resources on first launch. No manual dependency deployment needed — it handles everything for you.\n* **Native & Lightweight**: Built with Tauri/Rust, it's tiny and uses minimal system resources.\n* **Runs offline**: Your workflows and data stay on your machine. Perfect for self-hosted enthusiasts.\n* **Auto-start on boot** (configurable): Keeps your workflows always running.\n\n**Direct Download Links (v1.0.1):**\n\n* **Windows (.exe)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe)\n* **macOS - Apple Silicon (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)\n* **macOS - Intel (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64.dmg)\n\n**Important Installation Notes:**\n\n1. **For Windows Users**: I only have a Mac for development, so **the Windows version is untested**. Please use it at your own discretion and report any issues you encounter!\n2. **For macOS Users**: Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer account, you may see a “damaged” error on first launch. To fix this:\n   * Open **Terminal**.\n   * Copy and paste the following command, then press **Enter**: bashsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/n8n-desktop.app\n   * Enter your **administrator password** (it won‘t show as you type) and press **Enter** again.\n   * You should now be able to open the app normally from your Applications folder.\n\n**Source Code & All Builds:**\n\n* **GitHub Release Page**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1)\n* **Main Repository**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop) (Stars and feedback are welcome!)\n\n**Screenshot of the app:**  \n[https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app\\_screen\\_short.png](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app_screen_short.png)\n\n**Why Tauri?** I chose Tauri over Electron for its superior performance and smaller bundle size. The core is still the fantastic n8n, but now it feels like a true desktop citizen.\n\nThis is an open-source side project I use daily. I'd love to get your feedback, bug reports, or contributions.\n\n",

      "text": "I started studying automation in January of last year to work for a friend who accepted a marketing position but knew nothing about automation and needed to use it every day.\n\nI spent about 3 months with him doing this type of service, studying, learning, and applying. After 3 months, I made a mass mailing incorrectly, and instead of sending emails to 1000 leads, I sent them to about 50,000. The loss was quite high, and my friend wasn't very happy with the company anymore and ended up leaving after this mishap.\n\nI have ADHD and use cannabis, so lack of concentration is something that bothers me a bit during the day. So I created a checklist to prevent problems like this from happening again (so far, it's working). When I left that company, I thought about selling AI agents, and that's exactly what I did. I got a law firm to pay for my service, and I've had that contract active ever since. It's an AI agent for customer service and appointment scheduling that closes about 25 clients on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had much success working on a contract basis because I'm not a very good salesperson, and people in my city don't value that kind of service very much. Because of that, I had to look for a job.\n\nLast October I started a full-time job at an English language school. The pay is reasonable, and I learn a lot every day. So far, I've implemented an agent to assist students who have problems with the platform, an AI agent to respond to WhatsApp leads, and several HR automations, from candidate analysis to the entire hiring process that was previously done manually. I'm very happy with the service delivery; I've already managed to save about 830 hours of work per month that previously required a person to be available to do.\n\nI see many people here wondering if it's possible to make money with automation, and the answer is yes. You'll hardly make money selling workflows, but it's a very valuable service that companies are only now starting to seek. Selling services didn't work out the first time, but I'm already working on my second attempt this year, and I think everything will work out. If you are technically good and dedicated to delivering a quality service that will make a difference, there's certainly a place for you in the market.",

      "text": "Let’s be honest for a second: **Generative AI for end-to-end scheduling is a recipe for disaster in a professional environment.**\n\nI run an automation course with over **1,900 students**. For months, I’ve been delaying the release of our \"AI Scheduling Module.\" Why? Because I refuse to teach my students a solution that I know will fail them (and their clients) at least 5% of the time.\n\nI’ve tried everything in **n8n**:\n\n* Advanced Prompt Engineering\n* Direct Tool Calling with Google Calendar/Cal.com\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n* Multi-step verification loops\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good the model is. AI is probabilistic. It \"hallucinates\" time zones, it misses double-booking logic, or it simply fails to confirm a slot correctly.\n\n**The \"Human Error\" Fallacy:** People often say, *\"Well, humans make mistakes too.\"* Sure, but the market is significantly less tolerant of a machine's failure. If an AI messes up a CEO's calendar or double-books a high-ticket consultation, it doesn't look like a \"mistake\"it looks like a broken, amateur system. For professional services, 99% isn't enough. It has to be 100%.\n\n**The only solution that actually works 100% of the time:** After months of testing, I’ve concluded that the only \"pro\" way to do this is a hybrid model:\n\n1. **AI for Pre-qualification:** Let the AI handle the lead gen, answer questions, and build rapport.\n2. **Deterministic UI for Booking:** Once the lead is ready, the AI drops a link (Cal.com, tidycal, etc.) for the user to pick a slot.\n\nIt might not look as \"magical\" as a full chat-to-calendar booking, but it’s the only way to ensure the data is right every single time.\n\n**I want to hear from you:** Am I being too cynical, or are you guys also struggling with the reliability gap in conversational scheduling? Has anyone *actually* deployed a 100% fail-proof conversational booking system in production, or are we all just chasing a ghost?",

For the actual 'writing to the database' part, `if/else` and deterministic logic are king.\n\nThe reason people try to force AI into this is the **unstructured conversational layer** that comes before the booking. A simple script can't easily handle a lead saying:\n\n*'I’m travelling next week, but I might be free Thursday afternoon if my flight isn't delayed. Also, does your service cover VAT for European companies?'*\n\nAI is great for:\n\n1. **Contextual Qualification:** Understanding if the lead is even worth a meeting.\n2. **Handling Objections:** Answering those 'by the way' questions before the booking.\n3. **Intent Extraction:** Identifying that the user *wants* to book even when they don't use a specific keyword.\n\nMy argument is that we should use AI for that messy human interaction, but the second it’s time to actually pick a slot, we should hand it over to a deterministic system (the 'if/else' world). Trying to make the AI perform the logic of 'find slot -> check timezone -> verify conflict -> write' is where the 5% failure rate kills the UX.",

And this is why a lot of CEO's fail their projects. \n\nI don't know if you're an engineer or not, I'll try to do this argument without assuming it:\n\nWhen you study engineering for making a technical tool, you start by knowing that the user will ALWAYS get wrong the tool, so you have to do it like is for a child learning to read and even then, there's still probability of misusing. So, why in all hell you will allow the user to write \"I'm traveling next week...\".\n\nWhy in hell you will allow something like that? You study the booking process to the bone and automate it so the user receives a message like \n- \"Hi, *name*, which booking you want today? *Flight *Hotel *Uber\"\n- User just click button \n- Another message \"Please write the country\" \n- User write the country\n- You completely assume user will write wrong the country name, so you sanitize with model\n- \"To confirm, you have indicated country ****\"\n- User clicks *yes\n- \"Do you want to know information on VAT for this particular booking to *country?\"\n- User click yes\n- Model will start searching on it with a hell of a good prompt so you don't allow hallucination because there's no conversation before that...\n\nAnd so and so on, this is just the tip of the iceberg, so when you create a tool, ANY TOOL, no matter what, you have to assume that user is a stupid dumbass, ALWAYS. So stop creating tools that have to work with a message that was written by a stupid person. \n\nYour 5% failure it's because you're allowing the user, meaning you because I'm assuming you are the test case, to write whatever the hell he wants and not expect failure. \n\nThat's basic engineering process that you need to know before creating a tool...",

The goal of automation is to remove the bottleneck, not to create a new one where a human has to constantly click 'Approve'.\n\nThe 'AI Pre-qualification + Deterministic Link' combo gives you:\n\n1. **0% hallucination risk** on the final booking.\n2. **100% scalability** without human intervention.\n3. **Professional UX** where the user feels in control.\n\nIn the professional world, reliability isn't a 'value proposition'—it's a requirement.

That’s not the problem we are trying to solve here.\n\nThe challenge isn't the **calendar logic**; it's the **customer journey**.\n\nA simple automation script can't handle a prospect on WhatsApp who says: *'I want to book, but I need to know if you offer a discount for groups first.'* If you just send a link or a static form, your conversion drops because you’re forcing the user to do all the work. The AI is there to handle the 'messy' human part—answering questions, qualifying the lead, and building trust while the automation (your 'simple calendar') ensures the data remains 100% accurate.\n\nWe need to stop confusing **database integrity** with **customer engagement**. One is a solved problem; the other is where the money is made.",

The real 'deal-breaker' is the **unpredictability of human language.**\n\nThe 5% failure rate that kills a business reputation comes from:\n\n1. **Contextual Ambiguity:** A user says 'Next Tuesday' on a Sunday night. Does the AI pick 2 days or 9 days away? The LLM makes a probabilistic guess. If it guesses wrong, you lose the client.\n2. **The 'Change of Mind' Loop:** In a chat, users change their minds mid-sentence. *'Book me for 10 AM... wait, make it 11 AM... actually, is there a slot after lunch?'* LLMs often struggle to maintain the 'source of truth' in long, messy conversations, leading to corrupted data entry.\n3. **Implicit Intent:** A user might say *'I'm free after my 2 PM meeting.'* An AI has to guess when that meeting ends. A calendar link makes the user take responsibility for the slot.\n\nYour suggestion of 'confirmation emails' and 'error-handling links' just proves my point: if you need a safety net for when the AI fails, then the AI-led booking is the weak link.\n\nI’d rather provide a **100% fail-proof experience** by using AI for what it's best at (qualifying and chatting) and a deterministic UI for what it's best at (booking data). 95% accuracy is a 100% failure in the professional world.",

If each of them deploys this to just 10 clients, and each client has 100 appointments, we are talking about **nearly 2 million interactions**.

If you have 2 million entries, you certainly shouldn't use N8N to manage the service flow. Low-code tools don't handle large volumes of requests well.\n\n\nFor the reality you mentioned, I believe there are no problems. If you want something closer to 100% accuracy, just spend a little more and add a verification LLM with access to a RAG with at least 500 examples of successful conversations (which isn't expensive either). As I mentioned, the problem wasn't with the scheduling flow or a failure in interpreting information; it was simply a hallucination like any other, which can happen in all LLMSs at any point in the conversation.\n\n\nFurthermore, when it comes to AI, nothing will ever be 100% reliable. Anthropic knows this, as do OpenAI and Google. The issue isn't that AI... Making fewer mistakes (which I also believe to be true) is the consistency and speed with which she executes tasks, and that's what truly matters to serious companies.

So we made it agentic, where the agent orchestrates the nodes. The agent has some instructions to do this.\n\n\\- Then the next reality we discovered was exactly this. Most users don't interact with n8n because the UI doesn't work for consumers. You need to do the bulk iterative work and populate the outcome in a google sheet. But there needs to be some follow up actions which you may wanna perform on some select rows. We realized that our agentic approach already has the foundations for this. And we are currently solving this.\n\nI would love to share the solution with you and get some feedback",

Each request took 2-3 minutes to personalize properly. That's when I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire process while keeping it human and safe.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Starts with a simple form where you paste your LinkedIn post URL\n\n\\* Automatically retrieves all people who commented on that post\n\n\\* Checks connection status for each person (skips if already connected or pending)\n\n\\* Generates unique personalized messages using spin text variations\n\n\\* Sends connection requests with custom messages\n\n\\* Adds random 1-2 hour delays between each request to mimic human behavior\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take me 3-4 hours of manual work now runs completely on autopilot. Plus, the random delays and duplicate checks keep my account safe from LinkedIn's automation detection.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYour post gets 50 comments from engaged professionals:\n\n\\- Input: Paste the post URL into the form\n\n\\- Results: Workflow processes all 50 commenters over 2-3 days\n\n\\- Smart filtering: Automatically skips 15 people you're already connected with\n\n\\- Personalization: Each of the 35 new requests gets a unique message variant\n\n\\- Safety first: 1-2 hour random delays between each request\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The message personalization is clever:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIt uses spin text syntax to create variations like:\n\n\\- \"Thanks for engaging with my recent post\" OR \"Really appreciate you reacting to my latest content\"\n\n\\- \"Would love to connect and share insights\" OR \"Let's definitely connect to explore potential collaborations\"\n\n\n\nEvery single message is different, so it looks completely natural.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams building pipeline from thought leadership posts\n\n\\* Founders growing their network from viral content\n\n\\* Recruiters connecting with candidates who engage with job posts\n\n\\* Marketers expanding reach from high-performing content\n\n\\* Community builders nurturing engaged followers\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with posts that had 100+ comments. Just set it and forget it.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2724.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2724.json)",
