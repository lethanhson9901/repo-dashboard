      "text": "I have been using n8n for client work for a while now. Not hobby projects. Actual businesses paying real money to automate real workflows.\n\nAnd after doing this for long enough I have noticed some patterns that nobody in this community seems to talk about.\n\nFirst thing. Most founders have no idea what they actually want to automate. They come to me saying they want to \"automate their business\" which is the equivalent of going to a mechanic and saying \"fix my car.\" I spend the first week just watching them work and finding the one repetitive task that is quietly eating 3 hours of their day. That is where the money is.\n\nSecond thing. n8n is incredible until it isn't. The moment you start chaining more than 15 nodes together in a single workflow you are building a debugging nightmare. I have inherited workflows from other freelancers that look like circuit diagrams. Nobody can read them. Nobody can fix them when they break at 2am. I always split complex workflows into smaller ones that talk to each other. Boring but it works.\n\nThird thing. Everyone wants AI in the workflow now. Every single client asks if we can \"add AI\" somewhere. Sometimes it makes sense. Most of the time a simple IF condition does the same job faster and cheaper with zero hallucination risk. I have saved clients hundreds of dollars a month in API costs just by replacing an LLM call with a basic regex filter.\n\nThe actual stuff businesses pay for is not glamorous. Lead enrichment. Invoice parsing. Slack alerts when something goes wrong in the database. Syncing two tools that do not talk to each other natively.\n\nSimple problems. Boring solutions. Solid recurring revenue.\n\nAnyone else finding that the simplest automations are the ones clients renew contracts for every year?\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work. If you are a founder looking to get an MVP built, automate a workflow, or set up AI agents for your business I have a few slots open. Book a call from the link in my bio and we can talk through what you need.\n",

Most of my client work is either a flat project fee upfront or a monthly retainer if they want me to maintain and expand the workflows over time. I stopped doing hourly a while back. Hourly billing punishes you for being fast and efficient which makes no sense.\n\nFor hosting, self hosted n8n on a cheap VPS. DigitalOcean or Hetzner usually. Hetzner especially if the client is in Europe. A 6 dollar box handles most small to mid sized workflow loads without breaking a sweat.\n\nI only use n8n cloud for clients who absolutely refuse to think about infrastructure or have a compliance reason to keep everything managed. It gets expensive fast so I try to avoid it unless the client insists and is willing to pay for it.\n\nThe setup is boring but it works and it never goes down.",

                  "text": "Just out of curiosity, is there a big reason you use n8n rather than Microsoft Power Automate?\n\nThe reason I ask is that if the organisation already has a Microsoft enterprise license (which seems like most companies these days), then surely all you need to do is get their IT team to set you up with a service account where you could hold all of these automations in the web version of power automate, which would be no extra cost. If you want to add HTTP actions for API calls, you might need the premium Power Automate license to be acquired for the service account, which I think is something like £11/$15 per month, but with that you can run everything cloud-based on Microsoft’s servers with zero setup. \n\nI’m not super experienced in the field so I may have got some assumptions wrong / not understand enough about the pros/cons of each automation platform out there, but would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the above",

I run 52 active workflows on a self-hosted n8n instance and the ones that cause the most trouble are always the monoliths I haven't broken up yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n  On the AI point — completely agree. I went through a phase of throwing LLM calls at everything. Ended up replacing most of them with Code nodes doing regex or simple string matching. The ones where AI actually earns its cost are lead enrichment (extracting names from messy HTML) and content repurposing. Everything else is better served by a filter or a switch node.\n\n  One gotcha nobody warned me about: n8n's splitInBatches node swapped its output order in v2.6.x. Output 0 became \"done\" and Output 1 became \"loop\" — the opposite of what it was before. Had 4 workflows silently producing wrong results before I caught it. Always pin your version and test after upgrades.\n\n  What's your error handling strategy? I use a dedicated error workflow that catches failures across all 52 workflows and sends a Slack-style alert. Curious if you've found a better pattern for the 2am breaks.",

What I learned is that if I want complex automations that need solid debugging and are truly scalable, I will opt for code. As developers we usually have tons of tricks and classes that are proven and ready to go, as opposed to some spaghetti workflows that are hard to debug at times.\n\nAgain, it all depends on what works for you.  I have some simple n8n API automations that were created in a couple of hours and work great.\n\nI agree that there is too much hype from influencers.  My 2 cents.  \n\nCheers!",

Still some testing to do and work on getting good visibility like I had with n8n execution data and history, but being able to lean on Claude is much more productive than trying to arcitect something myself in n8n.",

Claude Code makes the backend side feel insanely productive, and once you get into a good flow with it, n8n can start to feel a bit heavy for anything complex. \n\n  \nThat said, I still think there’s one area where n8n really shines: **visualizing processes**.For business workflows, approvals, branching logic, or anything that needs to be explained to non‑technical teammates, that visual layer is incredibly valuable. And making small backend changes or shipping updates is super fast because everything is right there in front of you. \n\nCurious how you see this part. When you moved your 25+ workflows to Node.js, did you miss the visibility you had in n8n — like execution history, step‑by‑step traces, or just being able to “see” the whole flow at once?\n\nWould love to hear how you’re handling that now",

Now with a proper backend it's commits, PRs, pipelines to deploy, wait, check, test, repeat. Kind of a pain.\n\nI did a full review on my ported workflows and Claude has been pretty savage. Very poor resiliency. Lacking error Handling. Mainly because I avoided doing those things in n8n. So I'm fixing that in my node backend now.\n\nI'm still using n8n for all my one off automations and random stuff that isn't part of our core system.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was *good enough* to ship.\n\nCurious how others here are using AI for real builds (not just toy demos).  \nAre you letting AI write logic, or just using it as an assistant?\n\nI recorded the full build process if anyone wants to see how the workflow actually looked:  \n[https://youtu.be/ZPiDvUL4B7o](https://youtu.be/ZPiDvUL4B7o)\n\nJSON CODE HERE: [https://pastebin.com/Drv4JyXY](https://pastebin.com/Drv4JyXY)",

I wanted a better way to mix up my AI usage so I told claude what I wanted and we built a browser extension. \n\nI'm a lawyer, not a developer, so treat the code accordingly — it works, but there are patterns in here that will make real engineers wince.\n\n**Architecture:**\n\n* MV3 with port-based messaging between content scripts and background service worker\n* Platform-specific content scripts (`content-claude.js`, `content-chatgpt.js`, `content-gemini.js`) each with their own MutationObserver watching for assistant responses\n* Alarms API keepalive at 0.3 min intervals to prevent service worker termination\n* Remote config hosted on GitHub Pages with bundled fallback — lets me update DOM selectors without republishing\n* 2200ms debounce before routing to avoid capturing partial streaming responses\n* Injection guards (`window.__AI_ENSEMBLE_[PLATFORM]_V17__`) to prevent duplicate content script loading\n* Append mode — never overwrites existing text in the input field\n\n**What I learned the hard way:**\n\nThe biggest pain point is DOM selector fragility. Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini all structure their response containers differently, and they change without warning. Building the remote config system was the most forward-thinking decision I made — but it's still a maintenance treadmill.\n\nPort-based messaging turned out way more reliable than `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` for persistent connections. The service worker termination problem in MV3 is real and the Alarms API workaround feels like a hack, but it works.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/pattalkslaw-del/ai-ensemble-extension) — MIT license\n* [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-ensemble/lomphkghalmannpiophgdfjfdchfidim)\n\nBut now whenever I need something, I hit claude code or AI studio and make the software that does that one thing.

Data isolation between users, input validation on webhooks, secret handling. The AI gets the feature working but tends to skip the invisible safety stuff because it's optimizing for \"does it work\" not \"is it safe.\"\n\nNot saying your build has these issues, just that I got burned by exactly this pattern. Shipped fast, got a support ticket about one user seeing another user's data. Classic multi-tenant isolation miss that Claude didn't think to add and I didn't think to check.\n\nWorth a quick audit pass specifically looking for what's *missing* rather than what's broken.",

      "text": "n8n recently shipped \"AI Workflow Builder\" ([https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/)) where you describe what you want in plain English and it generates the workflow for you.\n\nZapier launched Agents in beta doing essentially the same thing. OpenAI dropped AgentKit with a visual agent builder at DevDay. And n8n 2.0 now lets you turn any workflow into a \"tool\" that an AI agent can call on its own when it decides it needs to.\n\nThe direction is pretty clear. \\~Two years from now, most people won't be dragging nodes around a canvas. They'll describe what they want and an agent will build it, test it, and probably fix it when it breaks.\n\nSo what actually happens to the skill of building automations? Right now knowing how to wire up a webhook to a database to an API is valuable because it's hard enough that most people can't do it. But if a prompt gets you 80% of the way there, does the remaining 20% become the only thing that matters? Things like knowing which edge cases will break in production, understanding rate limits, designing error handling that doesn't silently fail.\n\nI keep going back and forth on this. Part of me thinks the \"automation builder\" role just shifts from construction to architecture. You stop being the person who builds the workflow and start being the person who knows what the right workflow even is. The other part of me looks at how fast these tools are improving and wonders if even that gets automated away.\n\nCurious where you all land on this. Are you already using the AI builder features in your daily work? Has it actually replaced manual building for you or is it more of a starting point you still heavily edit?",

On their own it's going to be people like you still.\n\nI find it fun to vibe code/automate/ build things but there is still some complexity behind it that most people aren't going to take the time to figure out\n\n e.g supabase has 4 separate API keys took me like a hour my first time to figure out which one just view which ones edit rows etc.\n\nLet alone just building a process in general in my recent project I was uploading like 50+ ranging from 2-50mb each compressed folders and n8n would crash with to much data so had to figure out the loop node then the code node would crash with to much data figure out the set node getting it to filter correctly and update correctly I'm not smart but I'm not dumb either still took me like 3 days with all the crashes and errors and changing the flow to get it functional. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is long story short is I don't think much well change because \n1) people are lazy would rather pay someone to do \n2) people trust others who are experts or know more \n3) if they do start I bet alot give up after the first 3 failures and having to restart \n4) some people already don't trust AI let alone trust it enough to fully build something for their/a company that involves sensitive data or any data in general really\n5) alot of AI don't like you posting API keys in them at least that I have seen/done Gemini and open ai both would say delete the key you pasted it here it's exposed (I have to assume that they would fix that but well that be public then? Well that be used to train new models still?) \n\nJust my opinion I'm a landscaper personally I just like to build things for fun just started a few months ago just something to do after work.\nI personally plan to experiment around with n8ns Agent soon just to see what it's all about",

And yeah, 3 days of crashes and flow changes to handle large file uploads is exactly the gap between \"AI built me a workflow\" and \"I have a workflow that actually works\".   \n  \nI guess the real solution long term is agent-to-agent communication. Like Supabase has its own agent, n8n has its own agent, and they just talk to each other. The n8n agent asks the Supabase agent which key it needs, gets the right permissions, configures the connection. No more digging through docs for an hour. We're not fully there yet but that's clearly where it's heading.   \n  \nAlso respect for doing this after landscaping shifts, that's a solid hobby upgrade.",

Our value is shifting from **building the machine** to **guaranteeing the outcome.** We’re moving from being the ones in the trenches to being the ones who decide where the trenches should be. Clients don't pay for the speed; they pay for the guarantee and reliability.\n\nAI may be amazing at creating sophisticated workflows but it does not replace the learned experience and intuition of an expert that ***knows*** where it could go wrong.\n\nAlso this may seem ironic since I needed AI's assistance in writing this comment but I simply used it to refine my analogy and then that's where I added my personal touch.",

      "text": "Hey guys!! I’m a day late 😅 but as promised, and especially for u/Wild-Lama-474 who asked for the restaurant version, here’s the AI voice agent workflow I mentioned earlier.\n\nI originally built this around the same time as my dental receptionist agent while experimenting with AI voice automation. It was mainly a learning project, but instead of letting it sit unused in my n8n workspace, I figured it might actually help people building similar systems or learning automation.\n\nThis one is designed for **restaurant table bookings** and includes a full backend automation system for managing reservations automatically.\n\n[Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/kjbf1grce9kg1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbf406c8a8f6e27ef67ef8161286f14bb9f0a90b)\n\n[Dedicated frontend to view bookings](https://preview.redd.it/mnr1pupde9kg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28c355041f12d73e043cdb2d474647803b5907a)\n\n# 🔧 Workflow Overview\n\nThis is a **complete table booking automation system** built around four main workflows:\n\n# 🟦 1. Booking System (Main Flow)\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook (POST request for booking)\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Receives booking requests from the voice agent/web app\n* Automatically creates **date-specific Google Sheets** if they don’t exist\n* Assigns tables intelligently\n\n**Table Assignment Logic:**\n\n* Checks for available tables (`Not booked` status)\n* Same-day bookings → assigns first available table\n* Future bookings → uses **time-gap logic** so multiple bookings can exist per table safely:\n   * 90-minute booking slots\n   * Minimum 30-minute buffer between bookings\n\n**Data stored per booking:**\n\n* name\n* contact\\_number\n* guests\n* booking\\_time\n* booking\\_date\n* table\\_id\n* status\n\n# 🟩 2. Cancellation System\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook\n\n**Process:**\n\n* Finds the matching booking\n* Updates status → `Not booked (Cancelled)`\n* Clears customer info while keeping table availability intact\n\n# 🟧 3. Rescheduling System\n\n**Trigger:** Webhook\n\n**Two-step logic:**\n\n1. Creates or updates booking on the new date\n2. Removes the old booking automatically\n\nSupports both same-day and future rescheduling.\n\nStatus is marked as **“Rescheduled.”**\n\n# 🟥 4. Cleanup System\n\n**Trigger:** Scheduled (runs every 5 minutes)\n\nAutomatically:\n\n* Detects expired bookings (end time + 90 mins passed)\n* Frees tables\n* Resets status back to `Not booked`\n\n# ⭐ Key Features\n\n**Smart Table Management**\n\n* 90-minute booking duration\n* Circular time calculation (handles midnight edge cases)\n* 30-minute buffer between bookings\n\nI built this mainly to learn:\n\n* n8n automation design\n* webhook-based systems\n* scheduling logic\n* real-world state management without a traditional database\n\nIt might be a bit outdated but If you’re building AI receptionists, voice agents, or booking systems, you can reuse or modify large parts of this.\n\n[Workflow Link](https://github.com/kunal-n8n/kunal-n8n-portfolio/blob/main/workflows/restaurant_AI_VA.json)  \n[Google Template Link](https://github.com/kunal-n8n/kunal-n8n-portfolio/blob/main/google_sheets_templates/restaurant_AI_VA_template.xlsx)\n\nHappy to answer questions or explain design decisions if anyone’s curious 👍",

Below is how I thought this is solvable. \n\nThere are multiple tables at a restaurant and there's a whole row in the sheets which keeps tab of which tables are already booked for what time, so if two people called in at the same time for the same time slot they'll still be booked for two different tables. \n\nLet's say only one table is available but two people called in for the same time slot, even then, webhook executions hit at nearly the same time, both executions are processed independently by n8n. The first execution that writes the booking effectively “wins”, and the other person is asked to book again for some other day.\n\nSince this was a POC and intentionally kept DB-less, I accepted the small race-condition risk instead of adding locking via Postgres or a transactional store.",

Although you could go and deploy some stuff your self, I would say that the only reason to deploy your own stuff would be if there are data privacy concerns. The small models (I really like Ministral 3 14B) can very well be deployed on consumer grade hardware, but they are also super cheap to just query on open router. If you value your time, just try to make your application work with smaller models. To me this is in fact very liberating, because for application developers, this means much more independence from the frontier model vendors. \n\nWhat model are you currently mainly using that is responsible for the cost?",

For steady support workflows, a well tuned 7B to 14B open model with retrieval will usually get you most of the way there at a fraction of GPT tier costs. I’d validate whether you actually need fine tuning before going deep on it. In a lot of SME support cases, prompt tightening plus good RAG beats full fine tune.\n\nOn deployment, the big lever is utilization. If traffic is predictable, even a single dedicated GPU shared across multiple clients can undercut per token APIs fast. If it’s bursty, you’ll want aggressive batching or something that scales down cleanly between spikes. The real question is: what does your average daily request volume per client look like? That determines whether self hosting will actually fix the burn or just shift it.",
