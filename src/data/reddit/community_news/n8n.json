That data loop is gold for deciding where to double down on acquisition spend.\n\nRe: the $6k quote - honestly not even that overpriced for an agency that does not have internal n8n expertise. The ongoing maintenance, debugging, and iteration is where the real time sink is. You just shifted that cost to yourself, which only makes sense if you have the bandwidth and interest to maintain it.\n\nAppreciate you sharing the gist.

      "text": "I've been selling n8n-based automation services for a while now. Cold emails, Upwork projects, the whole pipeline.\n\nThe #1 lesson that changed everything: **never use the word \"automation\" in your pitch.**\n\nHere's why - I was sending 200 cold emails a week. Response rate? About 1.5%. Most replies were \"not interested\" or \"we're good.\"\n\nThen I reframed everything around **time saved** instead of technology.\n\nBefore:\n\"I'll automate your lead generation with n8n workflows\"\n\nAfter:\n\"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2 hours.\"\n\nSame exact service. Completely different response.\n\nWhat actually worked for me:\n\n1. **Lead scraping + enrichment pipeline** - Google Maps → email enrichment → cold email sequence. What used to take 5 hours manually now runs in 30 min.\n\n2. **Competitor comment mining** - Scraping LinkedIn post comments from competitors → building warm lead lists. These people already care about your space.\n\n3. **Proposal generation** - Template-based proposals that auto-fill client data. 2 hours → 15 minutes.\n\nThe ROI pitch that works: \"For every $1 you spend, you get back $X in saved labor costs per month.\"\n\nBusiness owners don't care about n8n, webhooks, or API integrations. They care about:\n- How many hours they get back\n- How much money they save\n- How fast they see results\n\nTarget businesses doing $3M-10M/year revenue. They have real pain points and actual budget. Stop pitching solopreneurs who do everything themselves.\n\nHappy to share specific workflow details if anyone's interested.",

      "text": "Hey all - figured it was time to actually join the community instead of just Googling my way through problems.  \n  \nI've been using n8n pretty much every day for the past year, both at my day job (AI automations) and for my own SEO side business. Built probably 500+ workflows at this point from super-complex to minute.  \n  \nA few things I wish someone had told me earlier:  \n  \nError handling is everything. My early workflows looked clean until something failed at 2am and I had no idea why. Now I build in fallbacks for basically every HTTP node.  \n  \nBreaking big workflows into smaller reusable pieces made my life way easier.  For example I had a project to make comments for a Google Business Profile comment reply automation that got super intricate early on. I broke it into 3 different flows, and used Supabase to be the workbench where everything came together, which leads me to my next comment....\n\nDATABASES ARE EVERYTHING - It's imperative for anyone who wants to get good at n8n to learn how to create and manipulate databases, even if that means using Claude with an MCP to build and manage the tables quickly and efficiently. \n\nSelf-hosting was worth the hassle. Cloud is fine for simple stuff but once you're running things constantly, having full control is a game changer.\n\nHave fun - build something at the weekend that makes it fun.  This weekend is Moltbot+n8n time.  Giggety. ",

Those are the lessons everyone learns after a few painful 2am failures 😅\n\nBig +1 on:\nFallbacks for every HTTP node, retries + status-based branching saves more workflows than any advanced AI logic.\nSplitting large systems into orchestrator + worker flows. Debugging and scaling becomes way more predictable.\nDatabases being non-optional once you care about state, idempotency, or audit logs. n8n really levels up once you add Postgres/Supabase.\n\nAlso fully agree on self-hosting. Cloud is fine for light use, but once workflows are always-on, webhook-heavy, or cost-sensitive, full control makes a huge difference (timeouts, memory, custom nodes, cron reliability).\nWe see this a lot with teams running self-hosted n8n (since we moved to OpenHosst with their optimized architecture for n8n we haven't faced such issues), the shift usually isn’t about “more features,” it’s about stability and predictability in production.\n\nMoltbot + n8n weekend builds sound like exactly the right kind of chaos 😄\n\nGreat post, this kind of real-world perspective helps the whole community.",

This means it often needs quiet a bit of setup and maintenance!\n\nAs someone who is running an early stage startup, I am curious, what are some better alternatives to N8N for specific tasks that does the job better?",

          "text": "Oh hell yeah, this is exactly something I can relate to! Specially the maintaining part is something that adds up over time and takes your time! We have since then moved to a bunch of dedicated tools inside our company for various tasks we used to have N8N do! Here are the ones that ended up working better\n\n* Outbound marketing: We earlier had an N8N automation but now we have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point\n* Meeting notes and action items: Again we tried setting up an automaton using N8N but since then moved to use specific tools like Otter to transcribes everything. It can also create action items, assign owners, update CRM, salesforce etc! You can even connect it to gamma to create after call presentations automatically\n* Blogs: We had an automation using N8N for both SEO and writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are much better since it's able to self improve based on google results now!\n\nThat's all I can think of rn! Curious what other tools others are using :)",

I also use a local LLM on what used to be my game system (but now it’s the AI system with an nvidia chip). I love using n8n for the workflow visibility and ease of use, but I am considering porting the entire system to be all python because I feel like I can trust the python more. Things are less abstracted than with n8n. The gui is nice, but I can also build a web gui using flask to control the automations. I’ve been thinking about converting also because I’d like to turn this into a possible business one day if I can get it all working how it needs to. For something with customers, I don’t fully trust that n8n won’t suddenly break on me after an update. However, the workflows will look really great for my current purpose (in a slide deck)",

      "text": "I've spent the last year building AI agents for B2B sales teams — from 2-person startups to 50+ sales rep organizations. Over 100 agents/automations deployed across the full sales cycle.\n\nSome were game-changers. Some were waste of time. Here's what actually works, broken down by where it sits in the pipeline.\n\nPRE-OUTREACH: Know more than your prospect expects\n\n1. Lead Enrichment Agent\n\n* Pulls LinkedIn profile, latest posts, comments, company news\n* Identifies tech stack, recent hires, funding rounds\n* Builds a lead dossier in 30 seconds that would take an SDR 20 minutes\n\n2. ICP Scoring Agent\n\n* Scores leads against your ideal customer profile automatically\n* Flags high-intent signals (job postings, tech changes, funding)\n* Prioritizes your pipeline so reps work the hottest leads first\n\n3. Personalized Icebreaker Agent\n\n* Reads the lead's last 5 LinkedIn posts + company news\n* Generates 3 hyper-specific openers — not \"I saw your company is growing\" garbage\n* Actually references something the prospect cares about\n\nOUTREACH: Send less, land more\n\n4. Sequence Builder Agent\n\n* Creates multi-touch sequences tailored to persona + industry\n* A/B tests subject lines and CTAs automatically\n* Adjusts tone based on whether it's a CEO, VP, or end user\n\n5. Campaign Reporting Agent\n\n* Daily/weekly automated reports: open rates, reply rates, booked meetings\n* Flags underperforming sequences before you waste a full week\n* Compares performance across segments so you double down on what works\n\nPRE-MEETING: Walk in prepared, not winging it\n\n6. Meeting Prep Agent - 2 hours before every call, delivers a one-pager to the rep:  \n\n* Lead summary (role, company, pain points)\n* Likely objections based on company profile and industry\n* Competitor intel (what else they might be evaluating)\n* Suggested talking points and questions\n* Reps stopped \"doing research\" for 15 min before calls. Now it's done for them.\n\n7. Automated Scheduling Agent\n\n* Handles the back-and-forth of booking meetings\n* Syncs with CRM + calendar\n* Sends confirmations + reminders automatically\n\nPOST-MEETING: Where most teams drop the ball\n\n8. Proposal Generator Agent\n\n* Listens to the meeting transcript (or takes structured notes)\n* Generates a tailored proposal within 30 minutes of the call ending\n* Includes pricing, scope, timeline — pre-filled based on what was discussed\n* Rep reviews, tweaks, sends. Instead of spending 2 hours writing from scratch.\n\n9. CRM Auto-Update Agent (My personal favorite one)\n\n* Updates deal stage, notes, next steps after every interaction\n* No more \"can everyone please update Salesforce\" emails from management\n* Pipeline is always current without reps doing data entry\n\n10. Follow-Up Agent\n\n* Sends personalized follow-ups based on meeting outcome\n* Adjusts timing and content based on engagement signals\n* Escalates stale deals to managers automatically\n\nResults across our implementations:\n\n* Average 2x increase in meetings booked per rep\n* Proposal turnaround: from multiple hours → 20 minutes\n* CRM accuracy: from \\~40% → 95%+ (because humans aren't doing the entry)\n* Reps spend 60%+ more time actually selling instead of admin work\n\nThe pattern:\n\nThe teams that got the biggest results didn't just automate random tasks. They automated the boring stuff that steals selling time — research, data entry, scheduling, reporting — and let their reps focus on the only thing AI can't do yet: building relationships.\n\nHappy to answer questions in the comments.",

You can use Claude or similar, and there is even a long section in the course dedicated to coding which helped me understand enough about JavaScript / JSON. \n\nI also felt like I'm out of my league when I started learning n8n, but I believe anyone can learn. Especially that you can problem solve and create code when needed with the help of Claude / GPT.\n\nFor motivation if you need, here are some things I built with zero coding knowledge:\n\n- A weekly customised newsletter with news from the AI and SEO industry.\n\n- An workflow for labeling all my 9000+ emails and helping me clean my inbox.\n\n- A finance tracker where I type or speak into telegram app the spendings and incomes and sends the details into a Google sheet where it further calculates differences from incomes/spendings.\n\n- An AI invoice automation that scans monthly pdf invoices from my Google drive and uploads details into notion as well as sending me an automated email with the invoices sum totals and breakdown. \n\n- A workflow that scrapes Google and creates content with self-checks steps that also formats and uploads the content in Google drive + internal linking process integrated. (This is not specifically in the course but I couldn't do it without what I learned in the course).\n\n- An AI chat agent that I integrated on my website that I fed it with my own knowledge about SEO to give personalised SEO answers directly to site visitors.\n\n+ Many more that I built but don't personally need like a CV summariser, automated customer support messaging with sentiment analysis and sentiment-aware replies. Or AI video generation and automated posting on social media. \n\nAfter you start learning you will understand why coding isn't really needed.",

Personally I don't think you will be able to learn one small service as good as selling it, without knowing to do a lot more than just that one small service. \n\nThere are always caveats in my experience. Almost every workflow I did in the course required some adjustments to make it work for my own scenario. N8n is updating and things change. Or the other tools you connect with N8N change and you need to find workarounds by yourself or by looking for info online or asking LLM. \n\nEven if you want to sell it I think every client will have something slightly different. Maybe one uses notion, the other uses Asana instead. And notion and Asana they might have different ways to connect with n8n. And you will need to know both. \n\nI think you just need to start first and then decide what questions to ask.   \n\nAnd I think having expectations and doubts will hurt the learning process. \n\nIn short, the course is not what you want. But then again I don't think you understand what you want. Because it seems you have ideas about automation that are not true. Automations are like open ended tools. \n\nYou use ai agents with detailed prompts, and you refine and improve the prompts. And then there are updates from the tools you connect with N8N that might change how they connect or change settings and interface. That's why I believe you need to know as much as possible to be able to do any one single automation and do it well. \n\nPersonally, I'm strange and I need to learn something new constantly to make my days feel less boring and more productive. I didn't start with expectations. And I think that is a benefit as your mind is better set to learning that way.",

Returns true/false\n4. **Customizes resume per job** - GPT-4.1 rewrites keywords, skills, bullets to match each job description\n5. **Creates new Google Doc** with the customized resume, sets sharing permissions\n6. **Finds hiring manager email** via AnyMailFinder (decision-maker lookup by domain)\n7. **Drafts personalized email** in Gmail with the custom resume link\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nMost resumes get killed by ATS keyword filtering before a human ever sees them. The only way to beat it is to tailor each application. But doing that manually takes 30+ minutes per job.\n\nNow it takes about 90 seconds of review per application.\n\n**Stack:**\n- n8n (orchestration)\n- Apify (LinkedIn scraper)\n- OpenAI GPT-4.1 / 4.1-mini\n- Google Docs/Drive API\n- AnyMailFinder\n- Gmail\n\n**What actually works:**\n- AI for filtering and rewriting = huge time saver\n- Human review before sending = keeps quality high\n- Targeting hiring managers directly = better response rate than applying through portals\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup.",

It wasn’t perfect, but it was *good enough* to ship.\n\nCurious how others here are using AI for real builds (not just toy demos).  \nAre you letting AI write logic, or just using it as an assistant?\n\nI recorded the full build process if anyone wants to see how the workflow actually looked:  \n[https://youtu.be/ZPiDvUL4B7o](https://youtu.be/ZPiDvUL4B7o)\n\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lesson 2 by KVK AUTOMATES: AI UGC Product Videos\",\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"parameters\": {},\n          \"type\": \"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolThink\",\n          \"typeVersion\": 1,\n          \"position\": [\n            784,\n            448\n          ],\n          \"id\": \"ca83167b-c8be-422c-9a7e-43530f727c07\",\n          \"name\": \"Think\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"parameters\": {\n            \"resource\": \"image\",\n            \"operation\": \"analyze\",\n            \"modelId\": {\n              \"__rl\": true,\n              \"value\": \"chatgpt-4o-latest\",\n              \"mode\": \"list\",\n              \"cachedResultName\": \"CHATGPT-4O-LATEST\"\n            },\n            \"text\": \"Return the analysis in YAML format with the following fields:\\n\\nbrand_name: (Name of the brand shown in the image, if visible or inferable)\\ncolor_scheme:\\n  - hex: (Hex code of each prominent color used)\\n    name: (Descriptive name of the color)\\nfont_style: (Describe the font family or style used: serif/sans-serif, bold/thin, etc.)\\nvisual_description: (A full sentence or two summarizing what is seen in the image, ignoring the background)\\n\\nOnly return the YAML.

This means:\\n    - Everyday realism with authentic, relatable settings\\n    - Amateur-quality iPhone photo/video style\\n    - Slightly imperfect framing and lighting\\n    - Real-world environments left as-is (clutter, busy backgrounds)\\n    - Authentic imperfections in capture (slight blur, imperfect exposure, etc.)\\n\\n  We need these videos to look natural and real. So in the prompts, have the Camera parameter always use keywords like these:\\n  unremarkable amateur iPhone photo, reddit image, snapchat video, casual iPhone selfie,\\n  slightly uneven framing, authentic share, slightly blurry, amateur quality phone photo\\n\\n  DIALOGUE RULES:\\n  - If the dialogue is not provided, is too short (under 30 characters), or looks like a test/placeholder (e.g. 'test', 'hello', 'asdf'), you MUST generate a proper casual, conversational dialogue under 200 characters.\\n  - The dialogue should sound like a person speaking naturally to a friend about the product. Avoid overly formal or sales-like language.\\n  - Use ... to indicate pauses, and avoid special characters like em dashes or hyphens.\\n  - NEVER use a dialogue that is just one word or doesn't make sense as spoken words.\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n    - Do NOT use double quotes anywhere in the image_prompt or video_prompt YAML strings.\\n    - The image_prompt MUST NOT include any human or human parts.\\n    - The video_prompt MUST include a human interacting with the product.\\n\\n  A – Ask:\\n    Generate image and video generation instructions for AI image and video generation models based on the user's request,\\n    ensuring exact YAML format for both image and video prompts. Infer aspect ratios from vertical/horizontal context; default to vertical if unspecified.\\n\\n    Scene count rule:\\n      - Read the user's requested number of videos (an explicit integer) and output exactly that many scenes.\\n      - If the user does not specify a number, default to 1 scene.\\n      - Never output more or fewer scenes than requested.\\n\\n  G – Guidance (Critical Rules):\\n\\n    1) IMAGE PROMPT = PRODUCT-ONLY (NO HUMANS)\\n       - The image_prompt MUST depict ONLY the product and environment.\\n       - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in image_prompt:\\n         - any person/human/character/model/influencer\\n         - any face, head, body, skin, hair, silhouette\\n         - any hands, fingers, arms, legs, feet\\n         - any reflections showing a person\\n         - any \\\"someone holding\\\", \\\"in their hand\\\", \\\"worn by\\\", \\\"on a person\\\"\\n       - If interaction is needed, use non-human supports only:\\n         - table, shelf, countertop, car seat, desk, nightstand, floor, hook, stand, tripod, clamp, box, bag\\n       - The image_prompt should still be casual and real, like an iPhone product pic, but with no people.\\n\\n    2) VIDEO PROMPT = HUMAN PRESENT + INTERACTING\\n       - The video_prompt MUST include a human (UGC creator) who is holding, using, wearing, or demonstrating the product.\\n       - It should feel like a casual phone-recorded clip.\\n       - Human diversity guidance applies ONLY to the video_prompt (not the image_prompt).\\n       - Default age range 21 to 38 unless user specifies otherwise.\\n\\n    3) CONSISTENCY\\n       - The product must match the reference image accurately, including brand marks and any text.\\n       - Never invent extra features or accessories not present in the reference image unless the user explicitly asks.\\n\\n    4) CAMERA STYLE\\n       - Always keep camera phrasing aligned with casual phone capture.\\n       - Avoid studio language: no softbox, no 3-point lighting, no seamless backdrop.\\n\\n    5) DIVERSITY RULE (VIDEO ONLY)\\n       - Ensure diversity in gender, ethnicity, and hair color when generating multiple scenes and when applicable.\\n       - Do NOT apply this diversity rule to the image_prompt, because the image_prompt contains no humans.\\n\\n  E – Examples:\\n    good_examples:\\n      - |\\n        {\\n          \\\"scenes\\\": [\\n

I’ve been learning n8n for 2 weeks now, and I built 3 workflows where it collects leads from a webhook (I used fake leads and pinned them), saves them into a Google Sheet, and notifies the owner. Next, using a Google Sheets trigger, an AI analyzes and scores the lead, classifies it as hot, warm, or cold, and updates the same row in the sheet. Then, in the last workflow, it sends the right follow-up based on the lead’s category while also updating the lead’s status. I built this with the guidance of chatgpt, and I’d appreciate any feedback and tips to improve my knowledge and skills so I can eventually earn money from this skill.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vgbxsz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c90afc4f87d176d23a21a0226e793a51f83dc3ae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkwrouz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dd9a6c10856c958f0f2791db44366ec751422aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls8wbuz052hg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=40aa4a4a02bbd0c6ea5a08ddd52bc06568ba0293\n\n  \n",

          "text": "Few notes on the workflows from the little info I have:\n\n1. Start building the habit of naming your nodes to be more descriptive so that it's easier to read - not just for others but also for you. If you do this well then the workflow itself serves as a documentation. For example I don't know what happens in the 'if' nodes, would need to click on it and open it first. Not sure what you were trying to do with the wait nodes but at least add how long it waits.\n2. If you are using AI only for simple tasks like classification, don't use an AI Agent node. In N8N AI Agent nodes have extra prompt wrappers so it would take more tokens for no reason. Use LLM Chain node instead.\n\nOne thing that I preach on the internet is \"Stop watching tutorials. Start building.\" and you are clearly doing that, so big kudos! The next step is keep building real solutions to real problems. I'd recommend going on Upwork, and look for automation job posts, see if you can create a demo based on the job requirements. Once you are consistently able to solve these, don't get stuck building non stop, start earning by applying for these jobs. That's how I got started.",

Chances are that they will hire you to solve more (complex) problems for them if you do a good job. \n\nAlso: make sure you dive into error handling and handling unexpected values in your current and future automations.
