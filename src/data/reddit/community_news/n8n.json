      "text": "l need to share this because I keep seeing people say \"AI agents are dead\" or \"you can't land big clients\" - this is complete BS and here's proof.\n\n**The Client**\n\nCriminal defense lawyer in Australia (keeping them anonymous for obvious reasons). They handle all types of criminal cases and were spending a TON of money hiring people to manage incoming leads. Most leads came through WhatsApp, and they were losing potential clients left and right because they couldn't respond fast enough.\n\n**The Solution I Built**\n\nI created an AI agent that lives in WhatsApp as a chatbot and integrates with their Salesforce CRM. Here's what it does:\n\n\\- **Transcribes audio messages** from potential clients automatically\n\n\\- **Responds intelligently to any query** 24/7 (like an actual human)\n\n\\- **Creates geographic heat maps** based on client addresses - shows where most cases are coming from to enable targeted ad campaigns\n\n\\- **Filters and stars high-priority cases** directly in their CRM\n\n\\- **Sends final invoices via email** automatically\n\nAll inputs come through WhatsApp. All outputs go to Salesforce and email. Complete automation.\n\n**Development time: 5 weeks**\n\n**Testing period: 2 weeks**\n\n**How It Went Down**\n\nFirst call: Pretty casual, just getting to know each other. He asked for a demo video.\n\nBefore the second call: I created a Loom video (about 10 minutes) showing exactly how everything worked. Sent it 2-3 minutes before our meeting.\n\nSecond call: This is where it got crazy. We watched the demo together for an hour. I walked him through every feature, showed him how it would replace multiple staff members handling leads.\n\nHe was BLOWN AWAY.\n\nBy the end of the call, he asked if we could start RIGHT NOW. In 2.5 years as an automation engineer, I've never had a client ready to pay on the spot during the second call.\n\nHe said \"let me talk to my finance department to get this started quickly. I love your solution.\"\n\n**Less than an hour after that call ended, I received the first 50% payment: $2,700 USD.**\n\nI literally just stared at my bank account. This was real.\n\n**The Results**\n\nProject is now complete. The client is thrilled. \n\nHere's the kicker: **I'm saving him approximately $250,000 USD annually** by solving their lead response problem and preventing clients from going to competitors.\n\nMy fee? **$5,400 total.**\n\nWorth every penny for both of us.\n\nI just sent the final invoice for the remaining $2,700 today as we wrapped up the project.\n\n**To Everyone Saying \"AI Agents Are Dead\"**\n\nThis post is a punch in the face to that narrative. \n\nRAG agents work. AI automation works. Real businesses have real problems that AI can solve RIGHT NOW.\n\nStop listening to the doom and gloom. Start building solutions for real problems.\n\n**Note to mods:** This isn't promotional - I'm not selling anything. Just sharing a success story to counter all the negativity I see here about AI agents being \"dead\" or \"overhyped.\"\n\nMy hands are literally still shaking as I dictate this using AI for obvious reasons. This is the future, and it's already here.\n\nSo all the n8n haters or doubters are u still think that ai agent is ded or have no future? ",

This is a fixed price engagement with a managed service support model on the backend.   These types of solutions in the past would run them $200k+.  \n\nLove the success but for that price they probably lost money.",

That means you underpriced by at least 10x. If your solution replaces multiple staff members handling leads, you should be charging recurring, not a flat project fee. That $5,400 is gone. His savings compound every month.\n\nThe \"my hands are still shaking\" energy is great for a reddit post but in practice you just did 7 weeks of work for what breaks down to about $770/week. That's not life-changing money for the complexity you described. WhatsApp integration, Salesforce CRM, audio transcription, geographic heat maps, automated invoicing. That's serious engineering.\n\nThe real lesson here isn't \"AI agents work.\" It's that you found a real problem, built a real solution, and closed it fast. That part is legit and most people never get there. But the pricing tells me you were so excited to close that you left a lot on the table.\n\nNo hate. I build with n8n too and I know how easy it is to underprice when you're just happy someone said yes. But next time, charge what the outcome is worth, not what the build took.",

One as near term history which is as you think of it today being mostly the full conversation where nothing is lost.  Then once that hits a specific number of tokens, you compress that (through varying techniques) into 'observational memory' section that is a much more concise version of what happened with way less details in it.  That way you kind of have a short term memory and a long term memory that consumes way less tokens over time, albeit with loss in precision for older stuff.\n\nI don't know for sure that is what is being done here, but I do it in my low level agents I am building for enterprises, and it works quite well.  A lot of the 'big boys' are doing this internally in their hosted llm solutions under the covers.",

I imagine the tricky part is deciding the compression threshold and what detail level to keep in the long term store. Too aggressive and you lose context that matters later, too conservative and you're just pushing the token limit problem down the road.\nDo you use a fixed token count trigger for compression or something more dynamic like topic boundary detection? And for the compressed summaries, are you generating those with the same model that's running the agent or a separate smaller model to save on cost?",

There are also things I want to happen the same way every time, but have adaptability and creativity at different points.  It is a balance.\n\nBy using deterministic paths at the points where it makes sense (and is much cheaper to run), but allowing freedom at the right places, you do end up with a very useful agentic approach.  The balance is key, but is also the power in that you don't end up with completely wonky behavior that could be very dangerous, and it is easier to add human in the loop where it is a good idea (like making the final purchase).",

Minus a lot of the user info and stuff. Then you may not have to worry as much about adding a whole new AI agent node for a new sub agent. Your sub agent can be a workflow with most of the capabilities of the main one and it can be called as many times as you need so you are less limited by the workflow and having to add more for more agents and only limited by computing power. \n\nThis may not work at all like I’m thinking, but could be something interesting to try!",

Maybe there are some gurus who make this money but honestly, someone who makes 100,000s of views on youtube most likely does not have a running business but youtube is the profitable business.\n\nFor sure some people make this kind of money but they just qualify better customers. I think your customer just do not have enough budget or not enough digital literacy.\n\nMaybe also you just dont make it big enough. Marketing and Sales is in the end always a little lie or a strong simplification of things. And it is never a good idea to give away something for free.\n\nI dont sell N8N workflows. But how I sell my tech solutions:\n\n\\- Understand the problem and draft with them a \"solution\"\n\n\\- Show them what have been worked for others\n\n\\- Sell a mini implementation and use the time to bump up the use-case. There is always more hidden and you just need find the angel how you fit in.\n\nHowever, make sure that your potential leads are qualified right. If you try to improve workflows for some small businesses (night shops, restaurants) your ticket size might be too small or you have not yet find the right way to explain them a potential value..",

      "text": "Most companies think they need a moonshot AI initiative to see real ROI.  \n  \nThey don't.  \n  \nThe biggest wins come from very practical (and often boring) use cases. The ones that remove bottlenecks, kill manual work, and make workflows predictable.  \n  \nHere's what's consistently delivering results for our clients:  \n  \n1/ Document Extraction & Parsing  \nAI reads PDFs, contracts, invoices. Extracts structured data. Pushes it into your CRM, ERP, or database. No human retyping.  \n  \n2/ Data Cleaning & Organization  \nDuplicate detection. Categorization. Format standardization. If your team spends hours \"cleaning things up\" — this is a massive unlock.  \n  \n3/ Workflow Automation + AI Reasoning  \nTraditional automation handles rigid rules. AI handles the gray area. Combine LLM decision-making with trigger-based workflows in n8n, Make, or Zapier. Operations start running themselves.  \n  \n4/ Knowledge Agents  \nYour company sits on years of SOPs, manuals, and docs nobody reads. AI agents search, summarize, and answer questions across all of it. Instantly.  \n  \n5/ Customer Support  \nAI support agents now handle 30-80% of inquiries. Same inputs every time: FAQs, policies, product data, past tickets. Humans only touch edge cases.  \n  \n6/ Data Enrichment & Research  \nPull missing fields. Categorize leads. Enrich CRM records with Clay or custom agents. Removes hours of manual research from sales and ops teams.  \n  \n7/ Reporting & Insight Generation  \nInstead of scrolling dashboards, AI reads your data, spots patterns, and generates weekly executive summaries. Like adding an analyst to the team.  \n  \n8/ Document Generation  \nReports. Product briefs. Training materials. AI fills the structure using your real data. Same quality. Fraction of the time.  \n  \n9/ Sales Team Agents  \nMeeting prep, CRM auto-updates, proposal generation. Three agents that save 5+ hours per rep per week. Cut proposal time by 80%. They pay for themselves in week one.  \n  \nThe pattern is simple.  \n  \nFind the repetitive data work your team does every week.  \nReplace it with AI + workflows.",

If the AI is generating messages from a bare LinkedIn profile, the output reads generic no matter how good the prompt is.\n\nThe trick is enriching the prospect data before the personalization step. Pull their recent posts, company news, or any public content they've written. That gives the model something specific to reference instead of just restating their job title back to them.\n\nFor the LinkedIn rate limiting side, are you spreading sends across the day or batching? LinkedIn's detection has gotten aggressive in 2026, especially on new accounts. Keeping under 20 to 25 connection requests per day with randomized timing seems to be the safe zone right now.",

      "text": "If you've been using the HTTP Request node to call Claude's API in your n8n workflows, you know how quickly the API costs add up — especially if you're running multiple automations daily.\n\nI found a way to use your existing Claude Pro subscription ($20/month) as a personal API endpoint that you can call directly from n8n. No separate API billing, no usage-based charges.\n\nHere's how it works at a high level:\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* Spin up a small VPS (DigitalOcean $6/month droplet works fine)\n* Install Claude Code SDK and authenticate with your Pro account\n* Run a lightweight FastAPI server that exposes a `/generate` endpoint\n* Secure it with a simple API key header\n\n**Connecting to n8n:**\n\n* Use the HTTP Request node\n* POST to [`http://your-server-ip:3001/generate`](http://your-server-ip:3001/generate)\n* Pass your prompt in the request body\n* Add your custom API key in the headers\n* That's it — Claude responds just like the official API\n\nI've been running this for my own content generation and automation workflows and it handles everything — writing, summarization, data extraction, you name it.\n\nFull step-by-step setup walkthrough here if you want to follow along: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O\\_Aq7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O_Aq7E)\n\nHappy to answer any questions if you try setting this up.\n\n**A word of caution:** This is great for personal projects and experimentation, but I wouldn't recommend using this for heavy client work or production-level automations. Anthropic will likely notice if you're pushing heavy usage through this — my estimate is anything beyond $200-$400 worth of equivalent API usage could get flagged, and there's a real chance your account gets blocked. Use it wisely for your own smaller workflows and testing. For serious client/production work, stick to the official API.",

Curious how stable it’s been for you over time and whether you’ve hit any friction with longer workflows?\n\nNice write-up 👌",

You can make a note in the workflow or several with you contact info, link to subscribe, link to your newsletter, link to the blog post ect. Just use the note node like an advertisement. Some guys might delete it but I would keep it and check your stuff out. You can even build smaller workflows like on how to build an AI agent that gives you daily stock updates or how to build a stock tracking dashboard, or how to vibe code your own bot that makes trades based off your voice context like \"Buy 3 shares of Apple when it reaches x. Then save that in a google sheet and the agent checks once a days and will alert you if it does buy it or if it runs into a problem it cant solve. If you really like stock trading ect and automations you could blow up really big if do it right.",

      "text": "Been grinding in the automation space for a long time now. Here's what actually moves the needle vs. what sounds good on paper:\n\n1. Start embarrassingly small\n\nYour first workflow should take 10 minutes to build, not 10 hours. I burned weeks overcomplicating things when a basic \"new form submission → auto reply\" would've taught me twice as much.\n\n2. Document everything in public\n\nEvery single automation you build is content waiting to happen. The screenshots, the lessons, the stuff that broke. All of it becomes proof that you know what you're doing. I land more clients from sharing my process than from polished demos.\n\n3. Learn the HTTP Request node before anything else\n\nI mean it. Half the \"limitations\" people complain about in n8n vanish once you can write custom API calls. It handles everything the native nodes can't. It's the one skill that changes the game.\n\n4. Drop the \"automation expert\" title\n\nEveryone uses it. Try this instead: \"I help \\[specific industry\\] eliminate \\[specific pain point\\].\" Being specific attracts people who will pay premium because you described their exact problem.\n\n5. Saying no makes you more money\n\nI passed on a $500 project last month because it didn't fit my niche. That same client came back two weeks later with a $3K project that was a perfect match. Holding your line creates value.\n\n6. Error handling separates beginners from pros\n\nEverybody shows the clean version. The real ones build for when APIs crash, data formats shift, or users submit garbage. If you're not planning for chaos, you're not ready for production.\n\n7. Post your failures, not just your wins\n\n\"Here's how I accidentally broke a client's workflow and what I learned from it\" outperforms \"Look at this flawless automation\" every single time. Being real builds trust faster than being perfect.\n\n8. Recurring revenue beats one time builds\n\nClients pay once for the setup. They pay monthly for \"keep it running and make it better.\" Maintenance contracts will always outperform project work.\n\n9. Other automators are your best referral source\n\nThey're not competition. Help people in communities, answer questions, share what you know. Half my inbound clients come from other builders sending people my way.\n\n10. Automate your own stuff first\n\nNothing proves you know automation like having your own lead gen, content pipeline, and client onboarding fully automated. Walk the talk.\n\nSpeaking of which, I genuinely love building n8n workflows. It's one of my favorite things to do. If you've got a project you need built, I'll probably take it on. Most workflows I'll do for $50, bigger ones around $100, and even the complex multi day builds top out at $200. I just enjoy the work and I'd rather keep the barrier low so more people actually get automated.\n\nBonus: The automators making real money talk about outcomes, not nodes. \"Saved 15 hours a week\" lands way harder than \"Built a 47 step workflow.\"\n\nWhat's been your biggest learning curve with automation? Curious what trips people up vs. what clicks right away.",

Also log source URL, date scraped, and “why they’re on the list” in separate columns so you’re not stuck sending generic agency cold spam.\n\n\n\nOn the infra side, I’d dump everything into Postgres/Supabase instead of only Sheets and add a dedupe key on domain + email. Then sequence from Apollo, with reply-stop logic and a suppression list synced back to the DB. I’ve used Clay, Apollo, and Pulse for Reddit together like this: scrape + enrich, then use Reddit conversations to warm up messaging before blasting a new niche.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, treat this as a pipeline, not just a fun demo, and it becomes a serious asset.",

          "text": "We found out the hard way. Two years ago, we decided to build agents and automations supporting every part of our company.  Tried n8n and other well-known frameworks. Experienced EXACTLY what you're describing!\n\nIn the end, our solution was to create our own framework. It solves all of these issues by replacing flow graphs with tables.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the table-based interface naturally ads real-time observability! Just by looking at the table, you can instantly see failed cells, check out the details and re-run (we added a spreadsheet-like interface). This has saved us crazy amounts of time in production! Debugging, adjusting and re-running is not an annoyance anymore.\n\nSecondly, storage and agent memory are built in from the get go. There's no need to connect databases or Google Sheets if you need your agents to remember anything. The workflows become much simpler and connecting them is as simple as accessing the data of one table from another.\n\nApart from that, we found two amazing side effects of the switch from flow graphs to tables:\n\n1. Customers and users instantly understand the agents we're building, because they know spreadsheets. Everyone in business has worked with Excel at some point, right? So this has been a massive boost for adoption and helped us overcome objections from users. \n2. The spreadsheet like interface naturally added human-in-the-loop capability to every workflow. Human team members and agents simply collaborate by editing data in cells. If an agent needs approval, or some piece of information, someone edits a cell and the agent picks it up and continues its task.\n\nWe built this for our startup in-house, but since it's worked so well we decided to release it publicly. If you decide to check it out at [taibles.ai](http://taibles.ai) (free!), please please please give me feedback :-)",

Simple, not life-changing, but a solid first build.\n2. **Meeting reminder automation:** Sends reminders to participants who haven't responded to tomorrow's meetings. After accidentally blasting a few dozen emails to last month's contacts due to a broken filter... it now works and is live.\n\nThen I hit a wall. I wanted to pull my LinkedIn post analytics into a dashboard automatically. Seemed straightforward. It wasn't:\n\n* LinkedIn's API doesn't give you the data you actually want\n* Scraping gets you blocked\n* OneDrive integration failed due to licensing issues\n* Google Drive with self-hosted n8n apparently isn't stable\n\nAfter 1.5 days of troubleshooting, I realized I could have just built the whole thing manually in Excel.\n\nWhich brings me to my actual question: **How do you decide what's worth automating?** Do you have a mental framework or threshold? How do you deal with hitting platform limitations that turn a 30-minute idea into a multi-day rabbit hole?\n\nWould love to hear from people who've been through this learning curve.  \nAre there any projects you thought they were great and had a good learning curve?

The trick is learning to quit early. When a “quick win” turns into day 2 with auth errors and workarounds, I step back and ask: “Would I still build this if I had to maintain it for a year?”\n\nGood learning projects that *are* worth it:\n\n* inbox / message triage\n* reminders and follow-ups\n* summaries and reports\n* routing things to the right place/person\n\nYour first two projects are actually great examples. The LinkedIn one is a classic trap — everyone hits it. Automating judgment-free, low-risk tasks is where n8n really shines.",

The LinkedIn API wall is brutal — it's one of those dead ends that eats days.\n\nRule of thumb I use: if it takes >3 hours to automate something you do monthly, it's not worth it yet. Focus on high-frequency, low-friction tasks first (emails, Slack notifications, simple data moves between apps).\n\nPlatform limitations = stop sign, not challenge. For LinkedIn analytics specifically, you're better off with a purpose-built tool or a simple manual dashboard than trying to scrape it through n8n. The scraping path always ends badly (rate limits, blocks, broken selectors every update).\n\nFor what's actually worth automating: look at what you do >3x/week that follows a predictable pattern. That's your sweet spot. Meeting reminders and screenshot→calendar were solid picks — keep going in that direction.",

One-off tasks that take 1.5 days to automate vs 30 minutes to do manually? Just do it manually.\n\n**Pain vs complexity**: The manual pain has to be significantly worse than the automation complexity. Your LinkedIn analytics example is perfect - you hit API limitations, licensing issues, stability problems. That's the automation screaming \"this isn't worth it.\"\n\nThe LinkedIn thing specifically: platforms expose the data THEY want you to have, not what you actually need. When you hit that wall, it's usually a sign to pivot.\n\nYour screenshot→calendar and meeting reminders? Those are good automations because:\n\n* You do them repeatedly\n* The APIs are designed to support exactly what you're trying to do\n* The alternative (manual entry every time) is genuinely annoying\n\nIf you're 3 hours into troubleshooting and still not close to working, that's usually my signal to kill it and do it manually.\n\nHope this helps!  \n\\-Winston  \nSandbox54, Founder",
