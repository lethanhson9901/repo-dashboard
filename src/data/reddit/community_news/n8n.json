      "text": "I run a small automation agency and build n8n workflows for clients every day. And honestly I'm getting fuckin tired of the AI agent slop.\n\nEvery week there's a new post: \"Built an AI agent that handles my entire customer support!\" or \"My autonomous workflow runs my whole business!\"\n\nThen you look at the actual workflow and it's... an LLM node connected to 3 tools. That's not an agent. That's a switch node with extra API costs.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love n8n's AI capabilities. We use them constantly. But for practical stuff:\n\n- Extracting data from messy PDFs clients send\n- Summarizing email threads before they hit the CRM\n- Categorizing support tickets so they route to the right person\n\nThese save real time, these are boring but these dont hallucinate when you ask it the weather\n\nMeanwhile the \"AI agent\" posts are usually either:\n1. Demos that break in production\n2. Workflows that cost $50/day in API calls to do what a $0 regex could do\n3. Cool experiments that the person will abandon in 2 weeks\n\nThe n8n team has built genuinely useful AI features. The agent node is powerful when you actually need autonomous decision-making. But please dont try and fucking tell me AI is now managing your 300k a year marketing team just because you have an http request to nano banana, one to veo3 and another to 11labs 😂\n\nOh and dont even get me started on molbots/clawdbot...\n\nAnyone else feel like we've collectively lost the plot on what \"AI automation\" actually means",

I think everyone is tired of holier-than-thou jackasses knocking together shitty N8N workflows in their bedrooms while claiming to run an \"automation agency\". \n\nWhy don't you share some of your \"true\" AI workflows if you're so smart?\n\nWhy don't do you make an encouraging post showing  people how they are limiting themselves and not utilising the the potential uses?\n\nWhy don't you make a post explaining how people can build useful tools without making $50/day API calls?\n\nWhy don't Make a post highlighting the importance of resilience in production and giving some tips?\n\nOf course you'd rather just come and shit on people to make yourself feel smart and important.",

Not everyone has the same learning curve, and nobody starts out building perfect PDF-extracting agents on day one. Even if they are making mistakes or doing things inefficiently, if it works for them, why does it matter? Let them build, break things, and eventually learn the best practices on their own time.",

People are trying to let the LLM handle the routing, which is non-deterministic and expensive.\n​Real production resilience comes from using the LLM only for extraction/transformation, while the Bridge Logic handles the routing via strict JSON schema validation. I’ve spent the last few months building a 'Self-Healing' n8n Framework that uses this hybrid approach—it doesn't break when the LLM 'hallucinates' a path. Happy to share the logic map of the 'Guardrail' structure with the group.",

The category normalization with the memory system is clever - I've seen so many finance trackers where categories just spiral out of control.\n\n\n\nA few thoughts from someone who works with similar workflows:\n\n\n\n1. For scaling those LLM-heavy nodes, have you considered implementing rate limiting at the n8n level? I usually add a queue node before heavy API calls to prevent timeout issues during peak usage.\n\n\n\n2. Your multi-path logging is clean. One optimization I'd suggest: you could use sub-workflows for each transaction type instead of having them all in the main flow. Makes debugging way easier down the line.\n\n\n\n3. The Redis + MongoDB + Airtable combo makes sense given your use case. Though you might be able to consolidate Redis and Airtable if you set up proper TTLs in Airtable (they have automation features now that could handle memory cleanup).\n\n\n\nGreat job sharing this with the code! This is exactly the kind of real-world implementation people can learn from.",

I'll look into queue mode and throttling for LLM calls.\n\nI like the sub-workflow idea too. The main flow has grown quite large, so splitting by transaction type makes sense for maintainability\n\nThanks again for the insights. Super helpful to hear from someone running similar workflows.",

What I learned is that if I want complex automations that need solid debugging and are truly scalable, I will opt for code. As developers we usually have tons of tricks and classes that are proven and ready to go, as opposed to some spaghetti workflows that are hard to debug at times.\n\nAgain, it all depends on what works for you.  I have some simple n8n API automations that were created in a couple of hours and work great.\n\nI agree that there is too much hype from influencers.  My 2 cents.  \n\nCheers!",

Claude Code makes the backend side feel insanely productive, and once you get into a good flow with it, n8n can start to feel a bit heavy for anything complex. \n\n  \nThat said, I still think there’s one area where n8n really shines: **visualizing processes**.For business workflows, approvals, branching logic, or anything that needs to be explained to non‑technical teammates, that visual layer is incredibly valuable. And making small backend changes or shipping updates is super fast because everything is right there in front of you. \n\nCurious how you see this part. When you moved your 25+ workflows to Node.js, did you miss the visibility you had in n8n — like execution history, step‑by‑step traces, or just being able to “see” the whole flow at once?\n\nWould love to hear how you’re handling that now",

Now with a proper backend it's commits, PRs, pipelines to deploy, wait, check, test, repeat. Kind of a pain.\n\nI did a full review on my ported workflows and Claude has been pretty savage. Very poor resiliency. Lacking error Handling. Mainly because I avoided doing those things in n8n.

In YouTube, Guru's show off things like complex workflows, and there had no meaning of real use cases. I tell you, master the basics of n8n. How does node work? how does node pass the data to another node? and these are seems technical but it's not. It's easier than zapier in my perspective. Right. It will take couple of weeks to master the basics, and you have to work on your automation. Start with a simple one, and you will get the hang of it.

Pull them apart, break them, rebuild them. You'll pick up the node logic way faster than sitting through any course because your brain already knows what the workflow is supposed to do, you're just learning new syntax.\n\nIf you want something more grounded, we put out content on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@frameworkfriday) that's focused on actual implementations with real workflows we've built and run in production, not theory.

Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini all structure their response containers differently, and they change without warning. Building the remote config system was the most forward-thinking decision I made — but it's still a maintenance treadmill.\n\nPort-based messaging turned out way more reliable than `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` for persistent connections. The service worker termination problem in MV3 is real and the Alarms API workaround feels like a hack, but it works.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/pattalkslaw-del/ai-ensemble-extension) — MIT license\n* [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-ensemble/lomphkghalmannpiophgdfjfdchfidim)\n\nBut now whenever I need something, I hit claude code or AI studio and make the software that does that one thing.

Start by understanding the fundamentals of APIs and a little JavaScript: Objects, JSON and functions. Remember that N8N is a visual composer for code — you're still working with logic, just in a visual way rather than code-based. You don't have to learn how to code, but understanding these fundamentals will help you grasp everything much faster.",

It's now been 4 months, and the workflow has just been sitting unused in my n8n workspace 😅\n\nInstead of letting it gather digital dust, I thought sharing it could benefit other learners or anyone searching for a free AI receptionist template.\n\nThis is a complete AI voice agent for a dental clinic developed using n8n + Retell AI + Google Workspace.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prfp7jt8bhjg1.png?width=1103&format=png&auto=webp&s=3200953b71c977f901ec77aee797eeddd7d18127\n\n**What it does (high level):**\n\nThe agent manages appointment booking, verification, rescheduling, and cancellation entirely via voice, essentially operating as a receptionist.\n\n**🧠 Stack I Used**\n\n\\* n8n → workflow orchestration & logic\n\n\\* Retell AI → voice agent + conversation engine\n\n\\* Cal  → real-time slot checking (integrated with Retell)\n\n\\* Google Calendar → arranging appointments\n\n\\* Google Sheets → lightweight database solution\n\n\\* Webhooks → link between voice agent and backend\n\n**Workflow Breakdown**\n\n**1️⃣ Booking + Verification Code**\n\n\\* Retell sends booking info to an n8n webhook (\\`/make\\_booking\\`)\n\n\\* Date/time is converted to ISO format\n\n\\* A 1-hour Google Calendar event is made\n\n\\* A unique appointment code is generated (simple sequential OTP)\n\n\\* Appointment is logged in Google Sheets (Name, Contact, Date, Time, Code)\n\n\\* Agent recites the OTP back to the caller\n\n👉 In short: voice → webhook → calendar + database → OTP reply.\n\n**2️⃣ Code Verification**\n\nEndpoint: \\`/checkCode\\`\n\n\\* Retrieve all entries from Google Sheets\n\n\\* Check appointment code + name\n\n\\* Send boolean outcome to the voice agent\n\nUsed before enabling sensitive tasks such as rescheduling or cancellation.\n\n**3️⃣ Rescheduling**\n\nEndpoint: \\`/rescheduling\\`\n\n\\* New date/time gathered from the voice chat\n\n\\* Fresh calendar event is generated\n\n\\* New verification code is created\n\n\\* Google Sheets is updated using contact number as unique key\n\n\\* New OTP is given to the user\n\n**4️⃣ Cancellation**\n\nEndpoint: \\`/cancellation\\`\n\n\\* Find calendar event by date/time\n\n\\* Remove event from Google Calendar\n\n\\* Clear the appointment details in Sheets (row kept)\n\nSilent execution, but the agent verbally confirms the cancellation.\n\n🔑 Technical Choices\n\n\\* All times are kept consistent.\n\n\\* 1-hour appointment slots are fixed\n\n\\* Google Sheets acts as an instant database (no backend server required)\n\n\\* OAuth2 is used for all integrations\n\n\\* OTPs are sequential (simple, yet works for MVP)\n\n    // If you want a more complex appointment code then you can use this code. It will generate a 6 digit OTP\n    \n    const items = $input.all(); \n    function generateRandomCode() {\n      const code = Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000);\n      return code.toString();\n    }\n    const generatedCode = generateRandomCode();\n    return items.map((item, index) => ({\n      json: {\n        ...item.json, \n        newAppointmentCode: generatedCode\n      }\n    })); \n\n[Github link](https://github.com/kunal-n8n/kunal-n8n-portfolio/blob/main/workflows/ai%20receptionist%20(1).json)\n\nHappy automating 🚀",
