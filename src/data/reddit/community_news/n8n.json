That data loop is gold for deciding where to double down on acquisition spend.\n\nRe: the $6k quote - honestly not even that overpriced for an agency that does not have internal n8n expertise. The ongoing maintenance, debugging, and iteration is where the real time sink is. You just shifted that cost to yourself, which only makes sense if you have the bandwidth and interest to maintain it.\n\nAppreciate you sharing the gist.

Clients forget what they asked for, workflows break months later, you need to remember why you built it that way.

      "text": "I've been selling n8n-based automation services for a while now. Cold emails, Upwork projects, the whole pipeline.\n\nThe #1 lesson that changed everything: **never use the word \"automation\" in your pitch.**\n\nHere's why - I was sending 200 cold emails a week. Response rate? About 1.5%. Most replies were \"not interested\" or \"we're good.\"\n\nThen I reframed everything around **time saved** instead of technology.\n\nBefore:\n\"I'll automate your lead generation with n8n workflows\"\n\nAfter:\n\"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2 hours.\"\n\nSame exact service. Completely different response.\n\nWhat actually worked for me:\n\n1. **Lead scraping + enrichment pipeline** - Google Maps → email enrichment → cold email sequence. What used to take 5 hours manually now runs in 30 min.\n\n2. **Competitor comment mining** - Scraping LinkedIn post comments from competitors → building warm lead lists. These people already care about your space.\n\n3. **Proposal generation** - Template-based proposals that auto-fill client data. 2 hours → 15 minutes.\n\nThe ROI pitch that works: \"For every $1 you spend, you get back $X in saved labor costs per month.\"\n\nBusiness owners don't care about n8n, webhooks, or API integrations. They care about:\n- How many hours they get back\n- How much money they save\n- How fast they see results\n\nTarget businesses doing $3M-10M/year revenue. They have real pain points and actual budget. Stop pitching solopreneurs who do everything themselves.\n\nHappy to share specific workflow details if anyone's interested.",

The ones that remove bottlenecks, kill manual work, and make workflows predictable.  \n  \nHere's what's consistently delivering results for our clients:  \n  \n1/ Document Extraction & Parsing  \nAI reads PDFs, contracts, invoices. Extracts structured data. Pushes it into your CRM, ERP, or database. No human retyping.  \n  \n2/ Data Cleaning & Organization  \nDuplicate detection. Categorization. Format standardization. If your team spends hours \"cleaning things up\" — this is a massive unlock.  \n  \n3/ Workflow Automation + AI Reasoning  \nTraditional automation handles rigid rules. AI handles the gray area. Combine LLM decision-making with trigger-based workflows in n8n, Make, or Zapier. Operations start running themselves.  \n  \n4/ Knowledge Agents  \nYour company sits on years of SOPs, manuals, and docs nobody reads. AI agents search, summarize, and answer questions across all of it. Instantly.  \n  \n5/ Customer Support  \nAI support agents now handle 30-80% of inquiries. Same inputs every time: FAQs, policies, product data, past tickets. Humans only touch edge cases.  \n  \n6/ Data Enrichment & Research  \nPull missing fields. Categorize leads. Enrich CRM records with Clay or custom agents. Removes hours of manual research from sales and ops teams.  \n  \n7/ Reporting & Insight Generation  \nInstead of scrolling dashboards, AI reads your data, spots patterns, and generates weekly executive summaries. Like adding an analyst to the team.  \n  \n8/ Document Generation  \nReports. Product briefs. Training materials. AI fills the structure using your real data. Same quality. Fraction of the time.  \n  \n9/ Sales Team Agents  \nMeeting prep, CRM auto-updates, proposal generation. Three agents that save 5+ hours per rep per week. Cut proposal time by 80%. They pay for themselves in week one.  \n  \nThe pattern is simple.  \n  \nFind the repetitive data work your team does every week.  \nReplace it with AI + workflows.",

Built probably 500+ workflows at this point from super-complex to minute.  \n  \nA few things I wish someone had told me earlier:  \n  \nError handling is everything. My early workflows looked clean until something failed at 2am and I had no idea why. Now I build in fallbacks for basically every HTTP node.  \n  \nBreaking big workflows into smaller reusable pieces made my life way easier.  For example I had a project to make comments for a Google Business Profile comment reply automation that got super intricate early on. I broke it into 3 different flows, and used Supabase to be the workbench where everything came together, which leads me to my next comment....\n\nDATABASES ARE EVERYTHING - It's imperative for anyone who wants to get good at n8n to learn how to create and manipulate databases, even if that means using Claude with an MCP to build and manage the tables quickly and efficiently. \n\nSelf-hosting was worth the hassle. Cloud is fine for simple stuff but once you're running things constantly, having full control is a game changer.\n\nHave fun - build something at the weekend that makes it fun.  This weekend is Moltbot+n8n time.  Giggety. ",

Those are the lessons everyone learns after a few painful 2am failures 😅\n\nBig +1 on:\nFallbacks for every HTTP node, retries + status-based branching saves more workflows than any advanced AI logic.\nSplitting large systems into orchestrator + worker flows. Debugging and scaling becomes way more predictable.\nDatabases being non-optional once you care about state, idempotency, or audit logs. n8n really levels up once you add Postgres/Supabase.\n\nAlso fully agree on self-hosting. Cloud is fine for light use, but once workflows are always-on, webhook-heavy, or cost-sensitive, full control makes a huge difference (timeouts, memory, custom nodes, cron reliability).\nWe see this a lot with teams running self-hosted n8n (since we moved to OpenHosst with their optimized architecture for n8n we haven't faced such issues), the shift usually isn’t about “more features,” it’s about stability and predictability in production.\n\nMoltbot + n8n weekend builds sound like exactly the right kind of chaos 😄\n\nGreat post, this kind of real-world perspective helps the whole community.",

You can use Claude or similar, and there is even a long section in the course dedicated to coding which helped me understand enough about JavaScript / JSON. \n\nI also felt like I'm out of my league when I started learning n8n, but I believe anyone can learn. Especially that you can problem solve and create code when needed with the help of Claude / GPT.\n\nFor motivation if you need, here are some things I built with zero coding knowledge:\n\n- A weekly customised newsletter with news from the AI and SEO industry.\n\n- An workflow for labeling all my 9000+ emails and helping me clean my inbox.\n\n- A finance tracker where I type or speak into telegram app the spendings and incomes and sends the details into a Google sheet where it further calculates differences from incomes/spendings.\n\n- An AI invoice automation that scans monthly pdf invoices from my Google drive and uploads details into notion as well as sending me an automated email with the invoices sum totals and breakdown. \n\n- A workflow that scrapes Google and creates content with self-checks steps that also formats and uploads the content in Google drive + internal linking process integrated. (This is not specifically in the course but I couldn't do it without what I learned in the course).\n\n- An AI chat agent that I integrated on my website that I fed it with my own knowledge about SEO to give personalised SEO answers directly to site visitors.\n\n+ Many more that I built but don't personally need like a CV summariser, automated customer support messaging with sentiment analysis and sentiment-aware replies. Or AI video generation and automated posting on social media. \n\nAfter you start learning you will understand why coding isn't really needed.",

Personally I don't think you will be able to learn one small service as good as selling it, without knowing to do a lot more than just that one small service. \n\nThere are always caveats in my experience. Almost every workflow I did in the course required some adjustments to make it work for my own scenario. N8n is updating and things change. Or the other tools you connect with N8N change and you need to find workarounds by yourself or by looking for info online or asking LLM. \n\nEven if you want to sell it I think every client will have something slightly different. Maybe one uses notion, the other uses Asana instead. And notion and Asana they might have different ways to connect with n8n. And you will need to know both. \n\nI think you just need to start first and then decide what questions to ask.   \n\nAnd I think having expectations and doubts will hurt the learning process. \n\nIn short, the course is not what you want. But then again I don't think you understand what you want. Because it seems you have ideas about automation that are not true. Automations are like open ended tools. \n\nYou use ai agents with detailed prompts, and you refine and improve the prompts. And then there are updates from the tools you connect with N8N that might change how they connect or change settings and interface. That's why I believe you need to know as much as possible to be able to do any one single automation and do it well. \n\nPersonally, I'm strange and I need to learn something new constantly to make my days feel less boring and more productive. I didn't start with expectations. And I think that is a benefit as your mind is better set to learning that way.",

Returns true/false\n4. **Customizes resume per job** - GPT-4.1 rewrites keywords, skills, bullets to match each job description\n5. **Creates new Google Doc** with the customized resume, sets sharing permissions\n6. **Finds hiring manager email** via AnyMailFinder (decision-maker lookup by domain)\n7. **Drafts personalized email** in Gmail with the custom resume link\n\n**Why I built this:**\n\nMost resumes get killed by ATS keyword filtering before a human ever sees them. The only way to beat it is to tailor each application. But doing that manually takes 30+ minutes per job.\n\nNow it takes about 90 seconds of review per application.\n\n**Stack:**\n- n8n (orchestration)\n- Apify (LinkedIn scraper)\n- OpenAI GPT-4.1 / 4.1-mini\n- Google Docs/Drive API\n- AnyMailFinder\n- Gmail\n\n**What actually works:**\n- AI for filtering and rewriting = huge time saver\n- Human review before sending = keeps quality high\n- Targeting hiring managers directly = better response rate than applying through portals\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup.",

This means:\\n    - Everyday realism with authentic, relatable settings\\n    - Amateur-quality iPhone photo/video style\\n    - Slightly imperfect framing and lighting\\n    - Real-world environments left as-is (clutter, busy backgrounds)\\n    - Authentic imperfections in capture (slight blur, imperfect exposure, etc.)\\n\\n  We need these videos to look natural and real. So in the prompts, have the Camera parameter always use keywords like these:\\n  unremarkable amateur iPhone photo, reddit image, snapchat video, casual iPhone selfie,\\n  slightly uneven framing, authentic share, slightly blurry, amateur quality phone photo\\n\\n  DIALOGUE RULES:\\n  - If the dialogue is not provided, is too short (under 30 characters), or looks like a test/placeholder (e.g. 'test', 'hello', 'asdf'), you MUST generate a proper casual, conversational dialogue under 200 characters.\\n  - The dialogue should sound like a person speaking naturally to a friend about the product. Avoid overly formal or sales-like language.\\n  - Use ... to indicate pauses, and avoid special characters like em dashes or hyphens.\\n  - NEVER use a dialogue that is just one word or doesn't make sense as spoken words.\\n\\n  IMPORTANT:\\n    - Do NOT use double quotes anywhere in the image_prompt or video_prompt YAML strings.\\n    - The image_prompt MUST NOT include any human or human parts.\\n    - The video_prompt MUST include a human interacting with the product.\\n\\n  A – Ask:\\n    Generate image and video generation instructions for AI image and video generation models based on the user's request,\\n    ensuring exact YAML format for both image and video prompts. Infer aspect ratios from vertical/horizontal context; default to vertical if unspecified.\\n\\n    Scene count rule:\\n      - Read the user's requested number of videos (an explicit integer) and output exactly that many scenes.\\n      - If the user does not specify a number, default to 1 scene.\\n      - Never output more or fewer scenes than requested.\\n\\n  G – Guidance (Critical Rules):\\n\\n    1) IMAGE PROMPT = PRODUCT-ONLY (NO HUMANS)\\n       - The image_prompt MUST depict ONLY the product and environment.\\n       - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in image_prompt:\\n         - any person/human/character/model/influencer\\n         - any face, head, body, skin, hair, silhouette\\n         - any hands, fingers, arms, legs, feet\\n         - any reflections showing a person\\n         - any \\\"someone holding\\\", \\\"in their hand\\\", \\\"worn by\\\", \\\"on a person\\\"\\n       - If interaction is needed, use non-human supports only:\\n         - table, shelf, countertop, car seat, desk, nightstand, floor, hook, stand, tripod, clamp, box, bag\\n       - The image_prompt should still be casual and real, like an iPhone product pic, but with no people.\\n\\n    2) VIDEO PROMPT = HUMAN PRESENT + INTERACTING\\n       - The video_prompt MUST include a human (UGC creator) who is holding, using, wearing, or demonstrating the product.\\n       - It should feel like a casual phone-recorded clip.\\n       - Human diversity guidance applies ONLY to the video_prompt (not the image_prompt).\\n       - Default age range 21 to 38 unless user specifies otherwise.\\n\\n    3) CONSISTENCY\\n       - The product must match the reference image accurately, including brand marks and any text.\\n       - Never invent extra features or accessories not present in the reference image unless the user explicitly asks.\\n\\n    4) CAMERA STYLE\\n       - Always keep camera phrasing aligned with casual phone capture.\\n       - Avoid studio language: no softbox, no 3-point lighting, no seamless backdrop.\\n\\n    5) DIVERSITY RULE (VIDEO ONLY)\\n       - Ensure diversity in gender, ethnicity, and hair color when generating multiple scenes and when applicable.\\n       - Do NOT apply this diversity rule to the image_prompt, because the image_prompt contains no humans.\\n\\n  E – Examples:\\n    good_examples:\\n      - |\\n        {\\n          \\\"scenes\\\": [\\n
