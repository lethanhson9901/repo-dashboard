Setup takes maybe an hour if you're familiar with n8n/Zapier.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/labeldekho/second-brain](https://github.com/labeldekho/second-brain)\n\nCredit to Nick B Jones for the original concept.

Tasks are captured via Siri, stored plainly, and a read-only workflow returns exactly one recommended next task based on priority and time of day. No auto-reprioritization, no background task mutation — just decision support to reduce cognitive load.\n\nArchitecture overview (technical):\nI’m using Vikunja as a self-hosted task store, n8n as the automation layer, and Apple Shortcuts/Siri as the capture + UI surface. New tasks are captured via Siri → Apple Shortcut → HTTPS n8n webhook, where they’re optionally classified (rules-first, AI optional) into priority buckets (P0–P3 + a TAX project) and created in Vikunja via its REST API. \n\nSeparately, I run a read-only n8n webhook (what-should-i-do-next) that queries Vikunja for active tasks, filters deterministically by project priority, status, start date, and time-of-day/business-hours constraints, and returns exactly one recommended task plus a short reason and an optional “prep step” if the task can’t be fully executed right now. A macOS Shortcuts widget calls that endpoint so I can click once on my desktop and get a single next action without opening the task manager. No background task mutation, no auto-reprioritization — just constrained decision support to reduce cognitive load.",

A few suggestions to make it even more robust: Consider adding error handling and logging for cases where Gemini misclassifies entries—perhaps a manual review queue in Notion for uncertain categorizations. You might also want to implement rate limiting to avoid hitting API quotas, especially if this scales to multiple users. For reliability, adding retry logic with exponential backoff would help handle temporary API failures gracefully.\n\nOn the scalability front, think about how this would work with high-volume inputs or across teams. You could explore batching requests to reduce API calls, or implementing a caching layer to avoid re-processing similar thoughts. Additionally, consider documenting the exact prompts you're using with Gemini—this would help others fine-tune the classification accuracy and understand any edge cases you've discovered.\n\nOne alternative worth exploring: instead of relying solely on Gemini for classification, you could implement a hybrid approach where users add a quick emoji reaction in Slack to suggest a category, which Gemini then validates. This adds a human-in-the-loop element that could improve accuracy without much extra friction. Finally, consider adding analytics—tracking which categories get the most entries and which get misclassified would help you continuously improve the system.",

If it needs something more I can host on the same VPS beside n8n in a docker compose stack without additional $$$ if the workers and pages route isnt the right fit. \n\nI have postgres for db on the same vps if required and typically this has been perfect for back office workflows as well as customer facing where I'm happy the volumes are relatively low. \n\nIf I need anything bigger than n8n ai nodes I'll switch those out for mastra.ai as I'm a js/ts guy. It handles workflows, multi-agent really well.\n\n\nOther notable parts to setup:\n\n- VPS with 0 access aside from my ssh cert and via Cloudflare tunnel between Cloudflare and the vps itself. \n\n- Cloudflare for waf, static pages, asset storage, workers etc\n\n- docker compose with docker for caddy/trafic, n8n, postgres and any server side apps like nuxt\n\n- Auth typically via clerk or workos I've used better auth a few times also but clerk was so simple to do I go there first.\n\n- Gitlab preferred as I'm dubious to GitHub pricing changes for private / client orgs and repos\n\n- Any vibe coding is through opencode and ohmyopencode Plugin. Preferred opus 4.5 for most work but I'll switch to codex or Gemini for the quicker front end work\n\n- Resend or brevo for mail. If it's just transactional I'll do resend but if the client wants to be involved I'll use Brevo as they often want to do marketing and use Brevo to sync from their other systems via n8n\n\n- Vite I'll use for even standard HTML apps as I can hot reload local, include tailwind if I want and bundle into a single output. This is ideal for Cloudflare pages too",

That’s just not what I’m seeing.\n\nI’ve worked with 14 clients using n8n, and only ONE of them actually asked for an AI agent. And even then, it was more curiosity than a real business need.\n\nNobody is excited to:\n\nBook meetings through a Telegram bot\n\nReplace simple forms with “AI conversations”\n\nAdd complexity where a Calendly link or form already works perfectly\n\nThere are way easier, cheaper, and more convenient solutions for 90% of the use cases being hyped on Twitter/YouTube.\n\nn8n is first and foremost an automation tool, not an “AI agent factory”.\n\nIts real power is:\n\nConnecting broken systems\n\nAutomating workflows that don’t already have a clean solution\n\nEliminating boring manual processes\n\nHandling edge cases that SaaS tools don’t cover\n\nSlapping “AI” on top of everything is, in my opinion, a bad approach. Businesses don’t buy AI. They buy solutions to annoying problems.\n\nIf a problem is already solved well with:\n\nForms\n\nCRMs\n\nWebhooks\n\nSimple automations\n\nThen forcing an AI agent into it just makes it worse.\n\nI’m far from an n8n expert, so maybe I’m wrong — but from real client work, the demand is clearly for solid automation, not fancy AI buzzwords.\n\nFocus on problems that don’t have an easy solution.\n\nThat’s where n8n actually shines.\n\nCurious if others here are seeing the same thing or if my experience is just an outlier.",

You’re right, forcing AI where it doesn't belong is just bad engineering.\n\nHowever, I look at n8n as the **'Visual Backend'** for the next decade. Whether you're building a simple CRM sync or a complex agent, n8n is essentially the nervous system that connects everything. The reason it’s the 'bomb' is that it handles the plumbing that makes *any* logic, AI or not, actually work.\n\nI think we are currently in the **'Messy Middle'** of a massive transition:\n\n* **Past:** Simple, linear automation (If this, then that).\n* **Present:** Solving 'annoying problems' with broken systems (The solid work you’re doing now).\n* **Future:** Autonomous tasks where a virtual assistant performs digital work on your behalf.\n\nWe’re in the 'electricity' phase. When it first came out, people were skeptical and 'knocker-ups' still had jobs waking people up. Some chose to stay in the dark, but the tech evolved regardless.\n\nThe 'AI Agents' of the future won't be annoying WhatsApp bots; they will be **Local/Sovereign AI**. We're moving toward tailor-made, open-source assistants running locally that have access to knowledge a business simply couldn't offer otherwise.\n\nn8n is the best tool to bridge that gap. We can stand out by not just 'slapping AI on things,' but by using n8n to segregate all these scattered platforms into one unified, intelligent system. You're right that businesses buy solutions, but soon, the best solutions will be the ones that can think and act across all their tools simultaneously.",

          "text": "This is a refreshingly grounded perspective that challenges hype, and your core insight is valuable—n8n's strength lies in solving real automation problems rather than forcing AI into every use case. Your experience with 14 clients provides solid anecdotal evidence. To strengthen this further, consider: (1) Sharing specific examples of the automation wins you *did* see—this would make your argument more concrete and actionable for readers trying to decide what to build; (2) Acknowledging that AI agents *do* have legitimate use cases (customer support at scale, complex multi-step workflows, personalized interactions) even if they're rarer than the hype suggests—this makes your critique more balanced and credible.\n\nOn the workflow/automation angle: you're right that many hyped solutions overcomplicate things, but consider exploring where n8n + AI *could* add real value without the buzzword trap—like using LLMs for intelligent data extraction, dynamic routing based on content analysis, or handling edge cases in existing workflows. This positions n8n as a *pragmatic* tool that uses AI when it genuinely solves a problem, rather than rejecting it outright.\n\nFinally, your call for \"focus on problems that don't have an easy solution\" is excellent advice. You might amplify this by encouraging readers to audit their current workflows first—identify the manual, repetitive, or error-prone steps—before deciding what tool to use. This problem-first approach is exactly how n8n delivers ROI. Your skepticism is healthy; just pair it with concrete examples of what *does* work, and you'll have an even more persuasive and helpful post.",

For discovery, I’ll track mentions in places like Reddit and pipe them into a Notion board; ScrapeBee, Zapier, and Pulse all help with monitoring and triaging signals so I’m only building flows where there’s clear pull.\n\nMain point: n8n wins as quiet infrastructure, not as a flashy chatbot factory.",

I wanted to share my first **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** setup.\n\n**The Problem:** I wanted an AI agent that doesn't \"hallucinate\" and actually knows my specific business data. **The Solution:** A flow that connects my documents to a vector database.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Data Ingestion:** I can upload files via a form or just drop them into a specific **Google Drive** folder.\n2. **Vectorization:** n8n takes the files, chunks the text, and stores them in a Vector Store (acting as the AI's long-term memory).\n3. **The Agent:** When I ask a question, the agent searches this database first to provide an accurate, fact-based response.\n\n**Why this matters for business:** Imagine automated customer support that actually reads your latest PDFs or an internal tool that knows every contract detail without a human having to search for it. It's a game changer for productivity.\n\nI've attached a short video of the workflow in action.\n\n**I'm curious:** Are you guys using n8n for RAG? What vector databases are you finding the most stable for production?\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone is interested!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbe3po/video/pte0t8h1u0dg1/player\n\n",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI run a small automation company and I’m looking for someone comfortable with n8n and AI automations to join the team as a freelancer/contractor.\n\nIt’s totally fine if you’re newer to this. Curiosity, ability to pick things up quickly, and actually wanting to learn matter more than years of experience. This is a good fit if you want to build real automation skills, understand how projects are scoped and delivered in the real world, get some client exposure, and potentially take on more responsibility over time.\n\nMost of the time I’ll handle the high-level architecture and client direction, and you’ll help build and implement workflows in n8n. That said, I’m not looking for someone who needs constant hand-holding or just executes tasks blindly. The goal is to reduce workload on my side, not add more. I’m happy to guide, review, and unblock you, but I need someone who can think independently, make reasonable decisions, and flag issues or improvements without being prompted. If you have ideas or see a better way to do something, I want to hear it.\n\nYou’ll be working on real client projects using tools like Zoho, ClickUp, Slack, Typeform, GHL, Instantly, Stripe, etc. Down the line you may also join client calls when it makes sense.\n\nYou should be comfortable with n8n, APIs, JavaScript for data transformations, Postgres/SQL, LLMs. The ability to quickly learn new tools is essential. Good English and availability during UK hours are required.\n\nBeyond the technical side, understanding how companies operate is just as important. You’re not just wiring nodes together, you’re solving real business problems. If you care about building workflows that are reliable, maintainable, and don’t break after two runs, we’ll likely work well together.\n\nPlease submit your application through this form: [ https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4 ](https://app.youform.com/forms/nekpmmq4)\n\nCompany website: [ https://innovaquest.ai ](https://innovaquest.ai)\n\nCompany name: InnovaQuest",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI really want to start learning n8n, but honestly I’m feeling super overwhelmed and don’t know where to begin.\n\nThere are so many courses out there — some of them are like 8+ hours long — and at the same time, the official n8n course on their website looks really short, which makes me confused about what’s actually enough to get started.\n\nOn top of that, when I see workflows with APIs, JSON, and all the data mapping, it just feels like a lot at once. I really want to start badly, but I don’t know what the right entry point is or what I should focus on first without burning out.\n\nFor those of you who learned n8n:\n\n\t•\tWhere did you start?\n\n\t•\tDid you already know APIs/JSON, or did you learn them along the way?\n\n\t•\tAny beginner-friendly resources or a simple roadmap you’d recommend?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

The fastest way to learn is just building workflows for real tasks, even if they're simple at first.\n\nOnce you've got the basics down, level up by learning how data flows between nodes, understanding when to use code nodes versus built-in functions, and practicing error handling. The mistake most beginners make is jumping into complex API integrations and JSON manipulation when we really just need to understand how to connect services and pass data between them first.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into agentic workflows, learning how to chain AI calls together using n8n is where things get really powerful.

There you will learn about the business model and learn about the real problems that needs to be solved not the flashy trend workflows.

Way better - I'm building a small SaaS and not even close to hitting limits.\n\nHere's what's weird though - a lot of the automation ideas I used to build in n8n, I'm now just describing them to Claude Code and it's... building actual apps? With UIs and everything? And they run faster than my workflows used to.\n\nI'm not trying to say \"ditch n8n\" or promote anything - genuinely want to know if others have noticed this too. Like, are these tools just for different things? Should I be thinking about them differently?\n\nWhat's your take?",

Run \\`pip install agentauth-py\\`\n2. Run \\`agent-auth grab github.com\\` (this syncs your active cookies to an encrypted local vault).\n3. Use the AgentAuth node in n8n to inject those cookies into your requests.\n\nWhy I built it:\n\nI wanted a \"set it and forget it\" way to keep my local workflows logged in. As long as you are logged in on Chrome, your n8n workflow is logged in too.\n\nLinks:\n\n\\- Node (npm): [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-agentauth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-agentauth)\n\n\\- Source Code: [https://github.com/jacobgadek/n8n-nodes-agentauth](https://github.com/jacobgadek/n8n-nodes-agentauth)\n\nIt's fully open source. I'd love to hear if this helps anyone else struggling with session persistence!\n\n**Update (Jan 12): Remote / Headless Support Added (v0.2.2)** Based on the feedback in the comments, I realized many of you run n8n on a VPS or Docker where Chrome isn't installed.\n\nI just shipped a new feature to handle this:\n\n* You can now run `agent-auth export` on your local machine (where you are logged in).\n* Transfer the vault file to your server.\n* Run `agent-auth import` on the server.\n\nThis allows you to sync your authenticated session to headless environments easily.

      "text": "Let’s be honest for a second: **Generative AI for end-to-end scheduling is a recipe for disaster in a professional environment.**\n\nI run an automation course with over **1,900 students**. For months, I’ve been delaying the release of our \"AI Scheduling Module.\" Why? Because I refuse to teach my students a solution that I know will fail them (and their clients) at least 5% of the time.\n\nI’ve tried everything in **n8n**:\n\n* Advanced Prompt Engineering\n* Direct Tool Calling with Google Calendar/Cal.com\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n* Multi-step verification loops\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good the model is. AI is probabilistic. It \"hallucinates\" time zones, it misses double-booking logic, or it simply fails to confirm a slot correctly.\n\n**The \"Human Error\" Fallacy:** People often say, *\"Well, humans make mistakes too.\"* Sure, but the market is significantly less tolerant of a machine's failure. If an AI messes up a CEO's calendar or double-books a high-ticket consultation, it doesn't look like a \"mistake\"it looks like a broken, amateur system. For professional services, 99% isn't enough. It has to be 100%.\n\n**The only solution that actually works 100% of the time:** After months of testing, I’ve concluded that the only \"pro\" way to do this is a hybrid model:\n\n1. **AI for Pre-qualification:** Let the AI handle the lead gen, answer questions, and build rapport.\n2. **Deterministic UI for Booking:** Once the lead is ready, the AI drops a link (Cal.com, tidycal, etc.) for the user to pick a slot.\n\nIt might not look as \"magical\" as a full chat-to-calendar booking, but it’s the only way to ensure the data is right every single time.\n\n**I want to hear from you:** Am I being too cynical, or are you guys also struggling with the reliability gap in conversational scheduling? Has anyone *actually* deployed a 100% fail-proof conversational booking system in production, or are we all just chasing a ghost?",

For the actual 'writing to the database' part, `if/else` and deterministic logic are king.\n\nThe reason people try to force AI into this is the **unstructured conversational layer** that comes before the booking. A simple script can't easily handle a lead saying:\n\n*'I’m travelling next week, but I might be free Thursday afternoon if my flight isn't delayed. Also, does your service cover VAT for European companies?'*\n\nAI is great for:\n\n1. **Contextual Qualification:** Understanding if the lead is even worth a meeting.\n2. **Handling Objections:** Answering those 'by the way' questions before the booking.\n3. **Intent Extraction:** Identifying that the user *wants* to book even when they don't use a specific keyword.\n\nMy argument is that we should use AI for that messy human interaction, but the second it’s time to actually pick a slot, we should hand it over to a deterministic system (the 'if/else' world). Trying to make the AI perform the logic of 'find slot -> check timezone -> verify conflict -> write' is where the 5% failure rate kills the UX.",

Imagine telling a client: *'Hey, our AI is great! It only messes up your schedule once every 20 or 100 appointments.'* That’s not an 'operational enhancement'; that’s a reputation killer.\n\nRegarding **HITL (Human-In-The-Loop)**: If I have to hire a human to babysit the AI and verify every single checkpoint, I haven't scaled the business I've just added a layer of expensive complexity. The goal of automation is to remove the bottleneck, not to create a new one where a human has to constantly click 'Approve'.\n\nThe 'AI Pre-qualification + Deterministic Link' combo gives you:\n\n1. **0% hallucination risk** on the final booking.\n2. **100% scalability** without human intervention.\n3. **Professional UX** where the user feels in control.\n\nIn the professional world, reliability isn't a 'value proposition'—it's a requirement.

Which has been the industry standard for years. The AI chatbot is doing what a 4-field intake form does, just with more latency and maintenance overhead.\n\nThe only scenario where conversational booking genuinely adds value is voice/phone, where you can't drop a link. For chat-based flows, the \"magic\" you're chasing is solving a problem users don't actually have - they prefer picking slots visually.\nSometimes the boring automation is the right one.",

That’s not the problem we are trying to solve here.\n\nThe challenge isn't the **calendar logic**; it's the **customer journey**.\n\nA simple automation script can't handle a prospect on WhatsApp who says: *'I want to book, but I need to know if you offer a discount for groups first.'* If you just send a link or a static form, your conversion drops because you’re forcing the user to do all the work. The AI is there to handle the 'messy' human part—answering questions, qualifying the lead, and building trust while the automation (your 'simple calendar') ensures the data remains 100% accurate.\n\nWe need to stop confusing **database integrity** with **customer engagement**. One is a solved problem; the other is where the money is made.",

Images and text are handled as separate objects internally, which is why media libraries lose the associated product code. Most Chrome extensions work by DOM scraping and are unstable or unsafe.\n\nThe only production-safe way I’ve seen this solved is by using WhatsApp Business API (directly or via Twilio). In that setup, each message arrives as a single payload: image + caption + metadata. From there you can route everything through n8n to:\n\t•\tdownload the image\n\t•\textract or validate the product code\n\t•\tgenerate PDFs or structured records\n\t•\tforward the result to an API or database\n\nThere is a technical breakdown of this exact document-extraction pattern (files, images, OCR, AI structuring, conditional routing). WhatsApp just becomes one of the ingestion channels:\n\nhttps://aistartmeup.com/n8n-extract-text/",

I've started tinkering with n8n in the last few weeks and can feel the potential, but I'm deliberately staying away from the usual \"AI YouTube empire / SaaS moonshot\" content that floods YouTube.\n\nMy only goal right now is modest but concrete:\n\nBuild simple, reliable automations that solve boring, repetitive problems for real people/small businesses → eventually charge enough to cover my personal basics.\n\nCurrent reality check:\n\nbeginner with n8n + AI nodes\n\nNo budget for paid tools/ads/team\n\nComfortable with Google Sheets, Excel, basic CRMs, data cleanup, maybe simple REST APIs once I learn them\n\nI want practical, low-risk use cases — not lottery-ticket ideas\n\nand, For a commerce/finance background person, where do you see n8n realistically fitting into future skills & opportunities? Better internal finance ops roles? Freelance reporting/ops automation? Micro-consulting for small CA offices / traders / e-commerce sellers? Or is it mostly a nice-to-have side-tool?\n\nIf more context about my current skill level or interests would help you give better pointers, just ask — happy to answer.\n\nThanks in advance for any no-BS, grounded input. Not chasing get-rich-quick, just trying to turn spare hours into something that pays for coffee without wasting months on dead-end hype.\n\nAppreciate you.",

I hope this resources would help you to give a head start.\n\n\\- n8n Workflow, nodes and data-flow: [https://theowllogic.com/n8n-workflow-nodes-data-flow](https://theowllogic.com/n8n-workflow-nodes-data-flow)  \n\\- Webhooks in n8n for beginners: [https://theowllogic.com/webhook-in-n8n-explained](https://theowllogic.com/webhook-in-n8n-explained)  \n\\- How to handle API rate limit: [https://theowllogic.com/how-to-handle-api-rate-limits-in-n8n](https://theowllogic.com/how-to-handle-api-rate-limits-in-n8n)  \n\\- How to handle errors like a pro: [https://theowllogic.com/handle-errors-in-n8n](https://theowllogic.com/handle-errors-in-n8n)\n\nI had to say this, you can't be comfortable when you're get into tech (automation), Don't get too much comfortable with nodes, each and every nodes are different kind of pain, You've to feel that every pain, inside and out - get comfortable being uncomfortable.  (This is my personal experience)\n\nOnce you understood these most mid-tier concepts, then you can try out some internal financial operation (FinOps) concepts to see how does this work? Approach someone for free at first (since you're a commerce student, get a help from a professor, or maybe your colleague), and get their feedback, and go with constant feedback loop. then you can understand the market demand.\n\nOnce you analyzed the demand, pivot the strategy. Once you have enough knowledge to maintain a workflow and market yourself. you can easily make some bucks.\n\nJust try to showcase your work, ah you can try here as well, but most of the demos are not worth it in my opinion. so go with youtube, tiktok, and write a medium or blog about the journey, and what problem you're going to solve.\n\nGood luck, if you have any clarifications or hiccups, feel free to share.",

Ask them “what would it mean for your business if you could solve this?” “Would it be worth solving for $1000? “. Offer to build them an automation for it. Then go find every other business in your city, province/state that’s the same and cold call them. “I’ve talked to a lot of dry cleaners and may of them struggle with X, does that sound familiar to you? “By building this automation we were able to help ABc dry cleaner solve X which meant Y to them.” Would that be something you’d be interested in?\n\nFind a problem solve it, sell it to as many people as possible who have the same problem. Then find another problem and do the same.\n\nBe prepared to charge a monthly retainer for support, as it’s not uncommon for these automations to break and a dry cleaner won’t have the foggiest idea what to do.",
