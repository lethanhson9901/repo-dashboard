But I've been using Caddy for my reverse proxy. \n\nI would just warn people though, that Oracle has usage minimums and you're not allowed to use it for commercial purposes. If you do not hit those usage minimums, they will just delete your instance and send you an email with no chance to backup or anything. I would highly recommend setting up a SSH backup script to grab your SQLite file of your entire n8n instance and encryption key so that you can restore your n8n instance into another docker instance if that happens to you.",

An AI agent will perform much better that way. To be honest, on its own, it really struggles with n8n workflows.\nHowever, the trade-off is that you have to build everything else yourself—your deployment, your infrastructure, and so on. Plus, you have to manage your connectors and credentials for all the different APIs you're using.\nAnd that’s where n8n is actually quite strong; a huge part of the heavy lifting is already done. It handles credentials for OpenAI and Claude, and makes it easy to interact with external services like Gmail, Notion, etc.\nAs for my component, it’s there to bridge the gap between these two worlds. n8n is great because managing credentials and OAuth is much easier to do manually; but when it comes to building complex workflow structures or making bulk edits, you want to do that via code. It’s ten times faster.\nWhile standalone agents do struggle with JSON workflows, my component provides them with all the necessary tools to be highly efficient—just as efficient as if they were manipulating Python code directly.",

I like the product and what the team is building, but the business model genuinely confused me.\n\nThe Community Edition (source-available / fair-code license) allows unlimited executions when self-hosted. The paid on-prem license, however, introduces execution and workload limits — even though customers already pay for hardware, electricity, networking, and operations. Paying more but getting less doesn’t make sense.\n\nLicense restrictions are fine — limited workloads are not. A paid version should never reduce core capabilities compared to the free version. Paid should always equal Free + More.\n\nA more logical model would cap the number of workflows, active plugins, or reserve advanced plugins for higher tiers — not executions in a self-hosted setup.\n\nI also found multiple Reddit threads/users who reverted to the Community Edition, not because Pro is bad, but because the licensing constraints feel arbitrary.\n\nN8N has a strong product and community. Revisiting the on-prem licensing model could significantly improve trust and adoption.\n\nExample, we've been using [Thingsboard.io](http://Thingsboard.io) more than 10 years now for our IoT Deployments. the tiered license makes sense, the perks you get by paying makes sense.\n\nAnyone here facing the same with N8N?",

So you still have to get customers somehow, but the fulfillment is way faster and robuster with this method, which enables you to handle a lot more clients. And if something brakes you can fix it with a single prompt and keep going.\n\nBasically you focus on getting clients as usual, but there is one addition: clients love speed, so you can promise crazy delivery times like 1-2 days, which gets you the deal or lets you charge higher prices.\n\nSo can promise great guarantees, also you can work for free on the first project with a new client and crush it. Wouldn’t really cost you a lot of time and makes your client happy, so he wants more.\n\nThe other option would be charging to teach people on how to create agentic workflows and replace the headache of working with freelancers.",

This workflow takes a simple list of company names and builds full leadership profiles automatically.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Reads company names from Google Sheets (batch processing up to 20 companies)\n\n\\* Finds official LinkedIn company pages automatically\n\n\\* Pulls complete company intelligence (industry, size, location, website, specialties)\n\n\\* Extracts full employee rosters from each company\n\n\\* Filters for decision-makers (CEOs, Chiefs, Chairmen, Owners)\n\n\\* Compiles leadership profiles with job titles and LinkedIn URLs\n\n\\* Outputs structured org chart data ready for sales/recruiting workflows\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 2-3 hours of manual LinkedIn stalking per company now runs automatically in under 5 minutes for multiple companies simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInput: List of 10 target companies in Google Sheet (just company names)\n\nResults: Complete organizational profiles including:\n\n\\- Company details: name, description, industry, size (employee count), location, website, specialties\n\n\\- Decision-maker profiles: Full names, titles, LinkedIn URLs\n\n\\- Processing time: \\~5 minutes for 10 companies\n\n\\- Data extracted: 10+ key employee profiles per company, filtered for C-suite and ownership\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How it works:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Discovery Phase\\*\\* – Converts company names to verified LinkedIn URLs\n\n2. \\*\\*Intelligence Phase\\*\\* – Extracts comprehensive company data\n\n3. \\*\\*People Phase\\*\\* – Pulls employee lists and filters for leadership\n\n4. \\*\\*Output Phase\\*\\* – Structures everything into clean, usable format\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams building account maps before outreach\n\n\\* Recruiters mapping target organizations for talent pipelines\n\n\\* Competitive intelligence gathering across market segments\n\n\\* Market research teams analyzing leadership trends\n\n\\* Partnership teams identifying decision-makers at scale\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – processes up to 20 companies in batches of 5, pulling 10+ employee profiles per company. Just add rows to your Google Sheet and it runs automatically.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2187.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2187.json)",

      "text": "I wanted to share something interesting I’ve been noticing while working on a small automation project.\n\nI built an n8n automation to handle Google reviews end to end. Initially, this was just an experiment to see if the workflow even made sense in the real world.\n\nBut what surprised me was how receptive Indian businesses have been to this idea.\n\nA lot of local businesses here genuinely want a structured way to manage reviews. Not to fake anything, but to avoid chaos. Missed reviews, unmanaged negative feedback, and no time to reply consistently are very common problems.\n\nHere’s what the system does in simple terms:\n\nCustomers are asked for feedback through a link.\n\nIf the rating is 3 stars or below, the feedback is stored privately so the business can address it internally.\n\nIf the rating is 4 or 5 stars, the customer is guided to leave a public review on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nOn top of that:\n\nIt tracks who clicks the review link and who doesn’t\n\nKeeps everything logged in one place\n\nAutomatically replies to new Google reviews using AI\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many Indian business owners don’t want more tools, dashboards, or complexity. They want something that quietly works in the background and improves their online reputation without daily effort.\n\nI can’t speak much about how foreign businesses would react to this, but locally, there’s genuine interest and adoption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/636a4qc31aeg1.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=be305629b3c148d1529f337219b81486d676b4c9\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone else seeing similar behavior in their region?\n\nAre there any obvious downsides or ethical concerns I should think about?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives.\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants, I can also break down how the workflow is built in n8n.",

Cleaning them manually would've taken weeks. So I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire enrichment process.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls contacts from Google Sheets (name, company, existing data)\n\n\\* Finds current LinkedIn profiles for each contact\n\n\\* Scrapes full profile data (email, phone, job title, location)\n\n\\* Enriches company information (official website, company phone, company email)\n\n\\* Gathers additional intel (company size, LinkedIn company page)\n\n\\* Updates all records back to Google Sheets automatically\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What would take 30-40 hours of manual research now runs completely automated. Process 500+ contacts in 30-60 minutes while you focus on actual selling.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"John Smith\" at \"Acme Corp\" (stale record from 2021)\n\n\\- Results: Fresh LinkedIn URL, verified work email, direct phone number, current job title, company website, company contact info, employee count\n\n\\- All data automatically updated in your CRM/sheet\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The workflow runs in batches of 10 contacts\\*\\* to maintain API stability and avoid rate limits. Perfect for overnight enrichment runs.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams cleaning hundreds of outdated CRM records before campaigns\n\n\\* RevOps maintaining data quality across large contact databases\n\n\\* Marketing enriching event attendee lists with complete contact info\n\n\\* Recruiters updating candidate databases with current employment data\n\n\\* Business development building complete prospect profiles at scale\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 500+ contacts per execution without issues.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow2919.json)",

      "text": "I used to deploy n8n on my local machine the hard way: manually installing Node.js, pulling the source, wrestling with Docker containers (which ate up gigabytes of space), and tweaking configurations. It was a hassle.\n\nThat frustration led me to build **n8n Desktop** — a native, self-contained app packaged with **Tauri**. Now I can ditch Docker and have a truly click-and-run experience.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Self-contained installer**: The app **automatically downloads and sets up** the required Node.js runtime and n8n resources on first launch. No manual dependency deployment needed — it handles everything for you.\n* **Native & Lightweight**: Built with Tauri/Rust, it's tiny and uses minimal system resources.\n* **Runs offline**: Your workflows and data stay on your machine. Perfect for self-hosted enthusiasts.\n* **Auto-start on boot** (configurable): Keeps your workflows always running.\n\n**Direct Download Links (v1.0.1):**\n\n* **Windows (.exe)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe)\n* **macOS - Apple Silicon (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)\n* **macOS - Intel (.dmg)**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop\\_0.1.0\\_x64.dmg](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.1/n8n-desktop_0.1.0_x64.dmg)\n\n**Important Installation Notes:**\n\n1. **For Windows Users**: I only have a Mac for development, so **the Windows version is untested**. Please use it at your own discretion and report any issues you encounter!\n2. **For macOS Users**: Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer account, you may see a “damaged” error on first launch. To fix this:\n   * Open **Terminal**.\n   * Copy and paste the following command, then press **Enter**: bashsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/n8n-desktop.app\n   * Enter your **administrator password** (it won‘t show as you type) and press **Enter** again.\n   * You should now be able to open the app normally from your Applications folder.\n\n**Source Code & All Builds:**\n\n* **GitHub Release Page**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.1)\n* **Main Repository**: [https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop) (Stars and feedback are welcome!)\n\n**Screenshot of the app:**  \n[https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app\\_screen\\_short.png](https://github.com/tangtao646/n8n-desktop/blob/main/app_screen_short.png)\n\n**Why Tauri?** I chose Tauri over Electron for its superior performance and smaller bundle size. The core is still the fantastic n8n, but now it feels like a true desktop citizen.\n\nThis is an open-source side project I use daily. I'd love to get your feedback, bug reports, or contributions.\n\n",

This inherently increases both user reliance on your specific product, and risk to the end user.\n\nWe already have entire communities of people who barely know how to scrape together a line of JSON, flailing about wildly running n8n insecurely in all sorts of ways. By adding a desktop wrapper yes you've lowered the bar for people to run, but at the same time increased their ignorance about what it actually takes to run production-ready environments.\n\nAre you going to be there to pick up the pieces when someone idiotic enough decides to install your software on a desktop in a commercial business and it all goes tits up?\n\nYes it's their fault, but soon enough they'll point the finger at you.\n\nI'm not trying to gatekeep n8n here, but there are real world effects to adding a presentation wrapper to a complex software product like n8n. Because when shit hits the fan the user will look to you to fix it.\n\nMaking things easier does not always make them better.",

      "text": "\\*\\*I've been manually tracking companies hiring for specific roles as buying signals. Not anymore.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIf you're in B2B sales, companies posting certain job titles are gold – they're actively investing in specific areas. I built this n8n workflow to automate the entire research process from LinkedIn job posts to enriched contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Scrapes LinkedIn for companies posting specific job titles (e.g., \"Customer Success Manager\", \"DevOps Engineer\")\n\n\\* Extracts company names from job postings and deduplicates the list\n\n\\* Enriches each company with verified websites, direct phone numbers, company emails, and employee counts\n\n\\* Outputs complete sales intelligence to Google Sheets with hiring signals attached\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 3-4 hours of manual research now runs automatically. I can process 40-50 companies in 4-6 minutes with complete contact data.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: \"Sales Development Representative\" + \"San Francisco\" + last 7 days\n\n\\- Results: 47 companies enriched in \\~5 minutes. Each record includes company website, phone, email, employee count, job titles they're hiring for, and LinkedIn profile\n\n\\- The workflow marks each with a hiring signal (\"Hiring 3 positions\") so you know their investment level\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* \\*\\*SaaS sales teams\\*\\* – Find companies hiring SDRs/AEs (they're investing in growth = need your sales tools)\n\n\\* \\*\\*DevOps/Infrastructure vendors\\*\\* – Target companies posting DevOps/SRE roles (they're scaling infrastructure)\n\n\\* \\*\\*HR tech providers\\*\\* – Identify companies with multiple open positions (recruiting pain points)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Recruitment agencies\\*\\* – Build targeted lists of companies actively hiring in specific verticals\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 50-100+ companies per run. Google Sheets trigger means you just add a row with your search criteria and it runs automatically.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8510.json)",
