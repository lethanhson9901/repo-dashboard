      "text": "l need to share this because I keep seeing people say \"AI agents are dead\" or \"you can't land big clients\" - this is complete BS and here's proof.\n\n**The Client**\n\nCriminal defense lawyer in Australia (keeping them anonymous for obvious reasons). They handle all types of criminal cases and were spending a TON of money hiring people to manage incoming leads. Most leads came through WhatsApp, and they were losing potential clients left and right because they couldn't respond fast enough.\n\n**The Solution I Built**\n\nI created an AI agent that lives in WhatsApp as a chatbot and integrates with their Salesforce CRM. Here's what it does:\n\n\\- **Transcribes audio messages** from potential clients automatically\n\n\\- **Responds intelligently to any query** 24/7 (like an actual human)\n\n\\- **Creates geographic heat maps** based on client addresses - shows where most cases are coming from to enable targeted ad campaigns\n\n\\- **Filters and stars high-priority cases** directly in their CRM\n\n\\- **Sends final invoices via email** automatically\n\nAll inputs come through WhatsApp. All outputs go to Salesforce and email. Complete automation.\n\n**Development time: 5 weeks**\n\n**Testing period: 2 weeks**\n\n**How It Went Down**\n\nFirst call: Pretty casual, just getting to know each other. He asked for a demo video.\n\nBefore the second call: I created a Loom video (about 10 minutes) showing exactly how everything worked. Sent it 2-3 minutes before our meeting.\n\nSecond call: This is where it got crazy. We watched the demo together for an hour. I walked him through every feature, showed him how it would replace multiple staff members handling leads.\n\nHe was BLOWN AWAY.\n\nBy the end of the call, he asked if we could start RIGHT NOW. In 2.5 years as an automation engineer, I've never had a client ready to pay on the spot during the second call.\n\nHe said \"let me talk to my finance department to get this started quickly. I love your solution.\"\n\n**Less than an hour after that call ended, I received the first 50% payment: $2,700 USD.**\n\nI literally just stared at my bank account. This was real.\n\n**The Results**\n\nProject is now complete. The client is thrilled. \n\nHere's the kicker: **I'm saving him approximately $250,000 USD annually** by solving their lead response problem and preventing clients from going to competitors.\n\nMy fee? **$5,400 total.**\n\nWorth every penny for both of us.\n\nI just sent the final invoice for the remaining $2,700 today as we wrapped up the project.\n\n**To Everyone Saying \"AI Agents Are Dead\"**\n\nThis post is a punch in the face to that narrative. \n\nRAG agents work. AI automation works. Real businesses have real problems that AI can solve RIGHT NOW.\n\nStop listening to the doom and gloom. Start building solutions for real problems.\n\n**Note to mods:** This isn't promotional - I'm not selling anything. Just sharing a success story to counter all the negativity I see here about AI agents being \"dead\" or \"overhyped.\"\n\nMy hands are literally still shaking as I dictate this using AI for obvious reasons. This is the future, and it's already here.\n\nSo all the n8n haters or doubters are u still think that ai agent is ded or have no future? ",

However, marketing companies and departments have such big budgets and those same graphics get them tons of cash but designers don’t charge enough and then they wonder why they are broke.\n\nI think the route that we should go especially now that we are implementing AI and workflows and saving companies millions of dollars is to do the same thing that front end developers did. They created so many frameworks that people were paying hundred dollars an hour just to get a developer to run react or angular code. It was impossible to find developers at one point and now the technology is obviously everywhere.\n\nWhat I’m saying is this if you know the value of what you’re creating charge by impact not by oh I can do this in a few hours so I’m gonna charge you $50 an hour or some cheap number like that. Learning code and understanding how all these things flow is very difficult for people outside of our field and it took us years to get to a point where we can automate things for them even if it’s something as simple as doing stuff in python People and companies really need to properly pay money and this guy charging 5K or whatever is going to make it because he’s probably not used to seeing money at all, but if he’s under charging it, it does a disservice to everyone in the industry.\n\nWe need to charge proper rates and people need to pay. I understand that the economy is really shit in the market and the job market is terrible but at the same time these are not easy to find skills and companies need to pay properly. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk",

But I want to push back on a few things because I think the framing is misleading for people starting out.\n\nYou're saving him $250k/year and charged $5,400 one-time. That means you underpriced by at least 10x. If your solution replaces multiple staff members handling leads, you should be charging recurring, not a flat project fee. That $5,400 is gone. His savings compound every month.\n\nThe \"my hands are still shaking\" energy is great for a reddit post but in practice you just did 7 weeks of work for what breaks down to about $770/week. That's not life-changing money for the complexity you described. WhatsApp integration, Salesforce CRM, audio transcription, geographic heat maps, automated invoicing. That's serious engineering.\n\nThe real lesson here isn't \"AI agents work.\" It's that you found a real problem, built a real solution, and closed it fast. That part is legit and most people never get there. But the pricing tells me you were so excited to close that you left a lot on the table.\n\nNo hate. I build with n8n too and I know how easy it is to underprice when you're just happy someone said yes. But next time, charge what the outcome is worth, not what the build took.",

Not to mention security was a joke (saw a really big business having the default password for their router ie admin admin 🤦)\n\nSo yea there's still going to be lots of businesses that are untapped and could potentially benefit from something like this especially if you market it right and currently not a large number of people who know how to do these kinds of things. \n\nHonestly deep down every time I see people post stupid AI generated images on social media or asking chatgpt random dumb questions, I'm really happy because I know as long as the general population is still doing this, I'm still ahead of the curve. Most people haven't realised the true power of AI and the time to make money off of it is now.\n\nYour only mistake I feel is you really undervalued your product. At the very least i would have figured out a way to get some form of recurring income from them. Hosting the app on athe cloud or something and charging a monthly fee for hosting and maintenance.",

Use the 20% rule--what you charge for your custom application, 20% of that for annual SLA maintenance and support, starting in year 2, so if you charge $25,000, you want at least $5,000 a year for maintenance and support. \nMy two cents anyway...

One as near term history which is as you think of it today being mostly the full conversation where nothing is lost.  Then once that hits a specific number of tokens, you compress that (through varying techniques) into 'observational memory' section that is a much more concise version of what happened with way less details in it.  That way you kind of have a short term memory and a long term memory that consumes way less tokens over time, albeit with loss in precision for older stuff.\n\nI don't know for sure that is what is being done here, but I do it in my low level agents I am building for enterprises, and it works quite well.

If you just let an agent have at it and do whatever, you get compounding errors when the workflow turns long.  There are also things I want to happen the same way every time, but have adaptability and creativity at different points.  It is a balance.\n\nBy using deterministic paths at the points where it makes sense (and is much cheaper to run), but allowing freedom at the right places, you do end up with a very useful agentic approach.  The balance is key, but is also the power in that you don't end up with completely wonky behavior that could be very dangerous, and it is easier to add human in the loop where it is a good idea (like making the final purchase).",

That's not an agent. That's a switch node with extra API costs.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love n8n's AI capabilities. We use them constantly. But for practical stuff:\n\n- Extracting data from messy PDFs clients send\n- Summarizing email threads before they hit the CRM\n- Categorizing support tickets so they route to the right person\n\nThese save real time, these are boring but these dont hallucinate when you ask it the weather\n\nMeanwhile the \"AI agent\" posts are usually either:\n1. Demos that break in production\n2. Workflows that cost $50/day in API calls to do what a $0 regex could do\n3. Cool experiments that the person will abandon in 2 weeks\n\nThe n8n team has built genuinely useful AI features. The agent node is powerful when you actually need autonomous decision-making. But please dont try and fucking tell me AI is now managing your 300k a year marketing team just because you have an http request to nano banana, one to veo3 and another to 11labs 😂\n\nOh and dont even get me started on molbots/clawdbot...\n\nAnyone else feel like we've collectively lost the plot on what \"AI automation\" actually means",

The category normalization with the memory system is clever - I've seen so many finance trackers where categories just spiral out of control.\n\n\n\nA few thoughts from someone who works with similar workflows:\n\n\n\n1. For scaling those LLM-heavy nodes, have you considered implementing rate limiting at the n8n level? I usually add a queue node before heavy API calls to prevent timeout issues during peak usage.\n\n\n\n2. Your multi-path logging is clean. One optimization I'd suggest: you could use sub-workflows for each transaction type instead of having them all in the main flow. Makes debugging way easier down the line.\n\n\n\n3. The Redis + MongoDB + Airtable combo makes sense given your use case. Though you might be able to consolidate Redis and Airtable if you set up proper TTLs in Airtable (they have automation features now that could handle memory cleanup).\n\n\n\nGreat job sharing this with the code! This is exactly the kind of real-world implementation people can learn from.",

I'll look into queue mode and throttling for LLM calls.\n\nI like the sub-workflow idea too. The main flow has grown quite large, so splitting by transaction type makes sense for maintainability\n\nThanks again for the insights. Super helpful to hear from someone running similar workflows.",

Right now you’ve got volume; you still need accuracy, structure, and deliverability. \n\n\n\nI’d add a verification/enrichment pass in n8n before Apollo: run emails through NeverBounce/Zerobounce, then enrich with Clay or Clearbit so you get role, company size, tech, and at least one concrete signal (case study, hiring, niche) you can reference in the email. Also log source URL, date scraped, and “why they’re on the list” in separate columns so you’re not stuck sending generic agency cold spam.\n\n\n\nOn the infra side, I’d dump everything into Postgres/Supabase instead of only Sheets and add a dedupe key on domain + email. Then sequence from Apollo, with reply-stop logic and a suppression list synced back to the DB. I’ve used Clay, Apollo, and Pulse for Reddit together like this: scrape + enrich, then use Reddit conversations to warm up messaging before blasting a new niche.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, treat this as a pipeline, not just a fun demo, and it becomes a serious asset.",

If the AI is generating messages from a bare LinkedIn profile, the output reads generic no matter how good the prompt is.\n\nThe trick is enriching the prospect data before the personalization step. Pull their recent posts, company news, or any public content they've written. That gives the model something specific to reference instead of just restating their job title back to them.\n\nFor the LinkedIn rate limiting side, are you spreading sends across the day or batching? LinkedIn's detection has gotten aggressive in 2026, especially on new accounts. Keeping under 20 to 25 connection requests per day with randomized timing seems to be the safe zone right now.",

      "text": "If you've been using the HTTP Request node to call Claude's API in your n8n workflows, you know how quickly the API costs add up — especially if you're running multiple automations daily.\n\nI found a way to use your existing Claude Pro subscription ($20/month) as a personal API endpoint that you can call directly from n8n. No separate API billing, no usage-based charges.\n\nHere's how it works at a high level:\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* Spin up a small VPS (DigitalOcean $6/month droplet works fine)\n* Install Claude Code SDK and authenticate with your Pro account\n* Run a lightweight FastAPI server that exposes a `/generate` endpoint\n* Secure it with a simple API key header\n\n**Connecting to n8n:**\n\n* Use the HTTP Request node\n* POST to [`http://your-server-ip:3001/generate`](http://your-server-ip:3001/generate)\n* Pass your prompt in the request body\n* Add your custom API key in the headers\n* That's it — Claude responds just like the official API\n\nI've been running this for my own content generation and automation workflows and it handles everything — writing, summarization, data extraction, you name it.\n\nFull step-by-step setup walkthrough here if you want to follow along: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O\\_Aq7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z87M1O_Aq7E)\n\nHappy to answer any questions if you try setting this up.\n\n**A word of caution:** This is great for personal projects and experimentation, but I wouldn't recommend using this for heavy client work or production-level automations. Anthropic will likely notice if you're pushing heavy usage through this — my estimate is anything beyond $200-$400 worth of equivalent API usage could get flagged, and there's a real chance your account gets blocked. Use it wisely for your own smaller workflows and testing. For serious client/production work, stick to the official API.",

How does node work? how does node pass the data to another node? and these are seems technical but it's not. It's easier than zapier in my perspective. Right. It will take couple of weeks to master the basics, and you have to work on your automation. Start with a simple one, and you will get the hang of it.

Pull them apart, break them, rebuild them. You'll pick up the node logic way faster than sitting through any course because your brain already knows what the workflow is supposed to do, you're just learning new syntax.\n\nIf you want something more grounded, we put out content on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@frameworkfriday) that's focused on actual implementations with real workflows we've built and run in production, not theory.

      "text": "Been grinding in the automation space for a long time now. Here's what actually moves the needle vs. what sounds good on paper:\n\n1. Start embarrassingly small\n\nYour first workflow should take 10 minutes to build, not 10 hours. I burned weeks overcomplicating things when a basic \"new form submission → auto reply\" would've taught me twice as much.\n\n2. Document everything in public\n\nEvery single automation you build is content waiting to happen. The screenshots, the lessons, the stuff that broke. All of it becomes proof that you know what you're doing. I land more clients from sharing my process than from polished demos.\n\n3. Learn the HTTP Request node before anything else\n\nI mean it. Half the \"limitations\" people complain about in n8n vanish once you can write custom API calls. It handles everything the native nodes can't. It's the one skill that changes the game.\n\n4. Drop the \"automation expert\" title\n\nEveryone uses it. Try this instead: \"I help \\[specific industry\\] eliminate \\[specific pain point\\].\" Being specific attracts people who will pay premium because you described their exact problem.\n\n5. Saying no makes you more money\n\nI passed on a $500 project last month because it didn't fit my niche. That same client came back two weeks later with a $3K project that was a perfect match. Holding your line creates value.\n\n6. Error handling separates beginners from pros\n\nEverybody shows the clean version. The real ones build for when APIs crash, data formats shift, or users submit garbage. If you're not planning for chaos, you're not ready for production.\n\n7. Post your failures, not just your wins\n\n\"Here's how I accidentally broke a client's workflow and what I learned from it\" outperforms \"Look at this flawless automation\" every single time. Being real builds trust faster than being perfect.\n\n8. Recurring revenue beats one time builds\n\nClients pay once for the setup. They pay monthly for \"keep it running and make it better.\" Maintenance contracts will always outperform project work.\n\n9. Other automators are your best referral source\n\nThey're not competition. Help people in communities, answer questions, share what you know. Half my inbound clients come from other builders sending people my way.\n\n10. Automate your own stuff first\n\nNothing proves you know automation like having your own lead gen, content pipeline, and client onboarding fully automated. Walk the talk.\n\nSpeaking of which, I genuinely love building n8n workflows. It's one of my favorite things to do. If you've got a project you need built, I'll probably take it on. Most workflows I'll do for $50, bigger ones around $100, and even the complex multi day builds top out at $200. I just enjoy the work and I'd rather keep the barrier low so more people actually get automated.\n\nBonus: The automators making real money talk about outcomes, not nodes. \"Saved 15 hours a week\" lands way harder than \"Built a 47 step workflow.\"\n\nWhat's been your biggest learning curve with automation? Curious what trips people up vs. what clicks right away.",

What I learned is that if I want complex automations that need solid debugging and are truly scalable, I will opt for code. As developers we usually have tons of tricks and classes that are proven and ready to go, as opposed to some spaghetti workflows that are hard to debug at times.\n\nAgain, it all depends on what works for you.  I have some simple n8n API automations that were created in a couple of hours and work great.\n\nI agree that there is too much hype from influencers.  My 2 cents.  \n\nCheers!",

Experienced EXACTLY what you're describing!\n\nIn the end, our solution was to create our own framework. It solves all of these issues by replacing flow graphs with tables.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the table-based interface naturally ads real-time observability! Just by looking at the table, you can instantly see failed cells, check out the details and re-run (we added a spreadsheet-like interface). This has saved us crazy amounts of time in production! Debugging, adjusting and re-running is not an annoyance anymore.\n\nSecondly, storage and agent memory are built in from the get go. There's no need to connect databases or Google Sheets if you need your agents to remember anything. The workflows become much simpler and connecting them is as simple as accessing the data of one table from another.\n\nApart from that, we found two amazing side effects of the switch from flow graphs to tables:\n\n1. Customers and users instantly understand the agents we're building, because they know spreadsheets. Everyone in business has worked with Excel at some point, right? So this has been a massive boost for adoption and helped us overcome objections from users. \n2. The spreadsheet like interface naturally added human-in-the-loop capability to every workflow. Human team members and agents simply collaborate by editing data in cells. If an agent needs approval, or some piece of information, someone edits a cell and the agent picks it up and continues its task.\n\nWe built this for our startup in-house, but since it's worked so well we decided to release it publicly. If you decide to check it out at [taibles.ai](http://taibles.ai) (free!), please please please give me feedback :-)",

Most people build linear workflows, but at scale, you need a 'Watchdog' branch that catches 401/500 errors and force-restarts the session instead of letting it hang.\n\nI’ve spent the last few months mapping out a 'Self-Healing' architecture for n8n that handles these silent drops and credential refreshes automatically. It’s saved us dozens of hours in production maintenance. I’m happy to share the logic map of the 'Watchdog' structure if anyone is struggling with stability.",

Built two things so far:\n\n1. **Screenshot → calendar event:** I send a screenshot (flight booking, concert ticket, etc.) to a Telegram bot, it extracts the info and creates an Outlook event. Simple, not life-changing, but a solid first build.\n2. **Meeting reminder automation:** Sends reminders to participants who haven't responded to tomorrow's meetings. After accidentally blasting a few dozen emails to last month's contacts due to a broken filter... it now works and is live.\n\nThen I hit a wall. I wanted to pull my LinkedIn post analytics into a dashboard automatically. Seemed straightforward. It wasn't:\n\n* LinkedIn's API doesn't give you the data you actually want\n* Scraping gets you blocked\n* OneDrive integration failed due to licensing issues\n* Google Drive with self-hosted n8n apparently isn't stable\n\nAfter 1.5 days of troubleshooting, I realized I could have just built the whole thing manually in Excel.\n\nWhich brings me to my actual question: **How do you decide what's worth automating?** Do you have a mental framework or threshold? How do you deal with hitting platform limitations that turn a 30-minute idea into a multi-day rabbit hole?\n\nWould love to hear from people who've been through this learning curve.  \nAre there any projects you thought they were great and had a good learning curve? What would you recommend building?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Or you can send it to an automation consultant and get better estimates.\n\nAs it's always true with software, the estimates will be far from perfect, but you'll get better over time.\n\nAlso, experiment and fail fast!
