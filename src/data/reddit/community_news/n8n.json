      "text": "I'm not some automation guru pulling $100K months. I made $15K selling AI automations in 5 months, but honestly, I learned some expensive lessons that nobody talks about. I'm just a guy who figured out why 80% of my first automations sat completely unused while clients went back to doing everything manually. Here's what actually matters when selling AI to businesses... integration beats innovation every single time.\n\nMost people build automations that work perfectly in isolation. The demo looks incredible, the results are impressive, and it ends up being a complete waste of money. I learned this the hard way with a plumbing company client. I built them an amazing AI system for managing service calls and dispatching... technically flawless. They used it for exactly three days. Why? Because their entire operation ran through group texts, sticky notes on the dashboard, and quick phone calls. My solution meant they had to check another app, learn new software, and change twelve years of habits.\n\nNow I map their actual workflow first... not what they say they do. Before I build anything, I spend two to three days just watching how they actually work. I track what devices they're on 90% of the time, how they communicate internally, and what apps are already open on their phone. Here's a perfect example... project management tools make total sense on paper. But for old school small business owners who handle everything through texts and calls, it creates more friction. Your time saving solution just became a 3x complexity nightmare.\n\nI build around their existing habits now... not against them. My HVAC client managed everything through a shared text thread with their technicians. Instead of building a fancy CRM system, I built an AI that reads customer complaint messages sent to the group chat, automatically pulls up service history, suggests parts needed, and sends appointment confirmations back to the same thread. Same communication method they'd used for six years... just smarter. My best performing client automation is embarrassingly simple. It just takes their voicemail inquiries and converts them into the same text format they were already using for their morning dispatch. Saves them thirty five minutes daily and made them $9K in avoided double bookings last month.\n\nHere's what I took away from all this... a simple automation they use every day beats a complex one they never touch. Most businesses don't want an AI revolution. They want their current process to work better without having to learn anything new. Stop building what impresses other developers. Build what fits into a fifty year old business owner's existing routine. Took me a lot of nos and unused automations to figure this out.",

Or something that makes the Quality of Life for the employee doing it, better. \n\nThere's a slew of opportunities in that workspace, and I'm sure they are mostly utilizing internal teams to do those things, but having the raw knowledge of how to turn a wrench, does benefit this type of thinking and workflow.",

Support flows that work inside email or chat. Social or ops updates that show up where teams already spend their time.\nIntegration beats intelligence. If it fits existing habits, it gets used.

The plumbing/HVAC examples effectively illustrate why adoption fails.\n\n## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions\n\n### 1. **Systematize Your Discovery Process**\nRather than informal 2-3 day observation, consider documenting a reusable discovery framework in n8n:\n- Create a checklist template for client workflows\n- Build a simple n8n workflow that logs common friction points\n- This makes your approach scalable and repeatable\n\n### 2. **Bridge the Gap, Don't Just Accept Limitations**\nYour text-thread AI solution is clever, but consider:\n- **Gradual integration**: Start with their existing tools, then introduce lightweight process improvements over time\n- **Hybrid workflows**: Use n8n to automate *between* their preferred channels (texts → backend system → confirmation back to texts)\n- This respects habits while still modernizing backend processes\n\n### 3. **Quantify & Communicate ROI Differently**\nYou mention 80% of automations went unused—this is critical data:\n- Track adoption metrics for each client\n- Share case studies showing *adoption rates*, not just technical capabilities\n- Help readers understand what makes YOUR approach different from typical automation fails\n\n### 4. **Share Specific n8n Workflows**\nYour audience came for n8n insights:\n- Show the actual workflow structure for your text-to-CRM integration\n- Highlight which n8n nodes solved the \"existing habit\" problem\n- Provide a template others can adapt\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nYou've identified a real problem (adoption failure), but lean harder into *how* to solve it systematically rather than just accepting client limitations. Your next post could be a game-changer if you share the actual n8n architecture behind your wins.",

Hence I also added Notion with a personal task list to the agent - allowing both to get immediate feedback on pending task and to create new one.\nPlus maybe the most important addition vs. your blueprint: output is NOT only to Telegram, but to a daily note taking app (capacities.io in my case, but e.g. Notion or Obsidian would be other good choices).\nThe rational behind this: create a sort of „context timeline“ of my digital life. Telegram is ephemeral. Daily notes stay - and can serve to improve personal context for current or future AI applications.",

The Telegram interface is practical, and your honest reflection on the emotional benefit (feeling calmer) resonates.\n\n## Areas for Improvement\n\n### 1. **Security & Trust (Critical)**\n- You mention handling emails, calendars, and expenses—consider adding explicit details about:\n  - How credentials are stored (encrypted? environment variables?)\n  - What data is logged and retained\n  - Rate limiting to prevent accidental bulk actions\n- This will help readers trust the system and learn best practices\n\n### 2. **Workflow Clarity**\n- The post describes *what* you built but not *how* it works technically\n- Consider adding:\n  - A simple flow diagram showing manager → helpers\n  - 1-2 concrete examples (\"I say 'add coffee meeting tomorrow at 2pm' → X happens\")\n  - Error handling strategy (what happens when the AI misunderstands?)\n\n### 3. **Resource Accessibility**\n- The Drive/YouTube links are helpful, but consider:\n  - A brief **setup guide** in the post itself (even 3-5 steps)\n  - Which n8n nodes are essential vs. optional\n  - Estimated time to replicate\n- This removes friction for people wanting to try it\n\n### 4. **Actionable Next Steps**\nInstead of just asking questions, suggest:\n- \"Here's what I'd test next: X\"\n- \"Known limitations: Y\"\n- \"Help wanted with: Z\"\n\n## Alternative Approaches to Consider\n- **Fallback workflows**: What happens if the AI is uncertain? (Ask for clarification vs. guess)\n- **Audit trail**: Log decisions for review—especially for financial/calendar actions\n- **Gradual trust**: Start read-only (summaries) before write access (actions)\n\n## Bottom Line\nYou've built something genuinely useful. Now help others understand *why* it's safe and *how* to build it. That's what will make this post valuable beyond inspiration.",

Maybe 1-2% either ignore or decline without comment. Haven't had anyone call it out as automated, which I credit to the human-like delays and genuinely relevant messaging.\n\nThe real insight: quality of targeting matters more than volume. 50 well-researched outreaches beat 500 spray-and-pray DMs every time.",

Still n8n has the option for pdf text extraction. I just rebuilt it anyway more for an experimentation. \n\nWith custom nodes, there is creative freedom to use whatever library we need and build custom business logic on top of it.\n\nTesseract.js might be better than the node I’ve built right now. But who knows.... if the community gets their hands on this open-source project and contributes value, this could become an all-rounder node. At least there’s a possibility (blindly being positive lol).\n\nAnd this was more like an learning & experiment project for me... so nothing serious 🤝",

      "text": "I’ve been working with n8n and AI automation since August, and looking back, I realize how easy it is to get lost in the \"noise\" of this fast-paced world. If you are a student or starting out, here is a realistic roadmap based on my failures and successes.\n\n**1. Don’t get stuck in the \"Code Trap\"** As a student, you might feel the need to master JavaScript first. **Don't.** In 2026, logic is more important than syntax. Use Gemini or ChatGPT as your coding partner. Focus on describing the problem and the output you need. If you can explain the logic/math of a data transformation, AI can write the code snippet for you. Understand the *logic*, let AI handle the *syntax*.\n\n**2. Choose a Niche (Avoid the YouTube Hype)** When I started, I fell for the \"RAG\" and \"Voice Agent\" hype because of YouTube. But those areas are crowded. My advice? Find an area where automation meets deep domain expertise. For me, it was **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**. By focusing on how automation can analyze AI-driven search results, I developed unique know-how. Pick a niche that is growing but lacks enough experts.\n\n**3. Master \"Error Management\" before \"Feature Building\"** It’s exciting when a workflow runs manually. But real automation happens when you're sleeping. Systems *will* break. Instead of just building \"happy paths,\" focus on what happens when a node fails. Learning error handling and log analysis is what separates a hobbyist from a professional.\n\n**4. The VPS & Docker Reality Check** Running n8n on a VPS is great for costs, but be prepared for a learning curve. I once spent half a day solving a simple \"Connection Lost\" error. It’s a great skill to have, but don't let infrastructure hurdles stop you from building. Start simple, then move to Docker/VPS as you grow.\n\n**5. Focus on the \"Essential\" Nodes** Don't try to learn every node. Master these first:\n\n* **Webhooks & HTTP Requests** (The bread and butter of APIs)\n* **JSON Logic** (How data moves)\n* **Edit Fields, IF, and Switch** (Control flow)\n* **Database nodes** (Start with PostgreSQL to understand data persistence)\n\n**6. Use AI as your Project Manager (Context Engineering)** When I see an interesting freelance job post, I don't just apply. I ask an AI assistant to help me build a **Product Roadmap** for that specific need. Break the problem into modular pieces and solve them one by one in n8n. This builds \"Context Engineering\" skills—learning how to translate a business problem into a step-by-step technical process.\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Put your projects into production. Even small ones. Real-world triggers and unexpected errors are the best teachers you will ever have.\n\nGood luck on your journey! It’s a marathon, not a sprint.",

Tasks are captured via Siri, stored plainly, and a read-only workflow returns exactly one recommended next task based on priority and time of day. No auto-reprioritization, no background task mutation — just decision support to reduce cognitive load.\n\nArchitecture overview (technical):\nI’m using Vikunja as a self-hosted task store, n8n as the automation layer, and Apple Shortcuts/Siri as the capture + UI surface. New tasks are captured via Siri → Apple Shortcut → HTTPS n8n webhook, where they’re optionally classified (rules-first, AI optional) into priority buckets (P0–P3 + a TAX project) and created in Vikunja via its REST API. \n\nSeparately, I run a read-only n8n webhook (what-should-i-do-next) that queries Vikunja for active tasks, filters deterministically by project priority, status, start date, and time-of-day/business-hours constraints, and returns exactly one recommended task plus a short reason and an optional “prep step” if the task can’t be fully executed right now. A macOS Shortcuts widget calls that endpoint so I can click once on my desktop and get a single next action without opening the task manager. No background task mutation, no auto-reprioritization — just constrained decision support to reduce cognitive load.",

      "text": "I have been into n8n for almost a year now, getting my head around all the aspect and the tutorial, then i joined Upwork where I worked on very simple n8n project like issue fixing and error handling, however, for the past few weeks I got this project on Fiver, where I needed to build a whatssap chatboT, THAT'S NOT JUST another whatssap chatbot it's for a real use case. that's why I Needed to vent/share because this project was a ride.\n\nStarted as \"simple WhatsApp bot for products\" - ended up being way more complex than anyone expected.\n\n## What happened\n\n- **Client had zero vision**. Literally just \"make it work like a bot.\" Added features as we went. Every call was \"oh can it also do X?\"\n- **No clear requirements = constant changes**\n\nBuilt it with AI Agent + Shopify + WhatsApp Business API. Should've taken a week, took a month.\n\n## The shit that broke me\n\n**AI Agent wrapping JSON in markdown** - spent HOURS on this. Output parser kept erroring. Had to literally write \"NO MARKDOWN\" 5 times in caps in the prompt before it listened.\n\n**Empty products array** - when someone says \"hello\", products is empty, Split Out node crashes. Took me 4 hours to realize I needed a Switch node to check first. Obvious in hindsight.\n\n**Scope creep** - \"simple\" became: multiple products, images, Arabic support, error handling, dual paths. None of this was in the original brief.\n\n## Pros\n- Works great now, client's happy\n- Sales actually went up for them\n- Learned a ton about AI Agents\n- Got paid\n\n## Cons  \n- Took 4x longer than estimated\n- Should've charged way more\n- Client changed requirements constantly\n- AI is unpredictable as hell\n- My estimation skills are trash\n\n## Technical stuff that might help someone\n\n- Output Parser is strict - one wrong field = error\n- Always check array length before Split Out\n- Phone number path: `$('WhatsApp Trigger').item.json.messages[0].from` not `$json.from`\n- Python handles JSON parsing better than JS for this use case\n- Prompt engineering is literally 80% of AI Agent work\n\n## Would I do it again?\n\nYeah. But I'd charge triple (it was kinda my first n8n real project) and get requirements in writing. Even if the requirements are \"figure it out as we go\" - at least that's documented.\n\nReal-world n8n isn't the clean workflows you see in tutorials. It's messy, clients don't know what they want, and everything takes longer...\n\nBut when it works? Pretty cool.\n\n---\n\nPs : I'm on discussion with other clients, thus stay tuned cuz I will definitly share those project and how it goes ...\n\nQuestions welcome. Especially if you've dealt with similar client chaos or AI Agent issues.",

          "text": "Great post—this is exactly the kind of real-world experience that's valuable for the n8n community. Your technical insights are solid, and I appreciate the honesty about scope creep and estimation challenges. A few thoughts that might help on future projects:\n\n**Workflow & Process Improvements:** Consider implementing a formal requirements document and change request process upfront, even if it's just a simple Google Doc. You could also build a \"feature toggle\" system in n8n using a config node—this lets you enable/disable features without rebuilding the workflow, making scope creep less painful. For the AI Agent issues you hit, exploring structured output formats (like JSON Schema validation in your LLM calls) earlier might have saved those hours debugging the markdown wrapping problem. Also, consider creating reusable sub-workflows for common patterns (array validation, error handling, phone number parsing)—this would speed up future projects and reduce bugs.\n\n**Technical Best Practices:** Your point about checking array length before Split Out is crucial—this is a common n8n gotcha. Beyond that, I'd suggest adding comprehensive error handling at each critical node (especially around API calls and AI outputs) with fallback responses for users. For the phone number path issue, documenting your data structure early with a \"data mapping\" node can prevent these kinds of surprises. Python for JSON parsing is smart, but consider whether a simple JavaScript function node with try-catch blocks could handle it—fewer dependencies mean easier maintenance. Your prompt engineering insight is spot-on; maybe document your final \"winning\" prompts as templates for future AI Agent projects.\n\n**Scalability & Client Management:** As you take on more clients, think about building a project template in n8n with your proven patterns already baked in. For future projects, propose a phased approach: Phase 1 (MVP with core features), Phase 2 (enhancements), Phase 3 (optimization). This gives you clearer scope boundaries and justifies higher pricing for each phase. Also, set up monitoring/logging early—use n8n's built-in error notifications so you catch issues before clients do. Regarding pricing: your instinct to charge more is right, but also track your actual hours per project type to build better estimates. You've got the skills; now it's about packaging them strategically.\n\nYou've clearly learned a ton from this project. The next one will be faster, and your clients will benefit from your hard-won experience. Keep shipping! 🚀",

If someone recognizes the message as templated, the brand hit is real. No argument there.\n\nWhere I'd push back slightly: the \"outsourcing relationships to a script\" framing assumes relationships were active in the first place. Most of my 2,000+ connections are people I met once at a conference, connected with after a webinar, or accepted requests from years ago. We're not grabbing coffee. The relationship is already dormant.\n\nSo the real question becomes: is a single templated message worse than permanent silence?\n\nFor close connections - absolutely, I'd never automate that. For the long tail of acquaintances I'll realistically never message manually? I'd rather take the shot and let them decide.\n\nYou're also making me reconsider the framing of the message itself. \"Please follow my page\" is a pure ask. Something like \"here's what we're building, thought it might interest you given your work in X\" at least offers context. The automation stays, but the message earns its send.\n\nGenuinely appreciate the perspective. It's easy to optimize for efficiency and forget that every message lands in a real person's inbox with real judgment attached.",

The \"automation at scale = spam\" concern is valid.\n\nA few thoughts though:\n\nThe underlying assumption is that any automated outreach is inherently trust-breaking. I'd argue it depends on what you're asking and how often. A single message to existing connections asking them to check out something you're building is pretty different from cold outreach sequences selling services to strangers.\n\nThese are people who already know me. If a friend texted me \"hey, I started a company, would mean a lot if you followed our page\" - I wouldn't feel funneled. I'd probably just do it. The automation is handling the logistics of reaching 2,000 people, not fabricating the relationship.\n\nThat said, you're right that the templates are a limitation. I'm actually exploring a version where the first touch is sharing something genuinely useful (a resource, insight, or even just catching up) before any ask happens. Makes it slower but probably more sustainable.\n\nThe honest truth: if someone feels negatively about getting a message like this from me, that's useful signal too. I'd rather know than assume silence means disinterest.\n\nAppreciate the direct feedback - these are the kinds of conversations that make the implementation better.",

I'm also processing only 10-15 connections per day max, which keeps the activity pattern looking human. [ConnectSafely.ai](http://ConnectSafely.ai) handles the rate limiting on their end too, but I'd rather be conservative.\n\nThe softer CTA idea is solid though. I've been thinking about a two-touch approach:\n\n1. **First message:** Share something genuinely useful (industry insight, a helpful resource, or even just reconnecting after a while)\n2. **Second message (1-2 weeks later):** Then make the ask for the page follow\n\nIt adds complexity to the workflow but probably gets better results long-term. Less \"ask\" fatigue, more relationship building.\n\nFor message copy, I'm rotating through 6 templates right now but planning to swap them out every few weeks. Might also add an AI node to generate more dynamic variations based on their job title.\n\nThanks for the resource link - always looking for positioning inspiration. Appreciate the feedback!",

You're not helping and most job seekers on reddit have likely already read the exact \"advice\" you posted many years ago at this point,\n\nIt's just so egotistical.

We're just doing the same amount of work, slightly faster, and then filling the gaps with more busywork.\n\nHere's what's bugging me:\nEveryone online is like \"AI automation will 10x your productivity!\" but I'm not seeing it translate to anything meaningful. We respond to tickets faster but customers aren't happier. \n\nWe update the CRM automatically but deals aren't closing faster. We're generating reports nobody reads in half the time.\n\nIt feels like we automated the easy stuff that doesn't actually matter and now I'm not sure what to do next.\n\nFor people who've actually seen real results:\nWhat did you automate that actually moved the needle on something that matters (revenue, retention, whatever)?\n\nHow do you figure out what's worth automating vs what's just... fine to keep doing manually?\n\nAm I measuring this wrong? Like should I be looking at different stuff?\n\nI'm not trying to trash AI automation - I genuinely think there's something here - I just feel like I'm missing the plot.\n\nAnyone else been in this spot? \nWhat did you do differently?",

If a business isn't optimising their prices (either lower to get higher volume or higher because there is headroom) then money is being left on the table.\n\n\nDoesn't technically require AI but AI can make price optimisation easier (e.g. often need to include competitor pricing and market sentiment to understand pricing).\n\n\nIt's easy to work solely on repeatable tasks and saving time but you need to have the buy-in to eventually make headcount redundant to realise those savings (and I'm genuinely concerned that when companies start to go more AI then AI companies will ramp up their token cost and suddenly your wage bill isn't under your control anymore - your business will collapse if you don't pay the AI racketeers)",

Most teams automate for efficiency first because it is easy to measure, but efficiency alone rarely moves revenue or retention.\n\nThe pattern I see is this: if an automation does not directly change a customer decision or an internal decision, it just creates speed without leverage. Faster ticket responses do not help if the underlying issue is expectation setting. Cleaner CRM data does not help if it is not used to change follow ups or offers.\n\nThe automations that actually move the needle usually sit closer to decision points. Things like qualifying leads differently, changing what happens after a key customer action, or forcing clearer next steps for sales and success teams.\n\nA simple test is to ask: if this automation disappeared tomorrow, would a customer notice or would revenue change? If the answer is no, it is probably convenience automation, not growth automation.",

I’ve experienced the same : \n- AI flows > lower frictions, more productivity but that’s hard to match with dollars \n- the hardest is to implement revenue generating workflows \n\nOne thing I’m working on that I recommend you take a look at as well : \n\nScan your organization and identify contractors and agencies you work with. See if you can create flows or automations that would make their job redundant. Take the amount your company saves and ask your boss for a 20% cut as a bonus. \n\nOne of my clients has an agency do lot of manual work, for hundreds of euros per day. I’m trying to automate that. \n\nI don’t know what business your in, but you can also sell (or provide for free) an add on that is powered by AI. Example : I’m creating a NotebookLM with the whole project for a client. It’s regularly updated. They can ask it any question with instant answer instead of waiting for me or going through docs.",

Since people need support for courses that have already been sold, it allows me to provide support without paying additional salaries that would generate more profit. \n\n3. It allows me to create new MVP solutions for my students, connecting Lovable or other platforms that people can try and give me quick market research. \n\nI hope this gives you some ideas, although it will depend on your niche.",

          "text": "Reddit Response - r/n8n Automation ROI Question\nYou're not crazy - you diagnosed it yourself: \"We automated the easy stuff that doesn't actually matter.\"\nThe issue is you're measuring activity (tickets touched, CRM updated, reports generated) instead of outcomes (revenue, retention, conversion). Most automation advice online optimizes for the wrong thing.\nWhat Actually Moves the Needle\n1. Lead Response Speed\nThis is the highest ROI automation most businesses ignore. Stats show responding to inbound leads within 5 minutes makes you 21x more likely to qualify them. Most companies respond in 42+ hours.\nOne automation - webhook catches lead, AI sends immediate personalized response, human gets notified with context - can increase conversion 30-50%. Not \"time saved\" - actual revenue.\nCost: ~$50-100/month (n8n + Twilio + AI API)\n2. Context-Aware Routing (Not Just Speed)\nYour observation that \"we respond to tickets faster but customers aren't happier\" is telling. Speed without intelligence is just fast noise.\nWhat works: AI classifies urgency AND intent, high-value leads get immediate human attention, low-value gets automated nurture. Your team stops wasting time on tire-kickers and focuses on closeable deals.\n3. Behavior-Triggered Follow-Up\n\"CRM updates automatically but deals aren't closing faster\" = CRM is updated, but nobody's acting on it.\nInstead of arbitrary \"day 3 check-in\" sequences, trigger based on behavior:\nNo response in 48 hours → different approach\nOpened email 3x but didn't reply → phone call\nVisited pricing page → sales gets alert NOW\nThis 2-3x close rates on existing pipeline because you're reaching people at decision moments.\n4. Alerts, Not Reports\n\"Generating reports nobody reads in half the time\" - reports answer questions nobody asked.\nSwitch to alerts:\n\"Deal stalled 2 weeks\" → notification to owner\n\"Customer mentioned competitor\" → escalation\n\"Unusual pattern detected\" → investigation\nInformation delivered at the moment someone can act on it, not filed in a folder.\nThe Framework\nAutomate:\nRevenue-adjacent touchpoints (lead response, follow-up, conversion moments)\nPattern detection humans miss (sentiment shifts, churn signals)\nSpeed-sensitive actions where timing matters\nIntelligence routing (right person to right problem)\nDon't Automate:\nReports for reporting's sake\nData entry disconnected from decisions\n\"Productivity\" metrics measuring motion not progress\nTasks that give people information they won't act on\nHow to Measure It\nStop tracking \"time saved\" and start tracking:\nLead-to-qualified conversion rate\nAverage deal velocity (days from first touch to close)\nResponse time on high-intent actions\nRevenue per lead source\nIf automation improved something and revenue didn't move, you automated the wrong thing.\nThe 10x productivity claim isn't wrong - it's just that most people apply it to busywork instead of revenue. You correctly identified that. Now point it at the stuff that actually matters.",

      "text": "There is a massive amount of \"he-said, she-said\" in this sub about building a SaaS on top of n8n. Some people say you need to cough up for an Embed license the second you charge a customer. Others say you can do whatever you want if you self-host.\n\n\n\nBoth are wrong.\n\nI’ve been digging through the official forums and specifically looking at replies from Jan (n8n founder) to clarify the Sustainable Use License (SUL). If you’re building a product, here is the playbook to stay legal and avoid a surprise bill.\n\n# The \"Whose Credentials\" Rule\n\nThe single most important factor is whose API keys n8n is using. Jan’s logic follows a \"Chef\" analogy:\n\nThe Green Zone (Standard SUL)\n\nThe Chef (n8n) uses the restaurant’s ingredients (Your company’s API keys) to cook a meal and hands it to the waiter (Your Frontend).\n\n* **The Model:** Your SaaS acts as a service provider. You use your OpenAI key or your SendGrid key to process a request and return a result.\n* **Identity:** It doesn’t matter if your users \"Login with Google\" to your app. As long as those user tokens aren't being passed into n8n nodes to act on their behalf, you are 100% fine.\n\nThe Red Zone (Embed License Required)\n\nThe Chef asks the customer for their house keys (User OAuth Tokens), drives to their home, and cooks in their personal kitchen.\n\n* **The Model:** If your SaaS \"manages the user's inbox\" or \"posts to the user's Twitter\" by putting their credentials into an n8n node, you need a commercial agreement.\n* **The Loophole:** You cannot bypass this by using a generic HTTP Request node to send user tokens. Jan was clear: if n8n connects to a user’s service at runtime, it’s a restricted use case.\n\n# The \"External Connection\" Strategy (The Workaround)\n\nThis is how you build a powerful SaaS without needing the Embed license immediately. You handle the \"connection\" layer outside of n8n.\n\n**The Architecture:**\n\n1. **App Side:** Your custom code handles OAuth and stores the tokens.\n2. **The Handover:** Your app fetches the data (the email text, the lead info) and sends **only the raw data** to an n8n webhook.\n3. **Processing:** n8n does the logic/AI and returns the result to your app.\n4. **Execution:** Your app (not n8n) uses the user’s token to push the final action.\n\nBecause n8n never \"leaves the restaurant\" to touch the user's account directly, this counts as internal processing.\n\n# The Roadmap (Q1 2026)\n\nJan recently mentioned they are working on a shift for Q1 2026. The goal is to allow Enterprise licenses to cover these multi-user credential cases, as long as you aren’t white-labeling the n8n UI.\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\n* **MVPs:** You’re allowed to test and build.\n* **Public Launch:** If n8n touches user keys, call Sales.\n* **Data Processing:** If n8n uses your keys or just processes data your app fetches, you’re good to go.\n\nAll of this is pulled from Jan’s direct replies on the forums. Stop guessing and build the right architecture from day one.",

Keep it simple.”\n\nFor the **text**, I usually generate it separately (I use Claude, but anything works):  \n– describe the workflow  \n– focus on the user problem  \n– keep it short\n\nThen I paste that content back into Gemini and ask it to fill the site.\n\n# Hosting\n\nSince it’s just static files, I host it using **DigitalOcean App Platform**:  \n– push files to GitHub  \n– connect repo to App Platform  \n– site goes live\n\nNo servers, no droplets.\n\nIf I want to change anything later, I just edit the GitHub files and it auto-updates.\n\n# Why I like this approach\n\n• fast  \n• no frontend stress  \n• good enough for sharing or validation  \n• works well with n8n-style tools\n\nI made a short video showing this flow end-to-end, but honestly the steps above are the whole thing.\n\n And here is a link to the video if you'd like a more in-depth tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuXuqXCIsA)\n\nIf anyone here is doing something similar (or better), I’d like to know how you handle landing pages for n8n projects.\n\nPS: English isn't my first language, so I've used ChatGPT to polish this post and write it professionally.",

Based on what I’d read earlier, GitHub Pages is great for static sites, but I wasn’t fully confident about performance under ad-driven traffic spikes, especially in terms of speed, load handling, and auto-scaling.\n\nWith DigitalOcean, I get peace of mind around traffic surges, auto-balancing, and predictable performance when ads suddenly push a lot of users to the page.\n\nThat said, if GitHub Pages can handle high traffic reliably with good performance (especially via CDN), I’m absolutely open to using it. In fact, I’m planning to give GitHub Pages a proper try this weekend and test it under real conditions.\n\nAlways happy to optimize for simpler and cheaper setups if they genuinely hold up in production.",

A while back I use it as a free hosting platform, basically GitHub would sync a local folder on my pc with a GitHub repository, then next time someone would access that page, it would see the latest uploaded version. This like in your suggestion becomes the front end, and n8n would then be the backend, responding to , for example , a form submission or a button press.\nI was already testing something like this, will be following my own suggestion, thanks for the inspiration!",

Actually, this tutorial focuses on creating a landing page to showcase your n8n workflows rather than integrating directly with n8n itself.\n\nThe landing page is generated using Gemini and hosted on DigitalOcean, which means it operates independently without requiring a direct n8n connection for the basic setup.\n\nIf you do need to connect to n8n, that would typically be for specific use cases like payment processing or user registration management. However, those integrations would be implemented on a case-by-case basis depending on your specific requirements.\n\nHope this clarifies things!",

      "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nMajor update on the n8n-autoscaling build - it's now fully compatible with n8n 2.0!\n\n[https://github.com/conor-is-my-name/n8n-autoscaling](https://github.com/conor-is-my-name/n8n-autoscaling)\n\n**What is this n8n-autoscaling?**\n\n* It's an extra performant version of n8n that runs in docker and allows for more simultaneous executions than the base build. Hundreds or more simultaneously depending on your hardware.\n* Includes Puppeteer, Postgres, FFmpeg, and Redis already installed for power users.\n* \\*Relatively\\* easy to install - my goal is that it's no harder to install than the regular version (but the Cloudflare security did add some extra steps).\n* Queue mode built in, web hooks set up for you, secure, automatically adds more workers, this build has all the pro level features.\n\n**Who is this n8n build for?**\n\n* Everyone from beginners to experts\n* Users who think they will ever need to run more than 10 executions at the same time\n\nSimply put, this is a FULL FEATURED pro level build, with as simple as it can be installation.  You just need to configure your passwords and secrets, that's it, everything else is done.\n\n**Why use this instead of the base n8n Docker image?**\n\nWhether you're just getting started or running n8n in production, this build gives you everything you need out of the box:\n\n**For beginners:**\n\n* One command install - just `docker compose up` and you're running\n* Cloudflare tunnel pre-configured - secure HTTPS access without messing with ports or SSL certs\n* No Kubernetes, no complex orchestration - just Docker Compose\n* Sensible defaults that just work\n* [Step-by-step setup guide in the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1l9mi6k/major_update_to_n8nautoscaling_build_step_by_step/)\n\n**For power users:**\n\n* **Queue mode enabled** \\- offload executions to workers instead of blocking the main instance\n* **Auto-scaling workers** \\- handles hundreds of simultaneous executions without manual intervention\n* **Puppeteer/Chromium built-in** \\- web scraping from Code nodes, way more reliable than community nodes\n* **Postgres with pgvector** \\- ready for AI/embeddings workflows\n* **Redis** \\- proper job queue for production workloads\n* **FFmpeg, GraphicsMagick, Git** \\- media processing and version control built in\n* **External npm packages** \\- AJV, moment, and easy to add your own\n\n**The big benefits over base n8n:**\n\n|Feature|Base n8n|This Build|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Simultaneous executions|10|Hundreds+|\n|Worker scaling|None/Manual|Automatic|\n|Puppeteer/Chromium|DIY setup|Pre-configured|\n|Queue mode|Manual config|Ready to go|\n|HTTPS/Security|DIY|Cloudflare tunnel included|\n|Task runners (2.0)|Manual setup|Pre-configured with sidecars|\n\nTested with hundreds of simultaneous executions on an 8-core 16GB VPS. The autoscaler watches your Redis queue and spins up/down workers automatically based on load.\n\n**What broke in n8n 2.0?**\n\nn8n 2.0 introduced a major breaking change - task runners (the things that execute your Code nodes) are now separate Docker containers running in \"external mode.\" This broke Puppeteer, broke libraries like AJV, and required a completely different architecture.\n\n**What's new in this update:**\n\n* **External task runners** \\- New `Dockerfile.runner` builds a custom task runner image with Chromium/Puppeteer pre-installed\n* **Sidecar architecture** \\- Each worker now gets its own task runner container (1:1 ratio)\n* **Autoscaler updated** \\- Scales workers AND their task runners together automatically\n* **Puppeteer working again** \\- Had to dig into the n8n source code for this one. The sandbox freezes prototypes by default which breaks puppeteer-core. Fixed with a custom `n8n-task-runners.json` config file.\n* **AJV and other packages** \\- Libraries that use `new Function()` now work (the default sandbox blocks this)\n\n**The technical details (for those curious):**\n\nThe n8n task runner sandbox has two security measures that break common packages:\n\n1. `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` \\- blocks `new Function()` which AJV and other software packages need\n2. Prototype freezing via `Object.freeze()` \\- breaks puppeteer's error handling\n\nThe fix is a custom `n8n-task-runners.json` config that gets copied into the runner image. You can also use this file to add your own npm packages.\n\n**Adding your own npm packages:**\n\n1. Edit `Dockerfile.runner` \\- add your package to the pnpm install\n2. Edit `n8n-task-runners.json` \\- add to `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`\n3. Rebuild: `docker compose build --no-cache n8n-task-runner n8n-worker-runner`\n\n**Quick start (same as before):**\n\n    git clone https://github.com/conor-is-my-name/n8n-autoscaling.git\n    cd n8n-autoscaling\n    cp .env.example .env\n    # Edit .env with your settings\n    docker network create shark\n    docker compose up -d --build\n\n**To update from the previous version:**\n\n    docker compose down\n    git pull\n    docker compose build --no-cache\n    docker compose up -d\n\nEverything else from the original post still applies - Cloudflare tunnels, Tailscale, Postgres, Redis, the whole setup. Just pull the latest and rebuild.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues!\n\nAs always, I do consulting both as a Fractional CFO and also AI and Automation Development. SF based, retainer preferred but happy to do one-off projects. Feel free to reach out.",

So depending on if your running 1x 4C or 4x 1C VMs you can attach block storage to the VMs for the excess storage. Multiple VMs can share this block storage. Just make sure its set it to the lowest performance to keep it free. Also, correct me if i am wrong but you can only resize up not down for block storage. So start small and increase the size as you go. Since, you may want to go from 1x VM to 2x. I have nginx reverse proxy, n8n, couple web servers, tailscale to connect to my lab at home, and so much more. Never got billed a cent. Btw, when your provisioning a VM it might say estimated cost of around $2.62/month or similar for the cost of the boot volume. As long as you stay below 200gb overall, you will not be charged. Feel free to DM me if you have any issues. Very great free service!",

If it needs something more I can host on the same VPS beside n8n in a docker compose stack without additional $$$ if the workers and pages route isnt the right fit. \n\nI have postgres for db on the same vps if required and typically this has been perfect for back office workflows as well as customer facing where I'm happy the volumes are relatively low. \n\nIf I need anything bigger than n8n ai nodes I'll switch those out for mastra.ai as I'm a js/ts guy. It handles workflows, multi-agent really well.\n\n\nOther notable parts to setup:\n\n- VPS with 0 access aside from my ssh cert and via Cloudflare tunnel between Cloudflare and the vps itself. \n\n- Cloudflare for waf, static pages, asset storage, workers etc\n\n- docker compose with docker for caddy/trafic, n8n, postgres and any server side apps like nuxt\n\n- Auth typically via clerk or workos I've used better auth a few times also but clerk was so simple to do I go there first.\n\n- Gitlab preferred as I'm dubious to GitHub pricing changes for private / client orgs and repos\n\n- Any vibe coding is through opencode and ohmyopencode Plugin. Preferred opus 4.5 for most work but I'll switch to codex or Gemini for the quicker front end work\n\n- Resend or brevo for mail. If it's just transactional I'll do resend but if the client wants to be involved I'll use Brevo as they often want to do marketing and use Brevo to sync from their other systems via n8n\n\n- Vite I'll use for even standard HTML apps as I can hot reload local, include tailwind if I want and bundle into a single output. This is ideal for Cloudflare pages too",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI got the idea for this side project because a friend of mine wants to start a business and needs to submit a proper business plan for banks and other institutions. He told me his biggest pain is not the writing itself, but not knowing where to start. There are tons of templates out there, but none that he can adapt directly to his idea without making major structural changes first. Most templates feel either too generic or too rigid.\n\nThat’s what triggered the idea of building an AI-powered business plan generator that creates a solid, structured first draft based on a small set of meaningful inputs. The goal is to give founders something they can immediately work with, refine and customize, instead of fighting a template.\n\nThe backend for the MVP is already mostly done and wired together. The current stack looks like this:\n\n* n8n as the backend orchestration layer for the MVP\n* Gemini for writing and structuring the individual business plan chapters\n* [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) for scraping competitor websites and similar businesses\n* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for early research and reasonable benchmark numbers\n* [Json2Doc](https://json2doc.com/) to generate the final output as PDF and DOCX with complex formatting, tables and charts\n* [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) to send the finished document to the user via email after generation\n\nThe product itself is meant to be simple from the user’s perspective. Users answer a short set of high-impact questions and receive a complete, editable business plan draft. Example inputs would be: Problem and target customer Core product or service Revenue model Key competitors Go-to-market approach High-level costs and growth goals\n\nWhat’s still missing: A simple and trustworthy step-based frontend Form (best case with integrated payment functionality) and a secure and maintainable overall setup\n\nHow would you approach the frontend and payments for something like this? And if you’ve created a business plan recently, I’d love to hear what was painful or what you wish a tool like this would do better.",

Honestly, I’d keep it even simpler for the first version  \n   \n\\- start with a robust **form builder** (like Typeform or Tally) and send the inputs to your n8n instance via **webhook**.   \n  \nOnce you’ve manually verified that the pipeline handles real-world data correctly, then you can invest the time into building a custom frontend and dedicated payment flow. It’s better to prove the backend works before over-engineering the UI.",

              "text": "gracias pero, mi Español no es bueno,\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ax7_QNZZ-pk?si=rPtpzJvr1sO23HzP\n\n\n TL;DR - [ English ] inglés transcript\n\n\nThis video explains how to create and deploy a free Artificial Intelligence (AI) API using Bun, a fast JavaScript runtime, and leverage the free tiers of various AI services like Grock and Cerebras (0:00). The goal is to build an extensible API that avoids subscription fees and credit card requirements.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:\n\n\nIntroduction to Free AI Services: The video highlights how to utilize the free tiers of services like Grock (up to 60 calls/minute) (0:29) and Cerebras (30 requests/minute) (0:45), as well as mentioning Gemini and Open Router for additional free access (0:50). The strategy is to combine these free tiers to extend overall usage (0:47-0:50).\n\n\nSetting up Bun: The first step involves installing Bun on your system, which is a straightforward command-line process (1:08-1:29). After installation, `bun init` is used to create a basic project structure (1:33-1:43).\n\n\nCreating a Basic API with Bun: The video demonstrates how to create a minimal API using `Bun.serve` to listen on a port (e.g., 3000) and respond to requests (1:58-2:32). It also covers setting up `package.json` scripts for easy development and server restarting (3:13-3:25).\n\n\nDeploying the API to Production with Hostinger and Coolify: The creator uses Hostinger VPS (a sponsor) (3:39) and Coolify (4:15), an alternative to services like Vercel or Heroku, for deployment. The process involves installing Coolify on the VPS (4:25-5:03), configuring an `nixpacks.toml` file to guide Coolify on building the Bun project (6:04-6:40), and linking the GitHub repository for automatic deployment (6:42-7:08). The video demonstrates how to access the Coolify panel, connect a repository, and deploy the application (7:13-9:01), including tips on viewing deployment logs (9:04-9:54).\n\n\nIntegrating AI Services (Grock & Cerebras):\nGrock Integration: The video shows how to get an API key from Grock (11:57) and use its SDK to make chat requests (10:29-12:31). The code structure is then refactored to create a reusable `GrockService` function that adheres to a common `AIService` interface (12:38-16:02), utilizing async generator functions with `yield` for streaming responses (14:44-16:02).\nCerebras Integration: Similar to Grock, the process involves obtaining an API key from Cerebras (21:50-22:08) and integrating its SDK into a `CerebrasService` (22:08-23:14).\nImplementing Service Rotation: The core of the free tier strategy is implemented by creating a `get next service` function that cycles through the available AI services (Grock, Cerebras, etc.) using a round-robin approach (16:24-17:19). This ensures that requests are distributed among different services, maximizing the use of their free allowances.\n\n\nAPI Enhancements and Testing: The API is modified to handle POST requests to a `/chat` endpoint (17:21-18:40), streaming responses back to the client as the AI models generate them (18:41-20:07). The video demonstrates testing the API locally using `curl` and observing the service rotation in the console logs (19:31-24:05).\n\n\nConfiguring Environment Variables for Deployment: The API keys for Grock and Cerebras are added as environment variables in Coolify to securely manage credentials in production (25:05-26:02). A redeploy is then performed to apply these changes (25:39-25:45), and the deployed API is tested (26:32-27:10).\n\n\nThe video concludes by reiterating the benefits of building such an API for cost savings and flexibility in using various AI models (27:23-27:52), and encourages viewers to like and subscribe (28:17-28:29).",

These files contain simple descriptions for entities, people, areas, and acts as context for the AI.\n\nSo when I send a query the LLM references it against my Memory Index and follows the wikinks through to gain context. If the query requires device control it references the current states and outputs a Json command back to HA.\n\nIf it requires a Google Search it goes and does that for me in context to my home address if it needs that context.\n\nThere's also a file in the Memory folder containing the last 10 queries and summaries of all previous queries, so it gains context from those files too.\n\nNext step is ironing out a pet peeve of mine with current AI in HA, which is that I cannot ask about previous entity states. So I'm planning on adding files that contain updated past states of entities so I can ask for example how cold the house was last night or when my son left to catch the bus to school.\n\nShare your Json mate, it might help supercharge the development of my project.",

Technically it could just live in a couple of folders, but I like being able to edit the files on my phone in the app.\n\nWhen I started playing with it, the query went to a Gemini Node in N8n which directed it to the Cli but I didn't like having it going through Gemini twice, doubling the token count so I spent time removing the AI in N8n, then structured my files and promp in such a way so as to minimise the token count as much as possible.\n\nSo the idea of it building context when needed by going through the \"Memory\" index, increases the tokens needed, but only when the query requires it.",

          "text": "I can't tell from your SS, but you could add a condition or wait node to allow for multiple messages to be aggregated. This is important if the users talk to the bot in a conversational manner. For instance a small AI analysis node to determine if the user has likely finished his idea and hence a response should be crafted or if it should wait, aggregate the messages and then craft a response, this can save tokens and make the user experience much better. I implemented this with a time window where it checks for new messages after 30 secs before sending the prompt to the bot, it then either gets sent to a do nothing node or to the bot. So essentially only the last message executes the bot. A condition can also be set up like i said, with a timeout of course, that defaults to aggregating all pending messages.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI realized I was wasting way too much time scrolling through junk news sites and RSS feeds, so I decided to build a \"Personal AI Editor\" to filter the noise for me.\n\nThe goal was simple: **Only show me news that actually matters to my specific interests, and summarize it so I don't have to clickbait.**\n\nI built this using **n8n** (self-hosted), and I wanted to share the logic in case anyone else wants to clean up their information diet.\n\n**The Workflow Stack:**\n\n* **Orchestrator:** n8n\n* **Filtering:** OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini is cheap and fast for this)\n* **Research:** Tavily API (for searching/summarizing)\n* **Delivery:** Gmail (SMTP)\n\n**How it works (The Logic):**\n\n1. **Ingest:** The workflow pulls headlines from my favorite RSS feeds every morning.\n2. **The \"Editor\" Agent:** I send each headline to OpenAI with a prompt describing my specific interests (e.g., \"AI automation,\" \"Node.js updates,\" \"Local LLMs\"). The AI assigns a **relevance score (0-10)** to each item.\n3. **The Filter:** A simple `If` node drops anything with a score below 7.\n4. **The Deep Dive:** For the high-scoring items, I pass them to **Tavily**. It searches the web for that topic and writes a concise summary (so I don't have to visit the ad-filled news site).\n5. **The Delivery:** It compiles the summaries into a single email digest and sends it to me once a day.\n\n**One major headache I ran into:** I kept getting \"Connection Lost\" errors because the AI generation took too long. I learned (from reddit community only) you have to configure **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** or adjust the timeout settings in n8n/Node.js to keep the connection alive during long research tasks.\n\n**The Result:** Instead of checking 10 sites, I get 1 email with \\~5 items.\n\nI made a full video walkthrough explaining the setup and sharing the code if you want to build it yourself: (https://youtu.be/mOnbK6DuFhc). Its a low code approach, and prompts and code (JavaScript) is made available, along with the workflow JSON in git ([Git](https://github.com/sojojp-hue/NewsSummarizer))\n\nLet me know if you have questions about the prompt engineering or the SSE setup—happy to help!",

One of the most powerful things you can do when self-hosting is install whatever additional packages you want for javascript and python code nodes, or even run native libraries like ffmpeg.\n\nYou can also control max execution times and similar. I believe there are significant limits here in the cloud version. For example, workflows will timeout after like 45 minutes in the cloud version, with self-hosted you can literally have workflows run for weeks.\n\nOne could spend an hour listing the benefits of self-hosting. Although, it also comes at the tradeoff of, if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to be screwed if you don't set things up right or it breaks.",

Works until it doesn’t, especially at scale.\n\nIn practice I’ve seen teams keep flows like this usable by:\n\n* Treating LinkedIn as a discovery signal only, not a guaranteed source of emails/phones\n* Leaning more on enrichment APIs for contact data and using LinkedIn mainly to confirm role/company\n* Adding fallbacks so the workflow degrades gracefully when LinkedIn blocks or rate-limits\n\nCurious how stable this has been for you over time.",

Cutting 10–15 minutes down to sub-30 seconds per lead is a massive ROI win.\n\nA few questions / ideas that came to mind while reading it:\n\n* **Profile matching accuracy:** how are you handling edge cases with common names or multiple people at the same company? Are you using confidence scoring or fallback signals (location, title similarity, domain match)?\n* **Verification layer:** for emails and phone numbers, are you relying on a single source or doing cross-checks? I’ve seen accuracy jump a lot when combining enrichment + lightweight verification before pushing to CRM.\n* **Change detection:** do you re-enrich existing contacts periodically? Job changes and role drift can silently kill outbound performance if data isn’t refreshed.\n* **Compliance & rate limits:** how are you thinking about throttling and regional compliance (GDPR/opt-in signals), especially if this scales to batch mode?\n\nPotential improvements you might explore:\n\n* Adding a **confidence score per field** so sales can prioritize high-certainty leads\n* Flagging **partial vs fully enriched records** to trigger different outbound sequences\n* Tracking **false positives** (e.g., bounced emails) and feeding that back into the matching logic\n\nOverall, this feels like the kind of system that quietly becomes mission-critical once a team uses it for a week.\n\nCurious: what’s been the hardest part so far — profile discovery, data quality, or keeping everything in sync as volume grows?",

      "text": "I have been running an AI company for almost three years and despite media generation (image, videos and 3d models) was our main focus, we touched different areas since our small team was very diverse in terms of interests, focuses and expertise. \n\nI personally started taking n8n and the whole automation thing seriously in early 2025 and I will say, a good agentic system will sell much better in 2026, so do not lose hope. But there are some facts I think are worth sharing here about n8n. \n\n# Where it helps?\n\nIt's a question I always wanted to answer. My workflows usually were \"customer service automations\" or \"RAG Systems\", but let me give you best things we've ever done with n8n. \n\n* **Telegram Bots** (in general, bots in messengers). If you even developed one of those bots you know how much headache they can cause and n8n just made it much simple for me (and my team). I even recorded a whole course on automating Telegram with n8n, including channel and group management, customer support bots, RAG or even generic \"ChatGPT on Telegram\" thing. \n* **Synthetic Data**. I think one of my best works with n8n is building a flow to generate synthetic data for our small LLM which we've been developing. We've had a data problem and using OpenRouter's API, it became something fantastic. I am not exaggerating on how much time it saved us. We were asleep, it did the heavy lifting for me. \n* **Coding** (not typical $10K/Month BS, actual contribution on a codebase) was also a thing. Although I made it an independent agent later but it still is one best thing I tried. I will make a workflow like what I've done before and I will explain how will it work. It is not low code or no code at all, but it is worth a try. \n* **Market Analysis** (crypto, stock, precious metals, etc) is one big thing you can do. n8n is great at working with API's!\n\nAnd in addition to the above, it is useful for pretty much everything else. But there is one big question and it is... \n\n# Where it does not help?\n\nThere is one simple answer and this is *where you need to scale up constantly.* I don't care how great n8n was for me in past year, I still think if I need scalability, I need to do coding from scratch. \n\nHonestly, the scalability issue is not exclusive to n8n. *All no-code and low-code platforms* have the very same problem so if you want to make a \"business\" using them, keep in mind these are great *to be a part of a bigger picture* and *great to give you an MVP* so consider learning more than making flows using n8n. \n\nAt the end, happy new year 2026 to everyone and I hope your AAA's, flows and everything else work as expected for you.

      "text": "I’m getting seriously fed up with all these automation/AI gurus pushing the idea that AI agents are insanely in demand and that every business wants a chatbot talking to users on Telegram or WhatsApp.\n\nIn reality? That’s just not what I’m seeing.\n\nI’ve worked with 14 clients using n8n, and only ONE of them actually asked for an AI agent. And even then, it was more curiosity than a real business need.\n\nNobody is excited to:\n\nBook meetings through a Telegram bot\n\nReplace simple forms with “AI conversations”\n\nAdd complexity where a Calendly link or form already works perfectly\n\nThere are way easier, cheaper, and more convenient solutions for 90% of the use cases being hyped on Twitter/YouTube.\n\nn8n is first and foremost an automation tool, not an “AI agent factory”.\n\nIts real power is:\n\nConnecting broken systems\n\nAutomating workflows that don’t already have a clean solution\n\nEliminating boring manual processes\n\nHandling edge cases that SaaS tools don’t cover\n\nSlapping “AI” on top of everything is, in my opinion, a bad approach. Businesses don’t buy AI. They buy solutions to annoying problems.\n\nIf a problem is already solved well with:\n\nForms\n\nCRMs\n\nWebhooks\n\nSimple automations\n\nThen forcing an AI agent into it just makes it worse.\n\nI’m far from an n8n expert, so maybe I’m wrong — but from real client work, the demand is clearly for solid automation, not fancy AI buzzwords.\n\nFocus on problems that don’t have an easy solution.\n\nThat’s where n8n actually shines.\n\nCurious if others here are seeing the same thing or if my experience is just an outlier.",

You’re right, forcing AI where it doesn't belong is just bad engineering.\n\nHowever, I look at n8n as the **'Visual Backend'** for the next decade. Whether you're building a simple CRM sync or a complex agent, n8n is essentially the nervous system that connects everything. The reason it’s the 'bomb' is that it handles the plumbing that makes *any* logic, AI or not, actually work.\n\nI think we are currently in the **'Messy Middle'** of a massive transition:\n\n* **Past:** Simple, linear automation (If this, then that).\n* **Present:** Solving 'annoying problems' with broken systems (The solid work you’re doing now).\n* **Future:** Autonomous tasks where a virtual assistant performs digital work on your behalf.\n\nWe’re in the 'electricity' phase. When it first came out, people were skeptical and 'knocker-ups' still had jobs waking people up. Some chose to stay in the dark, but the tech evolved regardless.\n\nThe 'AI Agents' of the future won't be annoying WhatsApp bots; they will be **Local/Sovereign AI**. We're moving toward tailor-made, open-source assistants running locally that have access to knowledge a business simply couldn't offer otherwise.\n\nn8n is the best tool to bridge that gap. We can stand out by not just 'slapping AI on things,' but by using n8n to segregate all these scattered platforms into one unified, intelligent system. You're right that businesses buy solutions, but soon, the best solutions will be the ones that can think and act across all their tools simultaneously.",

I can't see how you can be doing that, while at the same time building an influencer/ content business (which is also hard and requires a lot of time effort).",

So I automated the entire thing.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI scrape leads from Apollo, upload the CSV to Google Sheets, hit execute, and the workflow does everything else – LinkedIn profile scraping, web research, AI-powered message generation, and uploading enriched leads to my outreach tool.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls contact data from Google Sheets (Apollo exports)\n\n\\* Scrapes full LinkedIn profile data for each prospect\n\n\\* Runs AI web research to find recent company news, achievements, and unique details\n\n\\* Generates personalized icebreakers using company intel and natural language processing\n\n\\* Uploads enriched leads with custom messaging variables to your outreach platform\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 5-10 minutes per lead now happens automatically in seconds. I can process hundreds of prospects while focusing on actual conversations.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: Apollo CSV with 50 prospects from healthcare tech companies\n\n\\- Results: 50 fully enriched leads in \\~8 minutes. Each gets LinkedIn data (job title, company info, profile details) + AI-researched background (recent funding, product launches, hiring trends) + personalized icebreaker message\n\n\\- Output: \"Love what you're doing with \\[Company\\], especially \\[unique detail we found\\]. Wanted to reach out.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The two-phase approach:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Data Enrichment\\*\\* – LinkedIn scraping + AI web research runs in parallel to gather maximum context\n\n2. \\*\\*AI Personalization\\*\\* – Combines all enriched data to generate natural, specific icebreakers that reference real company achievements\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams doing B2B outreach at scale\n\n\\* Recruiters personalizing candidate outreach with company research\n\n\\* Marketing agencies prospecting new clients with tailored messaging\n\n\\* Founders doing partnership outreach with contextual ice breakers\n\n\\* Anyone who needs to research + personalize cold emails without the manual work\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable – I've tested it with 200+ leads in a single run without issues.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow7701.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow7701.json)",

Once a tracking number is added and a “ready” flag is set, we want the automation to:\n\n* Pull order, product, and client details from the sheet\n* Check if the tracking number is live (via carrier APIs)\n* Calculate the shipping ETA (carrier-based or fallback if not live)\n* Pull a weather forecast for the delivery date/location\n* Generate a personalized review prompt using OpenAI\n* Compile a beautiful branded email using Supermail\n* Send the email to the client\n* Log the activity in another sheet\n* Handle delays (e.g., if tracking doesn’t go live within 12 hours, alert a production rep)\n\nWe want this to run efficiently and cleanly, with smart conditional logic and fallback paths.\n\n**Required Developer Skills**\n\nThe ideal developer should have:\n\nn8n experience — building multi-node, conditional workflows using expressions, IF nodes, Set nodes, and branching logic\n\n Google Sheets integration — reading from, filtering, and updating rows\n\n HTTP Request node knowledge — working with APIs (GET, POST, auth headers, etc.)\n\n Experience with OpenAI API — using ChatGPT to generate dynamic content\n\n Supermail or Gmail integration — for sending branded emails with dynamic variables\n\n Good JavaScript skills — for using Function nodes and expression-based logic\n\n Basic familiarity with carrier APIs (FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL) or willingness to use alternatives (e.g., ShipEngine, EasyPost)\n\n Workflow structuring best practices — modular, readable, and expandable logic\n\n**Tools & Services They’ll Work With**\n\n* n8n (self-hosted or cloud)\n* Google Sheets (trigger + data source)\n* Google Drive (image storage)\n* Supermail (or Gmail SMTP)\n* OpenAI API (for generating review prompts)\n* OpenWeather API (forecast for ETA date/location)\n* Optional: Carrier APIs or API aggregators like ShipEngine\n\n**Core Workflow to Build (Shipping Notification Flow)**\n\n1. Trigger: A tracking number is added & a “Ready” flag is set in the sheet\n2. Lookup: Supplier + product → shipping origin ZIP (from a separate sheet tab)\n3. Tracking status check: \n   * If live: get ETA from carrier API\n   * If not: calculate fallback ETA using distance + business days\n4. Weather API call: Forecast at delivery ZIP on ETA date\n5. ChatGPT call: Generate a review request message based on product/client info\n6. Compose branded email (with product image, ETA, weather, etc.)\n7. Send email via Supermail\n8. Log notification to sheet\n9. If tracking was not live: check again after 12 hours; if still not live, send alert to production rep\n\n**Optional Experience (Bonus)**\n\n* Familiarity with Git (for versioning workflows)\n* Experience building reusable modules in n8n\n* Comfort documenting workflows for handoff or training\n\n  \n**Requirements:** Share your n8n experience/examples and rates. Start ASAP.\n\nNo agencies. Direct applicants only. Please reach out to [jay@merchclub.com](mailto:jay@merchclub.com) if interested!\n\n",

This doesn’t.\n\n* **Dynamic dropdowns** for accounts, zones, workers, KV namespaces, etc.\n* Resources **auto-load** from your Cloudflare account\n* No copy-pasting IDs\n* Far fewer config footguns\n\nIt’s designed for people who actually automate infra, not demo workflows.\n\n# Goal\n\n**Full infra-automation inside n8n.**\n\n* Deploy Workers\n* Manage security rules\n* Update DNS\n* Pull analytics\n* Orchestrate Cloudflare infra from a single workflow\n\nIt’s still **beta**, but already very usable.

Because of that, it’s built on top of the **official Cloudflare TypeScript SDK**, not brittle hardcoded endpoints - which should mean **significantly fewer errors** over time compared to other community nodes. plus we plan to release with them a special node replacing \"n8n imap node\" with \"**Cloudflare MailHook**\" i believe once this one done you will have another reason to use this node package; however it is not released yet just don't have time for now but it's on to-do.\n\n**Repo (again):**  \n[https://github.com/Automations-Project/n8n-nodes-cloudflare](https://github.com/Automations-Project/n8n-nodes-cloudflare)\n\nNPM:  \n[n8n-nodes-cloudflare - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-cloudflare)\n\nIssues/Feature requests:  \n[Issues · Automations-Project/n8n-nodes-cloudflare](https://github.com/Automations-Project/n8n-nodes-cloudflare/issues)",

I am also a backend dev and this is what threw me off: price, accordying to their policies, if you earn any money through any kind of sales, you gotta speak with n8n sales and they charge a lot. Concurrency, idk how it is on better tiers, but on the free one it was terrible. Also the building blocks, i have 16gb of ram (i know its the bare minimum today) and had to run it on a box or all my comouter grinded to a halt. Leave n8n for people who have no technical background or really small tasks, but never for production. Me personally, I would give maybe chatgpt the json with all the nodes (or section by section if too big) and ask it to formulate a plan pr do it directly in cursor/antigravity by hsving the file in a workspace. Great that you wanna lower costs, and great that you wanna ride this wave which is not in the end yet, but differentiate yourself from the rest that can code and buold with proven tools, where you can add security, logging, idempotencd and the like without so much hassle and later keep growing and expanding without having your future devs (if it gets to that) having to scramble around the spaghetti that n8n can become. Dont get me wrong, its a fun and interesting little tool, but I think there are much better alternatives if you have programming experience (and now 10x it with the correct llms)\n\nEdit: you mean you wanna copy and paste (create a new workflow) for each new user? That already seems like overhead and technical debt. It would be much better to have your program containeraized and allow for customization for each user",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI really want to start learning n8n, but honestly I’m feeling super overwhelmed and don’t know where to begin.\n\nThere are so many courses out there — some of them are like 8+ hours long — and at the same time, the official n8n course on their website looks really short, which makes me confused about what’s actually enough to get started.\n\nOn top of that, when I see workflows with APIs, JSON, and all the data mapping, it just feels like a lot at once. I really want to start badly, but I don’t know what the right entry point is or what I should focus on first without burning out.\n\nFor those of you who learned n8n:\n\n\t•\tWhere did you start?\n\n\t•\tDid you already know APIs/JSON, or did you learn them along the way?\n\n\t•\tAny beginner-friendly resources or a simple roadmap you’d recommend?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

Start with the official n8n course to learn the interface, then grab a template from their library and modify it for something you actually need. The fastest way to learn is just building workflows for real tasks, even if they're simple at first.\n\nOnce you've got the basics down, level up by learning how data flows between nodes, understanding when to use code nodes versus built-in functions, and practicing error handling. The mistake most beginners make is jumping into complex API integrations and JSON manipulation when we really just need to understand how to connect services and pass data between them first.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into agentic workflows, learning how to chain AI calls together using n8n is where things get really powerful.

If not available, client gives me credentials through a password manager (1Password or similar), never email.

They change something in their store or add a new app and the workflow breaks. Then they blame me even though it's their change that caused it. Now I include basic maintenance/monitoring in ongoing pricing.\n\nAlways separate workflows per client. Their business logic is different, their tools are different, their data needs to stay isolated. Building one app for multiple clients sounds efficient until one client needs a custom change and you break everyone else's stuff.\n\nReal advice - don't optimize for your convenience, optimize for client trust and data security.

I wanted to share my first **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** setup.\n\n**The Problem:** I wanted an AI agent that doesn't \"hallucinate\" and actually knows my specific business data. **The Solution:** A flow that connects my documents to a vector database.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Data Ingestion:** I can upload files via a form or just drop them into a specific **Google Drive** folder.\n2. **Vectorization:** n8n takes the files, chunks the text, and stores them in a Vector Store (acting as the AI's long-term memory).\n3. **The Agent:** When I ask a question, the agent searches this database first to provide an accurate, fact-based response.\n\n**Why this matters for business:** Imagine automated customer support that actually reads your latest PDFs or an internal tool that knows every contract detail without a human having to search for it. It's a game changer for productivity.\n\nI've attached a short video of the workflow in action.\n\n**I'm curious:** Are you guys using n8n for RAG? What vector databases are you finding the most stable for production?\n\nHappy to share more details if anyone is interested!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbe3po/video/pte0t8h1u0dg1/player\n\n",

                  "text": "Yeah - I am a runner so it's basically a run coach, the first iteration was running a local LLM on my Raspberry Pi. I have a hook that recognizes when I complete a new run (when it is uploaded to strava), it downloads the data from my run (things like distance, heart rate, cadence, type of run etc.)\n\nThen it parses that data into a db, collects the past 10 runs and creates a prompt for the LLM asking it to review my run acting as my run coach. It knows my next race my goal time and running history. It evaluates my work, and sends the data to an old iMac I have that delivers the message to my phone via iMessage.\n\nThe local LLM was a bit \"dumb\" so ran multiple models and had them self correct (review this response along with this data to ensure the previous coach is not hallucinating etc...) Eventually though I decided to pay for Gemini 3, I got better results and found that the reviews weren't necessary (it costs literally less than a penny per run).\n\nhere is an example of a recent response\n\n>🏃‍♂️ PacerX Summary\n\n>🧠 Overview\n\n>A proficient aerobic maintenance run that effectively absorbed recent volume. While physiologically controlled (HR 133), you technically exceeded the prescribed pace cap (9:14 vs 9:20), indicating high freshness but a need for stricter discipline.\n\n>📊 Execution\n\n>• Physiological Cost: Excellent. Average HR of 133 bpm sits perfectly in your established aerobic baseline (comparable to yesterday's 132 bpm over 9.5 miles).\n\n>• Pace Discipline: 9:14/mi was 6 seconds faster than the 9:20/mi 'speed limit.' While the effort was easy, the instruction was a limit, not a target.\n\n>• Biomechanics: Cadence of 178 spm indicates excellent efficiency even at slower recovery speeds, minimizing impact forces.\n\n>📈 Trends\n\n>• Aerobic Stability: Your HR is remarkably consistent across distances (131 bpm for 17mi vs 133 bpm for 3mi), confirming a massive aerobic base for Tokyo.\n\n>• Cadence Consistency: You are maintaining a 172-184 spm range consistently outdoors, which is crucial for economy at your 8:35/mi goal pace.\n\n>• Volume Absorption: You are bouncing back well from long efforts (17mi on 12/20, 9.5mi on 12/27) without signs of cardiac drift or suppressed HR.\n\n>⚠️ Concerns\n\n>• Minor discipline alert: Consistently running 5-15 seconds faster than prescribed 'easy' limits (seen here and on 12/25) can subtly erode recovery capital needed for the Build Phase.\n\n>🛠️ Next Steps\n\n>• Practice Pace Suppression: For your next easy run, intentionally aim for 9:30/mi to prove you can control the effort mentally, not just physically.\n\n>• Shoe Discipline: The 'Zoom Fly 6' are fast shoes; ensure they aren't subconsciously pushing your pace on recovery days. Save the pop for tempo work.\n\n>• Focus Shift: You have recovered well; channel this banked freshness into hitting your specific marathon-pace intervals in the next key session.\n\n>🔥 Coach’s Note\n\n>The future isn't just written in the fast miles, iGoalie; it's secured in the disciplined ones.\n\nI've continued to tweak the prompt to improve it, but overall I'm very happy with the results. Next steps are going to be having it actually coach me (prescribe my next runs and send me calendar invites for when, how far and how fast to run.\n\nOn an interesting side note, when I do a gym workout, it actually picks that up too and I was surprised to find that it was able to interpret the data and provide interesting feedback with every limited data on how that work fits into my overall running goals",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI love n8n, but I kept hitting a wall when trying to use the HTTP Request node on sites that require complex logins (2FA, Cloudflare, etc.).\n\nI decided to fix it by building a custom node: n8n-nodes-agentauth.\n\nIt works by connecting to a local CLI tool that syncs your active, authenticated session from Chrome directly into your n8n workflow.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Run \\`pip install agentauth-py\\`\n2. Run \\`agent-auth grab github.com\\` (this syncs your active cookies to an encrypted local vault).\n3. Use the AgentAuth node in n8n to inject those cookies into your requests.\n\nWhy I built it:\n\nI wanted a \"set it and forget it\" way to keep my local workflows logged in. As long as you are logged in on Chrome, your n8n workflow is logged in too.\n\nLinks:\n\n\\- Node (npm): [https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-agentauth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-agentauth)\n\n\\- Source Code: [https://github.com/jacobgadek/n8n-nodes-agentauth](https://github.com/jacobgadek/n8n-nodes-agentauth)\n\nIt's fully open source. I'd love to hear if this helps anyone else struggling with session persistence!\n\n**Update (Jan 12): Remote / Headless Support Added (v0.2.2)** Based on the feedback in the comments, I realized many of you run n8n on a VPS or Docker where Chrome isn't installed.\n\nI just shipped a new feature to handle this:\n\n* You can now run `agent-auth export` on your local machine (where you are logged in).\n* Transfer the vault file to your server.\n* Run `agent-auth import` on the server.\n\nThis allows you to sync your authenticated session to headless environments easily.

In most real automations, 80–90% of failures come from sessions breaking, not the request logic.

So I built this n8n workflow to handle everything from enrichment to personalized messaging.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's what it does:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Pulls lead data from Google Sheets (uploaded from your lead source)\n\n\\* Enriches each LinkedIn profile with full company data, job titles, and contact details\n\n\\* Runs AI-powered web research to find recent company news, achievements, and unique talking points\n\n\\* Generates hyper-personalized icebreakers using GPT-4 (normalizes company names + creates custom opening lines)\n\n\\* Uploads enriched leads with custom variables directly to your email outreach tool\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The big win:\\*\\* What used to take 3-5 minutes per lead now runs completely hands-free. I can process 100+ leads with personalized messaging in under 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Example usage:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- Input: CSV of 50 leads from prospecting tool with LinkedIn URLs\n\n\\- Results: Each lead gets enriched with verified company data, job details, and recent news\n\n\\- AI generates unique icebreakers like: \"Love what you're doing with \\[Company\\], especially \\[specific recent achievement\\]. Wanted to reach out.\"\n\n\\- Everything uploads automatically with custom fields ready for your email sequence\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The two-phase enrichment approach:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*LinkedIn Profile Scraping\\*\\* – Pulls verified company names, job titles, contact info, and professional background\n\n2. \\*\\*AI Research Agent\\*\\* – Searches for recent company news, funding rounds, product launches, awards, or noteworthy achievements to personalize outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use cases:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Sales teams doing B2B outbound at scale\n\n\\* Recruiters personalizing candidate outreach\n\n\\* Agencies prospecting new clients with relevant context\n\n\\* Partnership teams connecting with warm, researched intros\n\n\n\nThe workflow is completely scalable \n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about the setup!\n\n\n\n\\*\\*GitHub:\\*\\* [https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8796.json](https://github.com/eliassaoe/n8nworkflows/blob/main/linkedin-workflow8796.json)",

In the project instructions, include things like:\n\"ALWAYS use n8n version 1.x\"\n\"Before suggesting a node, verify that it exists in your Notion documentation\"\n\"Don't use deprecated nodes like X, Y, Z\" (list the ones that have given you problems)\n2. The trick that works best for me: before asking him to create a complete flow, I ask him to first list the nodes he's going to use and confirm that they exist. This way, you catch the errors before he generates 50 faulty nodes.\n\n3. Be explicit about versions. Claude sometimes mixes n8n 0.x and 1.x syntax. At each prompt, remind him: \"I'm using n8n version [your version].\"\n\n4. Divide and conquer. Instead of asking for complete flows, ask for small blocks. A trigger + 2-3 nodes. Test it, it works, then move on to the next block.\n\nThe reality is that even with MCPs, Claude needs guidance. MCPs help, but they're not magic.",

Once I had this \"stack\" in place, building, updating, and maintaining workflows was dramatically easier and faster.  The [https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp) server is a fantastic tool, but it needed some helper information specific to the workflow patterns of the back-end application I'm building in my n8n-hosted cloud workspace.\n\nHere is a link to the document describing what my \"stack\" looks like and how it was built:  \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzVsBbGey792lw00Ulw6K-xGXfuvTsPtlXiLDp6dyqY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzVsBbGey792lw00Ulw6K-xGXfuvTsPtlXiLDp6dyqY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nFull Disclosure: After creating a similar comment on a similar thread, another Redditor recommended that I move to Claude Code to finalize my back-end application on n8n. I investigated the capabilities of Claude Code and made that transition two weeks ago. Claude Code uses much of the same material I built into my \"stack\" for Claude Desktop, but it also allows me to spawn sub-agents to run work directly on my n8n workflows and Supabase tables.",
