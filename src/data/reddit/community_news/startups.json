      "text": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

Ask them what portion of the $100k should be yours (since you, um, did the actual work). Let’s say you split it 50/50.\n\n* Offer them an opportunity to invest their portion (eg $50k) into your company.  What equity % should they get? This is a classic classic “early stage valuation” problem. The industry has a very standard way of doing this: a SAFE. It defers the valuation question until a later priced round, after the company has made some progress.\n\n* If they bicker, ask them what their expectation of the value of the company at this point is. They’ll be torn: if they make up a tiny number, then clearly their sales intro didn’t add that much value. If they say a huge number, then use that to compute the equity you offer them (again, based on the cash value of their proceeds from the deal they intro’d).\n\n* Inform them of some business basics:\n* sales commissions at the top end are like 10%. Maybe for a “got me off the ground” thing you could flex to 20%. But like, if you (or someone) hadn’t done the work, they could make a million intros and they’d still make $0. They should contemplate intro’ing the opportunity to a brick or a tree, and take 99% of the proceeds lol.\n* finders fees are typically in the 1% range\n* SAFEs are incredibly common for early stage. In fact, not doing a SAFE is weird, and generally only happens when there’s a mature team and mature investors and clear line of sight to multiple years of revenue and well-understood business model etc etc.\n\n\nSource: founder of multi-billion dollar software company",

          "text": "Oof, I'm sorry to hear this. There are some serious problems here, and none of them have anything to do with the arrangement you're trying to make. What I'm about to say may come as a shock, but I'm offering this as constructive criticism, and I hope you see this is a great opportunity for growth.\n\nFirst, based on your description, your cousin's fiancee is a narcissist. She ostensibly did you a favor and then, without any prior agreement, tried to leverage that favor as \"debt\" to be paid back with completely unrealistic payment demands. You, rightly, refused, and in response she tried to manipulate you with pity and then threatened punishment. Classic cluster-B personality disorder behavior, totally unacceptable.\n\nSecond, it's likely your cousin is a narcissist as well. Narcissists tend to attract each other, and he's arguing \"there's no way you don't agree with this\" for an updated offer (demand, really) that is only mildly more agreeable than the first, and still completely unrealistic. You're now living in fear of retribution if you don't go along. Threatening retribution for not agreeing to a business deal you don't want to partake in? That's how the mafia works. It's the complete opposite of loving, caring, and supportive family behavior.\n\nWhich brings me to the third item, you. You said it was your mistake not to arrange terms prior to the introduction. No, from a business perspective you did nothing wrong at all. If she wanted compensation for the introduction, it was *her* responsibility to ask for that in advance. The reason it feels like a mistake has nothing to do with business, and has everything do with family dynamics. You're now in fear of your family because you accepted what reasonably looked like a gracious favor. Your words: \"They would hold this over me forever.\"\n\nIt sounds like narcissism runs in your family, and it also sounds like you're a well-grounded person who's escaped it. (Good for you!) Growing up around narcissism sucks, man, and it's scarring for life. One thing it does is distort your perception of fairness, because you've been taught since childhood (through gaslighting) that it's your fault that other people behave irrationally. As a result you have a completely understandable and natural tendency to over-accommodate, and you've been manipulated to believe that's what's fair. It's good that you're questioning this.\n\nIf I'm right (or even close to right) I'd kindly suggest some self-work and therapy, because it appears you are vulnerable and unaware of your vulnerabilities. Left untreated, situations like this will keep coming up in your life. As someone who didn't figure this out until late in life, I can say it is *really* helpful to learn how to nip this in the bud at a young age.\n\nTurning back to your question, \"Am I being unreasonable?\" The answer is unfortunately yes, but not in the way you think. It's completely unreasonable for you to consider this business arrangement, and to consider going into business with these people. The fact that you are wavering demonstrates that you have diminished boundary setting abilities, no doubt due to a lifetime of exposure to emotionally abusive role models. \n\nI have the utmost compassion for you, the situation you're in, and how difficult it appears to navigate. You have the full support of this Internet stranger (and many others like me, it appears) in telling these people to go pound sand. You've been more than fair, *too* fair.\n\nI wish all the fortitude necessary to withstand the retribution you're being threatened with. Good luck!",

That combination will poison fundraising, hiring, and any exit, and it turns your company into a hostage situation.\n\nThe clean move is: don’t sign, and don’t “tweak” this document—reset to a referral/reseller agreement or walk. Your proposed structure is standard: separate companies, generous revenue share on sourced clients with a 24-month sunset per client, defined responsibilities to keep the top rate (and a step-down if they stop doing the work), and either party can terminate with 60–90 days notice—no equity, no anti-dilution, no change-of-control baggage. Send one final take-it-or-leave-it offer in that form; if they refuse, let the client go and execute your other channels. Short-term family discomfort beats long-term business handcuffs, and signing under pressure just guarantees future resentment and conflict anyway.",

They basically see you have a mini gold mine on your hands for growth potential and want to piggy back off your hard work.  20% lifetime residual is more than fair. I recently finalized an agreement with a new start up that developed a lead platform for commercial trucking insurance agencies. The offer is 30% on all clients until\nI hit 10k MRR then drops to 20%.  And it’s for lifetime residuals regardless if I stay long term or quit or released.  All I’m doing is onboarding agencies to sign on. I have 15+ years exp in the trucking space so I have all the contacts.  They’re doing all the updates and customer service.  This to me was more than fair as I know once signed up- very little hand holding afterwards. I just invoice what’s owed to me. Sounds to me this is the similar role she was trying to put herself in.  But being a lot more aggressive and having unreal demands.  Like others suggested- walk away entirely from her.  No matter what you agree too even if favorable to you; it will not end well. There will be resentment on her part and who knows what that can boil up to.  She just wants her ego fed.  She wants the title of “company owner” or “cofounder”.  If the product is that good just promote yourself or hire an experienced salesperson to pitch it.",

You’re talking about paying this person forever and having to listen to what they think/say/want. You don’t agree now, that won’t change. Do NOT get into an enduring business relationship with them.  If you must, send them a generous commission check and a 1099 to document the expense off of the initial contract. The rest and any ongoing relationship with the client is yours. And, for sure, any “revenue split” (still a bad idea) should occur after you’ve recouped your expenses and time and should not be based on the gross revenue.\n\nMaybe demand a revenue split and minor equity in A’s insurance business for you to sign up with them as your insurance agent and for any clients you may send her way. See if she would agree to a similar arrangement.\n\n\nFor an early business startup a lot of your clients will come in via personal connections and referrals.

(My comment has nothing against anything that you’ve said - I’m simply giving you a blunt perspective to reflect upon from my own experience.)\n\nIf this is your first business, it may be worth while to give up a bit more to gain experience. Programming and product design are only one of many skill sets required to run a business. (Again, I’ve learned the hard way.)\n\nNow I’d rather bring in people who can add value in areas that I struggle with. It means less for me but I build out a team, a team of people who I can leverage to build future businesses, products or services with.\n\nPut aside the inexperience of yourself and your cousins, try and collaborate and think together about what’s needed to make this business grow. People can get petty when they are inexperienced in business and fail to see the bigger picture. First businesses tend to be learning experiences - the chance of hitting it big on your first go is rare, and more often people fail and go back to work or fail multiple times and give up. Each failure brings experience (or it should at least…) giving you an education which is difficult to obtain by going to school. (School can help no doubt, MBA’s exist for a reason.)\n\nI do agree that it seems there’s immaturity in your cousins and it may be best long term to not continue ventures with them but I’ll play devils advocate.\n\nBest of luck.",

SMB insurance has a big enough TAM and you’ve somewhat begun to validate your solution.\n3) she copies your solution by paying someone else to build it for her and you compete against her.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality: software is getting commoditized fast. With AI tooling, rebuilding what you described isn’t a multi-year moat anymore (of course I don’t know what you actually built). In vertical SMB markets, distribution and trusted relationships can be more defensible than the code itself.\n\nIf you believe you can own GTM and build that distribution independently, cut bait and don’t mix business with family.

In her head it’s her business and you agreed to help, and you essentially stole the business idea and now suggest to “hire” her.\n\nIf you go back in time and imagine you are before she shared the idea, before writing the software and all the intros, what would you agree on? \n\nYeah it’s really bad that you didn’t discuss the terms beforehand.

That second problem is something I identified entirely on my own because it’s essentially what I do at my day job in a different industry. Nobody involved would have the aptitude to solve that second problem without niche industry experience that I happen to have. On top of that, the product also replaces an extremely outdated piece of software they’re currently paying for, which is also something I identified independently.\n\nShe saw one problem. I saw an entire product. Two of the three core value propositions came from me, not from her.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Regardless, I wouldn’t have arrived to my solution without her.\n\nBut you and the rest of the commenters are right, theres seemingly no solution here.

Do 10-20 in one sitting when you're in the right headspace, then go back to building. Don't try to alternate between the two all day.",

Distribution feels scary because the feedback is delayed and personal (someone might say no, or worse, ignore you).\n\n  \nWhat helped: I started treating distribution like a build problem. Instead of \"I need to reach out to people\" (scary, vague), I'd break it into tiny mechanical steps. Write one message. Send it. Write another. No thinking about outcomes, just executing the process. Same way you'd write a function, test it, move on.\n\n  \nThe other thing -- the discomfort never fully goes away, but it does get boring. After enough cold outreach or posts that flop, your nervous system just stops caring as much. The first 20 are brutal. After 100 it's just Tuesday.\n\n  \nOne more thing that made a huge difference: I stopped trying to sell in outreach and started asking questions instead. \"Hey, I'm building X, can I get your take on this?\" People love giving advice. It takes all the pressure off because you're genuinely learning, not performing. And weirdly, those conversations convert way better than any pitch.",

And curiosity isn't draining the way pitching is.\n\n2. **The 10-minute rule** - you don't need to do 4 hours of outreach. You need 10 minutes, 5 days a week. That's 5 conversations. After a month, you've talked to 100+ people. Compounding applies to relationships too.\n\n3. **Build IN distribution channels** - instead of building then distributing, build WHERE your customers already are. Answer questions on Reddit. Comment on LinkedIn posts. Share your process publicly. The building IS the distribution.\n\n4. **The uncomfortable truth** - nobody cares about your product as much as you do. And that's okay. They care about their problem. When you lead with \"here's how I can help with YOUR problem\" instead of \"here's what I built,\" the emotional dynamic completely changes.\n\nWhat are you building?

Also, early stage teams vary a lot in how they think about this. In practice, if you do not close the loop with real users early, you can end up optimizing something elegant that never ships.

Every SaaS runs on AWS or GCP. Every payment startup runs on Stripe. Nobody calls Shopify a Stripe wrapper.\n\n  \nThe reason most wrapper startups died is they were literally just reskinned API access. The model was the product. When OpenAI made ChatGPT better, the wrapper became pointless. That is a real pattern and it will repeat.\n\n  \nBut agent platforms are doing something slightly different. The value proposition is not access to the model, it is the orchestration layer. Managing context across files, handling errors, running multi-step workflows, keeping state between sessions. That stuff is genuinely hard and the model providers have zero incentive to solve it for every niche use case.\n\n  \nThe ones that will die are the ones where the whole pitch is we put Claude in a browser tab. The ones that might survive are the ones building real workflow tools where the model is an ingredient, not the product.\n\n  \nSame pattern as mobile apps in 2010. Thousands of flashlight apps died. The ones that solved real workflow problems on top of the phone hardware became actual businesses.\n\n  \nSo yeah, some of these are wrappers 2.0. But not all of them. The trick is figuring out which ones actually have a workflow moat vs which ones are just banking on setup friction that will disappear in 6 months.",

When I was building my first real venture after a previous failure, I had to get ruthless about separating execution days from strategy days. Like literally on my calendar - Mondays and Fridays were for thinking/planning, Tuesday through Thursday were pure execution mode where questioning the direction was off limits. It sounds rigid but it saved me from that constant mental ping pong between doing and doubting. The other game changer was shrinking my validation timeline - instead of waiting for a \"finished\" product, I started testing core assumptions way earlier with basic prototypes and landing pages. Even getting 10 people to sign up for a waitlist or pay a small pre-order gave me enough signal to quiet that revenue anxiety. The key was making the feedback loop as short as possible, so I wasn't operating in a complete vacuum for months. Also learned to track leading indicators instead of just obsessing over the big outcome - like daily progress on features, weekly user interviews, monthly prototype tests. Gave my brain something concrete to focus on instead of spiraling about hypothetical futures.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.\n\n",

I stopped calling it a launch and started calling it a test. A test can fail and that is fine. A launch feels permanent.\n\n  \n2. I got 3 people to pay me before the product was done. Not a waitlist, actual money (even small amounts). Having someone pay $20 for early access gave me more confidence than 6 months of building alone ever did. It also forced me to talk to real humans which broke the isolation spiral.\n\n  \n3. I set a hard rule: no thinking about the business after 7pm. Sounds impossible but the anxiety feeds on rumination. When I cut the rumination window, the anxiety dropped way more than I expected.\n\n  \nThe overthinking you are describing is not a focus problem. It is a feedback problem. You have zero signal from the real world so your brain fills the gap with worst case scenarios. The fastest fix is getting any signal at all, even negative signal, because at least then you are reacting to reality instead of imagined futures.",

It doesn't seem that you learned too much with each release or didn't went through all the phases, or did you?

(ex. people are scrolling though your app but not clicking. you can try to improve icon/screenshots/title/subtitle. people don't even see your app: keywords and text may help you on that)\n\n\\- for a reason to create another app is more if you have some opportunity to chase AND if you can leverage and improve upon your previous app, not just about developing fast. if you first app didn't sell anything but you have an idea on how to do it. try a second. if the second didn't reach the 100 sales but you learned something and know how to improve. you go for the next app.\n\n\\- one last thing. you already have 8 apps. from my point of view you have a lot of space to work on. for me feels easy to try to create one screenshot for one, add one content into another then to create an entire app and go through all these apps from 0 again.",

The throwaway stuff accidentally hits something more universal.\n\n$123 MRR after 10 months with pure organic is progress, just not exciting progress. The real question is whether you know why those quick apps worked and your main one didn't.\n\nHave you actually talked to users of the apps that made money? Like real conversations about what problem they thought they were solving? That matters way more than another launch right now.\n\nAlso might be worth monitoring where people are actually talking about the problems your apps solve. I've seen some folks use tools like hazelbase to find those conversations on reddit and twitter, figure out what pain points keep coming up. Could help you understand what's resonating vs what's not before you build the next thing.\n\nAnd yeah, some founders go years without revenue but they're usually funded or have other income.

That almost never works early on because you’re paying for reach you can’t convert yet. What works better on a tight budget is getting smaller creators who actually use your product to post about it consistently. 10-20 creators talking about you regularly will outperform one big influencer post every single time and the effect compounds over time.\n\nThe timing question is less about stage and more about whether people actually like what you’re building. You said decent feedback and steady growth, that’s enough. You don’t need everything perfectly locked in to start. The real risk isn’t starting too early, it’s overpaying for the wrong creator and then writing off the whole channel based on one bad experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The trick is not trying to freeze them into something permanent, but giving yourself a structure that helps you decide what matters right now.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is treating strategy as a lightweight decision filter rather than a roadmap you must defend. Write it down not to be right, but so you can notice when new information actually changes the underlying assumptions versus when it’s just noise. That way, when an email from a prospect shows up, you can ask “does this invalidate our current bet, or is it just one data point?”\n\nThe fact that you’re already capturing where you are, where you’re aiming, and why in something shareable is honestly the hard part.

          "text": "This is an area where many businesses fail, because they chase features that they think excite the target customer but for which these customers wont pay.\n\nYou have two types of features.\n\n1. Features that solve the problems for your target market. As an example, if you were selling an accounting system to customers than ran US only businesses like an ETSY account, the features you need are simple. Tracking income and expenses. You would not then proceed to add support for multiple currencies. Multiple currencies are only needed if you plan to expand your addressable market, i.e., people that sell internationally. So first lesson, understand your target customers and the problems they need solved that they are willing to pay for. Only add features that specifically add value for teh customer and that they are willing to pay for.\n2. Once you have identified the required features for your target market, and you have delivered them, you need to figure out how to grow your market share. You do that, not by adding more cool stuff but by asking how can I improve my customer experience. If we go back to accounting for US businesses that might be, the ability to connect with the business bank account and automatically download and match income and expenses, or even a feature that simplifies expense tracking.\n\nSo ask yourself what am I trying to do\n\nI am trying to grow my market share within my existing market - focus on customer experience  \nI am trying to expand my addressable market - solve the problems for these new target customers\n\nOne more thing. As you consider what features you want to ask, consider when you rank them, how they might improve margins, e.g., if I add this feature that will reduce my COGS by 10%, will that return more profit than a feature that increases my customers by 10%. Or even, if I spend money not on features but quality, will that expense reduce customer churn leading to longer term recurring revenue.\n\nEdit - A comment on strategy\n\nStrategy is\n\nWho is my target audience  \nWhat problems do they need solving  \nWhy will they buy from me and not my competition\n\nIf your strategy contains numbers (increase revenue by 10%, broaden our markey by 20%) it is not a strategy it is a strategic goal. Furthermore if it contains broad statements like - be the world leader in \\[insert industry here\\], it is not a strategy, it is an aspiration.",

Yes, I'd say that's practically a defining feature of startups, relatively speaking.\n\nBut your question is about regressions. \n\nRegressions are accepted as normal in some organizations (Facebook's infamous \"move fast and break things\"), and are considered significant failures in others (Stripe's [zero downtime](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations) comes to mind). \n\nThere are obviously tradeoffs to both approaches--Facebook's users will tolerate bugs for neat features; Stripe's users will **not** tolerate losing money to downtime. \n\n**Regressions are a tech problem caused by a culture problem.** Every mistake is an opportunity to ensure your team never makes the same category of mistake again, but ensuring that the mistake never happens again takes a lot more work than fixing the bug and moving on. \n\nYou will need to accept that your team will move more slowly in the short term, and may have to completely stop adding new features for a while as they clear tech debt. Tech debt increases the chances that something will break in the future. \n\nBut again, this is a culture problem, because you are tolerating regressions, which follows tolerating bad practices. \n\nAI can help a lot. In my own workflow, I try to add automated test coverage as regressions happen to ensure every class of bug does not re-occur. \n\nAlso, you have developer**s**, plural, and no QA/QC staff? Catching this stuff is the job of a QA/QC person. Might consider making that your next hire before asking your devs to test their work more thoroughly. ",

Stop tracking work in a Google Sheet. Move to Linear or even just GitHub Issues. Sheets have no accountability trail, no status tracking, and things fall through the cracks constantly. A proper tool makes it obvious what is done, what is in progress, and what got skipped.\n\n  \n2. Require a screen recording with every delivery. Before they mark something done, they record a 2 min Loom showing it works. This alone cut my regression rate in half because they actually had to test it themselves before sending the video.\n\n  \n3. Define \"done\" explicitly. \"Done\" means it works on the main flow, does not break existing features, and has been tested on at least one real device or browser. If you do not define it, their version of done will always be different from yours.\n\n  \n4. On finding a technical cofounder, honestly the best way is to hang out where technical people already are. Contribute to open source discussions, go to local meetups, or post on places like YC cofounder matching. Cold outreach rarely works. People want to see you are serious about the problem before they commit.\n\n  \nThe stress does not fully go away but it gets way more manageable once you have a system.

VCs often look for some defensible advantage but might prioritize market potential and founder grit more in seed rounds.

Once you nail that, it will become obvious where they are and where they need to be. \n\nLet's go one by one of the channels you mentioned: \n\n1. Facebook. \n\nPaid Ads - these can be very expensive depending on the niche you're in. Generally this is one of the best ways to acquire customers, but huge downsides are that you need a hefty upfront investment. Meta Ads usually take a while before they start working since the algorithm needs to find the right customers for you. It generally takes the system from two to four months to learn who wants to buy from you, but that's just ballpark, it depends on a plethora of factors. \n\nFacebook Groups - answer questions, build relationships, promote after all that. This takes a lot of time, but it's the best if you don't want to spend money on ads. \n\n2. IG \n\nGreat for viral growth, but your content creation skills need to be exceptional. This takes time to master. Most accounts you see on your feed have been creating for years before you had found them. \n\nUGC is also amazing for certain niches. If you're posting on Instagram, you might want to post on TikTok as well. \n\n3. Reddit \n\nSame as Facebook Groups. One of the best ways to grow your brand by recruiting people one by one. This is good not only because it doesn't cost anything, but also because you talk to your customers one on one. It's easy to get feedback that way and improve your product. \n\n  \nFeel free to share more about your business, so we can offer some specific advice. ",

Instagram and Facebook mostly work for visual consumer apps. X can work for tech audiences but it is tough without an existing following.\n\nReddit can actually be one of the best places for early adopters, but only if you do not treat it like promotion. Launch posts alone rarely convert well. Most installs usually come from participating in discussions where people already have the problem your app solves. It also helps with long term consistent organic growth, and SEO rankings.\n\nFrom what I have seen working with a few apps and SaaS tools, the best results come from:\n\n• Answering “how do I solve this” type questions  \n• People complaining about current tools  \n• Advice seeking threads  \n• Smaller niche communities instead of huge subs\n\nOne product I worked with moved from Top 10 to Top 3 in Reddit search results in their niche, and their mentions even started showing up in Reddit’s AI answers. I have also seen posts cross 10k plus views in a few hours when the targeting is right, but views alone do not guarantee users, engagement and real trust building based discussion does.\n\nPaid ads can work, but early on they often bring low quality feedback unless targeting is extremely tight. Organic communities usually give much better insights because people actually care.\n\nIf you are comfortable sharing what your app does, I can suggest places that tend to bring early adopters quickly.",

      "text": "So I've been working on a review management tool for local businesses for the past few months and I've ended up in a situation I'm not sure how to navigate, so I figured I'd ask here since there are people who've been through similar things.\n\nThe idea came from watching small business owners ignore their Google reviews because writing individual replies is genuinely boring and most of them don't know what to say. So I built something that connects to their Google Business Profile, pulls in reviews, and uses AI to generate on-brand replies they can approve and publish in one click. Automation rules, analytics, Stripe billing, GDPR compliance for the EU market, the whole thing. It took longer than I expected but the codebase is solid and everything works.\n\nExcept for the part that makes it actually useful. To connect to Google Business Profile you need quota approval from Google for their Management API, and they rejected my request. Turns out you need to own a verified Google Business Profile for 60+ days before they'll even consider granting quota, which is one of those requirements that feels completely reasonable in hindsight but that I only discovered after building the whole product.\n\nSo now I have a production-ready SaaS that can't connect to the one platform it was built for. All the code exists and works, the domain is live, the accounts are all set up, it just needs someone who already has a verified GBP to pick it up and actually launch it. For a local SEO agency or anyone who manages Google Business Profiles for clients, the blocker doesn't even exist.\n\nMy question is really about how to position and sell something in this state. It's pre-revenue, there are no customers, and there's this one real blocker that I'm being upfront about. I've been looking at Acquire and Flippa but I'm not sure if those are the right places for something like this or if there's a better way to find buyers who would actually see the value in it. Has anyone sold a project in a similar state? Curious how you approached pricing it and where you found buyers.",

      "text": "I (29M, single, no kids) need advice on what to do next. Based on the overview below, I'd like to hear what other people's ideas are / what people would do if they were in my position. I'd especially like to hear from people who have faced similar circumstances and what they did -- although all are open to opine.\n\nI have had a bumpy career. I studied math in undergrad; did a masters in statistics (all of this was paid for by scholarship, no loans are dragging me down). Good grades. Not worried there.\n\nI briefly worked at a prestigious company doing some compliance (9 months). I was then poached by a hedge fund to work on their acquisitions team (left after 1.5 years). I made good money and the work was good, too; the people were the stuff of nightmares (my stories would sound fake and a coworker once said she \"wouldn't believe me except for the fact that she saw it herself\"). I left and then helped manage an endowment (\\~3 years).\n\nThe endowment was fine but was \"bad\" in the sense that I was severely understimulated. It was boring beyond belief. After saving some money, I ended up leaving to try starting my own company.\n\nThe new company is going alright. I've been at it for about 8 months. These last few weeks, I started running ads / doing marketing. It is still in its infancy. I genuinely believe it can make a lot of money, assuming I can work out the kinks. It is getting interest; good internet traffic; and I'm about to close my first transaction after about 1 week of ads.\n\nThe problem is that I am running out of money. I still have enough of my own savings for about 9-12 more months (before dipping into retirement funds). I had planned to start looking for a new job in about a month if things weren't immediately promising. This is because, on average, it takes about 6-9 months to get a job if you do not currently have one. I am prepared for a longer search.\n\nI do not know if I should continue to try growing this on the side (which, admittedly, would be very difficult, if not impossible to do). I have thought about trying to raise some funding but want to wait until I have more of a steady flow of revenue before trying to scale -- the business is very ad-spend dependent and some processes need to be worked out before I feel very confident I could return my investor money. Also, having this working revenue flow would make it much easier to raise money.\n\nI could go back to \"high finance\" but it would put me in a position that is \"more junior,\" assuming I return to the same vein as before. This is a possible route but I would have to give up any chance of starting my own thing. This is because I'd probably be working 60-80 weeks. I'm also getting older and those hours are just killer. I think I'd be miserable.\n\nI have a technical background and could probably make the switch to software development / something in that realm. However, I'd be starting all over, and I've heard the job market isn't exactly popping in that sector. It'd also be a lot of work prepping for interviews -- I'm rusty, and I'd have to re-learn a lot.\n\nIdeally, I'd be able to get a job at a new company / startup where I'd be able to earn equity, help the company grow, get valuable business-building experience, then leave and try starting something again.\n\nI've put together a few things that I think will help me pick a new career.\n\nI know this is bad, but I need to make at least $150K+ based on my past jobs.\n\nI'd prefer to like my coworkers but I'd take ones I don't hate.\n\nI need a job that is semi-social.\n\nI need a job that has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI need a job that is stimulating / will let my position \"matter.\" At the endowment, if I didn't do my job for a week or so, I'm pretty sure nothing would change.\n\nSo, my questions are...\n\n* Would you try raising funding?\n   * It'd have a small chance of happening but I am pre-revenue and that is a huge limiter. I think I could make an argument that I have a good \"path to revenue\" but, realistically, you don't know that it'll work out until you are actually generating revenue.\n* Would you go back to a high-paying career at a more junior role, eat shit for a while, and maybe burn out?\n* Would you try switching fields altogether into one that is struggling with extra uncertainty?\n* Would you try finding a new gig doing something perhaps more ambiguous, taking less money, and see if you can get an equity stake in something?\n\nI'd be happy to hear advice that individuals may have that could help with the decision calculus here.",

And you clearly have the discipline to get there based on your trajectory.\n\n  \nHere is what I would actually do: get a contract or consulting gig in the finance/data space. Not full time. Something 20-30 hours a week that pays $10-15k/month. Your stats background plus hedge fund experience makes this very doable on platforms like Toptal, or just reaching out to former colleagues who need help with quantitative projects. This buys you 12+ more months of runway without giving up equity or burning out in a 70 hour week finance role.\n\n  \nMeanwhile keep running the startup on the side. If the ads keep converting, double down. If they stall after a month or two, at least you have income and can pivot without desperation.\n\n  \nThe worst position to be in is fundraising when you are running out of money. Investors smell desperation. The second worst is taking a soul-crushing job that kills the startup entirely.\n\n  \nThe middle path (consulting + building) is harder to execute but it keeps all your options open.

I think focusing on the right kind of outreach can make a huge difference For my first app (educational audiobooks) I found Reddit to be a goldmine. Ads never really worked for me but showing up organically in relevant subreddits answering questions and mentioning my app when it fit the conversation did. People on Reddit especially in niche communities can be really passionate and become loyal users. The problem was finding those relevant conversations. I was using F5 bot and it was a massive time sink going through endless notifications. It became obvious that my app could only grow as much as I scaled community engagement something that wasnt scalable So I ended up building an internal tool to solve that problem now its my main project. It automatically finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn. Its designed to surface the posts where your product is actually relevant not just based on keywords. This means you can jump into discussions where you can genuinely help people and maybe even find some paying customers in the process. Its what led me to your post actually! If you think something like that could help you cut through the noise and focus on the right conversations let me know. It may make community engagment less tiresome",

You're talking to the right people but about the wrong angle.** They see value, but it doesn't connect to something they're actively trying to solve this week.   \nTry this: go back to the last 5 people who said \"this is cool\" and ask them one question: \"what's the most frustrating part of \\[the workflow your product touches\\] right now?\" If their answer doesn't match your pitch, you've found the gap.\n\n**2. You're solving the right problem but for the wrong buyer.** Sometimes the person who says \"cool\" isn't the one feeling the pain daily. The decision-maker and the pain-feeler are often different people. Worth mapping out: who actually suffers from this problem vs. who you've been reaching out to.\n\n**3. Your positioning is too broad.** \"Simple enough for seniors\" is a UX achievement, but it might also signal that you haven't narrowed down who this is specifically for. When a product is for \"everyone,\" it's urgent for no one. Try describing your user in one sentence with a specific role, a specific context, and a specific frustration. If you can't, that's the thing to fix first.\n\nFor the next 30 days, I'd pick one: either validate your positioning (are you describing the right problem?), your targeting (are you reaching the right people?), or your timing (are you catching them when they actually feel the pain?). Trying to fix all three at once is what keeps founders stuck in the loop you described.\n\nWhat does your current outreach message look like?

Instead of tweaking messaging, go back to customer interviews and ask people what they're currently doing to solve this problem and how much time/money it costs them - if they're not already spending significant resources on workarounds, your solution might be solving a \"nice to have\" instead of a \"must have.\" We use Brew for our email outreach and the biggest lesson has been that timing matters more than perfect messaging - catching people right when they're actively frustrated with their current solution.",

      "text": "This journey gave me a lot\n\nWe don’t usually fail because we lack intelligence. We fail because We drift away from reality. The more capable we think we are, the easier it becomes to live inside ideas instead of outcomes.  start operating in models, abstractions, long term frameworks. It feels powerful and visionary. But reality is much simpler and much harsher than that. Reality only responds to traction.\n\nStaying in reality means constantly asking: \n\nwho is paying right now, and why? \n\nNot who “will” pay when the system is complete. \n\nNot who “should” care once they understand the vision.\n\nNot who intellectually agrees. \n\nWho is transferring money, changing behavior, or committing time today? \n\nIf that number is low, your job is not to expand the vision. Your job is to narrow the problem.\n\nReality is brutally specific. It doesn’t reward layered architectures before demand. It doesn’t reward perfect positioning statements. It doesn’t reward conceptual elegance. It rewards solutions that remove pain immediately. \n\nThe founder who stays grounded obsesses over one friction point and makes it disappear. The founder who drifts builds systems around hypothetical scale.\n\nStaying in reality also means separating ego from product. Intelligence can become a trap. You begin to love being right more than being effective. You defend complexity because it reflects depth. But customers don’t pay for depth. They pay for relief. \n\nIf a simpler version works better in the market, reality demands you choose simple even if it bruises your identity.\n\nAnother uncomfortable truth: \n\nbeing busy is not evidence of progress. You can spend months refining infrastructure, strategy decks, security layers, or multi layer expansion plans. It feels productive because it’s hard work. But reality measures progress in retention, revenue, growth, and usage. If those numbers are flat, no amount of sophistication compensates.\n\nStaying in reality requires emotional discipline. Markets move slower than ambition. Adoption is messier than models. Feedback is often underwhelming. \n\nThe temptation is to escape upward into bigger ideas, new verticals, broader systems. But expansion is often avoidance.\n\n The harder move is to stay with the uncomfortable question:-\n\nwhy isn’t this single use case dominating yet?\n\nA grounded founder repeats a simple cycle: \n\nbuild something small, test it in the market, get rejected, adjust, repeat. No grand narrative protects you from this loop. \n\nNo intelligence shortcut bypasses it. You either confront it or you decorate around it.\n\nReality is not anti vision. It’s anti delusion. Vision gives direction. Reality gives correction. \n\nIf you only live in vision, you drift. If you only live in reaction, you shrink. The discipline is holding both dreaming big while measuring brutally.\n\nThe founders who win long term are not necessarily the smartest in the room. They are the ones who refuse to lie to themselves. They don’t inflate traction. They don’t hide behind complexity. They don’t expand before they dominate something small. They face the numbers. They face the silence from customers. They face the hard feedback.\n\nStaying in reality is uncomfortable because it removes fantasy. But it creates power. Because once you see clearly, you can act precisely.\n\n ",

They really want me to relocate to NYC for an offer, but I am hesitant. I live in a pretty low cost of living area and really like staying remote. I was told to be \"aggressive\" with an initial idea, but not given a range or anything so I am working on crafting an \"offer\" of my own to see what they might go for? So here is what I am factoring in:\n\nCurrently making $75 an hour, averaging 40 hrs a week  \nCurrently in a low cost of living area  \nNot sure what a normal ask is as far as stake in company at a series A? This is my longest time working for one.  \nRelocation package in general, I would love to add this in as I think moving would be a bit intense or impossible otherwise (feel like this is normal)\n\nWhat is a good range to be considering with all of this in mind? Is 250k crazy for me to be thinking about?? That was kind of the first number that came to mind, but I feel like I need some outside perspectives to help me here lol.\n\nSome other things to mention; I am the sole person in my dept (purposefully being vague but can answer if its relevant), I am not worried about my job otherwise, and there is a possibility of regular business trips but I would have to make some visits (reimbursed of course) before then to try and convince them it would work.\n\nWhat would you do if you were me?! I just need some direction, TYIA!",

I would anchor higher if you are truly critical.\n\nA simple framework:\n\n• Base: Adjust for NYC cost of living + risk premium (200k–240k range feels defensible).\n• Equity: Early Series A commonly lands somewhere between 0.1%–0.5% depending on seniority and leverage.\n• Relocation: Moving costs + temporary housing + sign-on bonus.\n• Flexibility: If remote is your preference, you can price relocation as optional (e.g., “I would consider relocating at X; remote at Y”).\n\n250k is not “crazy” if your function drives revenue or is strategic. The key is to justify it in terms of impact, not personal expenses.\n\nIf I were you, I would present it as a structured package, not a single number.",

They don't need to be the best engineers. They often aren't. But they should be focused on culture, value delivery, and biased towards action. There is no perfect indicator for these things, unfortunately.\n\nThere are many well meaning CTOs and engineers who lose sight of good in pursuit of perfection.

For the first version of the app, probably not, and with enough competence in your early hires, you could use both languages. I've worked in a lot of \"Haskell Startups\", great language, but the infrastructure around it makes a lot of things \"hard mode\" because hiring is tricky and there's a ton of missing libraries. Nonetheless, those businesses weren't rescued by using the language, but they weren't directly harmed by it either.\n\nThat said, if you want to pick a single language, I'd lean towards python if your biggest problems are going to be how you build and integrate AI, and lean towards C#/Java if you need to build a lot of performant backend services where operational concerns (logging/metrics/deployments) matter.\n\nMost of the code should be written with AI anyway, so \"what people know already\" should be less of a factor than it was even 3 years ago.\n\n",

The CTO is your right hand, someone that can help you succeed or destroy your goals, is the person in front of you someone that you feel comfortable going to battle with?",

      "text": "As I get close to just my first full year of building startups, I wanted to share a few hot takes/advice/random game about entrepreneurship.\n\n1. I know we all can’t stand the fake hype and staged founder aesthetics, but the concept works - It has become such a mess because content marketing delivers insane results for certain people that actually put the time in. Now it’s saturated. Everyone uses LinkedIn like social media, cuts corners, uses AI to write everything, and posts twice a day hoping to go viral.\n2. Burn the boats. Go all in - This is something I personally struggle with. Between getting into an awesome program a top 3 school and landing a cool internship this summer I have set myself up for a nice, comfortable corporate life. While my drive and passion to truly achieve something great is still there, having a safety net sometimes takes away from the “I can’t fail” mentality that is so essential in the early stages of building something.\n3. Being an already accomplished person makes starting a company 100x easier - Seems obvious, but when I first entered the startup space I thought ideas raised money. They don’t. Stanford grads, 18 year olds who interned at OpenAI, and founders with a real product and traction raise money. If you don’t have the résumé, more often than not you will need to build something successful before getting any help.\n4. Selling is harder than coding - This might be biased since I have a technical background and am kind of an awkward dude, but convincing people to give you their time, let alone their money, is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.\n5. The worst times in entrepreneurship are when you have nothing to do - I personally love the chaos because it means customers and progress. When you suddenly have time to build a feature nobody asked for, that is usually when you’re in trouble. So make the empty promise and work through the weekend to deliver.\n6. Work with someone else - Get yourself an awesome co-founder. Someone who forces you to post on LinkedIn, cold call, work until 10pm, and do all the hard things required to build a truly successful business.\n\nAgain only really been in the game for around a year so this is pretty basic stuff but curious to hear others options on these topics",

The biggest mistake I see founders make is trying to be everywhere at once - LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletters, podcasts - and ending up mediocre on all platforms instead of great on one.\n\nI'd rather send one really good email to my list every two weeks than blast generic content daily. Even for simple stuff like investor updates or customer onboarding sequences, I spend way more time on the actual message than the design. Something like Brew helps me focus on writing instead of wrestling with HTML, but the real work is still figuring out what to say and who needs to hear it.\n\nThe staged founder aesthetic thing is so real though. Half these \"hustle culture\" posts feel like they were written by someone who's never actually had to make payroll.",
