      "text": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

You made the right call. Its what I call, executive decisions. A mans gotta do, what a mans gotta do. You saves yourself years of grief down the road and pointless arguments fronting from silent resentment of all the time it took for things to finally work out. You and her missed out on nothing. On the grand scale, you are okay and have COUNTLESS options, in a way, to pursue, in alignment, a woman that you can provide for that deserves you and your resources. TREAD LIGHTLY, though. A lot women want resources from men. Its nasty. Ive seen it first hand. My Dad had a 6 fig income, retired, married... divorced just recent and maaaaan.... Its painful to see him in the finacial state. Wiped out by woman. He thought prayers and not taking action to protect himself would save him. Nope. So protect yourself at all times. Its a concrete jungle out there. Dont let nooooooo body, especially women that want to soften you up and, \"you cant be that way\", dude. Theyre their to open you up, never there when theyre wrong. You hold the cards. Hold them close. Use your best judgement. Keep your wits. Vet first, love later. A mans greatest folly, is his heart and his 2nd head. Good job. Proud of you. Now get to buying some hard assets, a trust, a finacial team etc. Still ways to go. congrats on cracking the 100k barrier.\nLadies , its not a shot at women. Its a warning to men , that I wasnt taught young, to guard your hearts. Mothers always warn girls about boys. Rarely do boys get warned about girls. Its no shade, just a grounding.",

I think you can NOW start to live again and prioritise life fulfilling things outside of work but since you hadnt achieved it previously you really couldnt afford to do so mentally. \n\nHonestly, I would just be grateful you finally succeeded because imagine if you had failed and were in the same position. You should thank god for that blessing. Now is your chance to make up for all the lost time spent too focused on trying to succeed and reap the fruits of your labour.",

      "text": "(I will not promote)\n\nI've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

What I meant was, one should still consider their startup and even their own momentum in terms of the list as you have built it. \n\nIt's important that one also acknowledge that there are certain... caveats because you can't always show immediate adoption numbers, so you have to come up with other ways. \n\nYour list is a map, and a map is an approximation of the territory, so adjust accordingly. :)\n\nFor example, with my surgical robot I was able to present a list of over 200 surgeons in the field that had used the robot in a simulation setting and validated the potential clinical value of the technology. They weren't a direct adopter (yes), but they were experts who provided their insight of the future value of the device. \n\nRegardless of that outlier, I say your list is spot on.",

Investors aren’t judging decks, they’re judging whether uncertainty is collapsing fast enough. Slides are just the surface area where that judgment shows up. That’s why “problem clarity,” “traction with context,” and “why now” keep coming up. They’re proxies for learning velocity.\n\nWhere founders still misread the game is thinking the deck *creates* conviction. It doesn’t. It only reveals whether there’s a tight loop underneath where effort reliably turns into insight. When that loop exists, even rough decks get funded. When it doesn’t, no amount of polish saves it.\n\nOnce you see that, fundraising becomes sequencing, not storytelling. Prove one narrow thing works, then raise to amplify it. That’s the pivot point most people miss.\n\nThe part I’d want to pressure-test is this: which single assumption in your story would break first if real capital hit it?\n\nIf you want to sanity-check that assumption, happy to go deeper or compare how investors usually probe it in conversation.",

A small early push (newsletter, Slack groups, Twitter/X, hunters) creates a snowball effect. Once a product hits the top spot early in the day, it gets more visibility on the homepage, email digests and notifications, which brings in more organic upvotes. That is how #1 can run away to 300+ while #2 stalls at 230. It is momentum and visibility compounding, not a linear race.\n\nSo yeah, its less about “best product wins” and more about who shows up with distribution ready on day one. If you launch cold, the disparity feels brutal, but its mostly the mechanics of the platform rather than outright manipulation.",

Actual development started around October 2024 (this is like the time i started to think the product create logos and stuff actual coding of any thing even the home page started feb of this year). Since then, I’ve focused on getting the product to a state where people can realistically use it.\n\nThis isn’t a 2010s MVP where a rough demo is enough. now a days peaple want polished thing that can do the actualy basics thing you claiming to do. For a platform that builds real apps and websites, polish and core functionality matter a lot. It’s also a hard produce MVP you can’t really fake something that claims to generate working platforms another words the claims we are making are really big and we needed to make sure every thing is what we said it is.\n\nAlso, TFKITY isn’t a no-code or low-code tool. It’s a full software platform. You can design UI ( we are targeting our canva to be like framer / figma full blown design making canvas), define logic (which means write normal js code that can change in runtime the ui. any thing like you made button object in the ui you can change the colour using the code by writing $opjectname.bg\\_color = #FFFFFFF this is going to change the color in runtime you can make this code to change the colour now by butting simple //??run!!now before this line ), and also you can connect any existing JavaScript packages. The goal is closer to something like a **game engine** then no code solution, but deeply programmable rather than competing with tools like Wix or Squarespace which means i am not calculating them us competitors at all more like my competitors are flutter and react extra we are code first engine.\n\nWe’ve already done some early validation with testers (friends and people idk the idea looks promising), but now the focus is shifting toward talking to more potential users publicly and getting broader feedback.\n\nOn the name totally fair criticism. English isn’t my first language ( not even my sec or third ), and the name came from how I was thinking at the time( i did not used to speak fully eng back then ). I’m aware it’s not ideal, but re branding this early is a non-trivial cost, so I’m weighing that carefully i cant redo the logo colors fonts i spent months before to come up name and other stuff .\n\nIf you’re curious about how TFKITY differs from low-code tools, these posts explain it better than the comment please look it if you can:\n\n* [https://tfkity.com/more/design-code/](https://tfkity.com/more/design-code/)\n* [https://tfkity.com/more/syntax/](https://tfkity.com/more/syntax/)\n\nI appreciate the honesty.\n\n also i am really apreciated if you can give me feedback for my homepage [tfkity.com](http://tfkity.com)",

Your post was asking how you get people coming to your wait list the name is going to severely impact your ability to do that - because people will struggle to share it. So even if you talk about it, other people won't be able to, you can't take advantage of network effects.",

But the automotive industry exists and many startup car companies fail. \n\nI don't recommend waitlists because of the same kind of abuse as validation. Founders who are eager to build the product use a couple of signups as an excuse to plunge headlong into development. Heck, they'll ask if a couple of survey responses is enough 'market traction' to launch. They're ridiculous. \n\nThe waitlist should disclose the reason for waiting. What value does the product bring to the table hundreds if not thousands of easy site builder apps don't? What problems with these site builders does this product solve? Saying you intend on building something better doesn't mean anything. Every crap product out there has a founding team with delusions of adequacy behind it. \n\nBuild In Public is often a driver of waitlist signups, and that's even less discussed. Way too often developers obsess on the coding when customers don't care but competitors coding their own product sign up. Customers don't care how the sausage is made, talk about your in-depth knowledge of the problem and correct diagnosis of the solution. \n\nIs your waitlist growing without your having to spam Reddit every day? Word-of-mouth growth is one signal you may be onto something. List size should be growing explosively if you are being serious. Which means you don't post to crow about a measly hundred signups on an internet with almost six billion users. \n\nThey paid NOTHING. You did this to make-believe there was lots of demand.

              "text": "hey thank you for the resp i really aprecited the feedback \n\nI think a big part of the disconnect is that people are assuming I’m building “another easy website builder.” That’s not what TFKITY is, and that framing is where a lot of the criticism comes from.\n\nTFKITY is **not** a web-based ( it is sfotware you need to downlaod it) site builder ( you can build apps desk apps web apps everything) , not no-code ( we made whole progmign lang and our own compilter), and not low-code ( you can code litterly any thing from the ui it self if the canva dont help you ). It’s a **full-blown software platform** designed to build *complex applications*, not just marketing sites. You can build things like social platforms ( i builded clone youtupe where you can post vids and eveyrthing alot of bugs still ), internal tools, even games not a constrained subset of templates.\n\nA rough analogy would be:  \n**Figma for structure + a real code engine for behavior.**  \nEverything is object-based. Objects are essentially compiled classes, extensible by the user, and can target multiple platforms. You can visually manipulate layout, properties by using the canvas side, and state and when you need logic , You open our built-in code editor and write real code that directly controls runtime behavior ( like you added new opj in the ui called buttonopj which is button you can change his color in runtime by writing $buttonopj.bg\\_color=#FFFFFF something like that).\n\nThat’s why comparisons to Wix, Squarespace, or generic low-code tools don’t really fit. Those tools intentionally limit scope. TFKITY is designed for people who want *no ceiling*, just a better interface for building. also since you can connect to any already exited npm package you can do litterly any thing.\n\nOn validation and waitlists: I mostly agree with your criticism. A couple of signups or surveys don’t mean demand ( i usedto be game deloper so this helps me personally allot and all tests i did it looks like it solves actual problem ), and I’m not treating a waitlist as proof of traction. The reason I’m considering one is purely practical the product is usable but still very buggy, and I don’t think it’s responsible to push public usage for a few more months. A waitlist, in my case, is about **controlled access and feedback**, not pretending there’s massive demand.\n\nAlso, this is genuinely the first time I’ve talked about the project publicly on Reddit. I’m not spamming communities or claiming traction I don’t have. Right now, I’m trying to pressure-test the positioning and messaging, because clearly the “website builder” assumption means I haven’t explained the value well enough yet.\n\nThat’s useful feedback and honestly, that’s why I posted. thank you i love to get more feedback if you undertand what is our product now. also any feedback of our home page [tfkity.com](http://tfkity.com)",

If you can pull off \"webflow but cross platform and with a more open ecosystem\" I think this could actually work. Or maybe another pitch would be \"WYSIWYG react\". The problem is your messaging. Your messaging talks about how it works, what features it's comprised of and some implementation details. Instead you should go after one specific group of potential customers and talk directly to them. You're not trying to get 1M people to think that this is \"somewhat interesting\". You want 10 people who will absolutely love it. Even if your target is developers you still have to talk in terms of solving their specific problem. Really think through your messaging and your GTM will write itself. You might need to try multiple ideas but when you hit it you'll just know. And be ready to evolve your solution, cut features or redo features as you go. It's very important especially early on. Ever feature you don't cut needs to be maintained and will slow you down.\n\n\nFrom personal experience. My startup has a page in webflow. For various reasons I'd like it to be self-hosted. Also we have a custom web app written in react that is linked from it. I'd love it if we could have a landing page that we have full control over and that still can be edited by our pretty tech savvy marketing people. They obviously won't touch react code or make a PR even with AI. But they maybe could use this. So right now we're looking at basically redoing the webflow page from scratch. We'll also lose any ability for the marketing team to make tweaks without them going through the engineering team.",

It’s hard to make a game people want to play. Very hard.\n\n2) You need to integrate test prep in a way that players will actually learn and enjoy. I assume this is the more magical part. \n\n3) This needs to be as effective or more so than current prep methods like reading the books, practice exams, buying a course. This is another very hard problem. \n\nIt also sounds like there isn’t much technical challenge which makes it less interesting for a CTO and less defensible. ",

However as a potential technical founder I would rather work on my own things solo then team up for this idea. \n\nYou're going to have all of the problems of an indie game studio and a startup combined if you start from scratch. \n\nYou need to secure funding to acquire an existing game that didn't sell to it's potential and re-release it, or find someone who is pretty far along the process of building a game and is willing to partner with you, add educational content for you finding funding for the rest of the game. \n\nHere were my initial questions/thoughts though that led me to the above conclusion. \n\n1. How did you validate it? Validating a game is hard, but you're also an educational tool, so you need to validate both sides. \n\n2. I don't think this is a startup, there's no way to scale this since games make 80% of their sales within the first few months and if you do a subscription model, you'll have constant churn since people only need to pass these tests once.\n\n3. What's your moat? Someone could vibe code a LSAT study mod into Skyrim in a weekend, Stardew Valley already has an ANKI study mod. I've never played Roblox, but I would be surprised if no one has done an educational game there already.\n\nI do think educational games will be a big thing in the future. It's just going to be hard to pull off and there's lots of competition. \n\nIf you're able to make the next Roblox/Minecraft/Stardew and show positive educational outcomes you'll be huge. There's also lots of ways to pivot/specialize along the way to keep going.",

If you don’t have any technical friends or folks from your network that’ll join in, then you need money. Money solves this problem and it’ll enable you to give away an order of magnitude less of your company. If I was you, I would focus on fundraising. Lots of smart, non-technical people raise on an idea or brittle MVP.\n\nEvery VC at every stage is going to tell you to derisk. At your stage, that’s proving you can hire a critical engineer. When they don’t follow up with an offer, that’s a signal.\n\nWhat this signal means is that the investors don’t believe in you yet; they know they’ll have to pay more if you get farther along and have a team. If they believe in you they’ll invest. So reading the books the VCs read, getting letters of intent from potential customers, refining your pitch, and practice-pitching to friendly VCs in your network - those are the types of things I would focus on.\n\nA couple other tips when talking to technical co-founders:\n\n1. Like investors, technical cofounders need to believe you. Saying things like “I’ve done most of the non-tech work” is definitely not true and makes it seem like you don’t know what you’re getting into. The non-technical work of running a business is never finished. \n2. Being generous or valuing the company inexpensively is not attractive to great engineers. Great engineers would rather have a smaller piece of something great than half of nothing. If you have something valuable, your offers to a technical co-founder - and frankly, everyone who wants a piece of your company - should reflect that confidence. Cheaper isn’t better. \n\n\nGood luck!",

Been there twice already.\n\n  If the product is primarily tech, the tech founder should own more. Of course if OP manages to get funding they can get away with giving minimal equity to incoming founder or just hire founding engineer for a salary.",

You only need to be confident about the few small things that would really hurt if they broke. For me, does it speak casually, or does it detect pre-defined issues correctly. that was it. For most products that ends up being a very small set. Once those feel solid, everything else feels a lot lighter.\n\nInstead of thinking manual versus automated, I started thinking in terms of what changed this week and how fast would I know if something went wrong, right. Since I was already confident on the core features, etc. The stress drops a lot once you trust that you’ll notice issues quickly and can recover fast, even if something slips through.\n\nI was just wondering if something broke in your production tomorrow, how quickly would you know about it and how painful would it be to roll back, friday to friday?",

It'll also help you get an understanding of metrics for performance.

With a high risk of failure.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just saying that you will do better if you take a step back, focus on finding out what's local to you, and get that one person that you can work with as a first client. Then you build on that. You expand your network through that. You establish the business. You bring in clients to that business. But it should start with what's around you already, not some online networking. \n\nGo to local events first. Meetups etc. Get that solid foundation in place.",

After 5 months live, here are our stats: $30K MRR, 10% CAC, $1044 LTV, 5% true churn (seasonally and product cycle adjusted), 350+ customers, 10-year $100M ARR ceiling, 1 large corporate partnership, government interest. We have a strong roadmap to $100K MRR within the next 6 months.  We are 3 founders, all with strong resumes. 1 founder has worked for Tim Cook, led the Auth0 exit to Okta and was a data lead for the Artemis II lunar project. Another has led two successful exits and has extensive front-end experience. I am leading the sales & marketing and have built a network of 4M target niche leads.  We have just hired our first employee.\n\n***Here is the meat and potatos of it all***. Recruiters from various organizations (SXSW Pitch, a16z, YC, NEXT AI, Vector, ISED, TechStars, etc) have reached out to us requesting that we apply for their event / accelerator / incubator. We fill out the requested applications, build strong custom pitch decks, tell a compelling story and ship our good numbers to them in our application. Heck, we have even had some big players sponsor us to apply.\n\nAnd every single time - rejected. In fact, one rejected yesterday. \"Thank you for your application. We are thoroughly impressed with your company's growth and trajectory, but unfortunately ...\".  (This was SXSW and we received our sponsorship to apply from Paddle/ProfitWell).  I am fine with it, if anything it strengthens our resolve. I can handle the rejection well. The primary issue is that I have no idea what I am doing wrong? I don't know how to course correct because I don't know where we are dropping the ball. I am sure that I am not presenting well, or perhaps the timing is wrong ... I don't know. But at what point do we just label this as a fruitless paperwork exercise and strictly focus on revenues and customer growth?\n\nIf I get in my own head, I think maybe we are too old (35yo, 35yo, 46yo)?  Maybe our story isn't compelling enough?\n\nFor those of you who got into YC or any other accelerator - did you get feedback on what clinched your entry?",

Before building anything now, I spend a fixed window purely on market research to look for real demand signals.

If there’s no meaningful traction at that stage, I drop the idea.\n\nThe intent is to reduce false positives and avoid spending weeks building products that only make sense in theory.\n\nI’ve also been exploring more structured ways to analyze where conversations are happening and what questions are repeatedly being asked, as a way to pressure-test assumptions before committing to an MVP.\n\nFor founders here who’ve been through this cycle: how do you personally validate problems early?

People won’t pay, competition will crop up too fast, technical issues, user issues, scaling issues, business model issues, go to market issues, whatever. For every issue, try and find robust ways to prove why. You specifically ask potential users why it won’t work. And you genuinely try to kill it. This helps you avoid motivated reasoning. \n\nIf it survives this step, it’s worth pursuing.",

      "text": "(I will not promote) Looking for a reality check on what's fair here.\n\n**The situation:**\n\nI have been helping someone over the last 7 months who has been working on a startup—a marketplace platform connecting families with service providers (babysitters, cleaners, tutors, etc.) in the Netherlands. She has now been working on it for about 16 months and has invested around €25k of her own money.\n\nShe'd already tried two development teams before me. A non-dutch agency that didn't deliver, and a solo developer (also not based in the Netherlands) who worked for 9 months but produced poor quality code. She was paying them.\n\nI initially offered to help with some small things—CSS fixes, minor bugs. I'm a senior backend developer with a full-time job elsewhere.\n\nI started building the backend one a half months after meeting her to support the Egyptian developer (because his data modeling skills were suboptimal for the long term health of the business). He was building a Flutter app and using Firebase as a backend. His skill was extremely low: late deliveries, bugs visible on first tests, consistent data loss (luckily the app was not in production yet). But I am starting to think he was doing it on prupose given her negotiation strategies. He was just stalling.\n\n**How I perceived things:**\n\nOver the last 7 months, I ended up building the entire platform from scratch:\n\n* Complete backend (NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL)\n* Complete frontend (Next.js; this only in the last month and a half, once she terminated the Egyptian developer)\n* Admin panel\n* Authentication system (I'm using Firebase Auth)\n* Emails (for events like bookings created, requests created... but also email verification and so on)\n* Database architecture\n* Payment integration (Stripe)\n* Monorepo structure deploying to vercel for FE and railway for BE, all automated.\n\nAll while keeping my full-time job. No salary. No contract. No equity agreement.\n\nShe started calling me \"CTO\" and \"business partner.\"\n\n**Her investment vs mine:**\n\n* Her: \\~€25k cash, 16 months of business development, marketing, partnerships\n* Me: 7 months of senior dev work (no pay), some tool costs (Claude, Vercel, Railway); low intensity the first 4 months, and then increasingly more and more time in the last 3 months.\n* She paid the marketing team (\\~€10k)\n* She paid the previous developers\n* She paid me: €0\n\n**When I asked about equity:**\n\nI proposed 30-35% equity with 4-year vesting. She keeps majority control, makes all business decisions. I just want to own part of what I built.\n\n**Her offers:**\n\n1. First document: 0% equity, 15% of exit only if I'm still involved when she sells, all IP becomes hers immediately\n2. Profit sharing: 5-10% of profit (she defines what profit means), expires after 12-24 months, salary \"when she can afford it\"\n3. Latest offer: 2.5% options (not equity), 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, but vesting only STARTS when she decides there are \"structural paying customers.\" Salary only when she decides The Company can afford it. Full personal liability on me. All IP transfers immediately upon signing.\n\n**Her arguments:**\n\n* \"The Company is not like other startups\"\n* \"Everyone is expendable, no one is irreplaceable\"\n* \"You're building it with AI\"\n* \"I could ask any of my friends\"\n* \"It's too early to discuss equity\"\n* \"Giving you ownership makes The Company uninvestable\"\n* \"I consulted friends in the startup world and they said my offers are standard\"\n\n**Where it ended:**\n\nShe said \"you can keep everything and move forward yourself\" after I wouldn't accept her terms.\n\n**My question:**\n\nFor someone who built the entire technical foundation of a pre-revenue startup over 7 months with no salary—what's standard? What should I have expected? Was I being unreasonable asking for 30-35%? Was she being reasonable? I am open to hearing argument both defending my position and hers.\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from founders, CTOs, or anyone with startup experience.",

Your instincts are likely correct that she is a bad person to be a business partner with, so figure out a number to sell to her (your hours times your hourly rate could work) or maybe take a smaller equity percentage for a shorter cliff (the app will need updates and work immediately and she wont survive without these very long)",

Indeed the user u/DbG925 is correct that the lack of written agreement might still imply a venture. **Be careful** because that means that you also own liability, ie the client might sue you and take your house! (according to Gemini).\n\nThe interesting part for you is this:\n\n> In the absence of a written contract, the default equity and profit split for a Vennootschap onder Firma (VOF) is governed by Book 7A of the Dutch Civil Code (specifically Article 7A:1670 BW).\n>\n> 1. The Default Rule: Pro-Rata to Contribution\n> \n> If you have not made specific agreements, the law assumes that your share of the profits (and losses) is proportional to what you \"brought in\" to the business.\n> \n> * **Mixed Contribution**: If one partner brings in money and the other brings in labor, and there is no contract, a judge or the Tax Authority must estimate the \"value\" of that labor to determine the fair percentage split.\n\nSo you cite this civil code to her (in a calm voice) and tell her that if you don’t come to an agreement, then the case will end up in litigation which will be more expensive for her. And it will result in a loss of productivity while she is looking for other developers. Remind her of bad experiences in the past. Tell her that you’re enthusiastic to come to a good agreement faster and develop a great company. \n\nIf you’re angry and if you want that everything to go out in flames, then you can lock her out of code and production systems claiming **security** reasons. It’s common in companies to have a *need-based access*. CEOs shouldn’t have access to prod system if they’re not contributing or maintaining the prod. This prevents malware or any phishing attack coming from that side. She mentioned that you’re a CTO, so you have the right to make an executive decision about this. Just remember that you’re still liable to your customers.",

Design experiments to test things by making prospects put skin in the game. “Enter your email to be notified of our launch” is VERY different than pay $1 to be the first to access our product. Validate messaging, does a different CTA cause more or less button clicks? Validate with calendly, make people put skin in the game by spending time. \n\nI feel like I’m rambling at this point. Long story short, there are literally hundreds of micro experiments you can run to validate your business. Some give much more signal than others.

If you're building a simple software app, it's probably a lot easier in many cases to validate your solution. If it's something like a surgical robot, you can't pre-sell it or you will go to jail. So you need to find other methods of validating the market and getting enough signals to know if you've got something that will eventually sell when you're ready. Even for consumer devices, this can be tricky. The Magic Link, which in many ways inspired the iPhone over a decade before its release, seemed to check all of the boxes for the kinds of things people were wanting to do with the internet. And yet, it just couldn't take off. On the other hand, the iPhone had so many detractors, it surprising anybody would have taken a product to market that was being openly ridiculed almost a year before it came out. And yet, 13 million units were sold in the first quarter, giving rise to a brand new product category and trillions of dollars in new market revenue that the so-called experts said had absolutely no demand.",

Validation should be finding if enough customers will pay enough money for a viable business. And they don't do that either. They will claim to have validated when they've done no such thing.\n\nIn the now an MVP is a synonym for project. Nothing more. The project isn't minimal, it is crippleware, for what else could it be market-blind. The project isn't viable because validation has devolved into generation of false positives, if developers know anything more about the customer than when they first started it is a miracle.\n\nThe only thing at launch is the \"p\" but that doesn't sound special. Shock, certainly. Feature requests from freeloaders, sure. Market learning about what people will or won't pay for, no.\n\nBest you can hope for is watrepreneur christmas -- monetization day -- when the capitalism fairy grants their wish to become a real business.

      "text": "I am a co-founder with four others, and I'm working on tech. I'm working on tech and am taking the CTO role and have built the app over the past few months. CEO is also working on tech but is only able to contribute with the help of cursor and AI.\n\nI constantly feel like things keep changing, and that we are not focused enough to build something. We definitely have made a lot of progress over the past few months, but things are changing way too fast, and half of the time, I have no idea what I am building, and then I am criticized for not moving fast enough. For example, this one time, I was working on a major feature that went beyond CRUD, and none of us had really defined the full flow and all the details, so I built what I could. CEO was not happy, got really angry, and said I was moving too slow and wasn't working as much as everyone else. He went on a week long vibe coding spree and said he \"built\" the feature. What took him a week to vibe code was in PR review for over 2 months because he himself didn't understand what he built, but still wanted me to ship it ASAP. Every time I asked him to fix something, his PR was looking entirely different, and I had to review it from the start again.\n\nI have tried to help more with product work to get all the flows and interactions defined, but they have at times said that what I am suggesting or demoing isn't what they had in mind. If I do spend more time trying to build smaller MVPs and demos on how things could work, they end up criticizing me for moving too slow, I guess because I am spending my time working on things that may not get shipped.\n\nI have tried to talk to CEO about this, especially about his vibe coding and how we can make sure that doesn't happen again. I wasn't really happy with his response. He said something like \"That was the most complicated feature and I had to do a ton of experimentation with the code itself to get the flow right\". I asked him, can you not do this work in Figma and then give it to me to implement, to which he said, \"I wanted to move fast and get a head start on the coding\". The feature is now merged in and shipped, but the code is still a bit of a black box and changing behavior or anything related to it will be difficult. I merged it because I was pressured into getting it done, but now that's gonna be a problem for future me.\n\nIt also doesn't help that everyone else is on his side for this, and they see me as a bottleneck in getting the app out. Before CEO took over the complicated and started vibe coding, he sorta sent a few rapid fire messages about how I am slowing everyone down, not making progress, and being a bottleneck. I was hoping that the others would advocate for me and try to help explain that features are not defined, tech is not easy, and everything, but everyone else was just silent and acted like nothing happened. I have tried to push to get more technical people on the team, but they are not interested.\n\nI get that as a startup we need to be able to move fast and pivot in very little time, but I feel there is a difference in that and CEO making up flows and details as he goes. While we do have a figma with one of the cofounders working on screens and flows, often when CEO works on a feature, he \"makes up\" a lot of UI that I don't see on figma.\n\nI am facing a few other issues, like I feel like CEO is trying to focus on getting a sprint done, but not worrying about how moving this fast is gonna affect things in the future. For example, whenever I work on a feature that has UI, I also include a very simple loading state and error state, which can be improved later. In one of CEO's pull requests, I asked him to make a simple loading state and error state, and he just resolved the comment and later told me that it's not needed right now. He also changed the GitHub org permissions, gave himself full permissions and has started letting himself push to main in the effort of moving faster. Now a few weeks later, others are finding bugs that are my fault (no proper error state, flash of incorrect states, for example), and I am blamed for them and expected to fix them. None of these errors would have even been there if I was given just a little bit more time in while I was implementing them.\n\nSorry for the mind dump, but does anyone have advice on how to talk about this with the rest of the team?\n\n\n\n",

PMF isn’t unlocked by chaos, it’s unlocked by tight feedback loops. That requires clarity on what’s being tested, not just motion.\n\nInvestors don’t reward speed in isolation. They reward evidence that a team can turn effort into learning, and learning into repeatable behavior.

Again, not a bad thing- we all grow into this, and it seems you're growing into yours faster than your colleagues by your need for organization, SOPs, and strategic plans.\n\nThe rest of your post confirms it for me though.  The lack of direction is a serious red flag.  You should have a clearly designed plan, feature list, constraints, and MVP acceptance criteria before you even begin writing code.  It's an expensive operation to build, discard, and rebuild on repeat- one unfortunately many junior startup teams fall into the pattern of.\n\nFrom my perspective, it's not a matter of focus or lack of effort on anyone's part, but a lack of respect within your dynamics.  There is an expectation placed on you that you're some sort of robot- and should be pushing the features for today, ignoring the problems of tomorrow.  But there is also the issue that you don't trust your CEO fully either.\n\nIt's tough, but at this point the best case scenario is to actually remove your roles and look to bring in someone who is actually seasoned as a founder and product manager, who will be in charge of everyone- or you leave.\n\nAs it is now, you're in a cycle of dreams with no plan.",

Speed without ownership always turns into chaos, blame, and rewrites. Especially when one founder codes impulsively and another is expected to make it production-safe after the fact.\n\nThe core issue isn’t vibe coding, PRs, or Figma. It’s that you don’t have an agreed rule for what counts as “done,” who defines scope, and who has final technical authority. Without that, every sprint becomes political. The loudest person wins, not the right solution.\n\nFrom an investor lens, this is actually a bigger red flag than messy code. Teams don’t fail because of bad abstractions. They fail because decision rights aren’t explicit. If the CEO can override architecture, bypass review, and then assign downstream blame, that’s not speed, that’s entropy.\n\nHere’s the hard part most people miss: once capital enters, this gets worse, not better. Pressure amplifies existing dynamics. That’s why investors care a lot about whether the CTO actually controls engineering standards or is just “the one who cleans up later.”\n\nYou don’t fix this by arguing details. You fix it by forcing clarity around ownership, scope definition, and what “moving fast” actually means in practice.\n\nWhat I’d want to understand is whether your role is formally empowered to define technical acceptance, or whether you’re expected to execute decisions you don’t control.\n\nIf you want a second perspective from someone who’s helped raise over nine figures and seen how these dynamics play out before and after funding, happy to go deeper on how teams usually resolve this before it breaks them.",

This would usually take around a day or maybe two depending on how much other work I was doing at the same time, but he saw this as slow too, and was angry that I wasn't just merging in his code. A lot of his code was not exactly functional too. For example, one of the features he worked on would only work correctly if the database only had one user. If there were more than one users, user A would see user B's data. I thought it would be a quick small fix, but it was not, so I decided to rebuild that part on my own. CEO was obviously angry about this because it was working on his end (with his limited test data) just fine.\n\nAbout the throw away part, that's what I realized too, and I decided to not worry about the minor things and leave them for later (if there is a later). However, before launch now, CEO and others have surfaced a ton of minor issues that either they told me to skip, or because I decided it is not relevant right now.

Of course as others have pointed out this does feel like a deteriorating situation, so maybe either you have to fight for your own sanity or walk away.  Trying to implement overbearing processes is only going to make you look obstructive to people who haven't been exposed to why these processes exist.

I kept thinking the core technical problem was really hard, so I spent months building a custom system around it. I hired some engineers, failed miserably to find the right engineers, it’s a niche technical skill in AI, wasted time on wrong hires and honestly just ended up me tightening mg sleeves and building it all by myself. (And poorly, lot of bugs)\n\nA few weeks ago I decided I am done fixing these bugs, it’s never ending. (The problem is my product requires very low latency to even verify my MVP. I could not have launched it unless it was functional). I didn’t even reach the phase of fail fast because I really thought I was just a few weeks away, and it’s been months now. I finally tried a different open-source framework that I repurposed… and it basically solves the core problem way better than what I built. It removes a huge chunk of complexity 70% of my codebase and makes everything cleaner and more scalable.\n\nObjectively, this feels RIGHT - as I can finally launch, and do the actual hard part, which is adding value in this world and gaining users. \n\nBut emotionally I feel awful. A big part of the last 5 months of work is basically throwaway, and I keep thinking “how did I not see this sooner?”. Yes hindsight is 20/20, but the cost of getting to December has been high emotionally, and financially. It feels like I lost a lot of time because of my lack of experience in this space. \n\nI know this is on me - some of you will say it’s part of the journey, but to me - it’s been an incredibly painful lesson and I can’t shake the feeling where I have to question my judgement skills or skills of a high efficient CEO if I want to build a 100M startup. And honestly it’s gut wrenching. \n\nTLDR;\n\nSpent 5-6 months building my MVP, living in delusion on the engineering scale. Now realize my entire work is throw away work because of an easier route to launch. Incredibly sad and embarrassed at my utter lack of good decision making skills. ",

      "text": "I’ve been building a software tool for a while now.\n\nIt’s not a standalone thing or plugin yet, more like a local tool I use for personal / hobby purposes. My background is in finance, and I am a \"citizen\" developer enjoying coding and doing projects.\n\nI recently shared a short demo with other people and got way more response than expected, aka *“I want to test this”, “Will this be available to buy?”, \"This should be open source / put it on GitHub”, “Insane / mental / sounds great”*\n\nAnd now I’m stuck.\n\nOn one hand, I get the open-source argument: people could contribute, ideas evolve faster, community goodwill, and transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, here’s my reality: I’m not technically strong enough to own and maintain an open-source project properly. I can compile it and bring it to a decent beta/MVP stage, and that's that. + I don’t have time to manage PRs, issues, forks, or governance. If it’s open, someone more skilled could very realistically package it better than I do and run with it. I’m fine paying a developer later if this goes somewhere, but I need to validate it first\n\nMy current instinct says \"keep it closed for now\", grind alone and get a decent version out, find some serious beta testers and collect feedback, reiterate, then decide whether to open parts of it later with a lead dev steering this, as early traction will be here.\n\nSome people say ideas don’t matter, execution does, which is true, but execution also takes time, money, and focus. And I’m one person.\n\nSo I’m genuinely asking:\n\n* What would be the best approach here?\n* If you are a dev, did you regret open-sourcing too early? Did keeping things closed slow you down or protect you?\n* Is “closed first, open later” actually viable, or just copium?\n* Why would one even want to contribute to something like this without any commercial PoC equity/ownership from day one?\n\nI’m trying to make the least stupid decision and would appreciate honest takes, even uncomfortable ones.\n\nThank you",

Think carefully about licensing models if you go this route - you may want to have all contributors sign an agreement, which makes it harder to contribute but preserves your flexibility. \n\nI’m confused by the way your choice is framed. You’re not technical enough to maintain an open source version but are enough to grind it out solo? That’s not any easier. Also: every expert developer started as a non expert developer. \n\nYou haven’t really given enough detail for anyone to give an informed opinion but my guess is open source it even though you probably won’t have anyone swoop in and make massive contributions for free.

The closed source makes sure you have something of an ace in your pocket to make sure you keep the profitability of your work. Lots of major tech companies succeed at doing this approach.",

      "text": "I’ve been reflecting a lot lately on the last five years of my life, and honestly, it’s been a hell of a ride. I started when I was 19, right in the middle of the pandemic. Back then, the ecosystem felt so different. There were no shortcuts like vibe-coding or shadcn. Everything had to be built from the ground up, and since I didn't know how to code, I had to figure it out the hard way.\n\nI ended up hiring a developer from Nigeria to help get our MVP off the ground. It was an absolute nightmare. The progress was incredibly slow even though we were paying him, but I stayed obsessed with the vision. I spent every day on LinkedIn, just networking and trying to get people to believe in what I was doing. At that age, I didn't know the first thing about startups or how to properly network, but I had this drive that kept pushing us forward.\n\nEventually, the frustration with the slow development hit a breaking point. Everyone I talked to kept telling me the same thing: You need a functional product. You have to have something to sell before you can actually do anything. You have to build XYZ first.\n\nI took that advice to heart, maybe a little too much. I decided I was going to learn to code and do it all myself. I went into a deep hole of development for years. I stopped networking, I stopped generating income, and I just built. I thought that if I could just get the product perfect, everything else would fall into place.\n\nLooking back, I definitely messed up in some ways. I spent way too much time building weird, unnecessary features and staying connected with people who weren't actually ready for the reality of a startup. I burned a lot of time and energy on things that didn't move the needle.\n\nBut even with the lost income and the wasted years on \"weird stuff,\" I don't regret it. If that was the price I had to pay to actually learn how things work from the inside out, then so be it. I learned the hard way that you can't just build in a vacuum, but at least now I have the skills to back up the vision I had when I was 19. It’s been a long road from hiring strangers on the internet to being the one who can actually execute.",

I know that doesn’t exist.\n\nBoth of my parents were entrepreneurs as well (different industry, not for me), so I grew up around that mindset. I’m not afraid of hard work, long hours, or slow progress. I just want to build something of my own that actually makes sense.\n\nWhat I’m really after is learning how to identify real niches and real customer problems, and then build products or services that solve those problems and people are willing to pay for. Not once, but repeatedly.\n\nMy current thinking: Focus first on marketing and understanding demand\n\n→ learn how people think, decide, and buy\n→ then build the right product on top of that\n\nNot the other way around.\n\nI’m starting to seriously study marketing and neuromarketing because I want to understand the mechanics, not just copy tactics. I genuinely enjoy these topics and want to develop the skillset to independently find problems, validate them, and build solutions.\n\nSo my questions:\nDoes this order of learning and execution make sense?\nWhat parts of marketing matter most early on for solo founders?\nWhere do technical people like me usually mess this up?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or hype. I’m looking for honest experiences and lessons learned.\n\nAppreciate any input. 🙏",

          "text": "Biggest lesson learned from building multiple startups and coaching new entrepreneurs is that going solo is, to put it mildly, insanity.   Why?\n\n* Getting a business off the ground is HARD\n* Very few people have all the skills to build a successful business\n* Most people don't have the personality traits to learn all those skills - that can't be learned, you are who you are\n* It is LONELY at the top - a (great) cofounder will support you through difficult times\n* It is easy to wander in the wrong direction and waste time on things that don't matter as much as we think.  We tend to focus on our personal interests and avoid the (necessary) things that we don't have an affinity for - a (great) cofounder will keep you on track and ideally complement you with complementary affinities.\n\nI don't want to discourage you, but I met, in person, hundreds of founders, and very very very few solo ones are successful beyond what would be called a \"lifestyle business\".  Might as well do consulting.\n\nI'm sure someone will chime in saying he/she is successful solo - these people do exist and you could be one of them - but they are RARE.\n\nMost people I met who insist on going solo have poor social skills.  That's a (business) death sentence right there.\n\nOne advice that stuck with me: it is better to invest your time into getting even better at what you are already good at (and like) than trying to fix your limitations - unless they are seriously handicapping you.  Just surround yourself with people who complement your weaknesses.",

It is people doing something that costs them a little time, attention, reputation, or money before you build anything.\n\nIf you are asking how to pick a good idea, I think the simplest answer is you do not pick it by thinking harder. You pick it by seeing what problem people already have a workaround for and whether they will commit to a next step when you put a clear outcome in front of them.\n\nIf you are asking how to validate, the journey is basically this. Make a single page that describes the outcome in one sentence. Put a form on it that asks a question that forces intent, not opinion. Something like would you try this with a few real customers once it is ready, or would you pay for this if it solved the problem. Then share it privately with people closest to the pain and watch what they do, not what they say.\n\nThe money questions in this thread are the right ones. Who buys, why do they buy, how often do they buy, and how expensive is it to reach them. A quick way to reduce risk is to look for proof of pull that matches the business model. If you want a B2B product, you want operators willing to test with real users and book a short call. If you want a paid product, you want people willing to pay a deposit or commit to an early plan. If you cannot get that kind of commitment, building usually just turns uncertainty into a bigger bill.\n\nIf the OP shares what kind of idea they are considering and who it is for, I can suggest a single proof of pull question that fits that exact market. If you do not want to post details publicly, message me and I will help you shape it privately.",

      "text": "So I have been working on my b2b startup for 5 months. Things are not looking the best, but just last month I got my first paying customers (not a lot of money).\n\nI live in the capital of my country, which can be a bit expensive. I like my house and it is VERY cheap for what the market rate is right now. I am worried that if I leave it now, it will be more expensive for me to come back.\n\nOn the other hand, my mother lives in a small town 120-ish km from the capital. I pay all of her living costs on top of mine. I have (realistically) still 1 year of runway left if I stay in the capital. 2 years if I move back.\n\nI talked about this with her and friends, and some recommended me to move back with her so I can focus on my startup (I would not have to cook, avoid commuting to a coworking, save on rent, etc.)\n\nMy ICPs are not in the capital, but most tech happens there. There is zero tech scene in my hometown.\n\nI am a bit blocked right now. Any other founders that went through a similar decision? Thanks a lot.",

If your goal is just to put something good into the world or scratch your own itch, keeping it free (or donation-based / open source) is totally valid. That’s not naive as long as your costs stay close to zero.\n\n\n\nIf you’re even slightly hoping this becomes sustainable though, some kind of paywall probably needs to exist from day one. Free users tend to be loud but low-signal, and adding pricing later often feels like a bait-and-switch. A “free core, paid extras” split makes sense here, and sync across devices is a pretty reasonable line, the people who really rely on the tool will self-select into paying.",

That’s also where I think this sub can be the most useful for a founder. There’s 2m subscribers - someone or the other can speak to a posted problem.\n\nBut the “I will not promote” rule (which I’m not opposed to) creates a perverse incentive for founders to poorly couch promotion as a validation question. These are easy to sniff out - along with a problem statement, they also include a solution.\n\nThe people actually trying to validate get drowned out. That’s why I’m proposing a new label to help these types of posts stay useful. \n\nThis is how I propose this label be used - OP posts a problem they’re facing and asks questions only around the problem.\n\n\\- How they uncovered the problem\n\n\\- Is it an *n of 1* problem\n\n\\- How big the problem space could be\n\n\\- what are adjacent (solved or unsolved) problem spaces\n\nI love early stage startups - I’ve built a couple and now invest in them.

You will find the small business subreddit has added a no 'market research' rule simply because of such flagrant, transparent abuse.\n\nNonetheless, you have sparked an interesting discussions topic. In the completely aboveboard and wholly innocent spirt of your proposal, allow me to suggestion one of my own.\n\nNo Mischief. I was going to use no bullshit, but this does seem to be the (slightly) more diplomatic slant. As bullshit is so prevalent it would cast far too wide a net, snaring those blundering obliviously. I don't have a problem with that, but I could see how others might.\n\nIn light of Reddit's notorious back ally DM  being poorly managed, this seemed a compromise.\n\nPeople have asked such things as which type of press-on nails would be right to offer. They post ideas clearly targeted at prospects not typical for startup founders or small business owners. They do this because they believe every businessperson has a copy of some book with all of the answers in it.\n\nAs for the topic of validation. That was long ago rendered an 'internet word' devoid of any useful meaning whatsoever. Now people post to startup, wantrepreneur and business forums, not for validation, but to get encouragement from those predisposed to tell them to go ahead with the brain farts continually passed-off as complete idea. Vaguely described. Simpering in presentation. Transparent of true motive.\n\nBut the unforgivable sin is artless in chicanery. Naïveté isn't a skill, yet everyone practices. Grifting is a skill, yet nobody will practice.\n\nThat is quite enough to deal with without this cheatcode seeking \"who ...me?\"",

Start with *service contracts* via ports or fleet managers (pay per cleaning / fuel delta), not capex sales.\n* **Validation**: Couriers won’t care about TRL or swarm logic. They care about *insurance, liability, and fouling delta vs last dry dock*. Measure that brutally.\n* **Ops risk**: “Works while moving” triggers regulatory + classification flags. Expect conservative pilots at anchor first.\n* **Moat**: Swarm + modular compute is nice, but defensibility will come from data (fouling patterns, fuel savings proofs), not hardware.\n\nYou’re early but on a real problem.

A few founders I know underestimated the ongoing service fees and the mental overhead of running a company in a country they do not live in. It can be fine at pre-revenue, just be clear on what problem you are solving by incorporating now versus waiting.

To mitigate that, any potential formation saving can be wiped out and then some.\n\nI would also look at who your customers are. From a B2C perspective whilst Estonia is not immediately a red-flag, there is a trust wobble when it has foreign shell behaviour; Italian ownership, vague address, etc...\n\nWhen you are B2B it has typically more scrutiny surrounding VAT, UBOs, bank accounts, governing law for contracting, data processing etc.\n\nDo it for the right reasons and it be fine, do it to save a relatively low amount then you'll be in for a shock.",

Here is how i am thinking about the GTM, but it seems so thin that i am wondering if i am getting the concept right and wether i have to think more and deeper about it.\n\nThe initial strategy is not to sell to enterprise directly, but rather sell to the professionals themselves with the idea that they like the tool and then request their company to get a subscription for the entire office (i think that was Notion or Figma strategy). The reason is that the product brings value for a single user and doesn't need networks (team features are extra). Also the pricing won't be too high not to try it. \n\nI will start selling at industry live events. I think that will be an opportunity to both sell and get much more instantenious feedback. I also plan on trying to pay for some visibility at events (sponsorship with ability to present etc.)\n\nAnother channel would be through Linkedin Sales Navigator. I experimented a bit and it does identify good leads. \n\nNext would be cold e-mails. In this profession it is common to have public e-mails so i will use that. \n\nI will try industry specific influencers, although this is quite a dry area. \n\nLast, search ads would be the best because the tool is providing intelligence and i want them to get a sample of the tool when they are searching for the information i will provide. \n\nSo is this enough for my first pitch on GTM or am i missing something?",

A group of people who believe you 'fire the boss' wouldn't conclude that guy did anything useful.\n\nYou don't care. You wanted blind encouragement. Okay.

The other potential competitors don't have pricing available, you have to solicit a demo etc., which makes the sell cycle long and tedious. I want to give the opportunity to professionals to try it out quickly and get the benefits as quickly.\n\nI am thinking that the customer journey bottom-up would look like this: following events and other chanels, a single professionals tries oyt the platform or even buy the subscription, eventually either they reach out to the boss saying this is a tool that the whole team needs (they would get some extra festures opened up such as collaboration etc) or i nudge them with an in app message. Alternatively based on their signup e-mail i can see if they are part of a bigger organization and try to reach it directly. I confess that as i am writing this, i am also seeing a flimsy case here, but i guess without at least a launch and some customer loops i cannot think of better way to approach this problem other than hiring dedicated sales people, which i thought i would do after some traction in the independent sector.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nJust offering an update here. Thanks so much for the comments and advice on my earlier post.\n\nSo since that last post in the last 3 days I've got a bit more to share.\n\n \n\nRight now I decided to tap into the tuition idea. Basically I went on Facebook groups to try and find tutors/students. That wasn't too successful because all my group posts kept on being pended and not published. The thing I realised though is that I don't need to make group posts I can just DM people in that group although I'm yet to try that method yet. The positive from this I got in contact with an English tutor who is open to \"work for me\" from Spain - and I'm in the process of finding English students for her.\n\n \n\nI've also been trying to find tutors/students through Reddit. I actually found a prospective student who is struggling with Spanish a bit and is willing to pay for classes a few times a week for a month as his exam is in a months time. The thing is right now I don't know any tutors who teach spanish - i've asked one of my friends in my grade and also another friend who graduated last year if they know anyone and they're yet to respond.\n\n \n\nBut guys this is the big issue. I'm going into the last year of high school in a challenging curriculum. Obviously right now I can work on this business because school doesn't start till just under a month. The problem is that as soon as school starts it's going to be very very difficult to manage this business. Like that friend I mentioned earlier I asked to help find connections, he also agrees and he won't be able to help me like he is now. Like I want to make some money and get some good skills in this stuff but its important I get a good result in my final year. I started this business so come next year when I go to uni I'll have a foundation for a business, maybe I was too unrealistic in my expectations but I simply can't deal with all this stress the business brings especially when I'm in my final year. Towards the end of the year when exams start and also when assignments have to be submitted I'm going to have to temporarily shut off from the business. Like yesterday I did a bit of school work but I couldn't do everything I wanted because of how much time the business stuff took - I ended up going to bed stressed and burnt-out last night. Also another thing in terms of foundation, something else I would want to have by next year is to have a bit of a social media following for the business on insta/tiktok - what do I post though?\n\nAlso I'm not giving up on that resources idea - do you think it's more doable for my scenario right now?\n\n \n\nThanks alot!\n\n \n\nPS - do I need a cofounder I've been considering to help me with this the thing is they're gonna have to not be a friend as I need someone who can do alot of work so maybe someone in uni?",

That self-awareness is rare, especially at your age.\n\nWhat you’re feeling is a very real trade-off, not a personal failure. Running anything that involves people, scheduling, payments, and expectations is mentally expensive, and that cost doesn’t show up on paper.\n\nIf you’re heading into your final year, it’s completely reasonable to treat this as an experiment, not a full business yet. Pausing or scaling it way down during exams isn’t “giving up”, it’s prioritising.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn’t add a cofounder right now. Coordination overhead alone will add more stress, not less, especially if you’re still figuring out the model.\n\nA resources-based idea or something asynchronous might fit your situation better, since it doesn’t require constant availability. That kind of foundation is much easier to pick back up later.\n\nYou’re already learning valuable things here. Don’t burn yourself out trying to force it all at once.",

The resources idea is more forgiving because you can build it in bursts and pause without breaking trust. You do not need a cofounder yet, you need a simpler version of the problem that fits your time reality. Finishing school strong is not quitting, it is buying yourself more optionality later.",

Moreover, I want to be able to really think about a B2C route but so far I feel concentrating on career centers and guaranteeing annual revenues is a more viable strategy for me.\n\nRight now, my entire app has been coded completely through vibe-coding (yes, I know) such as Antigravity and Cursor. I only spent maybe $200 so far on contractors from Upwork and I intend to keep spending extremely lean.\n\nI don't know if it's worth trying to spend more of my personal money on this project or if I should just keep vibe-coding because I'm not sure if it's worth trying to pay someone just so I can get for FERPA/GDPR compliance and make sure data is absolutely secured when I don't even have revenue.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n* Is it worth investing money in compliance/security before revenue, or should I wait?\n* At what point does “good enough for pilots” become “you need to do this properly”?\n* Would you keep vibe-coding and validating, or spend a few thousand now to future-proof it?\n\nAppreciate any honest perspectives here!

It will mean they don’t value your product and put in the relevant approvals and governance to make it work. Even a tiny charge makes them think properly about it. So deffo charge!",

The strange thing is however, that any money will mean that true business level requirements come out of the woodwork. When they have to pay (and justify any cost to their boss) you’ll find that they will suddenly start to tell you exactly what they need from this app for their boss to see it as a success, and thats the info you need to hit product market fit and move forwards. \n\nWithout any money on the table, they have no skin in the game. It makes it a nice toy for them and they won’t take it seriously. They’ll give you random feedback (by accident) because they don’t need to justify it to their boss (so they’ll end up feeding back on things that matter to them, instead of the business - given it’s not their money, their feedback is not as important as their bosses..)\n\nA paid pilot is just like a free one except they pay for it if it works. To work out how to craft your offer, you need to know:\n1. What is the problem you’re solving for them\n2. What is the cost of the current way they solve that problem \n3. What the success criteria are (i.e how much they need to improve on the current situation for it to be worth while to them). \n\nOnce you know the above, you write into the contract that if you complete [answer to question 1] and achieve [success criteria from number], then they will pay ~50% of [answer to question 2]. \n* You absorb all the risk by saying that if you don’t hit the success criteria, they can keep using it for free until you do on the condition they give you useful feedback, access to data etc to get it to work. \n\nRather than trying to do this with new customers, focus on getting a single (paying) customer over the line first. You can raise money from investors with a single contract usually (I did from VC) and getting a technical cofounder to join an startup to unpack the vibe coded app will be vastly easier with a single contract.",

There's a ton of privacy concerns, GDPR requirements, and legislative compliance that you simply cannot vibe code. \n\nThat's not a skill issue. It's just not something you should be piecing together yourself.\n\nHere's my advice: take this as far as you can with vibe coding. Get to a point where you have a demo you can show, maybe even get people to sign up for a beta. But the moment conversations turn to GDPR compliance, security protocols, and data handling? That's when you stop and bring in a professional.\n\nI made the mistake of thinking I could do it all. Then I'd put my project in front of a serious audience and got hit with questions like:\n\n* How do I know my data is secure? \n* Is everything encrypted?\n* What's stopping someone from breaking in? \n\nI had no good answers.\n\nSo ask yourself: am I ready to invest some money to get the security features that will take this to the next level?\n\nAlso - shout out to Upwork, by the way. I've worked with multiple teams from there by breaking down exactly what I needed and put it into a contract: security, Google OAuth, whatever. You can find people on there that are experts. They know what to do. You're not asking them to paint the Sistine Chapel. You're giving them a clear problem they've solved a hundred times. You can find solid help for $20–50/hour depending on your budget.\n\nLook at your system, identify the weak points, and hire accordingly.\n\n**TL;DR:** You don't know what you don't know. Get the MVP as far as you can, then put the specialized stuff in expert hands. If this has real potential, you'll need to invest some money to make it secure and compliant. That's just the reality.\n\nHappy to chat more if you have questions.",

Your goal is proving the value proposition, not building Fort Knox. Universities agreeing to pilots is already validation that you're solving a real problem.\n\n\n\nWait to spend serious money until you have:\n\n1. Paying customers (not just pilots) - shows willingness to pay\n\n2. Clear path to $10k+ MRR - proves unit economics work\n\n3. Customers actually asking about security/compliance - signals real concern\n\n\n\nFor FERPA/GDPR specifically: Most universities won't enforce strict compliance during unpaid pilots. But once money changes hands, legal gets involved. So timeline:\n\n\\- Pilots: Document your security practices, be transparent about current state\n\n\\- First paid deals: Get basic SOC2/compliance in order ($5-10k)\n\n\\- Scale phase: Full audit/certification\n\n\n\nThe risk isn't just money wasted - it's distraction. Spending $3k on compliance now takes focus away from product-market fit, which is your only job right now.\n\n\n\nThat said, avoid storing sensitive student data during pilots if possible. Even basic encryption at rest helps.",

Sometimes they may set up a posting to gather some competitive intel about the market by interviewing candidates when they aren’t totally sure if they want to hire or not. Sometimes they may have a specific person they want to hire but have a reason they need to post the job anyway (for h1b sponsorship for example).  But most postings will be legit at the time they are posted - though startups are probably uniquely bad (by dint of being understaffed and busy) at removing or updating postings if their priorities change or if they hire someone. And big companies aren’t great at this either!\n\nOnline postings are a terrible way to hire. You get hundreds or thousands of applications, including mediocre applicants, scams, people carpet bombing irrelevant posts, etc. So you make the postings as a backup plan it but if you’re a startup you probably don’t do a good job reviewing the resumes, etc because the high quality candidates are coming through other channels like referrals or networking.\n\nSeparately, you may think you’re a great candidate for a startup but in general at least at my company people who only have “big company” are not first preferred candidates. They have learned a lot of unhelpful norms for startups - they may be low agency, they may be used to cultures where you don’t “just do stuff” because there are preferred processes or gating meetings or whatever, they may be trained to “stay in their lane” for whatever reason, etc. Even great engineers can be very different quality team members in different environments. And good engineers at great large companies often lack humility and curiosity about these shortcomings. Just something worth reflecting on as you seek out entrepreneurial roles.",

For my first app before I even launched I was super active in relevant subreddits. I wasnt pushing the app just genuinely participating answering questions and offering advice. Then when I had something tangible Id mention it organically in conversations where it made sense. That earned me a lot more goodwill (and sign-ups) than any cold outreach ever did. What I found most challenging was just keeping up with all the conversations. Theres a lot of noise and sifting through it to find the relevant threads was a real time sink. I ended up building a tool for myself that scans Reddit Twitter and even LinkedIn now looking for conversations where my app or similar topics are being discussed. It started as a way for me to save time and not miss opportunities to connect with potential users. Its pretty focused on finding actual conversations not just keyword mentions so the quality is way higher. Its what brought me to this post its now my main thing. Might be something that could help you surface the right conversations without having to spend hours scrolling. If it sounds like it could be useful let me know and I can show you what it is.",
