Met the co-founders through a mutual connection early in my career, jumped in because it seemed like a killer learning opp at this stage.But damn, we're not aligned at all anymore. Moves feel desperate just to scrape by and raise enough cash to stay afloat.\n\nEveryone's learning on the fly—capabilities grow with time and hustle, so we don't need rockstar pros day one. We just need diligent folks who grind out solutions. Fair enough... but it's total bullshit how this only applies to their team, not mine. I don't trash-talk or lowball anyone on my squad, but I'm constantly under fire for timelines while they get a pass.\n\n I'm skilled enough to know when shit's unrealistic, but that doesn't matter.Now I feel straight-up like an employee in my own startup. Don't wanna turn into one of those ego-fueled assholes like Bhavish Aggarwal that every Indian founder seems to idolize. \n\nThe zero empathy and constant blame game is making everything toxic and unfulfilling as hell. To even get heard, I gotta play their game and turn into the same dick.Blaming the team for leadership's competence gaps ain't right. I'm the only one owning my fuck-ups openly (at least publicly), but they won't. \n\nMentally, I'm back in notice-period hell, eyeing the exit.Anyone been here? How'd you decide to bounce without torching your rep, future funding rounds, or job prospects? Tips on smooth exits or better startup ops to jump into next? I need to learn things I missed here and if this is very common I definitely need to learn how to mitigate this, so I feel it's time to work closely with seasoned entrepreneur and not the type my current co-founders are.

Really nobody cares about the reputation, the world is a big place.  Your experience, knowledge, ambition and successes are most of it. \n\nOne warning, it's extremely difficult to find the perfect fit that doesn't end up in the same situation you're already in.  One fact I've come to accept (for me) is that once I lose faith in a company/team, there is nothing that is going to fix that, The best action is to not wait, start looking for something new.  Be patient, not hasty and wait it out while you fully commit to finding a new job.",

Besides the emotional and physical damage I endured, after I left, the company failed. I learned a lot in the role and the experience, I gained accelerated my growth and skills.

          "text": "This sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a governance and expectations problem. Feeling like an employee usually shows up when decision rights, accountability, and ownership were never made explicit, or stopped being respected as the company got stressed. Early stage teams vary a lot here, and cash pressure tends to surface the worst versions of existing dynamics rather than create new ones. The question I would ask is whether there is any realistic path to resetting how decisions and blame are handled, or whether the pattern is now locked in. If it is the latter, staying longer rarely fixes it and often just normalizes behavior you do not want to carry forward. A clean exit usually comes from being boring and factual, framing it as misalignment on execution and leadership style, documenting handoffs, and avoiding moral arguments. Most experienced founders recognize this story more than they admit, and it usually hurts less to leave than to slowly burn out while still technically in charge.",

You just havent admitted it yet.\n\nI had a cofounder situation that sounds similar. Not toxic in the obvious way. Nobody was yelling. But there was this constant undercurrent of my team being held to different standards than theirs. I would flag unrealistic timelines and get treated like I was making excuses while they missed their own deadlines with zero accountability.\n\nThe turning point for me was realizing I was spending more energy managing the cofounders feelings than I was building the actual product. That ratio tells you everything you need to know.\n\nHeres what I wish I had done differently: left sooner and with a clearer head. Instead I waited until I was so burned out that my exit was messy and emotional. I said things I regret. I left equity on the table because I just wanted to be done.\n\nPractical advice for your exit:\n\n1. Document everything now. Every decision, every timeline, every commitment that was missed. Not to use as ammunition but to protect yourself if things get ugly later.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before you tell your cofounders. Understand your equity situation, your vesting cliff, and what happens to your shares if you leave. This conversation costs a few hundred dollars and can save you hundreds of thousands.\n\n3. When you do tell them, keep it short and professional. \"I have decided to move on\" is enough. Dont explain, dont justify, dont give them material to argue with. The conversation you want to have about why wont change anything.\n\nThe fact that you are writing this post means you already know the answer. You just need someone to tell you its okay to leave something you helped build.",

Misalignment around accountability and empathy only gets louder under pressure, especially when cash is tight. I have seen exits go cleanest when people document their scope, deliverables, and decision history before making any move. It keeps things factual and reduces the emotional rewriting later. If leadership refuses to own gaps, that culture rarely flips without a major reset. Leaving without burning bridges is less about being quiet and more about being consistent and professional on the way out. Also worth reflecting on what you would screen for harder next time, especially around how founders handle blame and stress.",

When I’ve seen founders navigate this, a few things helped: **Document everything clearly**: timelines, agreements, contributions.

      "text": "A lot of people keep asking how to chose or find a co-founder. I have had my fair share of this issue with 3 startups and how to find a co-founder. Twice I needed to find a business acumen co-founder as I am a techie myself and a third time I needed a very highly capable tech co-founder as the idea and the product had grown beyond my tech capabilities. Let me tell you what all went wrong.\n\n\n\n1. First startup: I knew I needed someone who could raise funds for the company which requires very special skills and hence looked in my network, found someone whom I did not know personally but was a heck of a person in story telling (which is the most important aspect when it comes to fund raising). We worked together for almost 18 months and I realised that my co-founder was acting more like a PE fund manager who needed a cut in the funds he/she raised. I got a realisation that I had made the wrong choice as the person was not a company-first thought person but ‘what is in it for me’ person. I have nothing against people who think of their gains before company gains, but as a cofounder it has to be a commitment to the company first approach. The company I sold hastily as I knew we were not going anywhere so thank god it was not completely futile.\n2. Second Startup: I joined hands with a person whom I knew for more than a decade so this time I knew that I am working with someone whom I trust. However, slowly I realised that we were not aligned on ethics. While, for me everything is wither white or black, for him everything was grey and he operated like that only. He would make commitments which we could not fulfil, he would tell numbers that were not true or realistic. However, he was faring well and the company started to do phenomenal. I would go to office every day, make lies to truth, work on hiding actual numbers, create hypothetical scenarios and mark them as reality… This continued to 8-10 months when one fine day I just gave up and relinquished my 47% equity and moved on as I could not handle lying each day. The company has done well and is a household name now.\n3. Third Startup: I needed a tech co-founder who knew more than I did and I moved to a business role (learnings from the two startups helped). From day 0 we connected (while we had not spent more than 2 hours together before I offered him the co-founder role) and worked in unison. While everyone said that co-founders need to have difference of opinion, we seldom did. We reached a state where we would complete each other’s sentences. The company has been doing well (not a unicorn but we are well known now) and we still operate in the same manner.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I realised in the last 13 years, when you are looking for a co-founder… Remember there has to be a compatibility on VALUES. If your values are not aligned, never work together. While we are very very careful in choosing a life partner, we need to be equally careful (if not more) in choosing our co-founder. This is the reason why I have taken the approach that even when hiring, I look for values alignment rather than quantification or capability. I am happy to hire or work with a person who is 8/10 on capability and 10/10 on values alignment vs 8/10 on values alignment and 10/10 on capabilities.",

I passed and he went on to build something successful, but I wouldve burned out trying to keep up with the narrative gymnastics.

So we waiting almost 15 mins to get a place. Even though we were hungry, we still remained calm and waited patiently (not asking the guy at the entry every 5 mins on how much time would it take)…. This clearly showed that the person had a major requirement in a startup ‘patience’… After all, in a startup you need to be patient (at least this is what I feel)\n2. Cue 02: The waiter got our orders wrong (may be he brought something which was ordered by another table). We were hungry and realising that our order was wrong, it was frustrating. When he called the waiter politely and said that our orders were wrong, the waiter apologised and took away the dishes from our table. I asked him, you did not get angry at the waiter? He said… No point getting angry at someone for a mistake… I am sure he did not do it purposely. This clearly showed how he would handle the team (I already had a team of 12 developers) and understand every person’s perspective.\n3. Cue 03: We were talking at length and discussed about family, kids, parents and a lot more… I could see that he thought in the same way about relationships the way I did\n\n\n\nIn all, we did not discuss the startup for more than 5 mins, but we knew we would click together if we worked together.

Your customers may not know what they actually want.  You may hit the product right but the customers are on another time frame.

Distribution feels scary because the feedback is delayed and personal (someone might say no, or worse, ignore you).\n\n  \nWhat helped: I started treating distribution like a build problem. Instead of \"I need to reach out to people\" (scary, vague), I'd break it into tiny mechanical steps. Write one message. Send it. Write another. No thinking about outcomes, just executing the process. Same way you'd write a function, test it, move on.\n\n  \nThe other thing -- the discomfort never fully goes away, but it does get boring. After enough cold outreach or posts that flop, your nervous system just stops caring as much. The first 20 are brutal. After 100 it's just Tuesday.\n\n  \nOne more thing that made a huge difference: I stopped trying to sell in outreach and started asking questions instead. \"Hey, I'm building X, can I get your take on this?\" People love giving advice. It takes all the pressure off because you're genuinely learning, not performing. And weirdly, those conversations convert way better than any pitch.",

And curiosity isn't draining the way pitching is.\n\n2. **The 10-minute rule** - you don't need to do 4 hours of outreach. You need 10 minutes, 5 days a week. That's 5 conversations. After a month, you've talked to 100+ people. Compounding applies to relationships too.\n\n3. **Build IN distribution channels** - instead of building then distributing, build WHERE your customers already are. Answer questions on Reddit. Comment on LinkedIn posts. Share your process publicly. The building IS the distribution.\n\n4. **The uncomfortable truth** - nobody cares about your product as much as you do. And that's okay. They care about their problem. When you lead with \"here's how I can help with YOUR problem\" instead of \"here's what I built,\" the emotional dynamic completely changes.\n\nWhat are you building?

Instead of cold outreach to strangers, I reached out to former colleagues, people Id helped before, anyone who already knew my work. Those conversations felt way less scary and gave me confidence that what I built actually mattered to people.\n\nThe emotional management thing is spot on though.

Is there a path that doesn't require 10K followers, burning VC dollars, or becoming an influencer?\n\n**EDIT:** This largely applies to B2C products\n\nCurious what's worked for people who are better at building than marketing - please share your thoughts!",

In my first startup over 15 years ago now, we tried so many different things; online ads, magazine ads, trade fairs, meet ups, sponsorships - you name it, we tried it. Some of these found customers, others only raised awareness. Success doesn’t come easy for most people, it takes take. All of these things work to some extent, but there’s no silver bullet and none work as well as you hope.\n\nThe best advice is to spend time talking to real people in person, learning more about the challenges you want to solve. Start with friends and family. Don’t expect to make lots of money quickly, but aim to create growing momentum. Your customers are your biggest advocates - we sold more via word of mouth than any other channel. \n\nBest of luck!",

You can learn that shit in a single afternoon.\n\nThe difficult part is knowing who you're selling to, knowing their very specific pain points, and convincing them that your product is the best solution to those problems. If you know how to do that, you just have to hire creators to execute on your vision and the rest is honestly pretty simple.\n\nThe catch is, this isn't something that just *anyone* can do. The best creative strategist is gonna fail horribly if your product is shit, which applies to probably 95% of the shit that gets spammed in r/SaaS and the like.\n\nYour first initial creatives is probably gonna suck, but if you have a genuinely good product you will get *some* sales. You might not get a positive ROI on your ad spend right away but it won't ALL be a loss, so consider that your tuition fee / learning tax.

Their users become your distribution. This is basically renting their trust.\n\n3. **\"Watering hole\" strategy** - Your ICP hangs out somewhere specific.

Things like targeting a particular workflow pain where users naturally talk to each other, or building something that replaces an existing manual process and spreads inside a team. A lot of solo builders underestimate how much “distribution” can come from narrow positioning and clear use cases, even with small absolute numbers. the hard part is that this usually forces tougher product constraints and slower iteration early on. It also means killing ideas that are fun to build but have no natural path to being discovered.

These days I can do a similar thing, run 30$ a day to validate an idea and it works. - only thing that has changed dramatically is the creative , having good ad content makes this possible (learn how to do basic design + video editing helps tremendously)\n\nSecond thing I can say is start planting the seed, I think Alex Hormozi has some incredible material, the full 100m$ leads video course on youtube is gold!\n\nI would study the hell out of lead generation and lead magnets, defining your funnel and what channels are you using to push people further down the funnel, you are B2C - i would even explore B2B2C options and launch cold email campaigns to other business that already have your buyers, giving a % of sales that come from them (example a mortgage brokerage partners with real estate agencies to facilitate their buyers mortgages, gives the agency a 10-20% kick back)\n\nIt’s really exciting, understanding the psychology of it all is when the matrix unlocks - once you see it you can never un-see it. 🙂",

The other game changer was shrinking my validation timeline - instead of waiting for a \"finished\" product, I started testing core assumptions way earlier with basic prototypes and landing pages. Even getting 10 people to sign up for a waitlist or pay a small pre-order gave me enough signal to quiet that revenue anxiety. The key was making the feedback loop as short as possible, so I wasn't operating in a complete vacuum for months. Also learned to track leading indicators instead of just obsessing over the big outcome - like daily progress on features, weekly user interviews, monthly prototype tests. Gave my brain something concrete to focus on instead of spiraling about hypothetical futures.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.\n\n",

I stopped calling it a launch and started calling it a test. A test can fail and that is fine. A launch feels permanent.\n\n  \n2. I got 3 people to pay me before the product was done. Not a waitlist, actual money (even small amounts). Having someone pay $20 for early access gave me more confidence than 6 months of building alone ever did. It also forced me to talk to real humans which broke the isolation spiral.\n\n  \n3. I set a hard rule: no thinking about the business after 7pm. Sounds impossible but the anxiety feeds on rumination. When I cut the rumination window, the anxiety dropped way more than I expected.\n\n  \nThe overthinking you are describing is not a focus problem. It is a feedback problem. You have zero signal from the real world so your brain fills the gap with worst case scenarios. The fastest fix is getting any signal at all, even negative signal, because at least then you are reacting to reality instead of imagined futures.",

It’s more like a living hypothesis that you keep stress testing against reality. The inputs you listed mission, customer feedback, market dynamics, delivery constraints are exactly the right ones. The trick is not trying to freeze them into something permanent, but giving yourself a structure that helps you decide what matters right now.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is treating strategy as a lightweight decision filter rather than a roadmap you must defend. Write it down not to be right, but so you can notice when new information actually changes the underlying assumptions versus when it’s just noise. That way, when an email from a prospect shows up, you can ask “does this invalidate our current bet, or is it just one data point?”\n\nThe fact that you’re already capturing where you are, where you’re aiming, and why in something shareable is honestly the hard part. The weekly churn doesn’t mean the strategy failed. It means the document is doing its job by giving the team a common reference point to react to and refine together.",

          "text": "This is an area where many businesses fail, because they chase features that they think excite the target customer but for which these customers wont pay.\n\nYou have two types of features.\n\n1. Features that solve the problems for your target market. As an example, if you were selling an accounting system to customers than ran US only businesses like an ETSY account, the features you need are simple. Tracking income and expenses. You would not then proceed to add support for multiple currencies. Multiple currencies are only needed if you plan to expand your addressable market, i.e., people that sell internationally. So first lesson, understand your target customers and the problems they need solved that they are willing to pay for. Only add features that specifically add value for teh customer and that they are willing to pay for.\n2. Once you have identified the required features for your target market, and you have delivered them, you need to figure out how to grow your market share. You do that, not by adding more cool stuff but by asking how can I improve my customer experience. If we go back to accounting for US businesses that might be, the ability to connect with the business bank account and automatically download and match income and expenses, or even a feature that simplifies expense tracking.\n\nSo ask yourself what am I trying to do\n\nI am trying to grow my market share within my existing market - focus on customer experience  \nI am trying to expand my addressable market - solve the problems for these new target customers\n\nOne more thing. As you consider what features you want to ask, consider when you rank them, how they might improve margins, e.g., if I add this feature that will reduce my COGS by 10%, will that return more profit than a feature that increases my customers by 10%. Or even, if I spend money not on features but quality, will that expense reduce customer churn leading to longer term recurring revenue.\n\nEdit - A comment on strategy\n\nStrategy is\n\nWho is my target audience  \nWhat problems do they need solving  \nWhy will they buy from me and not my competition\n\nIf your strategy contains numbers (increase revenue by 10%, broaden our markey by 20%) it is not a strategy it is a strategic goal. Furthermore if it contains broad statements like - be the world leader in \\[insert industry here\\], it is not a strategy, it is an aspiration.",

Yes, I'd say that's practically a defining feature of startups, relatively speaking.\n\nBut your question is about regressions. \n\nRegressions are accepted as normal in some organizations (Facebook's infamous \"move fast and break things\"), and are considered significant failures in others (Stripe's [zero downtime](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations) comes to mind). \n\nThere are obviously tradeoffs to both approaches--Facebook's users will tolerate bugs for neat features; Stripe's users will **not** tolerate losing money to downtime. \n\n**Regressions are a tech problem caused by a culture problem.** Every mistake is an opportunity to ensure your team never makes the same category of mistake again, but ensuring that the mistake never happens again takes a lot more work than fixing the bug and moving on. \n\nYou will need to accept that your team will move more slowly in the short term, and may have to completely stop adding new features for a while as they clear tech debt. Tech debt increases the chances that something will break in the future. \n\nBut again, this is a culture problem, because you are tolerating regressions, which follows tolerating bad practices. \n\nAI can help a lot. In my own workflow, I try to add automated test coverage as regressions happen to ensure every class of bug does not re-occur. \n\nAlso, you have developer**s**, plural, and no QA/QC staff? Catching this stuff is the job of a QA/QC person. Might consider making that your next hire before asking your devs to test their work more thoroughly. ",

Stop tracking work in a Google Sheet. Move to Linear or even just GitHub Issues. Sheets have no accountability trail, no status tracking, and things fall through the cracks constantly. A proper tool makes it obvious what is done, what is in progress, and what got skipped.\n\n  \n2. Require a screen recording with every delivery. Before they mark something done, they record a 2 min Loom showing it works. This alone cut my regression rate in half because they actually had to test it themselves before sending the video.\n\n  \n3. Define \"done\" explicitly. \"Done\" means it works on the main flow, does not break existing features, and has been tested on at least one real device or browser. If you do not define it, their version of done will always be different from yours.\n\n  \n4. On finding a technical cofounder, honestly the best way is to hang out where technical people already are. Contribute to open source discussions, go to local meetups, or post on places like YC cofounder matching. Cold outreach rarely works. People want to see you are serious about the problem before they commit.\n\n  \nThe stress does not fully go away but it gets way more manageable once you have a system.

      "text": "I (29M, single, no kids) need advice on what to do next. Based on the overview below, I'd like to hear what other people's ideas are / what people would do if they were in my position. I'd especially like to hear from people who have faced similar circumstances and what they did -- although all are open to opine.\n\nI have had a bumpy career. I studied math in undergrad; did a masters in statistics (all of this was paid for by scholarship, no loans are dragging me down). Good grades. Not worried there.\n\nI briefly worked at a prestigious company doing some compliance (9 months). I was then poached by a hedge fund to work on their acquisitions team (left after 1.5 years). I made good money and the work was good, too; the people were the stuff of nightmares (my stories would sound fake and a coworker once said she \"wouldn't believe me except for the fact that she saw it herself\"). I left and then helped manage an endowment (\\~3 years).\n\nThe endowment was fine but was \"bad\" in the sense that I was severely understimulated. It was boring beyond belief. After saving some money, I ended up leaving to try starting my own company.\n\nThe new company is going alright. I've been at it for about 8 months. These last few weeks, I started running ads / doing marketing. It is still in its infancy. I genuinely believe it can make a lot of money, assuming I can work out the kinks. It is getting interest; good internet traffic; and I'm about to close my first transaction after about 1 week of ads.\n\nThe problem is that I am running out of money. I still have enough of my own savings for about 9-12 more months (before dipping into retirement funds). I had planned to start looking for a new job in about a month if things weren't immediately promising. This is because, on average, it takes about 6-9 months to get a job if you do not currently have one. I am prepared for a longer search.\n\nI do not know if I should continue to try growing this on the side (which, admittedly, would be very difficult, if not impossible to do). I have thought about trying to raise some funding but want to wait until I have more of a steady flow of revenue before trying to scale -- the business is very ad-spend dependent and some processes need to be worked out before I feel very confident I could return my investor money. Also, having this working revenue flow would make it much easier to raise money.\n\nI could go back to \"high finance\" but it would put me in a position that is \"more junior,\" assuming I return to the same vein as before. This is a possible route but I would have to give up any chance of starting my own thing. This is because I'd probably be working 60-80 weeks. I'm also getting older and those hours are just killer. I think I'd be miserable.\n\nI have a technical background and could probably make the switch to software development / something in that realm. However, I'd be starting all over, and I've heard the job market isn't exactly popping in that sector. It'd also be a lot of work prepping for interviews -- I'm rusty, and I'd have to re-learn a lot.\n\nIdeally, I'd be able to get a job at a new company / startup where I'd be able to earn equity, help the company grow, get valuable business-building experience, then leave and try starting something again.\n\nI've put together a few things that I think will help me pick a new career.\n\nI know this is bad, but I need to make at least $150K+ based on my past jobs.\n\nI'd prefer to like my coworkers but I'd take ones I don't hate.\n\nI need a job that is semi-social.\n\nI need a job that has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI need a job that is stimulating / will let my position \"matter.\" At the endowment, if I didn't do my job for a week or so, I'm pretty sure nothing would change.\n\nSo, my questions are...\n\n* Would you try raising funding?\n   * It'd have a small chance of happening but I am pre-revenue and that is a huge limiter. I think I could make an argument that I have a good \"path to revenue\" but, realistically, you don't know that it'll work out until you are actually generating revenue.\n* Would you go back to a high-paying career at a more junior role, eat shit for a while, and maybe burn out?\n* Would you try switching fields altogether into one that is struggling with extra uncertainty?\n* Would you try finding a new gig doing something perhaps more ambiguous, taking less money, and see if you can get an equity stake in something?\n\nI'd be happy to hear advice that individuals may have that could help with the decision calculus here.",

Something 20-30 hours a week that pays $10-15k/month. Your stats background plus hedge fund experience makes this very doable on platforms like Toptal, or just reaching out to former colleagues who need help with quantitative projects. This buys you 12+ more months of runway without giving up equity or burning out in a 70 hour week finance role.\n\n  \nMeanwhile keep running the startup on the side. If the ads keep converting, double down. If they stall after a month or two, at least you have income and can pivot without desperation.\n\n  \nThe worst position to be in is fundraising when you are running out of money. Investors smell desperation. The second worst is taking a soul-crushing job that kills the startup entirely.\n\n  \nThe middle path (consulting + building) is harder to execute but it keeps all your options open.

I know marketing and distribution and iterating on user feedback is important, but it’s not my expertise. And I think that’s the same for a lot of first time builder-founders.  \n\nAfter a lot of talking with others who have more experience launching a product and raising funds, I was able to devise a cohesive plans for next steps. Once I had that clarity, the burnout went away because it became a new challenge to solve rather. Almost like an entirely new project.  \n\nBut before you get that clarity, it feels like burnout because there’s a sense of whether all your work was worth it. After you have the clarity, it’s not a question of if it was worth it, but how to make sure your efforts don’t go to waste.",

For example you have to maintain a DB server and it backups, you also have to maintain compliance for the various frameworks you are require meet.

I can tell you right now most places can’t even agree on how system requirements and then how to implement a SaaS let alone build it. And even if, by the grace of the divine, a SaaS is rolled out, it’s only as good as the next guy who thinks they know better. Are there some exceptions? Yes and are there some things that really should just be brought in house easily (like a bespoke CRM for say aged care, meeting room booking system, or a truly bespoke system where the are few competitors and none of them really match needs/budget). At any rate, the work to build those SaaS’s are likely to go to a consultant and I can tell you right now that list of trusted AI vibe code consultancies does not exist yet.

If AI makes it cheaper to build competing tools and the big platforms (Google, Meta) keep pulling more of the ad stack in-house, you get squeezed from both sides.\n\nPeople will always want this. The question is whether a specific product can hold pricing power when the cost of building a competitor keeps dropping.

      "text": "I’ve built (and helped build) a few mobile app MVPs now, and if there’s one pattern I’ve seen repeatedly, it’s this: most MVPs don’t fail because of bad tech. They fail because money gets spent too early, in the wrong places, for the wrong reasons.\n\nWhen I built my first MVP, I assumed “lean” meant cheaper development. What I didn’t understand was that lean is really about decision discipline.\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was trying to make the MVP feel complete. I wasn’t solving a single sharp problem; I was trying to impress imaginary users. The result was predictable, more screens, more logic, more time, and a rapidly shrinking budget.\n\nWhat changed things for me was shifting how I defined an MVP. I stopped seeing it as a product and started treating it as a question. Every feature had to earn its place by answering one thing: *Will someone actually use this to solve a real problem?*\n\nBefore writing code now, I validate in uncomfortable ways. I put up simple landing pages. I share rough prototypes. I talk to people who might actually use the app, not just friends who want to be supportive. If users won’t take a small action, sign up, reply, give feedback, I don’t build.\n\nAnother expensive lesson was skipping clarity. Early on, I’d say things like “it’s a simple app” or “we’ll refine this later.” That lack of detail always came back as extra development hours. Today, I spend more time mapping user flows than choosing tech stacks. Clear flows save more money than cheap developers ever will.\n\nI also learned to stop overthinking scalability at the MVP stage. An MVP isn’t meant to scale. It’s meant to teach. Once I accepted that the first version might be rewritten or discarded entirely, decisions became easier and cheaper.\n\nFinally, I stopped treating launch as the finish line. That mindset burns budgets fast. Launch is when reality shows up, not when the work is done. Now, I budget for iteration, not perfection.\n\nIf you’re building a mobile app MVP, my honest advice is simple: slow down before you start coding. Validate harder than you think you need to. Build less than you want to. And remember, an MVP’s job isn’t to look good. It’s to reduce risk.\n\nThat shift alone can save you months of work and a serious amount of money.\n\n",

I've seen so many founders get caught up in debates about React vs Vue vs whatever when they don't even know if the core user journey makes sense.\n\nOne thing I'd add: there's a mental trap around the word \"simple.\" Every founder I've worked with who said \"it's just a simple X\" underestimated the project by at least 3x. Simple to explain is not simple to build. A \"simple\" chat feature touches auth, real-time infrastructure, notification systems, and message persistence. Now multiply that by every \"simple\" feature in your scope.\n\nThe budget for iteration point is huge too. The best MVPs I've seen allocated maybe 40% of their budget to building v1 and kept 60% in reserve for what they'd learn after launch. The founders who spent everything on launch day were the ones scrambling for bridge funding three months later.\n\nCurious what your typical validation timeline looks like before you feel confident enough to start development?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe're a two-person partnership startup team building a global, digital-only business with customers all over the world. Both of us are European citizens, and neither of us resides in the US or Hong Kong (or has any ties there). We're looking to incorporate remotely with as little hassle as possible – keeping initial setup costs low, ongoing expenses minimal, and tax requirements simple and low (ideally tax-free where feasible for our setup).\n\n**After a ton of research and narrowing things down, our top finalists are:**\n\n* Incorporating in the US, specifically in Wyoming or Delaware.\n* Incorporating in Hong Kong.\n\nBoth options seem pretty attractive on paper: relatively straightforward processes, low costs, and favorable tax treatment for non-residents like us (e.g., no state income tax in Wyoming/Delaware for foreign owners, and Hong Kong's territorial tax system). We're leaning slightly toward Wyoming right now because of its privacy features, low fees, and simplicity for LLCs, but we're still concerned about potential US tax complexities (like federal reporting) and general bureaucracy. Hong Kong looks super straightforward for offshore setups, but we'd probably need to hire a local accountant or tax advisor, which adds some ongoing cost.\n\nThat said, we're both total foreigners to these jurisdictions, so we're worried about hidden complexities or \"gotchas\" that might not show up in the initial guides. For example:\n\n* The US (especially Wyoming/Delaware) offers amazing access to banking, fintech tools (Stripe, PayPal, etc.), and investor networks, but I've read it's surprisingly tough for non-residents to open a US bank account without a physical presence or EIN complications. Is that true, and how do people work around it?\n* Hong Kong seems easy for remote incorporation and has great Asian market access, but are there banking hurdles for Europeans (e.g., needing a local director or facing KYC issues)? Also, any tax filing surprises even if we're not operating there?\n\n**Questions for anyone who's done this:**\n\n* What are the strongest pros/cons of Wyoming, Delaware, or Hong Kong specifically for a remote, foreign-owned digital startup like ours?\n* Any hidden bureaucracy, tax pitfalls, or compliance issues that hit foreigners hard? (E.g., US BOI reporting, HK audit requirements, or visa/banking roadblocks.)\n* Real-world experiences: How easy was it to set up and maintain? Did you need lawyers/accountants, and what did it cost? Any recommendations for services that handle this remotely for non-residents?\n\nIf you've compared these directly, which one would you pick for low-hassle global ops?\n\nThanks in advance – any insights would be huge as we finalize this decision!",

Estonia is amazing for low cost set up, tax advantages and if you happen to raise money from European VCs,funds, it would be so easy for you guys. As I am aware, lots of UK's startups choosing this for headquarter. - Best for tax in EU and raising funds within.\n\nAnd if you really wanna go low/no tax check UAE, there are tons of middle companies helping with registration etc. - Best for tax advantage.\n\nOr try Cayman Islands for the best of the best",

This was our one opportunity to actually be in the same room and see each other at the same time. However, I don't think we ever accomplished anything real. People went back to their offices and just continued working on what they were working on because their products had their own roadmaps, so some big strategy session didn't really change all that much. \n\nIt was theater. \n\nI also think that a group setting for 3-5 year strategic goals is unrealistic and has been probably since the 1970s. Too many things change and too many things sneak up on us to really make any of that realistic. Unless you're in perhaps retail, heavy machinery, or forestry; Those industries might be predictable enough to get a 3-5 year strategy that holds. Instead, what you need is clear communication from the top executive indicating what the general North Star alignment is for the company.\n\n\n\nThink about it this way. Most companies at least 12 months ago had any of their future plans for their own operations, the marketplace and competitive just blown out of the water when it was made apparent that LLMs, while still falling short in many areas, are shockingly useful in a lot of cases for businesses. So it doesn't really matter what your 3-5 year strategy was, it was over. But if you had a clear alignment on company values and vision, which is something that doesn't really need an off-site, then you would be able to figure out how to adapt quickly.\n\n",
