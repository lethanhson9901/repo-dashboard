      "text": "I've been grinding on my own startup for over a year now. Met the co-founders through a mutual connection early in my career, jumped in because it seemed like a killer learning opp at this stage.But damn, we're not aligned at all anymore. Moves feel desperate just to scrape by and raise enough cash to stay afloat.\n\nEveryone's learning on the fly—capabilities grow with time and hustle, so we don't need rockstar pros day one. We just need diligent folks who grind out solutions. Fair enough... but it's total bullshit how this only applies to their team, not mine. I don't trash-talk or lowball anyone on my squad, but I'm constantly under fire for timelines while they get a pass.\n\n I'm skilled enough to know when shit's unrealistic, but that doesn't matter.Now I feel straight-up like an employee in my own startup. Don't wanna turn into one of those ego-fueled assholes like Bhavish Aggarwal that every Indian founder seems to idolize. \n\nThe zero empathy and constant blame game is making everything toxic and unfulfilling as hell. To even get heard, I gotta play their game and turn into the same dick.Blaming the team for leadership's competence gaps ain't right. I'm the only one owning my fuck-ups openly (at least publicly), but they won't. \n\nMentally, I'm back in notice-period hell, eyeing the exit.Anyone been here? How'd you decide to bounce without torching your rep, future funding rounds, or job prospects? Tips on smooth exits or better startup ops to jump into next? I need to learn things I missed here and if this is very common I definitely need to learn how to mitigate this, so I feel it's time to work closely with seasoned entrepreneur and not the type my current co-founders are.

In a lot of companies the analytical minded executives have the hardest time, we see through all the bullshit.\n\nI burnt out on it 10 years ago and decided I needed to find more alignment / become the CEO. Really nobody cares about the reputation, the world is a big place.  Your experience, knowledge, ambition and successes are most of it. \n\nOne warning, it's extremely difficult to find the perfect fit that doesn't end up in the same situation you're already in.  One fact I've come to accept (for me) is that once I lose faith in a company/team, there is nothing that is going to fix that, The best action is to not wait, start looking for something new.  Be patient, not hasty and wait it out while you fully commit to finding a new job.",

Besides the emotional and physical damage I endured, after I left, the company failed. I learned a lot in the role and the experience, I gained accelerated my growth and skills. But dealing with the aftermath was not fun, is not fun and I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.

You just havent admitted it yet.\n\nI had a cofounder situation that sounds similar. Not toxic in the obvious way. Nobody was yelling. But there was this constant undercurrent of my team being held to different standards than theirs. I would flag unrealistic timelines and get treated like I was making excuses while they missed their own deadlines with zero accountability.\n\nThe turning point for me was realizing I was spending more energy managing the cofounders feelings than I was building the actual product. That ratio tells you everything you need to know.\n\nHeres what I wish I had done differently: left sooner and with a clearer head. Instead I waited until I was so burned out that my exit was messy and emotional. I said things I regret. I left equity on the table because I just wanted to be done.\n\nPractical advice for your exit:\n\n1. Document everything now. Every decision, every timeline, every commitment that was missed. Not to use as ammunition but to protect yourself if things get ugly later.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before you tell your cofounders. Understand your equity situation, your vesting cliff, and what happens to your shares if you leave. This conversation costs a few hundred dollars and can save you hundreds of thousands.\n\n3. When you do tell them, keep it short and professional. \"I have decided to move on\" is enough. Dont explain, dont justify, dont give them material to argue with. The conversation you want to have about why wont change anything.\n\nThe fact that you are writing this post means you already know the answer. You just need someone to tell you its okay to leave something you helped build.",

          "text": "This sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a governance and expectations problem. Feeling like an employee usually shows up when decision rights, accountability, and ownership were never made explicit, or stopped being respected as the company got stressed. Early stage teams vary a lot here, and cash pressure tends to surface the worst versions of existing dynamics rather than create new ones. The question I would ask is whether there is any realistic path to resetting how decisions and blame are handled, or whether the pattern is now locked in. If it is the latter, staying longer rarely fixes it and often just normalizes behavior you do not want to carry forward. A clean exit usually comes from being boring and factual, framing it as misalignment on execution and leadership style, documenting handoffs, and avoiding moral arguments. Most experienced founders recognize this story more than they admit, and it usually hurts less to leave than to slowly burn out while still technically in charge.",

Misalignment around accountability and empathy only gets louder under pressure, especially when cash is tight. I have seen exits go cleanest when people document their scope, deliverables, and decision history before making any move. It keeps things factual and reduces the emotional rewriting later. If leadership refuses to own gaps, that culture rarely flips without a major reset. Leaving without burning bridges is less about being quiet and more about being consistent and professional on the way out. Also worth reflecting on what you would screen for harder next time, especially around how founders handle blame and stress.",

When I’ve seen founders navigate this, a few things helped: **Document everything clearly**: timelines, agreements, contributions.

      "text": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

Ask them what portion of the $100k should be yours (since you, um, did the actual work). Let’s say you split it 50/50.\n\n* Offer them an opportunity to invest their portion (eg $50k) into your company.  What equity % should they get? This is a classic classic “early stage valuation” problem. The industry has a very standard way of doing this: a SAFE. It defers the valuation question until a later priced round, after the company has made some progress.\n\n* If they bicker, ask them what their expectation of the value of the company at this point is. They’ll be torn: if they make up a tiny number, then clearly their sales intro didn’t add that much value. If they say a huge number, then use that to compute the equity you offer them (again, based on the cash value of their proceeds from the deal they intro’d).\n\n* Inform them of some business basics:\n* sales commissions at the top end are like 10%. Maybe for a “got me off the ground” thing you could flex to 20%. But like, if you (or someone) hadn’t done the work, they could make a million intros and they’d still make $0. They should contemplate intro’ing the opportunity to a brick or a tree, and take 99% of the proceeds lol.\n* finders fees are typically in the 1% range\n* SAFEs are incredibly common for early stage. In fact, not doing a SAFE is weird, and generally only happens when there’s a mature team and mature investors and clear line of sight to multiple years of revenue and well-understood business model etc etc.\n\n\nSource: founder of multi-billion dollar software company",

Not sure how you’ll solve this now.\n\nGoing with her fully forward together will be a mistake - as your values do not align and it’ll be only worse later. \n\nShitty relations with your family will poison stuff around you for years.\n\nI’d say 10% is generous from her side, not from yours.

That second problem is something I identified entirely on my own because it’s essentially what I do at my day job in a different industry. Nobody involved would have the aptitude to solve that second problem without niche industry experience that I happen to have. On top of that, the product also replaces an extremely outdated piece of software they’re currently paying for, which is also something I identified independently.\n\nShe saw one problem. I saw an entire product. Two of the three core value propositions came from me, not from her.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Regardless, I wouldn’t have arrived to my solution without her.\n\nBut you and the rest of the commenters are right, theres seemingly no solution here.

      "text": "A lot of people keep asking how to chose or find a co-founder. I have had my fair share of this issue with 3 startups and how to find a co-founder. Twice I needed to find a business acumen co-founder as I am a techie myself and a third time I needed a very highly capable tech co-founder as the idea and the product had grown beyond my tech capabilities. Let me tell you what all went wrong.\n\n\n\n1. First startup: I knew I needed someone who could raise funds for the company which requires very special skills and hence looked in my network, found someone whom I did not know personally but was a heck of a person in story telling (which is the most important aspect when it comes to fund raising). We worked together for almost 18 months and I realised that my co-founder was acting more like a PE fund manager who needed a cut in the funds he/she raised. I got a realisation that I had made the wrong choice as the person was not a company-first thought person but ‘what is in it for me’ person. I have nothing against people who think of their gains before company gains, but as a cofounder it has to be a commitment to the company first approach. The company I sold hastily as I knew we were not going anywhere so thank god it was not completely futile.\n2. Second Startup: I joined hands with a person whom I knew for more than a decade so this time I knew that I am working with someone whom I trust. However, slowly I realised that we were not aligned on ethics. While, for me everything is wither white or black, for him everything was grey and he operated like that only. He would make commitments which we could not fulfil, he would tell numbers that were not true or realistic. However, he was faring well and the company started to do phenomenal. I would go to office every day, make lies to truth, work on hiding actual numbers, create hypothetical scenarios and mark them as reality… This continued to 8-10 months when one fine day I just gave up and relinquished my 47% equity and moved on as I could not handle lying each day. The company has done well and is a household name now.\n3. Third Startup: I needed a tech co-founder who knew more than I did and I moved to a business role (learnings from the two startups helped). From day 0 we connected (while we had not spent more than 2 hours together before I offered him the co-founder role) and worked in unison. While everyone said that co-founders need to have difference of opinion, we seldom did. We reached a state where we would complete each other’s sentences. The company has been doing well (not a unicorn but we are well known now) and we still operate in the same manner.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I realised in the last 13 years, when you are looking for a co-founder… Remember there has to be a compatibility on VALUES. If your values are not aligned, never work together. While we are very very careful in choosing a life partner, we need to be equally careful (if not more) in choosing our co-founder. This is the reason why I have taken the approach that even when hiring, I look for values alignment rather than quantification or capability. I am happy to hire or work with a person who is 8/10 on capability and 10/10 on values alignment vs 8/10 on values alignment and 10/10 on capabilities.",

Early on I almost partnered with someone who could sell ice to penguins, but every pitch was stretching reality just a bit. I passed and he went on to build something successful, but I wouldve burned out trying to keep up with the narrative gymnastics. The hardest part about values alignment is that you cant really test for it in good times. It only shows up when you're low on runway or a customer's demanding something sketchy.

Cue 02: The waiter got our orders wrong (may be he brought something which was ordered by another table). We were hungry and realising that our order was wrong, it was frustrating. When he called the waiter politely and said that our orders were wrong, the waiter apologised and took away the dishes from our table. I asked him, you did not get angry at the waiter? He said… No point getting angry at someone for a mistake… I am sure he did not do it purposely. This clearly showed how he would handle the team (I already had a team of 12 developers) and understand every person’s perspective.\n3. Cue 03: We were talking at length and discussed about family, kids, parents and a lot more… I could see that he thought in the same way about relationships the way I did\n\n\n\nIn all, we did not discuss the startup for more than 5 mins, but we knew we would click together if we worked together.

Instead of \"I need to reach out to people\" (scary, vague), I'd break it into tiny mechanical steps. Write one message. Send it. Write another. No thinking about outcomes, just executing the process. Same way you'd write a function, test it, move on.\n\n  \nThe other thing -- the discomfort never fully goes away, but it does get boring. After enough cold outreach or posts that flop, your nervous system just stops caring as much. The first 20 are brutal. After 100 it's just Tuesday.\n\n  \nOne more thing that made a huge difference: I stopped trying to sell in outreach and started asking questions instead. \"Hey, I'm building X, can I get your take on this?\" People love giving advice. It takes all the pressure off because you're genuinely learning, not performing. And weirdly, those conversations convert way better than any pitch.",

And curiosity isn't draining the way pitching is.\n\n2. **The 10-minute rule** - you don't need to do 4 hours of outreach. You need 10 minutes, 5 days a week. That's 5 conversations. After a month, you've talked to 100+ people. Compounding applies to relationships too.\n\n3. **Build IN distribution channels** - instead of building then distributing, build WHERE your customers already are. Answer questions on Reddit. Comment on LinkedIn posts. Share your process publicly. The building IS the distribution.\n\n4. **The uncomfortable truth** - nobody cares about your product as much as you do. And that's okay. They care about their problem. When you lead with \"here's how I can help with YOUR problem\" instead of \"here's what I built,\" the emotional dynamic completely changes.\n\nWhat are you building?

What worked for me was making distribution as systematic as building. Set a number of outreach messages per day, track responses in a spreadsheet, treat every rejection as a data point not a judgment.

Nobody calls Shopify a Stripe wrapper.\n\n  \nThe reason most wrapper startups died is they were literally just reskinned API access. The model was the product. When OpenAI made ChatGPT better, the wrapper became pointless. That is a real pattern and it will repeat.\n\n  \nBut agent platforms are doing something slightly different. The value proposition is not access to the model, it is the orchestration layer. Managing context across files, handling errors, running multi-step workflows, keeping state between sessions. That stuff is genuinely hard and the model providers have zero incentive to solve it for every niche use case.\n\n  \nThe ones that will die are the ones where the whole pitch is we put Claude in a browser tab. The ones that might survive are the ones building real workflow tools where the model is an ingredient, not the product.\n\n  \nSame pattern as mobile apps in 2010. Thousands of flashlight apps died. The ones that solved real workflow problems on top of the phone hardware became actual businesses.\n\n  \nSo yeah, some of these are wrappers 2.0. But not all of them.

When I was building my first real venture after a previous failure, I had to get ruthless about separating execution days from strategy days. Like literally on my calendar - Mondays and Fridays were for thinking/planning, Tuesday through Thursday were pure execution mode where questioning the direction was off limits. It sounds rigid but it saved me from that constant mental ping pong between doing and doubting. The other game changer was shrinking my validation timeline - instead of waiting for a \"finished\" product, I started testing core assumptions way earlier with basic prototypes and landing pages. Even getting 10 people to sign up for a waitlist or pay a small pre-order gave me enough signal to quiet that revenue anxiety. The key was making the feedback loop as short as possible, so I wasn't operating in a complete vacuum for months. Also learned to track leading indicators instead of just obsessing over the big outcome - like daily progress on features, weekly user interviews, monthly prototype tests. Gave my brain something concrete to focus on instead of spiraling about hypothetical futures.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.\n\n",

I stopped calling it a launch and started calling it a test. A test can fail and that is fine. A launch feels permanent.\n\n  \n2. I got 3 people to pay me before the product was done. Not a waitlist, actual money (even small amounts). Having someone pay $20 for early access gave me more confidence than 6 months of building alone ever did. It also forced me to talk to real humans which broke the isolation spiral.\n\n  \n3. I set a hard rule: no thinking about the business after 7pm. Sounds impossible but the anxiety feeds on rumination. When I cut the rumination window, the anxiety dropped way more than I expected.\n\n  \nThe overthinking you are describing is not a focus problem. It is a feedback problem.

It doesn't seem that you learned too much with each release or didn't went through all the phases, or did you?

(ex. people are scrolling though your app but not clicking. you can try to improve icon/screenshots/title/subtitle. people don't even see your app: keywords and text may help you on that)\n\n\\- for a reason to create another app is more if you have some opportunity to chase AND if you can leverage and improve upon your previous app, not just about developing fast. if you first app didn't sell anything but you have an idea on how to do it. try a second. if the second didn't reach the 100 sales but you learned something and know how to improve. you go for the next app.\n\n\\- one last thing. you already have 8 apps. from my point of view you have a lot of space to work on. for me feels easy to try to create one screenshot for one, add one content into another then to create an entire app and go through all these apps from 0 again.",

That matters way more than another launch right now.\n\nAlso might be worth monitoring where people are actually talking about the problems your apps solve.

The trick is not trying to freeze them into something permanent, but giving yourself a structure that helps you decide what matters right now.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is treating strategy as a lightweight decision filter rather than a roadmap you must defend. Write it down not to be right, but so you can notice when new information actually changes the underlying assumptions versus when it’s just noise. That way, when an email from a prospect shows up, you can ask “does this invalidate our current bet, or is it just one data point?”\n\nThe fact that you’re already capturing where you are, where you’re aiming, and why in something shareable is honestly the hard part.

          "text": "This is an area where many businesses fail, because they chase features that they think excite the target customer but for which these customers wont pay.\n\nYou have two types of features.\n\n1. Features that solve the problems for your target market. As an example, if you were selling an accounting system to customers than ran US only businesses like an ETSY account, the features you need are simple. Tracking income and expenses. You would not then proceed to add support for multiple currencies. Multiple currencies are only needed if you plan to expand your addressable market, i.e., people that sell internationally. So first lesson, understand your target customers and the problems they need solved that they are willing to pay for. Only add features that specifically add value for teh customer and that they are willing to pay for.\n2. Once you have identified the required features for your target market, and you have delivered them, you need to figure out how to grow your market share. You do that, not by adding more cool stuff but by asking how can I improve my customer experience. If we go back to accounting for US businesses that might be, the ability to connect with the business bank account and automatically download and match income and expenses, or even a feature that simplifies expense tracking.\n\nSo ask yourself what am I trying to do\n\nI am trying to grow my market share within my existing market - focus on customer experience  \nI am trying to expand my addressable market - solve the problems for these new target customers\n\nOne more thing. As you consider what features you want to ask, consider when you rank them, how they might improve margins, e.g., if I add this feature that will reduce my COGS by 10%, will that return more profit than a feature that increases my customers by 10%. Or even, if I spend money not on features but quality, will that expense reduce customer churn leading to longer term recurring revenue.\n\nEdit - A comment on strategy\n\nStrategy is\n\nWho is my target audience  \nWhat problems do they need solving  \nWhy will they buy from me and not my competition\n\nIf your strategy contains numbers (increase revenue by 10%, broaden our markey by 20%) it is not a strategy it is a strategic goal. Furthermore if it contains broad statements like - be the world leader in \\[insert industry here\\], it is not a strategy, it is an aspiration.",

Yes, I'd say that's practically a defining feature of startups, relatively speaking.\n\nBut your question is about regressions. \n\nRegressions are accepted as normal in some organizations (Facebook's infamous \"move fast and break things\"), and are considered significant failures in others (Stripe's [zero downtime](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations) comes to mind). \n\nThere are obviously tradeoffs to both approaches--Facebook's users will tolerate bugs for neat features; Stripe's users will **not** tolerate losing money to downtime. \n\n**Regressions are a tech problem caused by a culture problem.** Every mistake is an opportunity to ensure your team never makes the same category of mistake again, but ensuring that the mistake never happens again takes a lot more work than fixing the bug and moving on. \n\nYou will need to accept that your team will move more slowly in the short term, and may have to completely stop adding new features for a while as they clear tech debt. Tech debt increases the chances that something will break in the future. \n\nBut again, this is a culture problem, because you are tolerating regressions, which follows tolerating bad practices. \n\nAI can help a lot. In my own workflow, I try to add automated test coverage as regressions happen to ensure every class of bug does not re-occur. \n\nAlso, you have developer**s**, plural, and no QA/QC staff? Catching this stuff is the job of a QA/QC person. Might consider making that your next hire before asking your devs to test their work more thoroughly. ",

As a non technical founder, it is reasonable to ask what testing looks like today and what would need to change to catch these issues earlier.

Before they mark something done, they record a 2 min Loom showing it works. This alone cut my regression rate in half because they actually had to test it themselves before sending the video.\n\n  \n3. Define \"done\" explicitly. \"Done\" means it works on the main flow, does not break existing features, and has been tested on at least one real device or browser. If you do not define it, their version of done will always be different from yours.\n\n  \n4. On finding a technical cofounder, honestly the best way is to hang out where technical people already are. Contribute to open source discussions, go to local meetups, or post on places like YC cofounder matching. Cold outreach rarely works. People want to see you are serious about the problem before they commit.\n\n  \nThe stress does not fully go away but it gets way more manageable once you have a system. Right now you are manually QAing everything which is exhausting and not sustainable. Even a part time QA person or a solid checklist process would help a lot.",

That almost never works early on because you’re paying for reach you can’t convert yet. What works better on a tight budget is getting smaller creators who actually use your product to post about it consistently. 10-20 creators talking about you regularly will outperform one big influencer post every single time and the effect compounds over time.\n\nThe timing question is less about stage and more about whether people actually like what you’re building. You said decent feedback and steady growth, that’s enough. You don’t need everything perfectly locked in to start. The real risk isn’t starting too early, it’s overpaying for the wrong creator and then writing off the whole channel based on one bad experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "So I've been working on a review management tool for local businesses for the past few months and I've ended up in a situation I'm not sure how to navigate, so I figured I'd ask here since there are people who've been through similar things.\n\nThe idea came from watching small business owners ignore their Google reviews because writing individual replies is genuinely boring and most of them don't know what to say. So I built something that connects to their Google Business Profile, pulls in reviews, and uses AI to generate on-brand replies they can approve and publish in one click. Automation rules, analytics, Stripe billing, GDPR compliance for the EU market, the whole thing. It took longer than I expected but the codebase is solid and everything works.\n\nExcept for the part that makes it actually useful. To connect to Google Business Profile you need quota approval from Google for their Management API, and they rejected my request. Turns out you need to own a verified Google Business Profile for 60+ days before they'll even consider granting quota, which is one of those requirements that feels completely reasonable in hindsight but that I only discovered after building the whole product.\n\nSo now I have a production-ready SaaS that can't connect to the one platform it was built for. All the code exists and works, the domain is live, the accounts are all set up, it just needs someone who already has a verified GBP to pick it up and actually launch it. For a local SEO agency or anyone who manages Google Business Profiles for clients, the blocker doesn't even exist.\n\nMy question is really about how to position and sell something in this state. It's pre-revenue, there are no customers, and there's this one real blocker that I'm being upfront about. I've been looking at Acquire and Flippa but I'm not sure if those are the right places for something like this or if there's a better way to find buyers who would actually see the value in it. Has anyone sold a project in a similar state? Curious how you approached pricing it and where you found buyers.",

      "text": "I (29M, single, no kids) need advice on what to do next. Based on the overview below, I'd like to hear what other people's ideas are / what people would do if they were in my position. I'd especially like to hear from people who have faced similar circumstances and what they did -- although all are open to opine.\n\nI have had a bumpy career. I studied math in undergrad; did a masters in statistics (all of this was paid for by scholarship, no loans are dragging me down). Good grades. Not worried there.\n\nI briefly worked at a prestigious company doing some compliance (9 months). I was then poached by a hedge fund to work on their acquisitions team (left after 1.5 years). I made good money and the work was good, too; the people were the stuff of nightmares (my stories would sound fake and a coworker once said she \"wouldn't believe me except for the fact that she saw it herself\"). I left and then helped manage an endowment (\\~3 years).\n\nThe endowment was fine but was \"bad\" in the sense that I was severely understimulated. It was boring beyond belief. After saving some money, I ended up leaving to try starting my own company.\n\nThe new company is going alright. I've been at it for about 8 months. These last few weeks, I started running ads / doing marketing. It is still in its infancy. I genuinely believe it can make a lot of money, assuming I can work out the kinks. It is getting interest; good internet traffic; and I'm about to close my first transaction after about 1 week of ads.\n\nThe problem is that I am running out of money. I still have enough of my own savings for about 9-12 more months (before dipping into retirement funds). I had planned to start looking for a new job in about a month if things weren't immediately promising. This is because, on average, it takes about 6-9 months to get a job if you do not currently have one. I am prepared for a longer search.\n\nI do not know if I should continue to try growing this on the side (which, admittedly, would be very difficult, if not impossible to do). I have thought about trying to raise some funding but want to wait until I have more of a steady flow of revenue before trying to scale -- the business is very ad-spend dependent and some processes need to be worked out before I feel very confident I could return my investor money. Also, having this working revenue flow would make it much easier to raise money.\n\nI could go back to \"high finance\" but it would put me in a position that is \"more junior,\" assuming I return to the same vein as before. This is a possible route but I would have to give up any chance of starting my own thing. This is because I'd probably be working 60-80 weeks. I'm also getting older and those hours are just killer. I think I'd be miserable.\n\nI have a technical background and could probably make the switch to software development / something in that realm. However, I'd be starting all over, and I've heard the job market isn't exactly popping in that sector. It'd also be a lot of work prepping for interviews -- I'm rusty, and I'd have to re-learn a lot.\n\nIdeally, I'd be able to get a job at a new company / startup where I'd be able to earn equity, help the company grow, get valuable business-building experience, then leave and try starting something again.\n\nI've put together a few things that I think will help me pick a new career.\n\nI know this is bad, but I need to make at least $150K+ based on my past jobs.\n\nI'd prefer to like my coworkers but I'd take ones I don't hate.\n\nI need a job that is semi-social.\n\nI need a job that has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI need a job that is stimulating / will let my position \"matter.\" At the endowment, if I didn't do my job for a week or so, I'm pretty sure nothing would change.\n\nSo, my questions are...\n\n* Would you try raising funding?\n   * It'd have a small chance of happening but I am pre-revenue and that is a huge limiter. I think I could make an argument that I have a good \"path to revenue\" but, realistically, you don't know that it'll work out until you are actually generating revenue.\n* Would you go back to a high-paying career at a more junior role, eat shit for a while, and maybe burn out?\n* Would you try switching fields altogether into one that is struggling with extra uncertainty?\n* Would you try finding a new gig doing something perhaps more ambiguous, taking less money, and see if you can get an equity stake in something?\n\nI'd be happy to hear advice that individuals may have that could help with the decision calculus here.",

Your stats background plus hedge fund experience makes this very doable on platforms like Toptal, or just reaching out to former colleagues who need help with quantitative projects. This buys you 12+ more months of runway without giving up equity or burning out in a 70 hour week finance role.\n\n  \nMeanwhile keep running the startup on the side. If the ads keep converting, double down. If they stall after a month or two, at least you have income and can pivot without desperation.\n\n  \nThe worst position to be in is fundraising when you are running out of money. Investors smell desperation. The second worst is taking a soul-crushing job that kills the startup entirely.\n\n  \nThe middle path (consulting + building) is harder to execute but it keeps all your options open. And at 29, single, no kids, you have way more flexibility than you think.",

If youre not making money after however long youve been at this, thats usually the signal. I burned through 8 months of runway before I finally admitted my first idea wasnt working. The hardest part wasnt the failure, it was accepting that passion doesnt pay rent.\n\nAt 29 with no dependents you have more optionality than most founders. If you can land a decent paying job (and with your background you should), you can always build on the side. Some of the most successful founders I know started their companies while employed.

Set a hard \"ship date\" for the next small feature. Scope it tiny. Something you can do in 2-3 days max. Momentum beats motivation.\n2. Talk to ONE real user. Not surveys, not analytics - an actual conversation. Their feedback will either light a fire under you or save you months of wasted effort.\n3. Accept that this phase is supposed to feel different. Building = dopamine hits. Marketing/iterating = delayed gratification. Your brain is adjusting.\n\nThe founders I know who made it through were the ones who learned to work in shorter bursts and protect their recovery time. Marathon, not a sprint.

Instead of asking “is this worth it?” I started asking much smaller questions like “what’s the next thing I can learn this week?” When the goal is vague, everything feels slow and overwhelming.\n\nI also had to separate burnout from signal. Feeling anxious or exhausted doesn’t automatically mean the idea is wrong. A lot of the time, it just means you’ve been pushing without a brea,k and that is not good.\n\nThis stage isn’t about grinding harder or hyping yourself up. It’s about lowering the pressure and then getting clearer feedback, and letting momentum rebuild naturally.\n\nYou’re not failing because you feel this way.

      "text": "As I get close to just my first full year of building startups, I wanted to share a few hot takes/advice/random game about entrepreneurship.\n\n1. I know we all can’t stand the fake hype and staged founder aesthetics, but the concept works - It has become such a mess because content marketing delivers insane results for certain people that actually put the time in. Now it’s saturated. Everyone uses LinkedIn like social media, cuts corners, uses AI to write everything, and posts twice a day hoping to go viral.\n2. Burn the boats. Go all in - This is something I personally struggle with. Between getting into an awesome program a top 3 school and landing a cool internship this summer I have set myself up for a nice, comfortable corporate life. While my drive and passion to truly achieve something great is still there, having a safety net sometimes takes away from the “I can’t fail” mentality that is so essential in the early stages of building something.\n3. Being an already accomplished person makes starting a company 100x easier - Seems obvious, but when I first entered the startup space I thought ideas raised money. They don’t. Stanford grads, 18 year olds who interned at OpenAI, and founders with a real product and traction raise money. If you don’t have the résumé, more often than not you will need to build something successful before getting any help.\n4. Selling is harder than coding - This might be biased since I have a technical background and am kind of an awkward dude, but convincing people to give you their time, let alone their money, is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.\n5. The worst times in entrepreneurship are when you have nothing to do - I personally love the chaos because it means customers and progress. When you suddenly have time to build a feature nobody asked for, that is usually when you’re in trouble. So make the empty promise and work through the weekend to deliver.\n6. Work with someone else - Get yourself an awesome co-founder. Someone who forces you to post on LinkedIn, cold call, work until 10pm, and do all the hard things required to build a truly successful business.\n\nAgain only really been in the game for around a year so this is pretty basic stuff but curious to hear others options on these topics",

The biggest mistake I see founders make is trying to be everywhere at once - LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletters, podcasts - and ending up mediocre on all platforms instead of great on one.\n\nI'd rather send one really good email to my list every two weeks than blast generic content daily. Even for simple stuff like investor updates or customer onboarding sequences, I spend way more time on the actual message than the design. Something like Brew helps me focus on writing instead of wrestling with HTML, but the real work is still figuring out what to say and who needs to hear it.\n\nThe staged founder aesthetic thing is so real though. Half these \"hustle culture\" posts feel like they were written by someone who's never actually had to make payroll.",

Followed by a couple of bullet points or a short paragraph for each one of them.\n\nWhat you've got there is what will open doors for you. It's what a VC will read/glance straight in your email even if they never were interested enough to actually download/open and slide by slide look at as a presentation, with fonts and pretty pictures that never actually could be comfortably viewed on a phone.\n\nIf you need to go \"well, actually…\" and dive deep for them to even get your idea you've lost them. You're not there to educate them in some obscure industry lore and technical possibilities, you're there to tell them why you'll make them a lot of money. The rest they'll ask about or send to their experts to ask about. And very few pretty slides or pictures will change that.\n\nSo start at and practice with those ten slides, in text format only. Then add the absolute bare minimum of graphs/pictures/screenshots.\n\nYou can read more about those ten slides and the person behind them here: [https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/](https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/)",

          "text": "i used to get stuck on this too. what helped me was separating thinking from design.\n\nfirst i dump everything into a messy doc. no slides, no layout, just the raw story in plain text. problem, who has it, why now, solution, traction, business model, why you. once that reads clean and tight, then i move it into slides. trying to design while still figuring out the narrative is what slows everything down.\n\nfor speed, templates  blank canvas. not because they’re perfect, but because constraints force decisions. pick one clean template and commit. investors care way more about clarity and momentum than fancy transitions.\n\nalso, 1 idea per slide. if a slide feels hard to design, it’s usually because it’s doing too much.\n\ncurious, is your bottleneck more visual polish or structuring the story arc?",

          "text": "Having worked in consulting for a number of years, I’ve built more than my fair share of decks. But when it’s something you truly care and are passionate about, your mind is too deep in the weeds. So I decided to create the slide copy, then outsourced the design.  \n\nI found a team on Fiverr that just built my pitch deck in 3 days for $500. They are a top rated, pro provider. I’ve not had great luck with regular Fiverr providers.  \n\nThey had 2 initial 5-slide mockups ready for me within 12 hours. I gave clear feedback, elaborated on elements I liked from each, and what I didn’t like. A few hours later, I received another 2 sample decks. Did the same thing. That was all yesterday.  \n\nThis morning I received a full deck that looks great, but still needs some polish. Submitting additional feedback in the next two hours, and expect to have final deck by this afternoon. \n\nI am actually pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Though I will say, to get it really right, you need to be very detailed in your feedback. Provide stock images and sample icons to give clear direction on guidance. The more detailed the better. So it’s not something you just delegate to get done. You still need to be very involved to get what you want. But done right, it can be very effective.",
