It’s a corporate owned sub that they manage actively, so I specifically said, this is directly yc related and useful for Canadians who were thinking of applying (like I once was before proceeding with better options). Within 3 minutes it was taken down, and their mod stated no reason why + no response to direct outreach\n\nJust another reminder these companies aren’t shining beacons on a hill, and don’t generally have your best interests in mind; they are a VC with good marketing. If it fits your path awesome, but don’t fall for the propaganda it’s what you need to grow (we ended up going with another accelerator that fit our growth better)",

YC is just trying to make money like everyone else (that’s how capitalism works). They are not our friend or magical in some way, and VC funding in general is not for every startup - there are huge down sides to consider for sure.",

It’s not that they do investments in companies from the Cayman Islands because they love applicants from there, but rather because it’s common and advantageous for companies to incorporate there (from outside of the Cayman Islands).",

Are you working for an exit, or is running this company your long-term goal? \n\nI understand a startup is more challenging than a job, you need to care about the problem not the money, there's a high chance of failure, etc. But founders still need to support themselves and fulfill other goals outside of work, especially if you're taking on more risk than in a job.      \n\nI'm full-time building a company with enough interest / traction to raise and hire more people. But my SO and I want to get married and eventually start a family, not to mention other goals like buying a home / car, traveling, etc. My former career on its own can certainly support a comfortable life, but hers can't. Plus I don't have any successful role models in my network of founders - everyone is either not stable enough in personal life yet, living off spouse's income / came from money, or went back to corporate.

I'm a software engineer, graduaded in 2007.  \n\\- 1st startup was failure: earning just enough to survive while peers were already buying car and getting morgage for a house  \n\\- 2nd startup became a large company, profitable. First yrs founders would take very low income, for at laest the first 2 yrs (startup was bootstrapped). Then we could afford normal pay. A couple of yrs more and the startup was acquired and all \"unpaid\" salaries returned with a big ROI.  \n\\- 3rd startup now, not taking anything out of it yet, but I don't have financial pressure anymore.\n\nHave seen somre startup friends do it faster, and other still earning less than peers, even after yrs. If the startup is invested, then there is more room for matching founders salary as it grows faster. But exit can be worse or even blocked depending on who invested in which terms.",

But I would still go out for drinks with friends regularly, what suffered most was my sleep. I still don’t believe much in work life balance, mainly because you are only one person, the same that work is the same with friends, and I had no problem to take some time on weekend to code, mostly because I was very curious about the outcome. \n\n3rd startup now, I have a little kid and my wife is pregnant. So I don’t stay working until late in the office because I rather play with my kid before he goes to sleep. Then, I sometimes go back to work after he sleeps. Weekends, if children with grandparents I may work a bit, but it is less volume then before. However, I want to believe that the past experience makes me work in a more right direction now, with less errors and chaos. By the way I date my wife since the first startup, so, we managed to survive.\n\nWhen the 1st startup failed it was the hardest part in the journey. I was in personal debt, returned to my mother’s house, and stayed like that for almost a year. Took some freelancing to get some money and go thru it. After surviving that and coming out ok, I felt very strong that I could survive anything, and need not to be afraid any longer.\n\nIt’s a real roller coaster.",

The best way to go about this is to just get a job for some type of income to feed the machine (the start-up) and your family. Unless you've got adequate savings and can bet on yourself. It needs oil& gas to run. From what I gather, it takes a while until you see a good payout, so you've got to have long-term goggles on. \n\nIf you have a pension, savings, assets, or some type of cash coming in, you'll get through. Unless you want to deal with investors and stuff. But I feel like once you do that, it becomes less of your company and more so everyone else's.

I fell myself more like a freelancer, who is TRYING to become a business man and scale the projects.\n\nWhen I was an employee, I was working less and receiving more $$$. When I left the company, some local managers were really surprised, because they were realising that probability to find a company with a higher salary is pretty low. Recently, I had several months with a high income, but I was working really a lot. I was working so much, that I don't think that everyone could handle it.\n\nRight now it is challenging because:\n\n1. IT market significantly decreased. I have a lot of IT friends who were laid off, some of them are searching for job for months\n2. Some of the projects are not stable. Recently main customer decreased amount of hours, and probably another client will drop shortly.\n3. I'm living in a 3rd world country where my experience in majority cases is not applicable for local SMBs. My services are mostly needed for huge corporations and very technological startups.\n   1.  It is hard to escape boundaries of the bubble, and reach directly decision makers from foreign companies.\n4. I have to handle a lot of things that I wouldn’t deal with as a regular employee:\n   1.  some customers are paying with huge delays, I need to spend some time sending reminders\n   2. I need to think about marketing. In some busy days I don't have enough energy for that\n   3. I need to handle some random stuff. For example, recently I replaced my accountant with another one, and spend several days on calling different companies, negotiating the transitioning to another company\n\n**Next plan**:  \nAfter some projects dropped, I had more time for marketing, research and brainstorm. Started to write more linkedin posts with successful cases, update website, ask for clutch reviews from current and old customers, writing some website blog posts with finished work, and launched several outreach campaigns. Hopefully it will bring some positive results.\n\nStill considering that I'm located in a wrong place. My local taxes are pretty low, but still hard to find some local good customers. From local companies, my ICT are banks and telecom, but it is mostly impossible to reach their decision makers, or to get a good rate.",

The trade is usually optionality and ownership versus predictable income, and that gap matters a lot once you factor in family planning, housing, and stress outside of work. A lot of early traction still does not translate into personal financial stability for a long time, especially if you want to run the company responsibly and not just optimize for founder cash flow. I would not frame this as a lack of founder mindset, it is more about risk tolerance and timing. plenty of technically strong people step back into a job to de risk their personal life and return to building later with more leverage. the hard part is that there is no clean signal early on that tells you when staying all in is rational versus when it is just hope.",

For the first 2 years, we bootstrapped and then raised ~$1.2 million.\n\nFor the first 3 years of the company's life, I had the lowest salary, and so did one of my co-founders. The last 2 I was in the middle pack but not much higher than the lowest. With that said, we pay market salaries now.\n\nMy income for the past 5 years approx (not based in the US, so after year 3-4, these are pretty acceptable in my country)\n- Year 1: $15,400\n- Year 2: $31,000\n- Year 3: $41,600\n- Year 4: $50,600\n- Year 5: $83,400 (big increase due to commissions)\n\nIn hindsight, I wouldn't be earning more if I was having a job as an employee in my field, and I would sure as hell not have a more stable job as an employee than as a founder.\n\nOnce you have a functioning business, you are the last person in the company to lose your job, and you are also the one who decides how much you get paid.\n\nHowever, even seemingly successful businesses can be a source of a ton of stress. I think about running out of money almost every month, and you have to make some really tough calls. After raising from VCs, our product failed to gain traction, and we went through a very bumpy road to survive. We almost ran out of money twice and had to let half of the team go twice. It absolutely sucks and you never know if you need to do that again a year later.\n\nSo yeah - be prepared for a ride haha - but ultimately at the end of the day if you succeed (even just moderately) it opens up doors for you that would never be easily accessible as an employee.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "A year ago, after leaving a big company, I decided to start a startup. I had been working with a technical cofounder for 3 months, we had a clear idea of what we wanted to build.  \nAfter two months of working together, he left. First hard hit.\n\nI found another cofounder in two weeks (spoiler: we’ve been working together for a year now and it’s going really well).\n\nI put insane pressure on myself. I worked 12 hours a day, every weekend, no days off, no vacations. I’ve always had a strong work capacity, so it didn’t really alert me. I was just a bit physically tired, but I didn’t see any issue.\n\nWe launched a product. It didn’t work the way I expected. I made a lot of mistakes, put my energy in the wrong places, developed 80% useless features. I applied to YC without much conviction, got rejected. Basically: first-time founder life.\n\nThen, overnight, my body gave up. Impossible to get up in the morning to work. As soon as I tried to work, I felt anxiety (I had never experienced that before). Loss of meaning, loss of bearings, loss of confidence.\n\nI’m convinced this small burnout was linked to the “almost success” of the project:  \nwe had early traction signals, but no PMF.\n\nSo I stopped everything. I went to another country for 5 days and I wrote a lot: what I don’t like doing, what I like doing, what I want to achieve\n\nI realized I had a very unhealthy relationship with time. I was always thinking about the next move without having succeeded at the previous one. I had big ambitions, a tendency to get carried away for nothing. That’s what led me to mistakes, loss of focus, and eventually to this state.\n\nSo I gave myself a single goal this year: make enough revenue to live from the company and pay myself + my cofounder properly. I have until the end of the year. If I don’t make it, I’ll ask myself what’s next at that point.\n\nI’m not rushing blindly anymore. I have a clear new direction, but everything that doesn’t bring business is cut. I’m very pragmatic about what can generate revenue (we’re a card payment gateway, with payouts in USDC)\n\nWhat drove me crazy was comparing myself to other founders. My relationship with success and time, feeling like I wasn’t moving fast enough (I’m 28).\n\nAnd for the past two months, living my founder life more simply, things have been much better. I’ve regained the joy of building, iterating, discussing. One clear goal with a defined timeframe. Plan B can wait.\n\nIn a world as complex as today’s, I chose to try simplicity. It doesn’t take anything away from my ambition to build a huge company and work hard on it.",

It might literally be *1* small thing, that is you never knew about, never thought about, never knew existed: that can literally make things 90% easier.\n\n\nImagine the whistle on Mario 3 (go look it up if you're not old school).\n\n\nIt's always a whistle out there where you can skip a few levels. Finding it may come from the grind, and / or extensive research, and a combination of luck. (The only thing you can control is staying in the race. Those who keep going will always find the whistle in the end while the others quit the marathon. As others drop out, your knowledge continues to grow. Any new entrants in the race (they will come forever) will be further and further and further behind you, the more time goes on.

Early traction signals can actually be more mentally exhausting than outright failure because they keep you in limbo, always feeling like you're one pivot away from PMF.\n\nThe shift to simplicity and a single, measurable goal (revenue to sustain the team) is underrated wisdom. Most advice tells founders to \"think big\" but rarely mentions that sustainable progress often comes from radically narrowing focus.\n\nTwo things that stood out:\n\n1. You recognized that your relationship with time was the root issue, not the product itself. That's rare self-awareness that many founders never develop.\n\n2. Setting a hard deadline (end of year) forces clarity. Without that, it's easy to stay in indefinite \"almost there\" mode forever.\n\nAt 28, you're actually in a good spot. The founders who burn out young and learn from it tend to do much better on their second or third attempt than those who never hit that wall. Good luck with the payment gateway.",

If your client is B2B, test cold acquisition first: we had 1 beta tester who was so interested in our product that we worked 2 months developing it. Only when I cold-called 300+ companies I understood that what the product solved wasn’t urgent enough for the market to buy.\n2. With co-founders, I look for vibes more than anything else and how I feel in the journey. I share a founders’ agreement with them right at the start, and this helped a lot.\n3. Going through rejections and NOs is the hardest thing for me. What helps a lot is humor. Not taking myself too seriously helped me avoid burnout over these years where I worked weekends and nights.",

This means leading a healthy lifestyle in general so that you can get through the intense moments and the less intense ones, but keep running overall. A healthy lifestyle means getting enough sleep and eating healthy foods that contain all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Exercising. Most of the time, we are very mentally tired after a long day at work, but our bodies need to release their energy. In addition, exercise releases beneficial hormones that help the mind. Having a supportive environment (friends, family, partner, colleagues). Taking time to get out of the tunnel effect. \n\nUltimately, we are on this journey to enjoy the journey and not just the final destination.\n\nTake care and good luck :)",

Always pausing to validate and breathe coz working alone on a whole project can be brutal. I’m glad it made me spend my time well now. No more video games until this works.

The idea was that people could live stream anything that was happening at a protest and it would basically put the footage in two places:\n\n1) a server with strong data protection laws in a country outside of the US where governmental and political influence by Silicon Valley could not touch it\n\n2) in a distributed file sharing / data sharding architecture where people could host bits of the file on their devices\n\nShould footage need to be retrieved it could be done so with watermarking to ensure no modification of the footage had taken place. \n\nI want to revisit this idea and could probably whip something together this weekend, but I want to expand on this idea and create a social network not powered and populated by bots like Reddit or X or Meta. I realize the irony of doing this here but there has to be a starting point. \n\nWhat has been happening in the past few weeks has me absolutely shaken to my core. I don’t want to sit around and do nothing. If there are people with the same level of conviction I want to work with you so we can use our collective brain power for doing something good. I don’t care for the negative viewpoints and quitter attitudes of people who don’t think we can’t make a change. If you want to build something that can help our fellow citizens both here and in any country that’s facing a repressive government, then let’s do it. ",

      "text": "My recent posts were about how we faced a forced pivot under intense runway pressure in 2024.\n\nWhat I didn’t explain is that our company would never have survived that moment if we hadn’t fixed something much earlier: a broken founder partnership.\n\nBefore we raised our $7M Series Pre-A, between 2021 and 2023, things inside the company were rough. I’m a non-technical, finance-background CEO. My co-founder is a deeply technical AI/CS engineer. At our lowest point, we were fighting constantly. He once yelled at me in the office. We were genuinely close to becoming unable to work together.\n\nI forced ourselves to rebuild. Here’s what I learned, especially as a non-technical founder working with a very strong technical co-founded.\n\nThe first three lessons are especially specific to non-technical founders working with a CTO:\n\n1. **Respect their technical taste or you don’t do this at all.** This is what I believe foundational! As a non-tech founder, normally you can't even judge code quality. What you can judge is their taste and integrity as an engineer or a person. If you don't fundamentally trust that, maybe you need a new partner.\n2. **Never treat your CTO like a cost center.** They're not an outsourced delivery machine. Dumping all deadlines and customer pressure onto them destroys trust. If you treat a CTO co-founder like a contractor, you don't have a real CTO.\n3. **Even when everything is on fire, don't bypass them.** When deliveries were burning, I learnt to not go around my CTO to direct his team. My job was to calm customers to buy some time, order some late-night food for the team and trust him to lead.\n\nThe next two lessons helped our relationship, and I think they apply more broadly to founding teams in general:\n\n1. **We eat together a lot**. We have at least (in average) three 1:1 working lunches a week. This is where fast decisions, alignment, and mutual learning happen. Shared context compounds.\n2. **Radical transparency around cash.** I give him unfiltered access to our cash position. When I push back on expensive ideas, it doesn't feel arbitrary, cause we're reacting to the same number. Shared urgency comes from shared reality.\n\nFast forward to late 2024. The AI wave hits. Our product is obsolete. But this time, instead of yelling, we were in a foxhole together. Because we had built that foundation of trust, we could make the hard decisions as a team.  \n  \nI’m not sharing this as advice or a playbook, it's just one founder’s experience. If there’s a takeaway at all, it’s probably this: treat your CTO like a true partner, especially when things are hard. It might not feel urgent when everything is going well, but it matters a lot when the storm hits.\n\nWould genuinely love to hear how others invest in their founder partnerships before they’re stress-tested.",

When a CTO is treated as a partner with real agency, not just the person who makes deadlines magically happen, the quality of decisions changes. In early AI startups especially, technical taste and sequencing matter more than raw velocity, and that only works if there’s trust both ways.

At the early stage, I feel like we are more creators than founders, because you are building the next great service, technology, product, etc., and that is the story people want to hear.\n\nOne last thing I'd say mention is that over the years, when talking to people about titles, I have always encouraged them to worry less about the title and more about the impact and money they are making. I can be the Founder & CEO of Daddy Diaper Duty, have a glamorous title, make nothing, and have a really crappy job 😉",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I hope your Friday is going well. Please be safe with the snowstorm, especially those in the South.\n\nAbout six months ago, I started a company. I thought it might be interesting to share a founder’s perspective from the Midwest, especially while building something fairly technical.\n\nBefore this, I worked as a DevOps engineer and most recently as an SRE at Cloudflare. I spent a lot of late nights inside a lot of tools, watching teams ship software faster than I could realistically maintain it. Over time, it became clear that while tooling had improved, the underlying problem had not. There was no real end in sight that would meaningfully improve both my work life and my personal life.\n\nThat realization is what ultimately pushed me to leave a job I genuinely liked and start a company.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and because I have worked in big tech, I was fortunate to build relationships with many incredibly talented people here, including local investors. It is a small ecosystem, with both challenges and strengths. After Missouri Startup Weekend, shout out to everyone who runs it, I decided to lean fully into building from here. See you there again this year.\n\nIn doing so, I learned a lot about what it means to try to build a venture-backed company in the Midwest. I want to share a few observations, not as complaints, but as context for anyone on a similar path.\n\n**Raising capital feels meaningfully different here.**  \nMidwest investors tend to be more conservative. They are thoughtful, kind, and deeply focused on fundamentals, but often operate on different cycles than the coasts. Pattern matching leans toward fintech, healthcare, and vertical SaaS. We leaned into this ecosystem anyway because some people believed in what we were building and believed in us.\n\nAt the same time, we found ourselves spending a lot of energy on education. When we spoke to investors on the West Coast, many immediately understood the problem space. The challenge then became valuation expectations and alignment. Midwest valuations can be strong for great companies, but the gap between coastal expectations and a great Midwest company can make it difficult to pull in certain types of partners early on.\n\nThis is not a value judgment. It is simply a reality worth understanding if you are building here.\n\n**Cross-collaboration takes more intentional effort.**  \nThere are incredibly talented builders across Midwest cities, but fewer accidental collisions. Trying another founder’s product, trading early feedback, or discovering what someone else is building often requires deliberate outreach or travel. The serendipity you get in denser hubs is harder to come by, which makes community building even more important.\n\n**Specialization shapes what gets built.**  \nMany Midwest investors are generalists rather than deep tech or AI infrastructure specialists. Generalists tend to fund general companies. That is why you see so much excellence in healthcare and fintech here. What we see less of are companies attempting truly wild or category-defining technical bets.\n\nThat said, this is not a criticism. It is an opportunity.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to tear down Midwest VCs or compare regions. I have met outstanding founders and investors here who are doing real, meaningful work. I want to celebrate them, learn from them, and meet more of them.\n\nIf you are building something in the Midwest, whether it is early, strange, ambitious, or simply useful to a handful of people, I would genuinely love to see it. Share your company. Reach out. Try other people’s products. Offer feedback. Cross-pollination matters, even if the outcome is not a billion-dollar business.\n\nAt the end of the day, building something that helps even one other person is still worth doing.",

Outside of them, every connection is intentional - which is exhausting but arguably produces higher quality relationships.\n\nBuilding in the UK (smaller tech scene than London specifically), I've found the same pattern: investors who immediately get it are often coastal, and the education gap with local capital is a real time sink. You end up becoming a translator between your problem space and their pattern library.\n\nOne thing that helped: treating online communities as the accidental collision layer that physical proximity would normally provide. Reddit, HN, Discord servers for your niche. Not a perfect substitute for grabbing coffee with someone, but it fills part of the gap.\n\nThe 80/20 rule another commenter mentioned is painfully accurate. Building is the easy part.

From my side, I felt like I explained it well. But she kept pushing on proof and GTM, and at the end basically said: “You’re still very, very early.”\n\nNow I’m stuck feeling confused:\n\n\t•\tIsn’t this… normal at pre-seed?\n\n\t•\tHow much GTM clarity is actually expected before you even have a product? For context I am not a GTM person. I vaguely understand how it works.\n\n\t•\tWhat are VCs really looking for at this stage? Vision? Early signals, or something else?\n\n\t•\tShould I be doing something differently right now, or is this just a mismatch?\n\nI just don’t know what the next concrete step should be after feedback like this.\n\nWould love to hear from founders who’ve been on either side of this.",

          "text": "Not knowing the investor I will make general statements here.\n\nIt's a bad idea to build a product with little proof that it's going to be successful. Based on your comment \"she kept pushing on proof and GTM\" it sounds to me like you were telling here your assumptions - why you ***think***  the product will be successful and we was asking for ***evidence*** that it will be.\n\nFor example, before building the product it is common to put up marketing sites and build a waitlist, get LOIs for a B2B app, pre-sell orders for a consumer app, run \"wizard of oz\" or \"concierge\" MVPs without a product. All of these things - and many more - can be done before building in order to show more concrete proof.\n\nTo give an example, before Zappos was funded, Tony Hsieh went around his town and took photographs of shoes. He put them up on a static website and when someone placed an order he would go buy them and ship them to customers. This cost a lot of money and wasn't profitable but Tony did this specifically to prep for calls like you just had. Had he shown up and said, \"I haven't built Zappos yet but I believe people will buy shoes online\" he probably never would have gotten investment - so he did this - proof.\n\nIf you want to learn more and get on the same page as investors check out \"Lean Methodology\" and try filling out a Lean Canvas for your startup. I am actually building a webapp right now to help people do this online because I have a cohort of new foudners going through an accelerator that I mentor through and we generally do this on paper.",

If you chase customers, fundraising will be easy. \n\nI hated this advice when I got it early days as well but it’s very true. If you come to investors with subscriptions, signed deals, LOIs, revenue…profit even…think about the discussion you’ll be having. You won’t have to even show your tech slides or answer questions. The convo becomes “what do you need the money for, and what level will it get you to” and then it’s a lot more about just making some sensible economic case. \n\nRight now you’ll have to prove even the most basic things - is your product worth it, are your competitors gonna eat you, what’s the market size, what’s the GTM, who the fuck are you and why would I trust you - a stranger - with my money, have you ever done this before, who is going to be on your team, etc ad nauseum. It gets old fast, it drains your resources to be building a perfect story and answers when you should be just on product and sales.

VC 1 will say go do this, and then VC 2 will say something completely different. Don’t focus on the VCs\n\nWhat you need to do right now is focus on defining how you measure success. If you are early, throw up a landing page and put a waitlist sign up there and then start posting ads and driving traffic to it.\n\nIf you already have the app and people can sign up, define what metric is most important. For Facebook it was MAU (monthly active users), for WhatsApp it was messages sent, and for Airbnb it was nights booked. Find the singular most important metric and obsess over making it go up and to the right.\n\nAlso (again sorry for being blunt), you need to run your company as if the VC money will never come. If you can’t survive the next 12 months without VC money you are already in trouble.\n\nIt takes on average 6 months and at least 80-100 conversations to find investment and you should be interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.\n\nHope that helps, DM me if you have any questions :)",

No. \n\nYou just weren’t perceived as coming on top. \n\nThe good news is finding VCs willing to invest is relative too. You might be perceived one thing by VC A and much better by VC B. \n\nVC investors deal with imperfect information and make imperfect decisions. \n\nBack to your question: how can you come on top? I don’t know you but you say “For context I am not a GTM person. I vaguely understand how it works.” \n\n=> That’s a red flag to me. \n\nEven if you’re two technical founders with super strong scientific backgrounds building a deep tech solution I would expect at least one of you to have articulated a plan for GTM. Let alone if you’re building at the application layer. \n\nBuild it and they will come is the worst mistake I made as a founder and the most common way for startups to die. \n\nSo my advice would be to think through these questions, read about GTM strategies a minimum, talk to founders and formulate a plan. \n\nWhy?\n\nThis plan won’t be a good one. No plan survives contact with the enemy and GTM can be a tough war. But having a plan matters because it forces you to think about what’s important in your value proposition, your business model and your priorities down the road. \n\nAt the end of the day, investors want founders who can anticipate.

Please stop, take a moment and decide if you really want to to do this. Entrepreneurship SUCKS, and even if you get good at it, it's like being a surgeon, you're only gonna be that from now on, with out swimming way up river. \n\nNow to answer, that VC doesn't have money. THAT VC is gonna make money on you. Gonna let that sink in... \n\nThat person is or is going to raise a fund, so they're going to High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) and do the same thing you're doing. Can you give me money? I promise I'll give you it back plus extra. Now these are all people who have make their money in finance, and the first thing they are going to ask is, are these companies self supporting. That's because most companies 95% or more never make dollar one. And that's assuming you get an exit which is even rarer. In fact they have marginally better odds betting in Vegas, then they do betting on you. I'm sorry that's just VC math. They're better bet is to bet on Gold, which is going through the roof, and hasn't reported a loss since the Roman Empire. \n\nBut they have to do something in High Risk Assets, and the VC is going to promise in the 15 to 30 stinkers, 1 of them is going to get a mid range exit of 300M. Which will yield a 20x return in 5 years, and in the mean time they can use it as a write off on their tax credits. (google it) \n\nSo they are going to say, they are all revenue generating firms, with scalable products, with veteran teams. \n\n**That's what you need to be. That's all you need to communicate. Remember you're not selling the VC, you're writing a pitch that they can sell to someone else. Once you do that, raising is easier. Just remember your first 100k will be the hardest.**",

It makes no sense to investors because it makes no sense at all. And if it doesn’t make sense, it’s usually not true. \n\nThe pre-seed should be largely you. You should get it by being an entrepreneurs and scraping together some bullshit cash, using an incubator/accelerator, using your own money, tapping your own network (I know, it’s unfair because people have different networks), maxing out your credit, using loans, selling your car, whatever you can. When you do go out to market, and you have some traction and you also have those scars, it’s a much stronger message to investors and gives you both milestones and credibility. Right now you have zero credibility. The only way to get it is to be a previous founder, or to get traction, or to have charisma and evident passion that the investor loves you and invests in YOU (not whatever thing you’re pitching). \n\nThe investors don’t know you and they’ve heard this story 1000x before.

Payments, compliance, lending, and financial infrastructure kept appearing in their spin-offs.\n\n\\- **AI labs → AI startups**\n\nPeople leaving AI- and research-heavy orgs like DeepMind often founded AI-native startups, often moving quickly because core technical and scaling risks were already familiar.\n\n\\- **Marketplaces and platforms**\n\nAlumni from OLX, Skyscanner, and Zalando frequently launched new marketplaces or SaaS tools adjacent to pricing, logistics, and demand aggregation.\n\n**Repeated operating exposure looks like this:** owning products, launching markets, handling customers at scale, navigating regulation, and living through failure.\n\nThis changed how I think about preparing to found a startup.\n\nIf your goal is to build a scalable company one day, a practical checklist that emerged from the data:\n\n\\- Choose roles where you own outcomes, not just tasks\n\n\\- Stay close to customers, revenue, and real constraints\n\n\\- Work in environments where products ship often and feedback is immediate\n\n\\- Get exposure to scale, regulation, or failure, not just growth narratives\n\n\\- Learn how systems break before trying to build your own\n\n\\- If possible, spend time in a company that has already scaled or exited\n\nI’ll add a comment with a link to the dataset for anyone who wants to dig into the details.",

Then business model fit (scale) then finally founder-investor fit. \n\nI think you list can be adapted into principles for early stage founders that guide them in later choices when scaling. \n\nFor example “Choose roles where you own outcomes, not just tasks” could be changed to: “Own outcomes, not just the tasks.” This is one of the biggest initial mistakes where first time founders don’t understand traction and fall into vanity metrics. \n\nHope that makes sense.

Team is great, culture is great, pay is great, I basically have no problem, its all remote so it might get lonely but that’s it.\n\nI open this up to my current employers and they basically said they will allow me to be in charge of companies expansion to other products where I can feel the entrepreneurial parts of it, gather more experience, and have a % cut or better financial upside if the new expansions reach the target goals etc.\n\nAm I doing a stupid decision here by leaving something good, or since this is also a great incubator its probably never going to be the same with trying your own thing.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.",

Otherwise they replace your internal conviction with external validation. That’s not always a bad trade but its something to think about.\n\nAlso,\n\nWanting to create a startup is often a proxy for wanting control, narrative ownership, and asymmetric upside.\n\nYou already kinda have 2.5 of those at your current job.\n\nWhatever you decide i hope you succeed. I hope some of this helped, even a little.\n\nGood luck!",

I know it sounds cliche, but if you are not deeply passionate about it then you won’t last long \n- find another person, or a couple of people that want to build this venture along with you.",

It’s the safest path, sounds like you are doing well and seems like you might have a career in front of you that can be both rewarding and successful. That’s also what any person who crunches numbers for a living will tell you.\n\nNow if after reading that paragraph you are like “well who tf is this guy telling me I should play it safe, he doesn’t even know me.”, well maybe that tells you deep down you don’t want to play it safe. And if the next couple of paragraphs don’t scare you or bother you, than maybe it’s worth a shot.\n\nBuilding a company is hard. It’s the hardest thing I ever did. People will hate you, even when you try to do the right thing. Customers will cancel for no reason. If you are lucky and are even mildly successful you’ll be responsible for expenses that are more than what both your parents used to make in a year. And those expenses will come in monthly. \n\nWhen things go right, everyone else gets the credit, when things go wrong it’s your fault. The only problems you’ll get to deal with are the absolutely soul crushing, hair on fire type of shit only the top and most thick skinned customer support agents deal with.\n\nYour phone will ring on vacation, and at the dinner table. You will be absolutely consumed to the point where you will actually forget about things in your personal life until it’s too late.\n\nWith all that being said, it’s also like a drug. You’ll have some of the highest highs and greatest moments in your life, and it’s a rush that you’ll never replace with a 9-5.\n\nI miss it and hope when my transition period ends I can have another go.\n\nEither way best of luck.

An incubator compresses uncertainty and forces you to answer hard questions quickly, often before you fully understand the problem space.

In practice, that can give you exposure to many of the same trade offs as a startup, with a much softer downside. the question is not whether the incubator is prestigious or rare, but whether it teaches you something you cannot realistically get where you are.\n\nI would focus less on fear of missing out and more on which path sharpens your judgment and decision making.

You’re giving access to repos, infra, sometimes customer data.\n\nYou don’t need to be SOC 2 or enterprise to reduce the risk.\n\nWhat we do now:\n\n* Ask for official ID (passport or national ID)\n* Use an identity check (selfie + ID, e.g. Stripe Identity or any KYC service)\n* Make sure the same identity is used across contract, GitHub, Slack, payroll\n* Track IPs when something feels off (DB access, repo activity, Zoom calls)\n* Run a basic background check there are decent services online\n\nThis isn’t anti-remote and not about geography.  \nMost people are honest.\n\nBut the cost of being naïve is going up and it can cost you a lot.",

      "text": "Right now, I am running a startup with my cofunder. It’s just the two of us, and while we’ve raised a tiny bit of VC money, it is enough for us to survive for now.\n\nBased on current situation, the two of us simply can’t handle everything ourselves anymore, so we’ve had to start hiring. And honestly, **hiring has been one of the most painful parts**:\n\n* Good talent is expensive, especially in the U.S., and we just can’t afford it at this stage;\n* So we started looking into hiring oversea, but remote work bring a new challenge: unstable work quality\n* After quite a bit of trial and error, we’ve finally managed to find a few decent people at a reasonable price.\n\n**But then came the next big challenge: management**. My co-founder and I both come from big tech companies where we were just IC. We’ve never really had to manage people before. Now that we do, we’re realizing just how hard it is to get it right:\n\n* If we’re too blunt, it kills motivation;\n* If we’re too soft, things get dragged out and quality suffers;\n* Striking the right tone and level of direction feels incredibly tricky. and especially i am the person working more with remote ppl and i am very straight forward person.\n\nI know some people would say, “Well, if someone isn’t working out, just replace them.” But in reality:\n\n* We’re already overwhelmed with the amount of work on our plates;\n* Given how stretched we already are, investing time into interviewing and onboarding could further disrupt our current workflow and introduce additional risks to output quality.\n\nAs for equity, i am very hesitant. I have seen friends fall out badly over equity disputes in their startup. So for now, we'd rather keep things simple and stick with paid employees.\n\nSo I'm throwing this out to the community:\n\n1. How did you get through this stage of your startup?\n2. Did you just power through, duct-taping things together until you had more stability and could afford better hires?\n3. Or is there a smarter way to navigate this messy, uncertain middle ground?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or stories from others who’ve been there. Thank you for your time.",

          "text": "I also came from big tech (MS) before jumping ship to the startup world. I have seen/lived small companies grow from <10ppl to 500+, with all the growing pains along the way. I sympathize with your situation; it is tricky to navigate. \n\nThe first 10ppl you hire are critical in defining the company culture for the next 100s you will bring on board. In particular, the 3rd and 4th person you hire are immensely critical - they can break your entire business if they don't fit culture-wise with you and your co-founder. \n\nBased on that, I suggest you make culture fit a component as important as expertise in your hiring decision. If you are a straightforward person, you can't hire someone who is touchy-feely. \n\nRegarding lack of management skills, you will need to pick them over time, unless you plan to carve an IC role for yourself as the company grows (you will still need leadership skills, but that is slightly different than having people report to you). Having said that, it should not matter much for the first 10 hires, because they should not need to managed - you should really be looking for people who tell \\_you\\_ what needs to happen and how, not juniors who require baby-sitting. \n\nGood luck!",

But putting it into practice is where I struggle.\n\n1. For being nice and tough \n\nYou mentioned how it’s hard to go from being warm and easygoing to suddenly becoming intense. I couldn’t agree more. That’s very much my situation. By nature, I’m an easygoing person. I don’t get worked up about a lot of things in life, but I do have high standards when it comes to work. So most of the time, before problems arise, I’m pretty laid-back and approachable. But when something goes wrong, I suddenly flip into a tough, no-nonsense mode and that shift catches people off guard. I honestly don’t know yet how to adjust that dynamic. I feel I have wear a mask now, cant be myself in work hours which is all my awak hours.\n\n2. As for the idea of demanding a lot without reciprocating, in terms of money, I think we’re being fair. \n\nBut if we’re talking about emotional investment or effort, that’s where I’m genuinely confused. It’s a tiny startup, and it’s not like we have clear top-down goals. Most of the time, I’m still figuring out the goals myself. And on top of that, I’m expected to manage and motivate a team it’s a lot to handle, and I don’t always know how to do it right.\n\n3. About to know better about your employees\n\nWhat you said about knowing people’s strengths and weaknesses really resonated with me. That’s actually how I try to assign work now. I put in a lot of effort trying to drive this forward. Not everyone is interested in discovering their own strengths and weaknesses. In fact, I often feel like I’m the one pushing them to figure it out, more than they’re pushing themselves.\n\n  \n3. About company goal\n\nRegarding your question about weekly updates or communicating company goals. We do have weekly meetings but we are currently in a period of turbulence due to changes in the external environment, so the business is still shifting quite a lot. I’m still figuring out the direction myself.\n\nWhat you said made me realize that so much of this, leadership, goal-setting, expectation management, really depends on me having clarity about what we are doing.\n\n**But the reality I'm facing is that I need to figure things out while also trying to be a good leader. Honestly, this is the hardest job I've ever had. I know how to build a product, and I know how to sell one but this part, the leadership part, is where I’m still very new and honestly not confident at all.**\n\n  \nSo yeah… it's a lot. But I really appreciate what you shared. It’s giving me a lot to think about.",

What type of people I want to work with ( it’s more about the personality part. Criteria would be passionate, quick learner, structured, builder, high work ethic, ok to work longer hours… list may go on. Quick tip, mostly people tend to hire people are similar to themselves and it may create bottlenecks. You may more seek for complementary personalities selected for the right places) \n\n2. What skills you are looking for ( you can identify the hard criteria) and try to hire the top talent. Going oversees is a good strategy. But if the oversees in Europe, within Europe you still have many countries with different cost of living. If the level you are looking for is still high budget I would go one step more junior but with a strong culture fit so they can learn fast \n\n3. Management. There is no one fits all and it’s a lot about understanding psychology rather than applied management methodologies at this stage. The best approach for remote first teams are setting very clear time bound deliverables, engaging them on daily to bond as a team, boosting trust and to do not micromanaging.\nFor instance you can create team rituals such as morning 10 mins coffee and 1h team lunch on a selected day where you talk about anything and bonding as people. Then every Friday all members set weekly targets and submit them to you, once approved they start working on it on Monday. You either have daily progress huddles or twice a week.\n\nRemote teams thrive with rituals and as much comms as possible in my opinion (leading remote teams for the last 6 years)\n\nIf you wanna discuss deeper feel free to dm me happy to support",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m a first time founder and I’m hoping to get some real guidance from people who’ve actually built physical products.\n\nI’m working on a non electrical hardware product for warehouses and retail environments. Most of my work experience has been in stores and warehouses, so the problem I’m trying to solve comes directly from seeing how slow and repetitive certain manual tasks are in real life. \n\nI’m still very early in the process. My LLC is pending, I don’t have funding yet, or ask friends and family to help with Boot strapping either and I haven’t filed any patents. I’ve only made a very rough, non functional concept prototype just to visualize the idea, nothing that works or could be used. I’m intentionally not sharing design or implementation details here because I want to handle IP the right way. \n\nI plan to work with independent mechanical designers and material specialists, and hire contractors as needed for prototyping, testing, and manufacturing prep. What I’m struggling with isn’t the idea itself, but the order of operations and funding. \n\nI’ve read a lot online and honestly it’s overwhelming and often contradictory. I don’t have a founder network, and I don't have any technical skills or knowledge so I’m trying to learn without making expensive mistakes. I’m fine moving slow if it means doing it right.\n\nI’m mainly looking for guidance on what should come first for a non electrical hardware startup like this and funding. \nIt would help me a lot to get some answers from the following questions based on your own experience as a founder. \n\nWhen did you personally involve a patent attorney, and what did you wait on? \n\nHow did you validate demand before spending serious money on manufacturing? \n\nWhat funding paths actually worked for you for physical products, whether that was grants, accelerators, pilots, LOIs, SBIR, or something else? \n\nAnd what early mistakes cost you time or money that you wish you had avoided? Is it realistic to try and keep 100% of the company? \n\nDid you find giving up equity for expertise or capital was necessary? \n\nAnd since I am a hardware start up, most of the time will be spend on product development and quality testing and collecting feedback and give it back to the team of contractors so that they can make revisions and improvements to the product before we can move on to manufacturing. My long term goal is to offer this as Hardware as a Service. Does that change anything in the early validation or funding stage?\n\nI want to keep things lean, avoid unnecessary steps, and reduce risk as much as possible and learn from everyone. I’m not looking for feedback on the product itself, just advice on process, sequencing, and how to approach this the right way. \nIf you’ve taken a physical product from idea to testing to manufacturing, or even failed trying, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective. And I also want to keep the company private. Thanks in advance.",

          "text": "It’s a tough question. I’m building an electronic hardware product, but the overall process is essentially the same. You have to start by fully understanding your goal and identifying the closest realistic milestone you need to reach. To get to a fully implemented product, you’ll usually need some combination of collaborations, investment, and a functional prototype. The key is to focus on the minimum you need to do right now in order to move forward without overbuilding. That usually starts with writing a simple but clear business or requirements document that defines the problem, the target customer, the value you’re delivering, and what the first usable version of the product must achieve. From there, you need to be honest about what you can financially commit to on your own and build the smallest possible prototype that can clearly demonstrate proof of concept. It doesn’t need to be 100% functional or production-ready just enough to show that the idea works and creates real value. Once you have that, you can start reaching out to companies for collaboration, but only if you know exactly what you’re offering them, whether that’s a pilot, efficiency gains, or early access. This stage involves a lot of small, detailed work. If you can secure one or two LOIs or a pilot and explore relevant grants at the same time, you’ll be in a much stronger position when approaching investors. You don’t need thousands of customers or many partnerships early, credible signals are enough. At this stage, it’s also important to be careful with IP: avoid oversharing, use NDAs when appropriate, understand the laws in your country specific about this, and focus on protection after you’ve validated the core technology and market. Everything depends on context, but a minimal, milestone driven approach is usually the most efficient and lowest risk way forward.",

In practice, most teams I have seen delay patent work until they have clearer signals from pilots or LOIs, because a provisional only really buys time, not certainty. demand validation usually looks less like surveys and more like someone committing budget, access, or time to test a crude version of the workflow you are targeting. Funding paths for physical products tend to follow that same logic, grants and accelerators care about technical feasibility, while angels and strategics care about whether a buyer is already leaning in. Keeping 100 percent ownership is theoretically possible, but it often trades speed and learning for control, which can be costly in hardware. Hardware as a service does not change the early steps much, but it raises the bar on reliability and unit economics earlier than many first time founders expect.",

In fact, this is exactly what I have done with one of my startups (Fusebit). It was a bit of a paperwork (around $10k), but at that point you already have inverstor's money. However, there are disadvantages to the LLC->C-Corp conversion. Generally, when you start a C-Corp, as a founder, you give yourself founder stock. If you hold onto it for 5 years, it gets preferential tax treatment (effectively, you don't pay the long-term capital gain taxes on it - read up about QSBS). The clock for the 5 year holding period starts ticking when you start the C-Corp, so it is beneficial to do it early if you know you will be picking up investors later.",

No profit is not a penalty If the LLC has $0 revenue and only expenses, you typically just have a loss. There is no extra federal tax just because you didn’t make money.\n2. But you still may need to file a return With two owners (you + your brother), a Missouri LLC is usually treated as a partnership by default for federal taxes. That means even with no income, you often still file a partnership return (Form 1065) and issue K-1s to each owner if there was activity. “No profit” does not mean “no filing.”\n3. Losses might help, but there are limits Startup/game dev costs and operating expenses can potentially create losses that flow to you personally, but whether you can use them right away depends on things like:\n\n* Whether the business is considered “started” vs still in startup phase\n* Basis/at-risk rules (did you actually put money in)\n* Passive activity rules (less common for an active dev project)\n\nEven if you can’t use the loss immediately, it generally carries forward.\n\n1. The practical “gotchas” to watch\n\n* Missouri: you’re right that MO doesn’t have an annual report fee like some states, but double-check local/city licensing if you operate from a city that requires it.\n* Separate finances: open a business bank account and keep clean bookkeeping from day one.\n* Multi-member admin: have an Operating Agreement that spells out ownership %, who owns the IP, who can sign contracts, what happens if someone leaves, and how profits/losses are split.\n\nWhen forming early makes sense\n\n* You’re spending real money (software, contractors, art, hosting)\n* You need a business bank account/payment accounts\n* You want clean co-founder/IP paperwork now\n\nWhen waiting can be simpler\n\n* You’re still tinkering with no real spending, no contracts, and no need for separate accounts yet\n\nBusinessAnywhere note (neutral): we see founders form early mainly for clean ownership/IP and banking, but the tax piece is usually manageable as long as you file what you’re supposed to file and keep books clean.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, 3 years ago I started building a price comparison app, just me, late nights, code line by line (miss those pre-AI days, honestly).\n\nWith basically zero marketing it grew to one of the top 3 price comparison sites in Australia. Millions of products, prices updated daily. Cool. But now I feel like I've hit a wall and I'm not sure where to take it.\n\n**Revenue breakdown (\\~$5k/month):**\n\n* Google Ads: $1-2k\n* Affiliates: $1-4k (good months)\n* Data sales: $20-50k/year\n\n**Why I feel stuck:**\n\n**Google ads** \\- looked at competitors, don't see much room to grow, maybe Australia's just not a big enough market.\n\n**Affiliates** \\- Australia sucks for affiliates. Only have Amazon, eBay, the global ones. I get 5+ emails a day from random brands wanting partnerships, but I don't know them and it feels sketchy so I say no to almost all.\n\n**Data sales** \\- this one surprised me. I've sold historical price data to a journalist from Sydney Morning Herald (biggest newspaper in AU), university researchers, and a few businesses. Never promoted this - they just found me. This feels like it has potential.\n\n**The missed opportunity** \\- I have 20k subscribers getting free price alerts. Yes, FREE. Probably should've charged $2/month from the start. Hindsight.\n\n**Options I'm considering (genuinely asking for advice):**\n\n* **Go global (like US?)**\n   * Same codebase, bigger market, more affiliates available (maybe)\n   * But: I don't know the market, and applying to affiliates is a grind\n* **Sell API access to developers?**\n   * I've been asked SO many times by developers wanting API access to my price data for their own projects. I always said no - didn't want to create competitors. But now that I've hit a wall, I'm reconsidering. The scraping infrastructure is honestly what I'm most proud of - it's the hardest part of the system.\n   * I spent 2 weeks extracting the scraping part of the system into a pricesapi and just started reaching out to everyone I previously rejected. Wish me luck.\n   * Concern: Are developers actually good paying customers? I'm a developer myself and I'm cheap as hell.\n* **Build competitor monitoring for ecommerce stores?**\n   * Did some research, this seems a real market. Some store owners already told me they use buywisely to track competitor prices (for free obviously). They'd probably pay for something dedicated.\n* **Some AI thing for consumers?** Could use my 20k subscribers. But honestly I hate B2C, I suck at marketing and doing another consumer product solo sounds painful.\n\nAnyone been in a similar spot? Which would you focus on?  \nAppreciate any thoughts. Thanks for reading.\n\n",

Keep testing until one sticks. Viola, You have PMF.\n\n\n\nSome more tips. \n\n\\- Install proper analytics that helps you record and watch user sessions. This is gold for watching your most engaged users and seeing what they do. Its better than user testing sites.\n\n\\- start gently restricting number or value of alerts free users get. \n\n\\- have a super cheap plan to cover your bases and ensure your cheapest users have an alternative instead of bouncing.",
