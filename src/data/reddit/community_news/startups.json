The system works end to end.\n\nWe’ve had multiple investor conversations. A lot of interest. A lot of “this is promising.” But no one is actually converting.\n\nWe don’t have money left for marketing. Growth is steady but not explosive. The team is still committed, but the pressure is real.\n\nThis is one of those moments where the next 60–90 days probably decide everything.\n\nIf you were in this position, what would you do?\n\nNot looking for motivation. Just real, practical thinking from people who’ve either been here or seen this play out.\n\n",

If customers are using it, you should have data as to how much revenue each of those customers are bringing in - which gives you an idea of what a new user's future value might be. This is also AI, so... you have the hurdle of somehow proving you're not an overnight success just waiting for the next overnight success to steal your audience. \n\nInvestors don't care if customers are 'using it' or even what they are \"using it for'. All they care about is how much they're paying in, how long they're likely to remain loyal (lifetime value) and whether there are plenty more people just like that out in the world that just need to be reached. \n\nWhen one of these investors says \"This looks promising\" next time - ask them, \"Great. What do you need to see or know in order to make you say, 'This looks like a promise you can keep, I'll invest'?\" Once you know what you're missing, it's easier to figure out how to deliver it. No one here knows the answer because we don't know the specifics. Your potential investors do - so just ask them what they need to see. ",

Venture debt loaned $800k and turned it into ~$28M in less than a year.\n\nBasically with venture debt they classified old stock as common and when they exercised they had a new primary stock. Common/original stock got a very very small slice. The last founder only had common and got about $400k.\n\nI was laid off in the pivot to pure software right before venture debt. That resulted in ServiceNow doing the buy. I took a $150k-200k salary cut to join that startup… sigh. Not worth it.",

      "text": "You know what's funny. genuinely funny. the kind of funny that makes you want to put your head through drywall.\n\na company worth billions looked at something i built and said yes. this is interesting. let's talk. let's explore synergies. let's schedule a follow up. let's loop in the team.\n\nand i can't pay rent.\n\nthat's it. that's the whole joke. you can laugh now. the post ends there for those looking for tldr.\n\ni don't know why i'm writing this. maybe because i have no one to say it to. maybe because at some point the pressure inside your skull becomes a structural problem and you need to let some of it out before something cracks. maybe because i am sitting in an apartment i might not be able to stay in by the end of the next week and i just need to know that these words exist somewhere outside my own head.\n\ni have been building things my entire life. not as a passion project. not as a side hustle. not as a thing i do between real jobs. as the only option i have ever had. i have never worked for anyone. not once. i have a residence permit that makes everything outside of self-employment illegal. i don't have a cv. i don't know what a performance review is. the only thing i have ever done is build and the only reason i'm alive is because sometimes the things i built worked.\n\nwhen i was a teenager something i made got covered by international press. so many countries. it was a weekend project. i remember the feeling. i remember thinking: okay. so this is possible. this is a thing that can happen. my life is going to be about making things.\n\ncute.\n\nthen a war started. not a metaphorical one. a war with bombs and conscription letters and people dying in places they used to buy groceries. the country i lived in decided to eat itself and i got a letter telling me to come help. come die, more specifically, for a government i didn't vote for in a conflict i didn't start for reasons nobody could explain without using the word \"sovereignty\" like it actually meant something to me, or as if i cared about it at all. i escaped first. my family came after. because someone had to go first and someone had to make sure there was something to arrive to.\n\nnew country. from scratch. do you know what from scratch means. it doesn't mean starting over. starting over implies you kept something from the first time. from scratch means you are standing in a new city where you don't know the language and you don't know the rules and you don't know anyone and you have a number in a bank account that is shrinking every day by the sheer act of being alive. because being alive costs money. every single day. just existing. just occupying space and metabolizing food and keeping the lights on. that costs money. and the money doesn't know you're building something. the money just leaves.\n\nbut i built. because what else was there. i found an opportunity, fought with hardware requirements for months alone in a room that was too small, and built a platform that worked. first month a single human being on earth decided what i made was worth money. by second month i had 7 paying members, which felt like a miracle and also like nothing because 7 times almost nothing is still almost nothing. lucky me, i found the distribution channel by third month. 1,600 paying members came, in a single month. and then it kept going. i ran that business for years. i operated it in a quite heavily regulated industry you can operate in. i dealt with payments and compliance and infrastructure and the ten thousand invisible things that nobody tells you about when they're writing blog posts about founder life. i learned what it actually costs to keep something alive. then i sold it. felt like i could finally have some rest. felt like i had beaten the math. thought i'd never run out again that soon. you know where this is going. that's the thing about money. it feels infinite exactly until the moment it isn't, and then you realize it was never infinite, you were just bad at counting.\n\nthat country had no future, no route for legalization and no stable life i wanted to give at least to my parents, with heavy corruption and the way the country was heading towards, to put it lightly, greatly sucked. no stability. no infrastructure. limited opportunity. a dead end with nice weather. so we had to move again.\n\nthird country. third time from zero. i brought my family because what was i supposed to do. leave them. tell my mother and father who gave me everything they had that i was going ahead and they should figure it out. i can't do that. i will never do that. so we all went. together. into the next zero. and this time i sold everything. and i need to put that into perspective what everything means because people say that word casually and they mean they sold their second monitor and cancelled netflix.\n\nmy mother had jewelry from her grandmother. her grandmother who is dead. has been dead. the only physical object on this earth that connected my mother to a woman she loved as a child. gold and stones shaped into something that meant nothing to anyone except her. i took it to a shop. a man behind a counter looked at it and named a number that was less than half of what it was worth and i said okay and he said okay and i walked out with cash and without the last physical piece of my mother's grandmother on this earth. i saw similar piece (not the one i gave) in the shop window weeks later priced at more than triple what they paid me. i stood outside and looked at it through the glass, just accepting the reality, because frankly i wasn’t obviously expecting to get full price, but just seeing it made the wound even more wide open. alongside other jewelry, i sold the ring my father gave me. his ring. the one he wore when he was doing his own business, building his own things, in another country in another decade. it had a weight that wasn't metal. you know the kind. i sold it. and i can’t express it in other words than feeling like a total failure and shit. the car sold. also gone. i actually sold it first. every asset that could be converted into a number was converted into a number and every number was fed into the machine of staying alive and building the next thing.\n\nright now im in an apartment in a city where i know no one. rent due in days. a bank account with almost nothing in it. a dog with cancer who needs immunotherapy which is not free because nothing is free, not ever, not even the things they call free, there is always a cost somewhere and someone is always paying it. taxes coming. bills coming. everything coming. every day the system extracts and it doesn't know and it doesn't care.\n\na few thousand… what is it really? i have held tens of thousands in a single month. i know what that looks like. i know what it feels like. and right now i am unable to produce a few thousand euros to continue existing in my apartment and the distance between what i know is possible and what is currently real.\n\nanother funny and highly predictable story. i reached out to people i worked with for years. people i paid. with money. regularly. for years. i showed up for them. i was reliable. i delivered. i paid on time every time.\n\nand now they need more time to think.\n\ni have been sitting with it for weeks. you build relationships over years. you show up. you are present. you pay people. you are the person who is reliable. and the moment you need someone to show up for you they say they need more time. Of course deep down i always knew that people were mostly transactional, after all everyone does the things that can bring them the gain. and the relationship was really nothing really more than a mere transaction which only ever flowed one direction and there is nothing you can do with that except carry it.\n\ni applied for credit. rejected. no credit history. such a big surprise, how could i have a credit history if i moved between more borders than sovereign people do, all just because i wanted a better life, and no system in any country has a box for that. they have a box for risk. i am in the box. the box is closed. on the rejection letter they actually suggested i try \"venture capital.\" i'm trying to pay rent. they suggested venture capital. that's another joke. you can laugh at that one too.\n\nand the thing that sucks the most is i have a product right now that works. actually works. people pay for it. the metrics are real. the conversion is real. the retention is real. companies have expressed interest. actual interest. and none of it can move fast enough. because the entire system operates on the assumption that you have time. investors need quarters. corporations need cycles. due diligence needs weeks. partnerships need months. everything needs time.\n\ntime costs money. i have no money. so i have no time. so nothing moves. so nothing closes. so i have no money. you can see the loop. i live inside it. i wake up inside it and i code inside it and i go to sleep inside it and the loop does not care about me, or the metrics or the product or the companies or any of it. the loop only knows the account balance. and the account balance says no.\n\ni don't see sunlight. i want to be specific about this because people say things like \"i don't get out much\" and they mean they ordered delivery this week. i mean i do not see the sun. i sit in this apartment and i code. it gets dark. i sleep. i wake up. i code. the sun does something outside that i am not part of. i have no friends in this city. i have no friends in this country. i have a dog. the dog has cancer. the dog doesn't know about runway or burn rate or due diligence or series A or convertible notes or any of the words that have taken over my entire brain. the dog just exists and is sick and needs me to not fall apart and i think sometimes the dog is the most honest relationship i have because the dog doesn't need me to perform anything. the dog just needs me to be here. and i'm trying. i'm trying to keep being here.\n\nwhat the system does if i fail. practically. the system adjusts a ledger. someone files something. someone closes something. the apartment gets listed again. the bills get sent to collections which sends them to somewhere else which sends them to nowhere. my product sits on a server until the server bill goes unpaid and then it doesn't. and the companies that were interested circle back in their next quarterly review and someone says whatever happened to that thing and someone else says i think they went under and they both nod and move on to the next slide. nobody remembers you. not you specifically reading this. generally. all of you. all of us. you walk around believing you matter because the alternative is physically unbearable. you know that the impact you have on the world is approximately zero and that approximately zero is generous and that the universe was here for 13 billion years before you showed up and will be here for trillions after and your whole life is a rounding error that rounds to nothing.\n\nyou tell yourself the story has an arc. you want it to have an arc. beginning middle end. struggle then triumph. pain then meaning. you need the pain to be going somewhere because if it isn't going somewhere then it's just pain and pain without purpose is just meaningless. i despise the warrior mentality, i believe if you're pushing a boulder uphill and a crane exists you should use the crane and if you refuse because \"pushing builds character\" you're not a hero you're an idiot. pain for the sake of pain is pointless. it serves no greater good. i literally do not have the ability to stop. not because i'm brave. because i don't have any another option. there is no other thing i can do. there is no plan b. there is only build or nothing and i have been choosing build for my entire life and i am so fucking tired.\n\nand the worst part, that makes me want to break something with my hands is that it works. what i built works. people pay for it. the numbers are real. it makes sense. it actually makes sense. and it doesn't matter. none of it matters. because you can't deposit \"interest from a multi-billion dollar company\" at the bank. you can't pay rent with conversion metrics. you can't buy immunotherapy for a dying dog with a pitch deck. you can’t pitch if you’re starving and have no roof over your head. the thing is real and the account is empty and those two facts coexist in the same moment in the same apartment. everything. my entire vision. every line of code. every feature. every customer. every metric. every conversation with every company. all of it. stalled. frozen. dead in the water. not because the product failed. not because the market said no. not because i built the wrong thing. because i can't make rent. the entire machine stops because of a number so small that the people saying no to me will spend it this weekend and forget by monday.\n\nI guess i just needed these words to exist somewhere that isn't the inside of my skull because the inside of my skull is becoming a place i don't want to be. you read this and maybe you felt something. maybe. for a second. and now you're going to scroll to the next post and that's fine. that's how this works. that's how all of this works. you feel something and then you don't and then you feel something else. and at some point either something breaks through or everything breaks down and i genuinely do not know which one it will be and i have made peace with the fact that making peace with it changes nothing.\n\nplease make your path easier. actually live your life. do not suffer just for the sake of suffering. pain is stupid and should not be tolerated. it’s a poison in your brain that tells you that you are not capable or not ready for something else. you are. don’t take the hits just for the sake of taking them, you will get them anyway. stay away from them and do not glorify them. i don’t know what else could be said, and frankly, i don’t know if this provides any meaningful information for you, i guess not really. it’s just me ranting about reality, without rose colored glasses or a happy ending. that’s it i guess. anyway, this post is going to get buried, and the feeling that i at least screamed at the void will hopefully make falling asleep easier tonight.\n\npeace.",

My permit doesn’t allow non self-employment work and I just can’t afford to cross this line because everything is at stake, and one random stupid slip up for a few bucks basically could evaporate everything that worked so hard to gain. As for freelancing, it’s a bit of a grey area since it falls under self employment rules (technically speaking).\n\nNonetheless, it’s not all ponies and fairy tales. Cold outreach and job hunting just becomes a second job. I’ve never freelanced before, so to actually get any work, I have to find that first customer, which is never going to happen in your first week (or even your first month) of existing on a platform. You have to do active work on the side, which already drains my insanely stretched and limited energy.\n\nI’ve done some gigs whenever the opportunity arose, but those were more like random events that happened to me and I just grabbed hold of them. The last one was in August, and that was basically the last big paycheck I’ve received. I even tried getting into Toptal, because I am technical fit, only to be met with 6-8 week timelines that I frankly just can’t afford right now. Everything demands much more time than I have.

The relationships you build with capitalists are not the same kind of relationships you would build with friends. They are based solely on the value you provide. They are not lasting, genuine bonds. They are convenient, temporary deals that last only as long as the money.\n\nYou may have given years to maintaining those relationships.. but they were never going to last. They were transactional. \n\nUnfortunately, that is how much of the world works. In fact, your country (if you are indeed ukranian) is experiencing something very similar to what you are experiencing right now. They arent being given the help they need from countries who promised they would help them, that they have spent years developing relationships with.. because these countries are unsure of the value Ukraine provides to them. It's fucking sad as hell. It's a mirror to your own experience..\n\nPersonally, I think this defensive war is one of the only justified/meaningful wars since the world wars. Ukraine wants to stay.. Ukranian. It doesnt want to become Russia's farmland. It doesnt want to be forced to speak only russian, to teach only russian language and russian history in its schools. It doesnt want to become.. Russia. It wants to maintain its sovereignty, its own, unique identity, history, and culture - however flawed it may be at times. \n\nAnyway.. Europe is stepping up to help them more. I hope you find your europe. People who see you for more than just the money you provide for them. People who see you as a friend and ally, despite the 'value' you provide. There are good people out there. People, ideals, ideas, and relationships, worth fighting for",

Sometimes you look at your bank balance and feel scared. \n\nSometimes you look at your ideas and wonder, Will this ever work? Sometimes you feel like quitting.\nBut listen carefully.\n\nIf what you are building makes you happy and if it solves a real problem for people then it has value. And anything that has real value will find its place. Maybe not today. Maybe not next month. But it will.\nRight now you may be alone. No big team. No big office. No big funding. Just you. Your idea. Your laptop. Your late nights. And that is okay.\n\nEvery big company once started with one person who refused to stop. One day, the right people will see your vision. And slowly, your small effort will become something bigger than you imagined.\n\nBut first, you must stay strong. Stay confident on the inside. Eat good food. Drink enough water. Work out. Sleep properly. A strong body helps build a strong mind. And a strong mind can handle any problem. You are not weak for feeling tired. You are human. But you are also brave for not giving up.\n\nAnd this message is for me too. I am also building. I am also struggling. I am also dreaming big while barely making ends meet. But I believe one day it will all make sense. One day the hard days will become a story of strength. One day the effort will pay off. Keep going.\n\nYou will become what you decide to become.

However, in the actual startup process, there will inevitably be long periods without any positive reinforcement—in fact, there's often a lot of negative feedback instead. That is why the most critical trait for a good entrepreneur is the ability to persevere.\n\nI also really liked what you said about the importance of eating and sleeping well. Recently, I've been sticking to a routine of waking up and going to bed early, and I spend an hour every day working out. It has significantly improved my mood. \n\nWhen you feel better, your productivity naturally increases. It is not about putting more hours into work; it is about focusing on the quality of the work itself.\n\nStay there. Keep building. OUR LUCK IS TURNING AROUND",

The founder had one very successful previous exit and another startup that’s doing really well.\n\nWe raised a 2 million seed round. I raised $1 million, founder raised the other $1 million.\n\nThen last year one of my young children suddenly died and it crushed us. It’s a horrible weight on my shoulders and the grief is constant and painful. It still does crush me, every single day.  I don’t know how we’ll ever fully recover.  My life is defined pre death and now post death. Worst thing that has ever happened to us, it’s impossible to explain.  We don’t get to say good bye, we didn’t get to see our child  close her eyes and sleep peacefully. I can’t go into any more details.\n\nI could barely function and took time off, everyone understood, investors were informed etc.  1.5 months later I realized I just couldn’t go back.  I didn’t have the passion and drive to do what I was doing.  I literally despised the idea of going back despite being proud of what we had built thus far.  Investors deserved better, employees deserved better.  Everyone was OK with it and at that time we had 12 months of runway.  So we hired my replacement and I stepped back and was just an investor in the company.\n\nThis winter I launched another company focused on prevention for what happened to my child, and it’s incredible.  Building something with purpose and drive to truly help people. I’m driven to do good and succeed in it despite the genesis of it.\n\nBut the previous company is failing.  I feel extreme guilt for its potential failure. I stretched my personal Rolodex to fundraise and I’m guilt ridden over their investment in me and the company failing, on top of all the stuff I’m already dealing with.   I don’t know what the future holds and I don’t know if my departure accelerated/caused the failure or if we were going to fail regardless with me or whomever was in charge, assuming they were semi-competent.\n\nIt’s easy to say “they knew what they were getting into investing in a startup” and I totally get that, but it doesn’t feel like that despite how many times I tell myself that.\n\nIdk, just looking for support I guess.\n\nEdit:  I really appreciate the responses.  Truly they have helped. My wife and I are both in grief therapy and it’s helping us navigate this.",

Somehow I never stumbled on this story, and as someone trying to build my own app studio, it inspired me big time.*\n\n# The Backstory\n\nIt starts in the late '90s, when Silicon Valley was minting millionaires overnight.  For the youthful Redditors, this was what eventually became the DotCom bust.  It has some parallels to the current AI boom, and everyone wanted to build the next big thing - VC money was flowing recklessly. \n\nBut three brothers from Cologne, Germany had a different idea - they wanted to expand a famous American company.\n\nMarc, Oliver, and Alexander Samwer were 3 promising brothers and came from a prominent family - their father was counsel to the German president.  They studied law and business, and spent summers interning at Goldman Sachs.  They looked destined for that life - being suits in boardrooms.\n\nBut they were inspired by the internet gold rush they saw happening in America.  One company in particular, eBay, (when they purely did auctions) was exploding.  Online auctions were printing money and Germany had nothing like it.\n\nSo they flew to Silicon Valley and asked eBay if they could run their entire European operation.  No product, no track record, just some serious gumption.  Naturally, eBay said no.\n\n...So they went home and built a copy.\n\n# The First 100 Days\n\nThey called it Alando - it was the same exact concept as eBay, but for the German market.  They executed crazy fast - within 100 days, Alando was Germany's #1 auction site.\n\neBay came back to the table, this time as a buyer.  They paid $43 million for the company they could've just partnered with.\n\nThis would be a crazy windfall for most people who would just take the money and move on. Instead the Samwers thought, \"why don't we just keep doing this?!\"\n\n# The Factory\n\nIn 2007, they founded Rocket Internet - essentially a venture studio built around a four-step playbook:\n\n1. Find a hot US startup\n2. Clone it as fast as possible\n3. Launch it in a market the original hadn't reached yet\n4. Sell it back to them or take it public\n\nAnd they did this over and over:\n\n* **CityDeal** = Groupon clone -> sold back to Groupon\n* **Wimdu** = Airbnb clone -> launched with 400 employees before Airbnb even entered Europe\n* **Lazada** = Amazon clone for Southeast Asia -> sold to Alibaba for $1B+\n* **Zalando** = Zappos clone -> didn't sell, went public, now worth billions\n\nThey weren't even subtle about it - Wimdu launched with a website that looked almost to Airbnb's and Zalando's early pitch decks referenced Zappos as the business model.\n\n# The Email\n\nIn 2011, an internal email from Oliver Samwer leaked with the subject line: *\"*When is it time for blitzkrieg?\"... *For those that don't know, this is a WWII reference to how the Germans invaded effectively, which is obviously not a terribly good thing to have leaked if you're German.* \n\nHe told his team to execute their plan and \"sign it with your blood.\"  He wrote that there were only three areas left in ecommerce to build a billion-dollar business, and that \"your grandchildren will ask you why you did not become it.\"\n\nObviously, when this got out, the brothers got a ton of flack for both the language and their strategy.  Oliver later apologized for the \"blitzkrieg\" reference, but never for the strategy.\n\n# The Scoreboard\n\nAt its peak, Rocket Internet had built 200+ companies and was valued \\~$6.5 billion - entirely from copying ideas that had a previous track record.\n\nNot every clone worked, but their hit rate didn't need to be perfect - they just needed to launch, test, and either scale it or shut it down.\n\n# The Moral of The Story\n\nBuilding companies is extremely hard. Validating ideas, running surveys, building waitlists - all of it takes time and has a low chance of success.\n\nThe Samwers skipped all of that. They just looked at what was already making money and asked \"where isn't this available yet?\"\n\nSometimes the best idea is someone else's!",

          "text": "You forgot the part where they fake sales & growth from other legal entities created by them by buying from eachother to increase valuation metrics. For all their startup clones.\n\nYes, Rocket Internet, known for its aggressive startup cloning and scaling model, has faced scrutiny over practices that appeared to inflate key metrics in some of its portfolio companies. A notable example involves Jumia, an e-commerce platform often called the \"Amazon of Africa,\" which Rocket Internet co-founded and backed heavily.\n\nIn 2019, shortly after Jumia's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (the first for an African tech unicorn), short-seller Citron Research published a report alleging material discrepancies in Jumia's SEC filings, including overstated active customers, orders, and gross merchandise value (GMV). Jumia later disclosed internal fraud involving its JForce sales consultant network, where some affiliates placed illegitimate orders (totaling around $17.5 million in inflated volume) that were later canceled, artificially boosting reported order volumes and growth figures. While Jumia stated this had no direct financial impact on revenues, it raised questions about metric reliability for valuation purposes. Rocket Internet, holding a significant stake at the time, exited its position in 2020 amid ongoing losses and stock declines.\n\nSimilar criticisms have emerged around Rocket's broader approach, including using self-led funding rounds via affiliated funds (like Global Founders Capital) to set higher valuations and employing metrics like \"last portfolio value\" that some viewed as overly optimistic. Related-party transactions, such as providing consulting services or loans to portfolio firms, also appear in financial reports, contributing to parent company revenue but potentially masking underlying performance issues in subsidiaries.\n\nThese practices align with Rocket's focus on rapid scaling to achieve high valuations for exits, though they've drawn accusations of prioritizing short-term optics over sustainable growth. For more details, Rocket's public filings from 2016–2020 highlight related-party dealings, while reports from outlets like Forbes, Reuters, and the Financial Times cover the Jumia controversies.",

Co-founder matching sounds efficient in theory, but in practice the signal-to-noise ratio can be rough.\n\nTwo structural issues I see founders run into here:\n\n1. Vague role definition. If your profile says “looking for a technical co-founder,” you’ll attract agencies, freelancers, and opportunists. If it says “looking for a full-time co-founder to own architecture and ship v1 in 90 days, equity-only, no side gigs,” you’ll filter out a lot of dev-shop energy immediately.\n2. No early filter mechanism. Before taking calls, add friction: ask for a GitHub, a shipped product they built end-to-end, and a short Loom walking through a technical decision they made. Agencies and GPT-polished profiles usually drop off here.\n\nAlso, consider where engineers with founder intent actually hang out: niche communities, open-source projects, or people already building in your space. Co-founder matching works best when it’s a supplement, not the primary funnel.\n\nFinding customers is hard. Finding aligned builders is harder. Tightening your criteria upfront saves a lot of wasted cycles.",

I learned quickly, however, the opposite was not true.

There are always bad apples, but you can generally sort teachers/advisors by two types: those who have shipped a product (that many people used), and those who haven't shipped a real product. Until you've actually built a product or service from idea, to launch, to post-market support, you don't know what you're talking about. But there are numerous teachers in good colleges or in accelerators that have walked the talk.\n\nVCs on the other hand. Don't get me started on those folks. Those are the real textbook jargon \"advisors\" that could never cut it as a real entrepreneur so they cheer from the sidelines and take the credit when it's working out.",

Not because failure is romantic or whatever, but because someone who watched their company die slowly over 18 months has a very specific understanding of what went wrong and why. They can point at your blind spots because they lived through their own.\n\nThe coaching/accelerator world has a selection bias problem. The people with the most time to teach are often the ones who don't have a company demanding their attention.

I wouldn't say I'm amazing (a bilionaire)—so therefore, OP would likely categorize me as mediocre.\n\nWhen I get asked to do it, they are typically looking for me to join their fund, one of their portfolio companies, or possibly for me to start something. They usually ask me to teach a subject that makes the program more well-rounded and better suited for that cohort—even if I'm not super specialized in it. They also ask super last minute, but they are well-meaning as they are looking for a reason to pay me and keep the relationship ongoing. However, in that sense, they would get a better presentation and delivery from a service provider who has tested their talk many times over.\n\nWhere I seem to be most helpful are the things that are not in the official program. From general topics like decision-making under pressure to specific cases like how to do layoffs without being a jerk or how to merge into an acquiring company smoothly. Or if a pivot or turnaround is needed, what can be done in the next 100 days?   I've also gone on sales pitches with some portfolio companies, so a lot of the work is outside the official scope.\n\nI would say the main reason I get asked by General Partners to 'teach' is really to evaluate the startup founders. Are the founders actually coachable? Of course, founders are going to have a level of arrogance higher than the average population, but there are many who come from top schools and consultancy firms or the \"mag 7\" who have so much hubris and are really not coachable or workable. GPs also want to know if I think the founders are people of good character, whether I would hang out with them, or if I think they should receive follow-up funding.\n\nKeep in mind—some of the mentors are specialists and some are generalists (like me). Some specialist mentors may not be the best person to start something with, but they are incredibly skilled at enterprise sales, and you likely wouldn't be able to afford their normal consultancy rates or hire them, so you should give weight to what they say. As a generalist, I won't know your niche domain like you do, but if you appreciate diversity of ideas or are open to seeing what has worked in other domains and experimenting in your own, I might be able to help you. However, I can't make you be open to learning or make you apply the best practices that we've seen across many cohorts.\n\n\n\n",

When you think about it, the downside cost of shipping sooner is usually low, unless you're in a security for privacy aware domain. Even then, let's say you ship, it fails, you can always take those lessons, rebrand, and present again to the market.\n\nAs I get older, I still believe that product vision first is required for success, but I've learned that emergent user behavior is impossible to predict, and often the most valuable lesson you can gain.

But eventually they want an experienced full stack developer who can built their application or at least a production grade MVP for Free. \n\nI got curious seeing this kind of post and even approached one person. My God the person had some tantrum. He was already thinking of himself as Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page. He gave me Do's and Don't for building the application ( He is a non technical person Btw) \nHe gave me timeline, I can give feedback about changes, I can't have any opinion on the product. But funny enough I am the co founder. \n\nIt made me laugh so hard. Like seriously you want a production ready application. With 3-4 premium core features. Payment gateway integration. API integration. And in return you are giving me 10% of your business which doesn't even exist without me? \n\nPlease give me your thoughts on this. ",

I give it the situation and make sure it knows everything about my client's brand and offerings (which is easy because I've spent the last 14 years training the AI and machine learning systems to understand our brands and offerings). I've gotten no real \"this will surely or even probably work\" answers, but it has saved me dozens of hours on many of them because the conclusion is \"That's just stupid, dude.\" \n\nAnd that's often enough to let you know if it's worth your time to dig in deeper, get real numbers, properly curated data, and all the things that go into a proper market analysis and validation. \n\nG.",

Typically, the free side doesn't reach out and look up things it doesn't know. And Gemini has a \"Deep Research\" option. That's found us some excellent small but highly profitable customer personas to target and whatnot. \n\nEither way - there's no \"wave a wand and have every answer you need\" solution to any problem.

I’m extremely motivated to make this work and build something meaningful, but I’ve realized I keep making the same mistake.\n\nI start with a solution instead of a real, validated problem.\n\nI’ve launched several digital projects. None of them truly validated. Not because I didn’t execute, but because I didn’t start from a deep, painful problem.\n\nMy latest project was a B2C service for Airbnb hosts. I offered listing optimization to increase their bookings. The issue? It was more of a one-time improvement rather than a recurring, painful monthly problem. I was chasing MRR with something that didn’t justify recurring payments.\n\nSo now I’m stepping back.\n\nI don’t want to jump into another idea blindly. I want to learn how to properly identify real problems in society or in specific niches before building anything.\n\nFor those of you with more experience:\n\n\t•\tHow do you systematically find real, painful problems worth solving?\n\n\t•\tHow do you validate before building?\n\n\t•\tDo you have frameworks, mental models, or processes you follow?\n\n\t•\tWhere should someone like me spend time looking for opportunities?\n\n\t•\tWhat would you do if you were starting again at 20?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and any advice you’re willing to share.

Best thing I could ever come across was the practice of “Observing”.   \nPick your top 3 favourite niche, the ones that genuinely fascinate you and something you‘re very much passionate about.   \nNow, start observing people who fall into that niche. Observe the consumers, the creators, the ones who influence, the ones who de-influence. Focus on the details. It doesn’t really require you to be a smart-brained analyst. As long as there are people on this planet, there will be tons of problems. Some of them might have had solutions, while some might be requiring better ones. The more your eyes start observing, the more your brain starts thinking and brainstorms ideas for better tweaks or improvised solutions. \n\n2. Once you‘ve figured out the problems on the basis of visible observations, and ideated something you think would help ease up the hurdles caused by the problems, connect to the same people who helped your observations. Reach out to them, to learn more, talk more. Don’t pitch just yet. Casually mention your idea as something you wished had existed to help solve this. Repeat the process, and that could help you eventually validate. \n\nI might not be the best one to advise you on questions 3,4, and 5. Some niche could require much of technical input, or expertise from a specific set of learned individuals. But I’m sure you’ll be able to crack that. \n\nGodspeed! :)",

Ideas:\n\n* Some people live with their eyes closed and accumulate no experience despite time elapsing. So, live with your eyes open, get involved, be curious, do stuff that frightens you, constantly interact with the real world. Problems you can solve will soon emerge. Move between groups (companies, countries, cultures, political circles whatever) to maximise the cross-learning and be able to make observations people entirely within those groups can't make.\n* And, you do have experience, also unique experience, and advantages of seeing things with fresh eyes. So start with the problems you already face, and sell the solutions to people like yourself.\n* Look at problems that older people are unintentionally putting up with (\"it's always been this way\", or just lack of understanding of new tech/culture) - you might make great inroads reinventing those ideas. This ones tricky, because you're the newest to the game so a) you'll be niaive, it is what it is and b) they might be stuck in their ways and put blockers up to your new ideas even if they're valid! Both hard to over come.\n\nTLDR; live extra hard, notice problems you and your peers face, solve those. Look at problems people with more experience face, research carefully before solving those.",

I would step back and ask \"what does this site need todo\" and then focus on the \"how should we do this\".\n\nthe other bigger issue is \"How\" will you maintain this new website code in the future. Building the website is not the hardest part, the ability to maintain, upgrade, and improve over time is the bigger operational cost to focus on. \n\nGood luck with the project!\n\nI wrote down some of this info for Lovable default stack here: [https://datajelly.com/guides/lovable-stack](https://datajelly.com/guides/lovable-stack) ",

I want a partner.\n\nI’m prepared to offer meaningful ownership for a true A-player who commits long term and takes real responsibility.\n\nI would rather share big with the right person than stay underpowered.\n\nIf this resonates, DM me with:\n\n1.

It’s obsolete and irrelevant. \n\nBeing adaptive means accepting you have no idea what’s going to happen out of your control and learning what to do along the way.

It's useful, but it's stateless. Every conversation starts from zero. You end up re-explaining your context every time, which is exhausting and means the advice never gets more specific to you.\n\n  \nWhen you're trying to figure out if a problem is worth solving, where do you actually go first and at what point do you feel like you have enough to make a call?

When is suitable time to seriously start reaching out to VCs?\n\nShort answer: When the lack of their money is holding you back.\n\nThe math is fairly simple. Practically you're selling a part of the business to these investors, and for that to make sense your remaining ownership must end up being worth more to you than if you'd not sold a part of it to investors.\n\nIf the business is worth $100k today and you sell 20% to investors it must be done because their money, invested to be used to grow the business, is a requirement for your business to end up worth perhaps $200k instead. Which would mean that your share (80%) now would be worth $160k. So you gained $60k by giving them 20%.",

Basically the idea is:\n\nyou paste a client’s existing website URL and AI migrates it into the platform automatically. Then you can edit everything though a chat interface instead of messing around in page builders. And analytics like Hubspot would just be built in from the start so you can track all the important anaytics.\n\nSo instead of managing 10 client across 5 different platforms, everything lives in one place.\n\nI haven’t built anything yet, just trying to check my gut before i spend coupe week to work on it. For anyone here who worked or working on the website stuff: what are the worst part of your current workflow? Would something like this actually save you time or is it solving a problem that dosen’t really exist? and how much would you pay for this service.\n\nBe honest please, I’d rather her “this shit suck” then some sugar coated answer.",

But if you place yourself at $899 it could be seen as aggressively going for market share and disrupting things.

Is that a fair assessment of me to make here? And is there anything that we could do better to listen to minority voices going forward? Are we currently risking not taking full advantage of skills, knowledge, and experiences in the team?!\"\n\nIt can't presented in a way that will be perceived, no matter your intention, as just be a thinly veiled attempt at complaining about your own frail ego getting hurt because you think everyone should listen to you. So you need to be careful about how you bring it up. But one way or another you probably should try to bring it up in a constructive way, rather than expect them to extrapolate and learn from what's essentially only \"I told you so\".",
