It’s a corporate owned sub that they manage actively, so I specifically said, this is directly yc related and useful for Canadians who were thinking of applying (like I once was before proceeding with better options). Within 3 minutes it was taken down, and their mod stated no reason why + no response to direct outreach\n\nJust another reminder these companies aren’t shining beacons on a hill, and don’t generally have your best interests in mind; they are a VC with good marketing. If it fits your path awesome, but don’t fall for the propaganda it’s what you need to grow (we ended up going with another accelerator that fit our growth better)",

Canada is now being treated like nearly every other country in the world by YC.\n\nThat said - I agree a lot with your conclusion, even though I feel like it has little to do with the Canadian company change. YC is just trying to make money like everyone else (that’s how capitalism works). They are not our friend or magical in some way, and VC funding in general is not for every startup - there are huge down sides to consider for sure.",

Do you feel like they have/have always had somehow a negative attitude about, say, European applicants (since they have never invested in European companies)?

It’s not that they do investments in companies from the Cayman Islands because they love applicants from there, but rather because it’s common and advantageous for companies to incorporate there (from outside of the Cayman Islands).",

      "text": "A year ago, after leaving a big company, I decided to start a startup. I had been working with a technical cofounder for 3 months, we had a clear idea of what we wanted to build.  \nAfter two months of working together, he left. First hard hit.\n\nI found another cofounder in two weeks (spoiler: we’ve been working together for a year now and it’s going really well).\n\nI put insane pressure on myself. I worked 12 hours a day, every weekend, no days off, no vacations. I’ve always had a strong work capacity, so it didn’t really alert me. I was just a bit physically tired, but I didn’t see any issue.\n\nWe launched a product. It didn’t work the way I expected. I made a lot of mistakes, put my energy in the wrong places, developed 80% useless features. I applied to YC without much conviction, got rejected. Basically: first-time founder life.\n\nThen, overnight, my body gave up. Impossible to get up in the morning to work. As soon as I tried to work, I felt anxiety (I had never experienced that before). Loss of meaning, loss of bearings, loss of confidence.\n\nI’m convinced this small burnout was linked to the “almost success” of the project:  \nwe had early traction signals, but no PMF.\n\nSo I stopped everything. I went to another country for 5 days and I wrote a lot: what I don’t like doing, what I like doing, what I want to achieve\n\nI realized I had a very unhealthy relationship with time. I was always thinking about the next move without having succeeded at the previous one. I had big ambitions, a tendency to get carried away for nothing. That’s what led me to mistakes, loss of focus, and eventually to this state.\n\nSo I gave myself a single goal this year: make enough revenue to live from the company and pay myself + my cofounder properly. I have until the end of the year. If I don’t make it, I’ll ask myself what’s next at that point.\n\nI’m not rushing blindly anymore. I have a clear new direction, but everything that doesn’t bring business is cut. I’m very pragmatic about what can generate revenue (we’re a card payment gateway, with payouts in USDC)\n\nWhat drove me crazy was comparing myself to other founders. My relationship with success and time, feeling like I wasn’t moving fast enough (I’m 28).\n\nAnd for the past two months, living my founder life more simply, things have been much better. I’ve regained the joy of building, iterating, discussing. One clear goal with a defined timeframe. Plan B can wait.\n\nIn a world as complex as today’s, I chose to try simplicity. It doesn’t take anything away from my ambition to build a huge company and work hard on it.",

It might literally be *1* small thing, that is you never knew about, never thought about, never knew existed: that can literally make things 90% easier.\n\n\nImagine the whistle on Mario 3 (go look it up if you're not old school).\n\n\nIt's always a whistle out there where you can skip a few levels. Finding it may come from the grind, and / or extensive research, and a combination of luck. (The only thing you can control is staying in the race. Those who keep going will always find the whistle in the end while the others quit the marathon. As others drop out, your knowledge continues to grow. Any new entrants in the race (they will come forever) will be further and further and further behind you, the more time goes on. So by year 3 (or 10, depends) you'll be 95/100 level while the new entrants are 20/100. The ones who were 90/100 just quit, so things get easier and clearer for you.\n\n\nThe 20/100 can't do any damage (competition) because you're so far ahead in knowledge and skill now.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\nThis all, I know for a fact.\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: it's dam near impossible for Anybody unless your parents can casually loan you $300k like bezos did (probably worth a few mil back then before inflation).\n\n\n\n\nP.s., what is your actual product type?",

Early traction signals can actually be more mentally exhausting than outright failure because they keep you in limbo, always feeling like you're one pivot away from PMF.\n\nThe shift to simplicity and a single, measurable goal (revenue to sustain the team) is underrated wisdom. Most advice tells founders to \"think big\" but rarely mentions that sustainable progress often comes from radically narrowing focus.\n\nTwo things that stood out:\n\n1. You recognized that your relationship with time was the root issue, not the product itself. That's rare self-awareness that many founders never develop.\n\n2. Setting a hard deadline (end of year) forces clarity. Without that, it's easy to stay in indefinite \"almost there\" mode forever.\n\nAt 28, you're actually in a good spot. The founders who burn out young and learn from it tend to do much better on their second or third attempt than those who never hit that wall. Good luck with the payment gateway.",

If your client is B2B, test cold acquisition first: we had 1 beta tester who was so interested in our product that we worked 2 months developing it. Only when I cold-called 300+ companies I understood that what the product solved wasn’t urgent enough for the market to buy.\n2. With co-founders, I look for vibes more than anything else and how I feel in the journey. I share a founders’ agreement with them right at the start, and this helped a lot.\n3. Going through rejections and NOs is the hardest thing for me. What helps a lot is humor. Not taking myself too seriously helped me avoid burnout over these years where I worked weekends and nights.",

This means leading a healthy lifestyle in general so that you can get through the intense moments and the less intense ones, but keep running overall. A healthy lifestyle means getting enough sleep and eating healthy foods that contain all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Exercising. Most of the time, we are very mentally tired after a long day at work, but our bodies need to release their energy. In addition, exercise releases beneficial hormones that help the mind. Having a supportive environment (friends, family, partner, colleagues). Taking time to get out of the tunnel effect. \n\nUltimately, we are on this journey to enjoy the journey and not just the final destination.\n\nTake care and good luck :)",

The idea was that people could live stream anything that was happening at a protest and it would basically put the footage in two places:\n\n1) a server with strong data protection laws in a country outside of the US where governmental and political influence by Silicon Valley could not touch it\n\n2) in a distributed file sharing / data sharding architecture where people could host bits of the file on their devices\n\nShould footage need to be retrieved it could be done so with watermarking to ensure no modification of the footage had taken place. \n\nI want to revisit this idea and could probably whip something together this weekend, but I want to expand on this idea and create a social network not powered and populated by bots like Reddit or X or Meta. I realize the irony of doing this here but there has to be a starting point. \n\nWhat has been happening in the past few weeks has me absolutely shaken to my core. I don’t want to sit around and do nothing. If there are people with the same level of conviction I want to work with you so we can use our collective brain power for doing something good. I don’t care for the negative viewpoints and quitter attitudes of people who don’t think we can’t make a change. If you want to build something that can help our fellow citizens both here and in any country that’s facing a repressive government, then let’s do it. ",

If you have a spouse or family, how are you managing your finances and is it enough? Are you working for an exit, or is running this company your long-term goal? \n\nI understand a startup is more challenging than a job, you need to care about the problem not the money, there's a high chance of failure, etc. But founders still need to support themselves and fulfill other goals outside of work, especially if you're taking on more risk than in a job.      \n\nI'm full-time building a company with enough interest / traction to raise and hire more people. But my SO and I want to get married and eventually start a family, not to mention other goals like buying a home / car, traveling, etc. My former career on its own can certainly support a comfortable life, but hers can't. Plus I don't have any successful role models in my network of founders - everyone is either not stable enough in personal life yet, living off spouse's income / came from money, or went back to corporate. So I've been thinking a lot about going back to a job especially before I take outside money or decide to bring more people along for the ride. \n\nPlease no snarky bs like \"if you think about money or family, you're not cut out to be a founder\" ",

I was in personal debt, returned to my mother’s house, and stayed like that for almost a year. Took some freelancing to get some money and go thru it.

The best way to go about this is to just get a job for some type of income to feed the machine (the start-up) and your family. Unless you've got adequate savings and can bet on yourself. It needs oil& gas to run. From what I gather, it takes a while until you see a good payout, so you've got to have long-term goggles on. \n\nIf you have a pension, savings, assets, or some type of cash coming in, you'll get through. Unless you want to deal with investors and stuff. But I feel like once you do that, it becomes less of your company and more so everyone else's.

I'm single employee, I would like to scale and hire more people, but I don't have enough workload right now.\n\nI don't have kids, but recently I got a wife. She is supporting me a lot, and helping sometimes with some basic marketing tasks which are outside of her experience, but she can handle them. Tbh, she is less responsive comparing to an employee, she rejects some tasks when she is in a bad mood.\n\nSeveral years ago I was working as an employee for an USA company, my salary ( comparing to local market was pretty HIGH ) . I left that company because:\n\n1. I was tired of poor management.\n2. bad decisions\n3. I wanted to try myself as a business man.\n\nRight now I can't say that I'm a business man. I fell myself more like a freelancer, who is TRYING to become a business man and scale the projects.\n\nWhen I was an employee, I was working less and receiving more $$$. When I left the company, some local managers were really surprised, because they were realising that probability to find a company with a higher salary is pretty low. Recently, I had several months with a high income, but I was working really a lot. I was working so much, that I don't think that everyone could handle it.\n\nRight now it is challenging because:\n\n1. IT market significantly decreased. I have a lot of IT friends who were laid off, some of them are searching for job for months\n2. Some of the projects are not stable. Recently main customer decreased amount of hours, and probably another client will drop shortly.\n3. I'm living in a 3rd world country where my experience in majority cases is not applicable for local SMBs. My services are mostly needed for huge corporations and very technological startups.\n   1.  It is hard to escape boundaries of the bubble, and reach directly decision makers from foreign companies.\n4. I have to handle a lot of things that I wouldn’t deal with as a regular employee:\n   1.  some customers are paying with huge delays, I need to spend some time sending reminders\n   2. I need to think about marketing. In some busy days I don't have enough energy for that\n   3. I need to handle some random stuff. For example, recently I replaced my accountant with another one, and spend several days on calling different companies, negotiating the transitioning to another company\n\n**Next plan**:  \nAfter some projects dropped, I had more time for marketing, research and brainstorm. Started to write more linkedin posts with successful cases, update website, ask for clutch reviews from current and old customers, writing some website blog posts with finished work, and launched several outreach campaigns. Hopefully it will bring some positive results.\n\nStill considering that I'm located in a wrong place. My local taxes are pretty low, but still hard to find some local good customers. From local companies, my ICT are banks and telecom, but it is mostly impossible to reach their decision makers, or to get a good rate.",

The trade is usually optionality and ownership versus predictable income, and that gap matters a lot once you factor in family planning, housing, and stress outside of work. A lot of early traction still does not translate into personal financial stability for a long time, especially if you want to run the company responsibly and not just optimize for founder cash flow. I would not frame this as a lack of founder mindset, it is more about risk tolerance and timing. plenty of technically strong people step back into a job to de risk their personal life and return to building later with more leverage. the hard part is that there is no clean signal early on that tells you when staying all in is rational versus when it is just hope.",

Company went under 6 months after I left).\n\nThe 4th one has been running for 5+ years. For the first 2 years, we bootstrapped and then raised ~$1.2 million.\n\nFor the first 3 years of the company's life, I had the lowest salary, and so did one of my co-founders. The last 2 I was in the middle pack but not much higher than the lowest. With that said, we pay market salaries now.\n\nMy income for the past 5 years approx (not based in the US, so after year 3-4, these are pretty acceptable in my country)\n- Year 1: $15,400\n- Year 2: $31,000\n- Year 3: $41,600\n- Year 4: $50,600\n- Year 5: $83,400 (big increase due to commissions)\n\nIn hindsight, I wouldn't be earning more if I was having a job as an employee in my field, and I would sure as hell not have a more stable job as an employee than as a founder.\n\nOnce you have a functioning business, you are the last person in the company to lose your job, and you are also the one who decides how much you get paid.\n\nHowever, even seemingly successful businesses can be a source of a ton of stress. I think about running out of money almost every month, and you have to make some really tough calls. After raising from VCs, our product failed to gain traction, and we went through a very bumpy road to survive. We almost ran out of money twice and had to let half of the team go twice. It absolutely sucks and you never know if you need to do that again a year later.\n\nSo yeah - be prepared for a ride haha - but ultimately at the end of the day if you succeed (even just moderately) it opens up doors for you that would never be easily accessible as an employee.\n\nHope this helps!",

But she kept pushing on proof and GTM, and at the end basically said: “You’re still very, very early.”\n\nNow I’m stuck feeling confused:\n\n\t•\tIsn’t this… normal at pre-seed?\n\n\t•\tHow much GTM clarity is actually expected before you even have a product? For context I am not a GTM person. I vaguely understand how it works.\n\n\t•\tWhat are VCs really looking for at this stage? Vision? Early signals, or something else?\n\n\t•\tShould I be doing something differently right now, or is this just a mismatch?\n\nI just don’t know what the next concrete step should be after feedback like this.\n\nWould love to hear from founders who’ve been on either side of this.",

Based on your comment \"she kept pushing on proof and GTM\" it sounds to me like you were telling here your assumptions - why you ***think***  the product will be successful and we was asking for ***evidence*** that it will be.\n\nFor example, before building the product it is common to put up marketing sites and build a waitlist, get LOIs for a B2B app, pre-sell orders for a consumer app, run \"wizard of oz\" or \"concierge\" MVPs without a product. All of these things - and many more - can be done before building in order to show more concrete proof.\n\nTo give an example, before Zappos was funded, Tony Hsieh went around his town and took photographs of shoes. He put them up on a static website and when someone placed an order he would go buy them and ship them to customers. This cost a lot of money and wasn't profitable but Tony did this specifically to prep for calls like you just had. Had he shown up and said, \"I haven't built Zappos yet but I believe people will buy shoes online\" he probably never would have gotten investment - so he did this - proof.\n\nIf you want to learn more and get on the same page as investors check out \"Lean Methodology\" and try filling out a Lean Canvas for your startup. I am actually building a webapp right now to help people do this online because I have a cohort of new foudners going through an accelerator that I mentor through and we generally do this on paper.",

If you chase customers, fundraising will be easy. \n\nI hated this advice when I got it early days as well but it’s very true. If you come to investors with subscriptions, signed deals, LOIs, revenue…profit even…think about the discussion you’ll be having. You won’t have to even show your tech slides or answer questions. The convo becomes “what do you need the money for, and what level will it get you to” and then it’s a lot more about just making some sensible economic case. \n\nRight now you’ll have to prove even the most basic things - is your product worth it, are your competitors gonna eat you, what’s the market size, what’s the GTM, who the fuck are you and why would I trust you - a stranger - with my money, have you ever done this before, who is going to be on your team, etc ad nauseum. It gets old fast, it drains your resources to be building a perfect story and answers when you should be just on product and sales.

You can't just be like \"we'll run ads and get customers\" unless you've already done that and proven it works amazingly well. For more difficult industries, an appropriate answer could be \"because I became best friends with 5 different people who have purchasing power at my 5 largest customers, and here are signed support documents to prove it.\" Yeah that's crazy to have at pre-seed, but any proof that you are not at the starting line for sales is all that is needed.\n\n>Should I be doing something differently right now, or is this just a mismatch?\n\nFeel free to have a few more calls to verify, but if you're 0/5 in terms of follow-up interest, then you need to rethink something.",

If you are early, throw up a landing page and put a waitlist sign up there and then start posting ads and driving traffic to it.\n\nIf you already have the app and people can sign up, define what metric is most important. For Facebook it was MAU (monthly active users), for WhatsApp it was messages sent, and for Airbnb it was nights booked. Find the singular most important metric and obsess over making it go up and to the right.\n\nAlso (again sorry for being blunt), you need to run your company as if the VC money will never come. If you can’t survive the next 12 months without VC money you are already in trouble.\n\nIt takes on average 6 months and at least 80-100 conversations to find investment and you should be interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.\n\nHope that helps, DM me if you have any questions :)",

They're better bet is to bet on Gold, which is going through the roof, and hasn't reported a loss since the Roman Empire. \n\nBut they have to do something in High Risk Assets, and the VC is going to promise in the 15 to 30 stinkers, 1 of them is going to get a mid range exit of 300M. Which will yield a 20x return in 5 years, and in the mean time they can use it as a write off on their tax credits. (google it) \n\nSo they are going to say, they are all revenue generating firms, with scalable products, with veteran teams. \n\n**That's what you need to be. That's all you need to communicate. Remember you're not selling the VC, you're writing a pitch that they can sell to someone else. Once you do that, raising is easier. Just remember your first 100k will be the hardest.**",

If your answers are speculative and haven't been validated with potential customers, then you're just early. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it just tells you where you are at. These are great questions to consider, though, as part of your own normal staging process as you develop as a company.  \n  \nIf you have competition that is already installed, are you able to displace them? I was once working on a SaaS product where the primary competition was interestingly famous in the industry because even though it was the most heavily installed, customers almost universally hated the product and the company. It's pretty wild when you can have a marketing campaign based on \"We aren't them.\" At the same time, it costs money to switch off of an old system, so even if everybody hates your competitor and will throw you a parade just for having an MVP, can you make it brain-dead easy and simple to switch? That is an essential part of your GTM strategy.  \n  \nDepending on your particular situation, I might make a slide dedicated to just that point. We have competition deeply entrenched. This is why we're better. This is why the potential customers think it's better. How do we know? We talked to them. We asked them questions about using the product today: What do they hate about it? What is a hassle? Don't ask speculative questions like, \"If we were selling today, would you switch to us?\" Customers are either going to answer that politely and outright lie or you're just not going to know because people are horrible at answering future predictive behavioral questions. You need to make that process seem like an assembly line. That's part of your GTM strategy.  \n  \nThose four questions are almost the same question. That VC gave you a roadmap; use it wisely.",

I think a lot of early founders are on the hunt for capital very early, and what you’re basically telling investors at that stage is that you want them to take the risk instead of you. Which is a horrible signal for the thing you supposedly believe in. \n\nWhy can’t you build an MVP and get some early traction? Why are you so eager to give up a portion of the thing you say you have maximum passion for, only to try to hawk it for the cheapest valuation in pre-seed? It makes no sense to investors because it makes no sense at all. And if it doesn’t make sense, it’s usually not true. \n\nThe pre-seed should be largely you. You should get it by being an entrepreneurs and scraping together some bullshit cash, using an incubator/accelerator, using your own money, tapping your own network (I know, it’s unfair because people have different networks), maxing out your credit, using loans, selling your car, whatever you can. When you do go out to market, and you have some traction and you also have those scars, it’s a much stronger message to investors and gives you both milestones and credibility. Right now you have zero credibility. The only way to get it is to be a previous founder, or to get traction, or to have charisma and evident passion that the investor loves you and invests in YOU (not whatever thing you’re pitching). \n\nThe investors don’t know you and they’ve heard this story 1000x before.

They are just trying to be part of the hype and nonsense that flows around there.\n\nMy two cents are that I would be much more interested in what you are working on and your story behind it than whether you founded the company or not. At the early stage, I feel like we are more creators than founders, because you are building the next great service, technology, product, etc., and that is the story people want to hear.\n\nOne last thing I'd say mention is that over the years, when talking to people about titles, I have always encouraged them to worry less about the title and more about the impact and money they are making.

      "text": "Hello everyone, I hope your Friday is going well. Please be safe with the snowstorm, especially those in the South.\n\nAbout six months ago, I started a company. I thought it might be interesting to share a founder’s perspective from the Midwest, especially while building something fairly technical.\n\nBefore this, I worked as a DevOps engineer and most recently as an SRE at Cloudflare. I spent a lot of late nights inside a lot of tools, watching teams ship software faster than I could realistically maintain it. Over time, it became clear that while tooling had improved, the underlying problem had not. There was no real end in sight that would meaningfully improve both my work life and my personal life.\n\nThat realization is what ultimately pushed me to leave a job I genuinely liked and start a company.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and because I have worked in big tech, I was fortunate to build relationships with many incredibly talented people here, including local investors. It is a small ecosystem, with both challenges and strengths. After Missouri Startup Weekend, shout out to everyone who runs it, I decided to lean fully into building from here. See you there again this year.\n\nIn doing so, I learned a lot about what it means to try to build a venture-backed company in the Midwest. I want to share a few observations, not as complaints, but as context for anyone on a similar path.\n\n**Raising capital feels meaningfully different here.**  \nMidwest investors tend to be more conservative. They are thoughtful, kind, and deeply focused on fundamentals, but often operate on different cycles than the coasts. Pattern matching leans toward fintech, healthcare, and vertical SaaS. We leaned into this ecosystem anyway because some people believed in what we were building and believed in us.\n\nAt the same time, we found ourselves spending a lot of energy on education. When we spoke to investors on the West Coast, many immediately understood the problem space. The challenge then became valuation expectations and alignment. Midwest valuations can be strong for great companies, but the gap between coastal expectations and a great Midwest company can make it difficult to pull in certain types of partners early on.\n\nThis is not a value judgment. It is simply a reality worth understanding if you are building here.\n\n**Cross-collaboration takes more intentional effort.**  \nThere are incredibly talented builders across Midwest cities, but fewer accidental collisions. Trying another founder’s product, trading early feedback, or discovering what someone else is building often requires deliberate outreach or travel. The serendipity you get in denser hubs is harder to come by, which makes community building even more important.\n\n**Specialization shapes what gets built.**  \nMany Midwest investors are generalists rather than deep tech or AI infrastructure specialists. Generalists tend to fund general companies. That is why you see so much excellence in healthcare and fintech here. What we see less of are companies attempting truly wild or category-defining technical bets.\n\nThat said, this is not a criticism. It is an opportunity.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to tear down Midwest VCs or compare regions. I have met outstanding founders and investors here who are doing real, meaningful work. I want to celebrate them, learn from them, and meet more of them.\n\nIf you are building something in the Midwest, whether it is early, strange, ambitious, or simply useful to a handful of people, I would genuinely love to see it. Share your company. Reach out. Try other people’s products. Offer feedback. Cross-pollination matters, even if the outcome is not a billion-dollar business.\n\nAt the end of the day, building something that helps even one other person is still worth doing.",

Outside of them, every connection is intentional - which is exhausting but arguably produces higher quality relationships.\n\nBuilding in the UK (smaller tech scene than London specifically), I've found the same pattern: investors who immediately get it are often coastal, and the education gap with local capital is a real time sink. You end up becoming a translator between your problem space and their pattern library.\n\nOne thing that helped: treating online communities as the accidental collision layer that physical proximity would normally provide. Reddit, HN, Discord servers for your niche. Not a perfect substitute for grabbing coffee with someone, but it fills part of the gap.\n\nThe 80/20 rule another commenter mentioned is painfully accurate. Building is the easy part.

Payments, compliance, lending, and financial infrastructure kept appearing in their spin-offs.\n\n\\- **AI labs → AI startups**\n\nPeople leaving AI- and research-heavy orgs like DeepMind often founded AI-native startups, often moving quickly because core technical and scaling risks were already familiar.\n\n\\- **Marketplaces and platforms**\n\nAlumni from OLX, Skyscanner, and Zalando frequently launched new marketplaces or SaaS tools adjacent to pricing, logistics, and demand aggregation.\n\n**Repeated operating exposure looks like this:** owning products, launching markets, handling customers at scale, navigating regulation, and living through failure.\n\nThis changed how I think about preparing to found a startup.\n\nIf your goal is to build a scalable company one day, a practical checklist that emerged from the data:\n\n\\- Choose roles where you own outcomes, not just tasks\n\n\\- Stay close to customers, revenue, and real constraints\n\n\\- Work in environments where products ship often and feedback is immediate\n\n\\- Get exposure to scale, regulation, or failure, not just growth narratives\n\n\\- Learn how systems break before trying to build your own\n\n\\- If possible, spend time in a company that has already scaled or exited\n\nI’ll add a comment with a link to the dataset for anyone who wants to dig into the details.",

Just look at all the teachers and coaches that have helped lift people up to their full potential. Also all the moms and dads and grandparents and in some cases even neighbors that have made people's success possible.\n\nA mentor help you be better, they don't do the work for you, they just give you more tools to work with. It could be ideas, techniques, stories, advice, flowcharts, decision trees, documents, or anything else. But at the end of the day it's up to you to make it all into something that is your unique path forward.\n\nA bad mentor is a bad mentor, and there's nothing uniquely and absolutely superior about one guy having done something 2-3 times compared to a guy having seen and worked with people that have done it 20-30 times.\n\nIf you're a decent enough founder working with a decent enough mentor those 20-30 stories will help you choose your path forward more than if you were to work with that one guy that says \"this is what you should do because it's what I did that one time I was in a similar situation\".\n\nAs a founder it's on you to find the mentor that best fits in with what you need, and if you think that a mentor will hold your hand and show you the one true way forward you're thinking like a child looking for comforting, not like a business leader (which is what a founder is/should be).\n\nThis is also why you in most cases don't want to work with an angel investor that's fresh from their first or second exit. They'll walk into your business with the biggest ego ever, thinking that because they ended up with cash they are money-making machines that should copy-paste everything from how they did it into your business.\n\nIt's even more obvious in sports, where having been the world champion doesn't automatically make you a better trainer than the trainers that actually help elevate people to that level.\n\n>Having a prior founder is a must for mentorship.\n\nNope. Not a must.\n\nEdit: As an example, look at how OP from the start has acted like an emotional child throwing a tantrum because they've got a fixed view on how the world should work according to them, and it doesn't. While this comment by me was filled with what's meant to be relatable examples. I'm leaving you with ideas and concepts that you can evaluate and incorporate into how you see things; while with OP you can get emotional/angry and jump up and down while screaming at the world that it must work a certain way or you'll get upset at it. You choose which of those approaches works best for you as a business leader trying to grow a startup.",

How?  The other side's attorneys used a P.I. and the \"powers of the Equity Court\" (like a search warrant) to prove that someone they had worked with had been moonlighting, and, this company V's source code was the moonlighter's day job company (\"C\") computer, at their facility.  On weekly backup tapes.  For a year.  That would (in that jurisdiction) give C a claim against V, easily.\n\nCase abandoned, then, a quiet settlement.\n\n2 years later, this company that, er, did me wrong, was locked out of their own facility with chains on the doors via the California Marshalls and a court order, by the very same SPAC entity.\n\nMe + F < C + V < Q < T\n\nInsane Factoid?

The choices and method of operating and founding principles are perceived as extreme by practically everyone who hasn’t done it. It’s preposterous how many times I have seen some professor or grey haired corporate dude try to convince young founders to invest their time and limited money into distractions like a website, or IP, or consultants, or some other ridiculous thing. Concepts like selling before you have a product are bizarre to people and you’ll have people convince you to make a perfect product instead of pushing something broken to market. \n\nObviously every situation is a bit different, but I’d say the vast majority of advice is shamefully bad when not by a founder, or maybe an extremely well experienced investor. \n\nI’m definitely not trying to sound clever in saying this.

They have stories.  \n\nOur job as Founders is to seek out a lot of advice and information, measure and weigh all factors, and then make sense out of a jumble of contradictory results.  I call this: \"Tuesday\".  It's gonna happen, every day.  Sometimes that's too much for some folk, or, any folk at certain times.\n\nReal Operators: I recently was doing interviews for a project, centered on a certain kind of Tech Startup Participant.  36 in I realized, \"wait a minute...a lot of these people are barely operators, I'll add a question: 'How many startups have you operated, directly?'\"  This happened at interview 17.  I went back and most of the previous interviews rapidly supplied their numbers.  Average was 1.4.  Participant type was Angel Investor.  I was at 1.4 by the time I was 18... \n\nSo, yeah, I am now more selective in that particular way!\n\n\"Mentor is useless if he doesn’t have real network of successful founders or VC or customers.\"\n\nI think I see where you're coming from.  My feels is \"a Mentor should have some of these, and/or, have operated companies that survived until elective exit.\"  I thought about it, and that seems like the right list.  \n\nBut,... fails are very, very useful.  At UCLA Grad School of Mgmt, they had two MBA programs: \"The children\" aka age 24-26, day time, M-Th.  \"Executive\" meant  people who were there Tue/Thu night, and Saturday, and during the week, ahem, arrived in a preserved state, more than not.  These were the real deal: The J. Jonah Jameson type, either loud or silent.  38-45.  There were several criteria to getting into the Executive as pre-quals: the most popular listed on applications (I saw them all as part of my function) was \"Taken a company into, and out of, bankruptcy\".  Dang.\n\nThat being said, I got my first three startup experiences from those Executive people  Full of fail, and Priceless!",

Team is great, culture is great, pay is great, I basically have no problem, its all remote so it might get lonely but that’s it.\n\nI open this up to my current employers and they basically said they will allow me to be in charge of companies expansion to other products where I can feel the entrepreneurial parts of it, gather more experience, and have a % cut or better financial upside if the new expansions reach the target goals etc.\n\nAm I doing a stupid decision here by leaving something good, or since this is also a great incubator its probably never going to be the same with trying your own thing.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.",

Otherwise they replace your internal conviction with external validation. That’s not always a bad trade but its something to think about.\n\nAlso,\n\nWanting to create a startup is often a proxy for wanting control, narrative ownership, and asymmetric upside.\n\nYou already kinda have 2.5 of those at your current job.\n\nWhatever you decide i hope you succeed. I hope some of this helped, even a little.\n\nGood luck!",

It’s the safest path, sounds like you are doing well and seems like you might have a career in front of you that can be both rewarding and successful. That’s also what any person who crunches numbers for a living will tell you.\n\nNow if after reading that paragraph you are like “well who tf is this guy telling me I should play it safe, he doesn’t even know me.”, well maybe that tells you deep down you don’t want to play it safe. And if the next couple of paragraphs don’t scare you or bother you, than maybe it’s worth a shot.\n\nBuilding a company is hard. It’s the hardest thing I ever did. People will hate you, even when you try to do the right thing. Customers will cancel for no reason. If you are lucky and are even mildly successful you’ll be responsible for expenses that are more than what both your parents used to make in a year. And those expenses will come in monthly. \n\nWhen things go right, everyone else gets the credit, when things go wrong it’s your fault. The only problems you’ll get to deal with are the absolutely soul crushing, hair on fire type of shit only the top and most thick skinned customer support agents deal with.\n\nYour phone will ring on vacation, and at the dinner table. You will be absolutely consumed to the point where you will actually forget about things in your personal life until it’s too late.\n\nWith all that being said, it’s also like a drug. You’ll have some of the highest highs and greatest moments in your life, and it’s a rush that you’ll never replace with a 9-5.\n\nI miss it and hope when my transition period ends I can have another go.\n\nEither way best of luck.

An incubator compresses uncertainty and forces you to answer hard questions quickly, often before you fully understand the problem space. That can be energizing, but it can also mean making irreversible calls with a limited signal.\n\nWhat stands out is that your current role is offering real ownership over new product lines. In practice, that can give you exposure to many of the same trade offs as a startup, with a much softer downside. the question is not whether the incubator is prestigious or rare, but whether it teaches you something you cannot realistically get where you are.\n\nI would focus less on fear of missing out and more on which path sharpens your judgment and decision making. Early stage paths vary a lot, and timing matters more than people admit.",

You’re giving access to repos, infra, sometimes customer data.\n\nYou don’t need to be SOC 2 or enterprise to reduce the risk.\n\nWhat we do now:\n\n* Ask for official ID (passport or national ID)\n* Use an identity check (selfie + ID, e.g. Stripe Identity or any KYC service)\n* Make sure the same identity is used across contract, GitHub, Slack, payroll\n* Track IPs when something feels off (DB access, repo activity, Zoom calls)\n* Run a basic background check there are decent services online\n\nThis isn’t anti-remote and not about geography.  \nMost people are honest.\n\nBut the cost of being naïve is going up and it can cost you a lot.",

The tricky part is that most signals founders rely on early, GitHub, interviews, and references were never designed to defend against adversarial behavior at scale. From a research perspective, it is a classic asymmetric risk problem. The median candidate is fine, but the tail risk is high and hard to detect without a process. What worries me more than the fraud itself is how quickly this can push teams toward heavy-handed controls that also filter out good people. The hard question is where to put just enough friction to reduce risk without killing velocity or trust. Early stage teams vary a lot in how thoughtfully they approach that balance.",

I’m currently at $170k with 1% equity.\n\nThe company is in a bit of a tight spot. We have $500k ARR but are cash-flow negative with 6-8 months of runway left. We’re currently trying to raise a Seed round (pre-seed is done), but some VCs are being picky about our numbers so not the best look but just started. Also recently another engineer quit, and I’ve taken on a massive chunk of their workload. Between the extra stress and the market rate, I started feeling undervalued and took a few interviews.\n\nI just received a verbal offer for $200k. I value peace and comfort, and I genuinely believe in my current company. I don’t want to leave, but I also don't want to leave $30k on the table; especially when I’m doing the work of two people and the company’s future is uncertain.\n\n1. How do I approach the founder? Since we haven’t closed the Seed round yet, a $30k salary bump may be a big ask for our runway.\n2. Is a lump sum better? I’m considering asking for a $20k retention bonus instead of a permanent salary hike to help the company's burn rate. And later ask for an increase.\n3. Equity vs. Cash: Should I use the offer to negotiate for more than my 1%? I feel though its not smart given the rockiness.\n4. What’s the \"fair\" play? I don't want to hold them over a barrel while they’re raising, but I also need to look out for myself if we don't clear the next 8 months.\n\nAny advice from people who have negotiated during a fundraise or stuck it out through a rocky Seed round?\n\n  \n",

In neither scenario are you starving, maybe there’s something more or less compared to market for your role but I dunno. Doesn’t matter. \n\nHere’s the facts. Theres no comfy startup like that. While you’re working and focussing, the founders are sweating every night as the bank account dives toward zero and they don’t have the next financing lined up. It’s not comfy. That company must raise a round definitely within 6 months, which means they need a term sheet in 3 months. And honestly, nobody likes to fund companies about to cash out. They get picked apart on terms. But whatever, you do what you gotta do to live. Long story short - it’s risky and there’s just no guarantee at all that it doesn’t go down. \n\nHowever. If you leave, that could compound the issues and make the company even worse. It’s really a question of whether the risk is that risky to you? How secure are in your industry. Are you confident that you could find a new job if/when this one ends? Can you finance a job search for a month or 3 months? Is that a big deal to you or just a small inconvenience. Do you like the company and vision and would you derive satisfaction from seeing it succeed and being a part of that?\n\nIt’s a matter of taste. You can take the stable 200k, or give 170k a run for a few more months and really give it your best and see if it works out. \n\nWhat you can’t do at this stage is- you can’t ask for a raise. It will only make things worse, that 30k is not going to make your job easier, and it will make it tougher for the company. You can try to ask for more equity but with 1% already and going out to market, it will weaken the funding narrative giving out grants like that. \n\nIt’s just a question for you. Do you wanna give it a shot and try to get to a win understanding that it’s risky. Or do you wanna take that stable job.",

A few months ago, I quit my job and decided to pursue this SaaS product we made a couple of months ago. \n\nI happened to come across an investor and they decided to fund us quite elaborately, more than what we ever thought of.\n\nAnyway, the idea itself isn't mine, but my friends decided to make me the CEO. Problems with ego was apparent with the CTO (The real founder) was obvious from the start. But I've dealt with people like this before and honestly I myself was one in my early teens and twenties. However these people don't have much business experience and I'm having a hard time to make them do things, simple things like a daily update call on the morning. Telling to fix the scope etc. Plus they come in late to the office and two of them are working other jobs on the side. \n\nI'm tempted to inform the investor to take over, but I sort of believe that it'll make the team and myself look incompatible. I seriously want to put some structure in place and I seriously want to put the product out to the market. But it feels like a big pain in the a\\\\\\*\\\\\\*se and it's draining me out both creatively and mentally.\n\nInstead of taking responsibility for things I'm getting trash talk back, for instance if I asked someone when are you shipping this next feature their answer would be like \"Where's the social media post\". \n\nI dunno if this is a me problem, I thought startups were about unity and fun and building together setting aside egos and this is the complete opposite, and the frustrating part is that we haven't even shipped the product yet.",

They work when everyone's committed to the same destination. When they're not, those tools just create friction.\n\nThe real problem isn't that they won't show up on time. It's that you don't share values, commitment level, or clarity on what you're actually building.\n\nYou can't manage people toward an unclear destination.\n\nI've been the founder trying to impose structure on a misaligned team. It's exhausting because you're fighting the foundation, not fixing execution problems. Every \"simple\" request becomes a negotiation because there's no shared understanding of what matters.\n\nTwo things helped me:\n\nFirst, stop trying to manage the symptoms. The trash talk, the side jobs, the resistance - those are signals that this team never clarified what they're building together or what they're willing to sacrifice for it.\n\nSecond, before you talk to the investor, have a direct conversation with the team. Not about daily standups. About whether you're actually aligned on building this company. What are they willing to commit? What do they want out of this? Is this their priority or a side project?\n\nIf they can't answer those clearly, or if their answers don't align with yours, no amount of structure will fix it. You'll be fighting this battle every single day.\n\nHave you had that direct conversation about commitment and alignment yet?",

Or you get clever.\n\nMy advice to you is to focus less on the CTO/problem right now, and more on the constructive process of leveling yourself up as a CEO. And get a mentor through/in collaboration with the investor.\n\nHere's the trick in that:\n\nYou running to the investor saying that the team are idiots makes both you and the team look bad. It's a no win situation. And the investor won't be happy getting dragged into a \"he said, she said\"-type of a catfight when they've put their money into that team. (The investor might be friendly, but he's not your friend!!)\n\nBut, if you work on your growth and get yourself a CEO mentor that the investor is friends with, then they'll be there either (passively, through discussions) helping you sort out the team, or they'll over a cup of coffee tell their investor friend about the disastrous CTO.\n\nThat's a win-win type of a situation for you.\n\nAt the end of that you've either both grown as a CEO and sorted out the mess, or you have put yourself in the good seat for whatever crash is about to happen. Making you able to walk away in a better position, and keep growing your career as a startup CEO (as compared to having just failed at your first and only attempt).\n\nThe only risk is of course if it turns out that you're the too incompetent person that accidentally caused all the problems. But even in that case it's better to learn that through showing that you've had the maturity to want to learn and level up, rather than you just causing a fight with others.\n\n(imo, and all the other usual caveats, of course. including that I was imagining a western-style work culture.)",

He didn't turn things around overnight, but by the end of the Vietnam conflict, without getting rid of people, without layoffs or firings or whatever corporate equivalent you would have in the army, he had one of the most decorated regiments in the army. His leadership is credited with turning things around and is actually taught at West Point.\n\n\n\nThe point that I hope is relevant for you is that there's a way that you can bring these people together. Part of that is going to require a clear vision of what you're bringing them together for. If you're right now having a difficult time articulating what the North Star is for the entire company, then asking for status meetings is just start-up theatre, and that is definitely not something you want to do.\n\n\n\nSo again I'm going to be a little bit trite and quote Stephen Covey: one of the seven habits is \"Begin with the end in mind.\" What is it that you're trying to achieve? What's the big goal that everyone shares? Identify that and build upon it. What are the next steps you need from everyone to move you towards that goal? Not from a start-up theatre standpoint but an actual achievement. Might be a little step, might be a big step, doesn't matter. All you want is to get people moving in the same direction. You're the CEO, you're the quarterback, you're on the same field as everyone else. Find a way to communicate the goal and rally people around that. It's not about you; it's about what you're all trying to achieve. Make that the focus.",

      "text": "So we're a two person very early(4 months in) cofounders who's building an mobile app. Currently 0 revenue, a few sum of alpha testers from our friends mostly, not bad retention(Around 30 \\~ 40% are still using after 3 weeks even when we didn't push them to), Got early angel investment(sum of $10k), now we're almost ready to get a big angel investment(sum of $100k) soon.\n\nSo all in all, not a bad start right? But here's the problem: My cofounder is kinda not fully commited.\n\nI'm the CTO, 100% bootstrapped from the beginning full time, no wages, spent my money for upkeep costs. Built and manage the total flow of mvp - which is UI/UX design, wireframes, backend, frontend, db, cicd, testings, deployment, appstore optimizations, etc. Basically built a full mvp in 3 months with no help but me. So I took 60% of the share and he agreed.\n\nHe's the CEO and also bootstrapped, but he was and still is a part-timer. He works around 10\\~15 hours a week allegedely. He acquired most of our alpha testers(around 30) and still is acquiring some, was supposed to have full responsibility with marketing but apart from making our social accounts, he has produced 0 visible items. I would say his most contribution so far was his initial idea and his ability to horde angel investors to our side.\n\nI have to tell, he is very good with investor relations and managing them. But like that's it so far. He would sometimes give me okayish idea about our products, I deny like 90% of them cos it is just not worth it... I guess the product is so far so good since most of our investors and testers were satisfied with it.\n\nThe problem now stems from me doing additional work. Yes he does fetch us investors, but negotiating, drafting contracts, finding lawyers is all my work so far. I even had to make him a pitch deck, draft submissions for VC investments, research other investment opportunities, etc etc... I had to attend most of the investor's meeting since he wanted me there to support him(Which I would happily if he did his works...). My breaking point was when I was doing more \"business\" then \"building\" stuffs. I couldn't focus on what I was building and forgetting what I was even building sometimes.\n\nThe other problem is that he just wants all of the fruits from our business + his current job. He wants to take a few(Not big but also not small) stipend while also having his shares(40%) and his job. He is about to be promoted as a marketing lead so I think that's why he just wants his job also. He works like 10+ hours a day, sometimes 12 with his job. I know he is not lazy, he's just greedy and wants everything and don't want to give up a few.\n\nI opened up a serious talk with him about this issue, he just shrugged with saying that we are already doing great, we will get more investors, he will convert to full time once we're \"successful\" enough... He told me I can take \"whatever I want\" as stipend from our investment fund. If I were to take a huge pay, let's say around $3500/month(Which is quite a decent salary from where I live), we will still have 20 months of runway left with our expense and $400/month marketing budget, which is not bad I think.\n\nBut I feel this is so wrong. I can take much less(Like $1800/month) and he can take much less and we can save up for more runway or more marketing budget. But he insists that we should \"reward\" ourselves more. I'm so conflicted right now what to do at this point. I even suggested he stays part time and be a fundraiser and he takes 0.5% as bonus every round but he said no to that.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Do you think we can pull it off still? Or is this not sustainable long term?",

Y Combinator's Michael Seibel estimates ninety-eight percent of founders claim to have product-market fit when they don't. This focus inward is keeping the partners from crucial market learning and customer discovery. Well ... unless you two have a quarter million friends. \n\nPlenty have posted their shock that all the positive opinion dried up and blew away the instant they asked for payment. Not half. Not most. All of it. \n\nI think your partner is using investor funding as counterfeit validation. Mostly to avoid answering the question will enough customers pay enough money to make this a viable venture. \n\nI expect lame excuses about this all around. What's not happening is growth, word-of-mouth, any signal anybody is willing to pay under any circumstance. That's a serious failure. All too convenient to consider an bug hunter a user and a user as an eventual customer. Which is why hardly anybody posting *to a business forum* will mention paying customers. \n\nHowever, while I think celebration is premature, there is nothing unusual going on. You couldn't count the number of posts here complaining the other partner isn't pulling his weight. And their complaints trump yours by a wide margin, some of these slack asses are one step from comatose. \n\nThe failure point is discussion and correction of perceived problems *between partners*. Because if the partnership had a solid foundation, you would not be trying to get Redditors on your side. Despite previous talks nothing has changed.\n\nIf anything, these posts should have both partners making their case. That doesn't happen. Which tells me most partnerships are doomed. \n\nThe reason I call this the amateur coder's forum is the business side is undervalued. And management issues like this only come up long after *the management has neglected its job.* Nobody is managing anything ...they cope with problems rather than deal with them.\n\nDon't sit on your laurels because you have none. Businesspeople, having control of the purse strings, can and should hire -- not partner. And posts such as yours is the reason why. \n\nMonths in and thousands spent, at least nobody used the bullshit term Minimum Viable Product. The one bright spot.\n\nPartnering problems are so frequent just that topic could be its own sub. Work this out with your partner because if you can't get your point across you are on the way out, one way or the other. You may not be aware. You may not admit it. The signals are there.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m a first time founder and I’m hoping to get some real guidance from people who’ve actually built physical products.\n\nI’m working on a non electrical hardware product for warehouses and retail environments. Most of my work experience has been in stores and warehouses, so the problem I’m trying to solve comes directly from seeing how slow and repetitive certain manual tasks are in real life. \n\nI’m still very early in the process. My LLC is pending, I don’t have funding yet, or ask friends and family to help with Boot strapping either and I haven’t filed any patents. I’ve only made a very rough, non functional concept prototype just to visualize the idea, nothing that works or could be used. I’m intentionally not sharing design or implementation details here because I want to handle IP the right way. \n\nI plan to work with independent mechanical designers and material specialists, and hire contractors as needed for prototyping, testing, and manufacturing prep. What I’m struggling with isn’t the idea itself, but the order of operations and funding. \n\nI’ve read a lot online and honestly it’s overwhelming and often contradictory. I don’t have a founder network, and I don't have any technical skills or knowledge so I’m trying to learn without making expensive mistakes. I’m fine moving slow if it means doing it right.\n\nI’m mainly looking for guidance on what should come first for a non electrical hardware startup like this and funding. \nIt would help me a lot to get some answers from the following questions based on your own experience as a founder. \n\nWhen did you personally involve a patent attorney, and what did you wait on? \n\nHow did you validate demand before spending serious money on manufacturing? \n\nWhat funding paths actually worked for you for physical products, whether that was grants, accelerators, pilots, LOIs, SBIR, or something else? \n\nAnd what early mistakes cost you time or money that you wish you had avoided? Is it realistic to try and keep 100% of the company? \n\nDid you find giving up equity for expertise or capital was necessary? \n\nAnd since I am a hardware start up, most of the time will be spend on product development and quality testing and collecting feedback and give it back to the team of contractors so that they can make revisions and improvements to the product before we can move on to manufacturing. My long term goal is to offer this as Hardware as a Service. Does that change anything in the early validation or funding stage?\n\nI want to keep things lean, avoid unnecessary steps, and reduce risk as much as possible and learn from everyone. I’m not looking for feedback on the product itself, just advice on process, sequencing, and how to approach this the right way. \nIf you’ve taken a physical product from idea to testing to manufacturing, or even failed trying, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective. And I also want to keep the company private. Thanks in advance.",

Could you do something similar in the early phases and save a fortune on your contractors?

I'd suggest looking at your 3-5 biggest ideas and finding the thing you can get your hands on, ideally locally.\n\nFor example you say you don't have technical skills to build the ugly prototype -- I find it highly unlikely you couldn't dive in and learn it in 3 months if you REALLY wanted to. \n\nDo you have ADHD? The high of ideas can be overwhelming and the freezing once things get tough -- your dopamine is gone, and you move to the next ideas.\n\nCommit to something, it'll be tough but you can teach yourself to build a prototype, I promise.

          "text": "It’s a tough question. I’m building an electronic hardware product, but the overall process is essentially the same. You have to start by fully understanding your goal and identifying the closest realistic milestone you need to reach. To get to a fully implemented product, you’ll usually need some combination of collaborations, investment, and a functional prototype. The key is to focus on the minimum you need to do right now in order to move forward without overbuilding. That usually starts with writing a simple but clear business or requirements document that defines the problem, the target customer, the value you’re delivering, and what the first usable version of the product must achieve. From there, you need to be honest about what you can financially commit to on your own and build the smallest possible prototype that can clearly demonstrate proof of concept. It doesn’t need to be 100% functional or production-ready just enough to show that the idea works and creates real value. Once you have that, you can start reaching out to companies for collaboration, but only if you know exactly what you’re offering them, whether that’s a pilot, efficiency gains, or early access. This stage involves a lot of small, detailed work. If you can secure one or two LOIs or a pilot and explore relevant grants at the same time, you’ll be in a much stronger position when approaching investors. You don’t need thousands of customers or many partnerships early, credible signals are enough. At this stage, it’s also important to be careful with IP: avoid oversharing, use NDAs when appropriate, understand the laws in your country specific about this, and focus on protection after you’ve validated the core technology and market. Everything depends on context, but a minimal, milestone driven approach is usually the most efficient and lowest risk way forward.",

          "text": "Speaking from the outside looking in, the biggest risk early hardware founders face is over indexing on IP and building before they have real evidence of pull. In practice, most teams I have seen delay patent work until they have clearer signals from pilots or LOIs, because a provisional only really buys time, not certainty. demand validation usually looks less like surveys and more like someone committing budget, access, or time to test a crude version of the workflow you are targeting. Funding paths for physical products tend to follow that same logic, grants and accelerators care about technical feasibility, while angels and strategics care about whether a buyer is already leaning in. Keeping 100 percent ownership is theoretically possible, but it often trades speed and learning for control, which can be costly in hardware. Hardware as a service does not change the early steps much, but it raises the bar on reliability and unit economics earlier than many first time founders expect.",

I am fortunate enough to have the experience, tools and expertise to do all the design and prototyping myself, so it is a huge advantage. I have been mechanical designer for over 20 years and have designed dozens of products across various industries for large companies and startups, and it can be very daunting even when you have a full complement of resources. If you lack the expertise or resources to design and build a prototype of the concept yourself then you will have to go the contractor route that you mentioned. Be forewarned though, this can get expensive very quickly. Be sure to lay out in as much detail what each “phase” of this development requires (just a rough 3D concept versus a fully vetted production ready product). This initial concept process, if you hire the right people, will work out most of your manufacturing questions. Is it going to require machining processes? Is it going to be sheet metal? Is it going to be assembled with fasteners? Or welded? Are injection-molded parts required? All these combined? Can my prototype be designed and built in a way that can transition to higher production volumes easily? It is one thing to 3D print some parts and hobble together a prototype, it is another thing entirely to take that idea and manufacture it on a production level scale. Be warned that there are many, many people who can create a 3D model of something, I taught my kids to model stuff in Solidworks when they were 8 years old LOL. What you want to find is someone who can work through that design and define these manufacturing processes as they design, keeping DFM, DFA and cost in mind throughout the process. That usually requires years of experience.\n\n \n\nAnd all of this is after you have done the research to even see if your product is a viable solution to an existing problem.",

I put up an ad on Y Combinator. I burned through my first startup solo working with offshore devs.  gained some modest traction (1000+ users), made a bunch of mistakes. but just couldn't get the build stable enough or to iterate fast enough to attract stable growth, revenues, or real investors. \n\nwhat I did earn in that 2 years, though, was the lashings and experience to understand what it takes to attract a quality co-founder. \n1) Became a real expert in my space. An expert in my competitors, customer pains/sticking points, trends, and explored just about every aspect of the industry.  you need real hands on experience in your space.  launching counts if you're doing it right. \n2) be/become an expert in marketing and/or customer feedback. you need to show that you have a plan and can execute/attract customers.  \n3) leverage customer feedback for conviction about solutions to customer pain. be open to pivots! \n4) validate your idea. Strong devs have a lot of options. you need to frame yourself as the rocket ship they NEED to jump on before it's too late.  validation van be interviews or surveys. but ideally it's signups on a website with $ down. \n5) be able to fundraise.  you don't need to necessarily have the experience, but they need to believe that an investor will believe in you.  \n6) be a good leader and supportive partner.  lower your expectation in a technical co-founder. they're humans not magicians. they make mistakes. AI gives us the tools to really paint our vision. gotta communicate clearly.  \n\nTowards the end of that 2 years I began looking more seriously for my unicorn.  posted job ads on linked in, refreshed my YCombinator and other websites. ultimately I found my partner on Y Combinator, and we're set to launch next month. \n\nit was honestly brutal. wish I had prioritize a partner sooner.  such a roller coaster working with contractors.  progress was slow. always in the red zone but never past the goal line. growth, growth...just to see it pulled out from under you.   one of the hardest years of my life.",
