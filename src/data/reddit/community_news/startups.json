If you have a spouse or family, how are you managing your finances and is it enough? Are you working for an exit, or is running this company your long-term goal? \n\nI understand a startup is more challenging than a job, you need to care about the problem not the money, there's a high chance of failure, etc. But founders still need to support themselves and fulfill other goals outside of work, especially if you're taking on more risk than in a job.      \n\nI'm full-time building a company with enough interest / traction to raise and hire more people. But my SO and I want to get married and eventually start a family, not to mention other goals like buying a home / car, traveling, etc. My former career on its own can certainly support a comfortable life, but hers can't. Plus I don't have any successful role models in my network of founders - everyone is either not stable enough in personal life yet, living off spouse's income / came from money, or went back to corporate. So I've been thinking a lot about going back to a job especially before I take outside money or decide to bring more people along for the ride. \n\nPlease no snarky bs like \"if you think about money or family, you're not cut out to be a founder\" ",

I was in personal debt, returned to my mother’s house, and stayed like that for almost a year. Took some freelancing to get some money and go thru it.

I consider myself one of the bests local professionals in my field.  \nRight now things are pretty hard and challenging. I'm single employee, I would like to scale and hire more people, but I don't have enough workload right now.\n\nI don't have kids, but recently I got a wife. She is supporting me a lot, and helping sometimes with some basic marketing tasks which are outside of her experience, but she can handle them. Tbh, she is less responsive comparing to an employee, she rejects some tasks when she is in a bad mood.\n\nSeveral years ago I was working as an employee for an USA company, my salary ( comparing to local market was pretty HIGH ) . I left that company because:\n\n1. I was tired of poor management.\n2. bad decisions\n3. I wanted to try myself as a business man.\n\nRight now I can't say that I'm a business man. I fell myself more like a freelancer, who is TRYING to become a business man and scale the projects.\n\nWhen I was an employee, I was working less and receiving more $$$. When I left the company, some local managers were really surprised, because they were realising that probability to find a company with a higher salary is pretty low. Recently, I had several months with a high income, but I was working really a lot. I was working so much, that I don't think that everyone could handle it.\n\nRight now it is challenging because:\n\n1. IT market significantly decreased. I have a lot of IT friends who were laid off, some of them are searching for job for months\n2. Some of the projects are not stable. Recently main customer decreased amount of hours, and probably another client will drop shortly.\n3. I'm living in a 3rd world country where my experience in majority cases is not applicable for local SMBs. My services are mostly needed for huge corporations and very technological startups.\n   1.  It is hard to escape boundaries of the bubble, and reach directly decision makers from foreign companies.\n4. I have to handle a lot of things that I wouldn’t deal with as a regular employee:\n   1.  some customers are paying with huge delays, I need to spend some time sending reminders\n   2. I need to think about marketing. In some busy days I don't have enough energy for that\n   3. I need to handle some random stuff. For example, recently I replaced my accountant with another one, and spend several days on calling different companies, negotiating the transitioning to another company\n\n**Next plan**:  \nAfter some projects dropped, I had more time for marketing, research and brainstorm. Started to write more linkedin posts with successful cases, update website, ask for clutch reviews from current and old customers, writing some website blog posts with finished work, and launched several outreach campaigns. Hopefully it will bring some positive results.\n\nStill considering that I'm located in a wrong place. My local taxes are pretty low, but still hard to find some local good customers. From local companies, my ICT are banks and telecom, but it is mostly impossible to reach their decision makers, or to get a good rate.",

The trade is usually optionality and ownership versus predictable income, and that gap matters a lot once you factor in family planning, housing, and stress outside of work. A lot of early traction still does not translate into personal financial stability for a long time, especially if you want to run the company responsibly and not just optimize for founder cash flow. I would not frame this as a lack of founder mindset, it is more about risk tolerance and timing. plenty of technically strong people step back into a job to de risk their personal life and return to building later with more leverage. the hard part is that there is no clean signal early on that tells you when staying all in is rational versus when it is just hope.",

For the first 2 years, we bootstrapped and then raised ~$1.2 million.\n\nFor the first 3 years of the company's life, I had the lowest salary, and so did one of my co-founders. The last 2 I was in the middle pack but not much higher than the lowest. With that said, we pay market salaries now.\n\nMy income for the past 5 years approx (not based in the US, so after year 3-4, these are pretty acceptable in my country)\n- Year 1: $15,400\n- Year 2: $31,000\n- Year 3: $41,600\n- Year 4: $50,600\n- Year 5: $83,400 (big increase due to commissions)\n\nIn hindsight, I wouldn't be earning more if I was having a job as an employee in my field, and I would sure as hell not have a more stable job as an employee than as a founder.\n\nOnce you have a functioning business, you are the last person in the company to lose your job, and you are also the one who decides how much you get paid.\n\nHowever, even seemingly successful businesses can be a source of a ton of stress. I think about running out of money almost every month, and you have to make some really tough calls. After raising from VCs, our product failed to gain traction, and we went through a very bumpy road to survive. We almost ran out of money twice and had to let half of the team go twice. It absolutely sucks and you never know if you need to do that again a year later.\n\nSo yeah - be prepared for a ride haha - but ultimately at the end of the day if you succeed (even just moderately) it opens up doors for you that would never be easily accessible as an employee.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "My recent posts were about how we faced a forced pivot under intense runway pressure in 2024.\n\nWhat I didn’t explain is that our company would never have survived that moment if we hadn’t fixed something much earlier: a broken founder partnership.\n\nBefore we raised our $7M Series Pre-A, between 2021 and 2023, things inside the company were rough. I’m a non-technical, finance-background CEO. My co-founder is a deeply technical AI/CS engineer. At our lowest point, we were fighting constantly. He once yelled at me in the office. We were genuinely close to becoming unable to work together.\n\nI forced ourselves to rebuild. Here’s what I learned, especially as a non-technical founder working with a very strong technical co-founded.\n\nThe first three lessons are especially specific to non-technical founders working with a CTO:\n\n1. **Respect their technical taste or you don’t do this at all.** This is what I believe foundational! As a non-tech founder, normally you can't even judge code quality. What you can judge is their taste and integrity as an engineer or a person. If you don't fundamentally trust that, maybe you need a new partner.\n2. **Never treat your CTO like a cost center.** They're not an outsourced delivery machine. Dumping all deadlines and customer pressure onto them destroys trust. If you treat a CTO co-founder like a contractor, you don't have a real CTO.\n3. **Even when everything is on fire, don't bypass them.** When deliveries were burning, I learnt to not go around my CTO to direct his team. My job was to calm customers to buy some time, order some late-night food for the team and trust him to lead.\n\nThe next two lessons helped our relationship, and I think they apply more broadly to founding teams in general:\n\n1. **We eat together a lot**. We have at least (in average) three 1:1 working lunches a week. This is where fast decisions, alignment, and mutual learning happen. Shared context compounds.\n2. **Radical transparency around cash.** I give him unfiltered access to our cash position. When I push back on expensive ideas, it doesn't feel arbitrary, cause we're reacting to the same number. Shared urgency comes from shared reality.\n\nFast forward to late 2024. The AI wave hits. Our product is obsolete. But this time, instead of yelling, we were in a foxhole together. Because we had built that foundation of trust, we could make the hard decisions as a team.  \n  \nI’m not sharing this as advice or a playbook, it's just one founder’s experience. If there’s a takeaway at all, it’s probably this: treat your CTO like a true partner, especially when things are hard. It might not feel urgent when everything is going well, but it matters a lot when the storm hits.\n\nWould genuinely love to hear how others invest in their founder partnerships before they’re stress-tested.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I hope your Friday is going well. Please be safe with the snowstorm, especially those in the South.\n\nAbout six months ago, I started a company. I thought it might be interesting to share a founder’s perspective from the Midwest, especially while building something fairly technical.\n\nBefore this, I worked as a DevOps engineer and most recently as an SRE at Cloudflare. I spent a lot of late nights inside a lot of tools, watching teams ship software faster than I could realistically maintain it. Over time, it became clear that while tooling had improved, the underlying problem had not. There was no real end in sight that would meaningfully improve both my work life and my personal life.\n\nThat realization is what ultimately pushed me to leave a job I genuinely liked and start a company.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and because I have worked in big tech, I was fortunate to build relationships with many incredibly talented people here, including local investors. It is a small ecosystem, with both challenges and strengths. After Missouri Startup Weekend, shout out to everyone who runs it, I decided to lean fully into building from here. See you there again this year.\n\nIn doing so, I learned a lot about what it means to try to build a venture-backed company in the Midwest. I want to share a few observations, not as complaints, but as context for anyone on a similar path.\n\n**Raising capital feels meaningfully different here.**  \nMidwest investors tend to be more conservative. They are thoughtful, kind, and deeply focused on fundamentals, but often operate on different cycles than the coasts. Pattern matching leans toward fintech, healthcare, and vertical SaaS. We leaned into this ecosystem anyway because some people believed in what we were building and believed in us.\n\nAt the same time, we found ourselves spending a lot of energy on education. When we spoke to investors on the West Coast, many immediately understood the problem space. The challenge then became valuation expectations and alignment. Midwest valuations can be strong for great companies, but the gap between coastal expectations and a great Midwest company can make it difficult to pull in certain types of partners early on.\n\nThis is not a value judgment. It is simply a reality worth understanding if you are building here.\n\n**Cross-collaboration takes more intentional effort.**  \nThere are incredibly talented builders across Midwest cities, but fewer accidental collisions. Trying another founder’s product, trading early feedback, or discovering what someone else is building often requires deliberate outreach or travel. The serendipity you get in denser hubs is harder to come by, which makes community building even more important.\n\n**Specialization shapes what gets built.**  \nMany Midwest investors are generalists rather than deep tech or AI infrastructure specialists. Generalists tend to fund general companies. That is why you see so much excellence in healthcare and fintech here. What we see less of are companies attempting truly wild or category-defining technical bets.\n\nThat said, this is not a criticism. It is an opportunity.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to tear down Midwest VCs or compare regions. I have met outstanding founders and investors here who are doing real, meaningful work. I want to celebrate them, learn from them, and meet more of them.\n\nIf you are building something in the Midwest, whether it is early, strange, ambitious, or simply useful to a handful of people, I would genuinely love to see it. Share your company. Reach out. Try other people’s products. Offer feedback. Cross-pollination matters, even if the outcome is not a billion-dollar business.\n\nAt the end of the day, building something that helps even one other person is still worth doing.",

Outside of them, every connection is intentional - which is exhausting but arguably produces higher quality relationships.\n\nBuilding in the UK (smaller tech scene than London specifically), I've found the same pattern: investors who immediately get it are often coastal, and the education gap with local capital is a real time sink. You end up becoming a translator between your problem space and their pattern library.\n\nOne thing that helped: treating online communities as the accidental collision layer that physical proximity would normally provide. Reddit, HN, Discord servers for your niche. Not a perfect substitute for grabbing coffee with someone, but it fills part of the gap.\n\nThe 80/20 rule another commenter mentioned is painfully accurate. Building is the easy part.

They are just trying to be part of the hype and nonsense that flows around there.\n\nMy two cents are that I would be much more interested in what you are working on and your story behind it than whether you founded the company or not. At the early stage, I feel like we are more creators than founders, because you are building the next great service, technology, product, etc., and that is the story people want to hear.\n\nOne last thing I'd say mention is that over the years, when talking to people about titles, I have always encouraged them to worry less about the title and more about the impact and money they are making.

Team is great, culture is great, pay is great, I basically have no problem, its all remote so it might get lonely but that’s it.\n\nI open this up to my current employers and they basically said they will allow me to be in charge of companies expansion to other products where I can feel the entrepreneurial parts of it, gather more experience, and have a % cut or better financial upside if the new expansions reach the target goals etc.\n\nAm I doing a stupid decision here by leaving something good, or since this is also a great incubator its probably never going to be the same with trying your own thing.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.",

Otherwise they replace your internal conviction with external validation. That’s not always a bad trade but its something to think about.\n\nAlso,\n\nWanting to create a startup is often a proxy for wanting control, narrative ownership, and asymmetric upside.\n\nYou already kinda have 2.5 of those at your current job.\n\nWhatever you decide i hope you succeed. I hope some of this helped, even a little.\n\nGood luck!",

It’s the safest path, sounds like you are doing well and seems like you might have a career in front of you that can be both rewarding and successful. That’s also what any person who crunches numbers for a living will tell you.\n\nNow if after reading that paragraph you are like “well who tf is this guy telling me I should play it safe, he doesn’t even know me.”, well maybe that tells you deep down you don’t want to play it safe. And if the next couple of paragraphs don’t scare you or bother you, than maybe it’s worth a shot.\n\nBuilding a company is hard. It’s the hardest thing I ever did. People will hate you, even when you try to do the right thing. Customers will cancel for no reason. If you are lucky and are even mildly successful you’ll be responsible for expenses that are more than what both your parents used to make in a year. And those expenses will come in monthly. \n\nWhen things go right, everyone else gets the credit, when things go wrong it’s your fault. The only problems you’ll get to deal with are the absolutely soul crushing, hair on fire type of shit only the top and most thick skinned customer support agents deal with.\n\nYour phone will ring on vacation, and at the dinner table. You will be absolutely consumed to the point where you will actually forget about things in your personal life until it’s too late.\n\nWith all that being said, it’s also like a drug. You’ll have some of the highest highs and greatest moments in your life, and it’s a rush that you’ll never replace with a 9-5.\n\nI miss it and hope when my transition period ends I can have another go.\n\nEither way best of luck.

An incubator compresses uncertainty and forces you to answer hard questions quickly, often before you fully understand the problem space.

In practice, that can give you exposure to many of the same trade offs as a startup, with a much softer downside. the question is not whether the incubator is prestigious or rare, but whether it teaches you something you cannot realistically get where you are.\n\nI would focus less on fear of missing out and more on which path sharpens your judgment and decision making.

We had a total economic impact of somewhere around $10m CAD that stayed in-province because of the jobs created from the increased sales our vendors were experiencing. We had Whole Foods and Sobeys literally knocking on our doors and I got to refuse them with a smile. We didn’t need them and neither did our vendors. we also worked with Food Not Bombs and helped to feed over 400 food insecure residents in Toronto every sunday and created the largest black plastic recycling effort in Toronto.\n\nThat definitely had a positive community impact. *shrug*",

          "text": "I think a lot of this reaction is understandable, especially after being exposed to real suffering rather than pitch decks and metrics. Startup narratives flatten impact into growth curves, which makes anything that does not map to revenue feel invisible or fake. At the same time, neither startups nor academia has a monopoly on meaningful work, they just optimize for very different incentives. In practice, a lot of academic research never reaches patients either, and a lot of startups are not pretending to cure cancer, they are solving narrower problems. The frustration usually comes from the mismatch between stated mission and actual day to day decisions. If you are craving alignment between effort and human value, it is reasonable to question the environment you are in. A PhD can make sense if you are motivated by the work itself rather than the story around it. The harder question is what kind of contribution you want to make and under what constraints, because every system trades something off. It is worth giving yourself time before making a sharp pivot, especially when emotions are raw.",

      "text": "Right now, I am running a startup with my cofunder. It’s just the two of us, and while we’ve raised a tiny bit of VC money, it is enough for us to survive for now.\n\nBased on current situation, the two of us simply can’t handle everything ourselves anymore, so we’ve had to start hiring. And honestly, **hiring has been one of the most painful parts**:\n\n* Good talent is expensive, especially in the U.S., and we just can’t afford it at this stage;\n* So we started looking into hiring oversea, but remote work bring a new challenge: unstable work quality\n* After quite a bit of trial and error, we’ve finally managed to find a few decent people at a reasonable price.\n\n**But then came the next big challenge: management**. My co-founder and I both come from big tech companies where we were just IC. We’ve never really had to manage people before. Now that we do, we’re realizing just how hard it is to get it right:\n\n* If we’re too blunt, it kills motivation;\n* If we’re too soft, things get dragged out and quality suffers;\n* Striking the right tone and level of direction feels incredibly tricky. and especially i am the person working more with remote ppl and i am very straight forward person.\n\nI know some people would say, “Well, if someone isn’t working out, just replace them.” But in reality:\n\n* We’re already overwhelmed with the amount of work on our plates;\n* Given how stretched we already are, investing time into interviewing and onboarding could further disrupt our current workflow and introduce additional risks to output quality.\n\nAs for equity, i am very hesitant. I have seen friends fall out badly over equity disputes in their startup. So for now, we'd rather keep things simple and stick with paid employees.\n\nSo I'm throwing this out to the community:\n\n1. How did you get through this stage of your startup?\n2. Did you just power through, duct-taping things together until you had more stability and could afford better hires?\n3. Or is there a smarter way to navigate this messy, uncertain middle ground?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or stories from others who’ve been there. Thank you for your time.",

I sympathize with your situation; it is tricky to navigate. \n\nThe first 10ppl you hire are critical in defining the company culture for the next 100s you will bring on board. In particular, the 3rd and 4th person you hire are immensely critical - they can break your entire business if they don't fit culture-wise with you and your co-founder. \n\nBased on that, I suggest you make culture fit a component as important as expertise in your hiring decision. If you are a straightforward person, you can't hire someone who is touchy-feely. \n\nRegarding lack of management skills, you will need to pick them over time, unless you plan to carve an IC role for yourself as the company grows (you will still need leadership skills, but that is slightly different than having people report to you). Having said that, it should not matter much for the first 10 hires, because they should not need to managed - you should really be looking for people who tell \\_you\\_ what needs to happen and how, not juniors who require baby-sitting. \n\nGood luck!",

But putting it into practice is where I struggle.\n\n1. For being nice and tough \n\nYou mentioned how it’s hard to go from being warm and easygoing to suddenly becoming intense. I couldn’t agree more. That’s very much my situation. By nature, I’m an easygoing person. I don’t get worked up about a lot of things in life, but I do have high standards when it comes to work. So most of the time, before problems arise, I’m pretty laid-back and approachable. But when something goes wrong, I suddenly flip into a tough, no-nonsense mode and that shift catches people off guard. I honestly don’t know yet how to adjust that dynamic. I feel I have wear a mask now, cant be myself in work hours which is all my awak hours.\n\n2. As for the idea of demanding a lot without reciprocating, in terms of money, I think we’re being fair. \n\nBut if we’re talking about emotional investment or effort, that’s where I’m genuinely confused. It’s a tiny startup, and it’s not like we have clear top-down goals. Most of the time, I’m still figuring out the goals myself. And on top of that, I’m expected to manage and motivate a team it’s a lot to handle, and I don’t always know how to do it right.\n\n3. About to know better about your employees\n\nWhat you said about knowing people’s strengths and weaknesses really resonated with me. That’s actually how I try to assign work now. I put in a lot of effort trying to drive this forward. Not everyone is interested in discovering their own strengths and weaknesses. In fact, I often feel like I’m the one pushing them to figure it out, more than they’re pushing themselves.\n\n  \n3. About company goal\n\nRegarding your question about weekly updates or communicating company goals. We do have weekly meetings but we are currently in a period of turbulence due to changes in the external environment, so the business is still shifting quite a lot. I’m still figuring out the direction myself.\n\nWhat you said made me realize that so much of this, leadership, goal-setting, expectation management, really depends on me having clarity about what we are doing.\n\n**But the reality I'm facing is that I need to figure things out while also trying to be a good leader. Honestly, this is the hardest job I've ever had. I know how to build a product, and I know how to sell one but this part, the leadership part, is where I’m still very new and honestly not confident at all.**\n\n  \nSo yeah… it's a lot.

What type of people I want to work with ( it’s more about the personality part. Criteria would be passionate, quick learner, structured, builder, high work ethic, ok to work longer hours… list may go on. Quick tip, mostly people tend to hire people are similar to themselves and it may create bottlenecks. You may more seek for complementary personalities selected for the right places) \n\n2. What skills you are looking for ( you can identify the hard criteria) and try to hire the top talent. Going oversees is a good strategy. But if the oversees in Europe, within Europe you still have many countries with different cost of living. If the level you are looking for is still high budget I would go one step more junior but with a strong culture fit so they can learn fast \n\n3. Management. There is no one fits all and it’s a lot about understanding psychology rather than applied management methodologies at this stage. The best approach for remote first teams are setting very clear time bound deliverables, engaging them on daily to bond as a team, boosting trust and to do not micromanaging.\nFor instance you can create team rituals such as morning 10 mins coffee and 1h team lunch on a selected day where you talk about anything and bonding as people. Then every Friday all members set weekly targets and submit them to you, once approved they start working on it on Monday. You either have daily progress huddles or twice a week.\n\nRemote teams thrive with rituals and as much comms as possible in my opinion (leading remote teams for the last 6 years)\n\nIf you wanna discuss deeper feel free to dm me happy to support",

Most of my work experience has been in stores and warehouses, so the problem I’m trying to solve comes directly from seeing how slow and repetitive certain manual tasks are in real life. \n\nI’m still very early in the process. My LLC is pending, I don’t have funding yet, or ask friends and family to help with Boot strapping either and I haven’t filed any patents. I’ve only made a very rough, non functional concept prototype just to visualize the idea, nothing that works or could be used. I’m intentionally not sharing design or implementation details here because I want to handle IP the right way. \n\nI plan to work with independent mechanical designers and material specialists, and hire contractors as needed for prototyping, testing, and manufacturing prep. What I’m struggling with isn’t the idea itself, but the order of operations and funding. \n\nI’ve read a lot online and honestly it’s overwhelming and often contradictory. I don’t have a founder network, and I don't have any technical skills or knowledge so I’m trying to learn without making expensive mistakes. I’m fine moving slow if it means doing it right.\n\nI’m mainly looking for guidance on what should come first for a non electrical hardware startup like this and funding. \nIt would help me a lot to get some answers from the following questions based on your own experience as a founder. \n\nWhen did you personally involve a patent attorney, and what did you wait on? \n\nHow did you validate demand before spending serious money on manufacturing? \n\nWhat funding paths actually worked for you for physical products, whether that was grants, accelerators, pilots, LOIs, SBIR, or something else? \n\nAnd what early mistakes cost you time or money that you wish you had avoided? Is it realistic to try and keep 100% of the company? \n\nDid you find giving up equity for expertise or capital was necessary? \n\nAnd since I am a hardware start up, most of the time will be spend on product development and quality testing and collecting feedback and give it back to the team of contractors so that they can make revisions and improvements to the product before we can move on to manufacturing. My long term goal is to offer this as Hardware as a Service. Does that change anything in the early validation or funding stage?\n\nI want to keep things lean, avoid unnecessary steps, and reduce risk as much as possible and learn from everyone. I’m not looking for feedback on the product itself, just advice on process, sequencing, and how to approach this the right way. \nIf you’ve taken a physical product from idea to testing to manufacturing, or even failed trying, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective. And I also want to keep the company private. Thanks in advance.",

          "text": "It’s a tough question. I’m building an electronic hardware product, but the overall process is essentially the same. You have to start by fully understanding your goal and identifying the closest realistic milestone you need to reach. To get to a fully implemented product, you’ll usually need some combination of collaborations, investment, and a functional prototype. The key is to focus on the minimum you need to do right now in order to move forward without overbuilding. That usually starts with writing a simple but clear business or requirements document that defines the problem, the target customer, the value you’re delivering, and what the first usable version of the product must achieve. From there, you need to be honest about what you can financially commit to on your own and build the smallest possible prototype that can clearly demonstrate proof of concept. It doesn’t need to be 100% functional or production-ready just enough to show that the idea works and creates real value. Once you have that, you can start reaching out to companies for collaboration, but only if you know exactly what you’re offering them, whether that’s a pilot, efficiency gains, or early access. This stage involves a lot of small, detailed work. If you can secure one or two LOIs or a pilot and explore relevant grants at the same time, you’ll be in a much stronger position when approaching investors. You don’t need thousands of customers or many partnerships early, credible signals are enough. At this stage, it’s also important to be careful with IP: avoid oversharing, use NDAs when appropriate, understand the laws in your country specific about this, and focus on protection after you’ve validated the core technology and market. Everything depends on context, but a minimal, milestone driven approach is usually the most efficient and lowest risk way forward.",

          "text": "Speaking from the outside looking in, the biggest risk early hardware founders face is over indexing on IP and building before they have real evidence of pull. In practice, most teams I have seen delay patent work until they have clearer signals from pilots or LOIs, because a provisional only really buys time, not certainty. demand validation usually looks less like surveys and more like someone committing budget, access, or time to test a crude version of the workflow you are targeting. Funding paths for physical products tend to follow that same logic, grants and accelerators care about technical feasibility, while angels and strategics care about whether a buyer is already leaning in. Keeping 100 percent ownership is theoretically possible, but it often trades speed and learning for control, which can be costly in hardware. Hardware as a service does not change the early steps much, but it raises the bar on reliability and unit economics earlier than many first time founders expect.",

This is incredibly helpful and cuts right to the heart of what I was asking.\n\nThe point about delaying patents until after pilots/LOIs and focusing on real buyer commitment as validation makes a lot of sense.

Documentation is going to be your best friend and you walk in the shadows with the documentation in case anything like 'stealing your idea' happens. \nHope this helps.",

      "text": "A year ago, after leaving a big company, I decided to start a startup. I had been working with a technical cofounder for 3 months, we had a clear idea of what we wanted to build.  \nAfter two months of working together, he left. First hard hit.\n\nI found another cofounder in two weeks (spoiler: we’ve been working together for a year now and it’s going really well).\n\nI put insane pressure on myself. I worked 12 hours a day, every weekend, no days off, no vacations. I’ve always had a strong work capacity, so it didn’t really alert me. I was just a bit physically tired, but I didn’t see any issue.\n\nWe launched a product. It didn’t work the way I expected. I made a lot of mistakes, put my energy in the wrong places, developed 80% useless features. I applied to YC without much conviction, got rejected. Basically: first-time founder life.\n\nThen, overnight, my body gave up. Impossible to get up in the morning to work. As soon as I tried to work, I felt anxiety (I had never experienced that before). Loss of meaning, loss of bearings, loss of confidence.\n\nI’m convinced this small burnout was linked to the “almost success” of the project:  \nwe had early traction signals, but no PMF.\n\nSo I stopped everything. I went to another country for 5 days and I wrote a lot: what I don’t like doing, what I like doing, what I want to achieve\n\nI realized I had a very unhealthy relationship with time. I was always thinking about the next move without having succeeded at the previous one. I had big ambitions, a tendency to get carried away for nothing. That’s what led me to mistakes, loss of focus, and eventually to this state.\n\nSo I gave myself a single goal this year: make enough revenue to live from the company and pay myself + my cofounder properly. I have until the end of the year. If I don’t make it, I’ll ask myself what’s next at that point.\n\nI’m not rushing blindly anymore. I have a clear new direction, but everything that doesn’t bring business is cut. I’m very pragmatic about what can generate revenue (we’re a card payment gateway, with payouts in USDC)\n\nWhat drove me crazy was comparing myself to other founders. My relationship with success and time, feeling like I wasn’t moving fast enough (I’m 28).\n\nAnd for the past two months, living my founder life more simply, things have been much better. I’ve regained the joy of building, iterating, discussing. One clear goal with a defined timeframe. Plan B can wait.\n\nIn a world as complex as today’s, I chose to try simplicity. It doesn’t take anything away from my ambition to build a huge company and work hard on it.",

It might literally be *1* small thing, that is you never knew about, never thought about, never knew existed: that can literally make things 90% easier.\n\n\nImagine the whistle on Mario 3 (go look it up if you're not old school).\n\n\nIt's always a whistle out there where you can skip a few levels. Finding it may come from the grind, and / or extensive research, and a combination of luck. (The only thing you can control is staying in the race. Those who keep going will always find the whistle in the end while the others quit the marathon. As others drop out, your knowledge continues to grow. Any new entrants in the race (they will come forever) will be further and further and further behind you, the more time goes on. So by year 3 (or 10, depends) you'll be 95/100 level while the new entrants are 20/100. The ones who were 90/100 just quit, so things get easier and clearer for you.\n\n\nThe 20/100 can't do any damage (competition) because you're so far ahead in knowledge and skill now.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\nThis all, I know for a fact.\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: it's dam near impossible for Anybody unless your parents can casually loan you $300k like bezos did (probably worth a few mil back then before inflation).\n\n\n\n\nP.s., what is your actual product type?",

In the last 5 months I’ve been working with another co-founder, and now it’s going very well.\n\nLast week my boss asked me: what do you want to do as your next career move?\n\nI told him the truth: entrepreneurship, and I asked him if he could help by letting me develop a product for his company.\n\nHe will think about it and I’m not sure how it’ll go yet. \n\nReading this post helped me, thanks!\n\nSo, I’ll share some of my learnings:\n1. If your client is B2B, test cold acquisition first: we had 1 beta tester who was so interested in our product that we worked 2 months developing it. Only when I cold-called 300+ companies I understood that what the product solved wasn’t urgent enough for the market to buy.\n2. With co-founders, I look for vibes more than anything else and how I feel in the journey. I share a founders’ agreement with them right at the start, and this helped a lot.\n3. Going through rejections and NOs is the hardest thing for me. What helps a lot is humor. Not taking myself too seriously helped me avoid burnout over these years where I worked weekends and nights.",

Early traction signals can actually be more mentally exhausting than outright failure because they keep you in limbo, always feeling like you're one pivot away from PMF.\n\nThe shift to simplicity and a single, measurable goal (revenue to sustain the team) is underrated wisdom. Most advice tells founders to \"think big\" but rarely mentions that sustainable progress often comes from radically narrowing focus.\n\nTwo things that stood out:\n\n1. You recognized that your relationship with time was the root issue, not the product itself. That's rare self-awareness that many founders never develop.\n\n2. Setting a hard deadline (end of year) forces clarity. Without that, it's easy to stay in indefinite \"almost there\" mode forever.\n\nAt 28, you're actually in a good spot. The founders who burn out young and learn from it tend to do much better on their second or third attempt than those who never hit that wall. Good luck with the payment gateway.",

First of all, take care of yourself. I greatly underestimated this aspect and paid the price. Starting a business is like running a marathon, as others have said. This means leading a healthy lifestyle in general so that you can get through the intense moments and the less intense ones, but keep running overall. A healthy lifestyle means getting enough sleep and eating healthy foods that contain all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Exercising. Most of the time, we are very mentally tired after a long day at work, but our bodies need to release their energy. In addition, exercise releases beneficial hormones that help the mind. Having a supportive environment (friends, family, partner, colleagues). Taking time to get out of the tunnel effect. \n\nUltimately, we are on this journey to enjoy the journey and not just the final destination.\n\nTake care and good luck :)",

I created a plan, kept on researching, and ended up getting master and PhD level research questions out of it. I have developed the spine for the architecture, done some testing to validate my logic and it works. This will be my first mvp. I still don’t know a lot of mvp stuff but I still keep going. Always pausing to validate and breathe coz working alone on a whole project can be brutal. I’m glad it made me spend my time well now. No more video games until this works. I will need to battle test and pressure test the solution soon and expose it to industry players. I hope you all make it in your endeavours. Peace!",

My brother and I are working on developing an online card game and we have been discussing making an LLC for opening business accounts and so we have that structure in place early (as well as other benefits a business entity would provide). However, we are concerned that we may not have anything out until next year (2027) and therefore will not have any profit in 2026 for this entity, only expenses.\n\nWill this hurt us for taxes next year when we file? Or will we not be penalized since we had no profit for the business? We are just wanting to play it safe and not end up in a large financial hole due to an unexpected tax hit.\n\n(We are aware of the annual fees for LLC's and the initial filing fee. Luckily we are based in Missouri, where the filing is $50 and there does not seem to be an annual renewal fee).\n\nAny advice or help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

You can run either LLC or C-Corp without having any profit for a while - you just don't pay taxes. \n\nAs someone mentioned, you can also start as an LLC and convert to C-Corp later when you pick up investors. In fact, this is exactly what I have done with one of my startups (Fusebit). It was a bit of a paperwork (around $10k), but at that point you already have inverstor's money. However, there are disadvantages to the LLC->C-Corp conversion. Generally, when you start a C-Corp, as a founder, you give yourself founder stock. If you hold onto it for 5 years, it gets preferential tax treatment (effectively, you don't pay the long-term capital gain taxes on it - read up about QSBS). The clock for the 5 year holding period starts ticking when you start the C-Corp, so it is beneficial to do it early if you know you will be picking up investors later.",

This also gives you a legal structure in place for opening a business bank account, handling contracts, and protecting personal liability once your game launches.\n\nTo make the process easier and less stressful, you could use BusinessAnywhere. They handle LLC filing, set up the registered agent, help get your EIN, and provide a dashboard to track your documents. The next steps are simple:\n\n1. Fill in your LLC and owner information on their site.\n2. Choose any optional add-ons (mail forwarding, compliance reminders, etc.).\n3. They submit your Articles of Organization and registered agent setup.\n4. Once approved (usually about a week), you get access to your dashboard to track filings and deadlines.\n\nUsing a service like this keeps everything organized, even if your business won’t have revenue for a while, and makes managing expenses and filings much easier.",

Should we just work on it and see where it goes as they said?

Keep the core decisions and momentum with you.\n\nThe danger isn't that they bail - it's that you slow down waiting for people who have other things going on. Build like they're not coming back tomorrow, and if they stick around, bonus. Way better than building in dependency on people who've already hedged their commitment.",

Which is fine. \n\nWhat I'd do: don't push for a comp conversation now, but set a checkpoint. Something like \"cool, let's revisit this after we hit X milestone\" (first 10 users, working prototype, whatever makes sense). That gives everyone an out without awkwardness, and by then you'll have data - did they actually show up? Did they deliver? That makes the comp conversation 10x easier because it's based on reality not hypotheticals.\n\nIf you do need something formal now, cliff vesting is your friend.

If you really agree on the excitement level, share the same values and can influence each other (meaning that you are committing to each other rather than the business idea) thats great because even if the initial idea wouldnt work in the market, you can keep motivating each other and pivot - thats the ideal scenario, however, its not always easy to find a person to share this\n\n2. You can start working with multiple people on a very small projects, such as preparing the tech roadmap, KPIs that they plan to deliver, tech stack they want to use etc. You can do like 2-4 weeks projects with each simultaneously. This is not to take advantage or go behind people. Its more to see how's the style of each. You can be transparent about it to them by saying lets get to know our working style for the next 2 weeks to see if we align. Maybe some of them will drop on the way, become less responsive. Or the ones you are less optimistic will align better with your vision and working style. Based on that you may have a healthier judgement.\n\nOverall the most risky approach would be to ignore red flags and just to focus on having an MVP with whomever agrees.",

In practice, uncertainty is normal at this stage, but ambiguity about expectations tends to hurt later. The bigger risk is not people dropping off, but misaligned assumptions about effort, ownership, and decision-making. Getting those explicit early usually matters more than enthusiasm.",

We’ve grown to 50+ paying clients so far. I’m proud of what we’ve built, and I know that objectively this is early traction, especially at my age.\n\nThat said, I constantly feel like I’m behind.\nI’ve always had the mindset of building something on my own. My parents are financially comfortable, but I’ve never relied on that and don’t consider it part of my safety net. Because of that, I put almost all my time and energy into the business.\n\nThe issue isn’t lack of direction. I knew I’d be building something like this. It’s more about pace. Growth feels slower than what I expected, and the gap between expectations and reality is mentally exhausting. Some days it feels like I’m sacrificing everything else just to move forward inch by inch.\n\nMy routine is basically work, sleep, and a mental shutdown at night. No social life, no relationships, very limited downtime. I’m okay with solitude, but I sometimes wonder if this is just how the early-stage journey feels or if I’m doing something wrong.\n\nI’m not complaining, just looking for perspective from people who’ve been here before or are currently building.\n\nFor founders who started early:\nDid you feel this constant pressure to move faster?\n\nAt what point did things start to feel less heavy?\n\nHow do you balance ambition with not burning out this early?\n\nWould really appreciate honest thoughts.\n\nTL;DR:\n19 y/o college student running a bootstrapped tech startup with 50+ clients. Early traction but still feeling behind and mentally exhausted. Looking for perspective from other founders.",

You're 19 - with respect - you're still a child and a part of this seems like you're struggling to make a living at an early age (and succeeding at it very well).\n\nIf you hang in there, you could be set for life. Just don't let it cost you more than you can pay. You don't want to trade some of the best years of your life for this situation - you'll never get back time and especially not your 20s, 30s, 40s when you're at your physical best.\n\nSome of what you're writing sounds a bit like depression or exhaustion related depression. There's nothing wrong with slow, steady surety. You don't need to create the next business monster that takes over as a wannabe world leader in your industry or whatever cheap shi* people like to peddle. Protect your business and protect yourself. Grow at the pace you feel ready to take on so that things don't spiral out of control.\n\nJust to summarize - enjoy your life a bit more. Maybe instead of trying to grow your business try to make it more efficient first so that you have a life outside of work hours. And don't feel bad if thigns don't grow super fast. People are obsessed with things going fast for some reason. I find it unhealthy. Nothing that lasts goes fast, the long run isn't about speed, it's about strength.",

I used to work 12+ hours/day and after a few months I felt the mental cost hard.\n\nNow I work in blocks and force breaks (5 minutes every 60-120 minutes). Stand up, walk, get water just anything with zero mental input. It sounds small, but it helps you reset and come back sharper.\n\nAlso: I used to constantly compare myself to bigger companies that already look “finished.” That comparison is poison. You started your company for a reason, and if you already have paying customers, you’re not behind you’ve proven real demand.\n\nFocus on your own pace, protect your energy early, and you’ll actually move faster long term.",

I could be working 24/7 and it’s not healthy \n\nBeyond disconnecting, what works for me is to start building systems. What systems can you build for long term growth?  execute, move on, and trust the process…",

Even when things are moving forward, it’s easy to only focus on the gap between where you are and the absolute top performers.\n\nAnd yeah, the “get a life” part is harsh but fair .  I’ve kind of let work take over everything else. I’ve tried dating too, but it never really worked out for me, so I ended up just putting all my energy into building.\n\nThe systems advice really stood out to me though. I’ve been mostly in execution mode, but building processes for long-term growth sounds like the right way to reduce mental load and make things more sustainable.\n\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what kind of systems helped you most early on? Client acquisition, delivery, team/process, anything like that?",

In my specific case for customer acquisition purposes it was several for example:\n\n1) a system to catch the email of the lead that provides immediate value, then sends them email to push for signup or purchase\n\n2) system of posts that you know works the simply adapt and repost (reduces mental load by a lot) \n\n3) system of email automations to encourage sign up’s to go to paid tier\n\n4) this one was gold for my specific product, I created a directory of resources specific to my niche. each page ranks in google and this then grows organically and ads value. I can simply share this resource directory and get sign ups or leads (example of system 2)\n\n5) set up an affiliate system and position it correctly? This is quite tough , and has not yet paid off but long term could be huge… \n\n6) create product features that are easy to share, so that when a user sees them, they want to post it and bring more users.\n\nEverything you do should have a long term impact",
