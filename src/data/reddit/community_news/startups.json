      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about why some people build multiple successful startups while most others never get one off the ground, and the more I strip away the mythology, the more it looks like a simple equation rather than some mysterious talent.\n\nIf you look closely, the market already gives you most of the variables. Products already exist. Customers already pay for solutions. Pricing models are already validated. Revenue structures are proven. In other words, demand has already been solved. Yet people still act like they need to invent everything from scratch, when in reality that’s usually where momentum dies.\n\nOnce I understood this, my whole approach changed. I stopped treating startups as artistic projects and started treating them like repeatable experiments. If competitors are making money, the correct move isn’t to innovate wildly, it’s to align. Same pricing logic. Same revenue model. Same customer profile. If the market is already paying X for a solution and won’t pay X for yours, the issue isn’t price discovery. It’s sales, positioning, or distribution.\n\nThat’s where most founders lie to themselves. They say the product isn’t ready, or the timing isn’t right, or they need one more feature. But if you already know the market exists, then the only real question is whether you can communicate value well enough to convert attention into money. If you can’t sell after enough real attempts, the math is telling you something, and it’s not subtle.\n\nSo I started optimizing for throughput instead of perfection. Build the smallest thing that can be sold. Ship it fast. Try to sell it aggressively. If it doesn’t move after a meaningful number of attempts, kill it without drama and move on. No emotional attachment. Just data. Repetition compounds. Each cycle sharpens your understanding of what actually works.\n\nSales became the core function, not an afterthought. Not polishing features, not tweaking designs, but improving language. Pitch clarity. Objection handling. Distribution. After enough reps, outcomes become predictable. Either the market pulls, or it doesn’t. Both are valuable answers.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that once even a small amount of traction exists, everything downstream simplifies. Pricing debates disappear. Confidence increases. Even investors behave differently, because you’re no longer presenting a hypothesis, you’re showing evidence. At that point, fundraising isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about scaling something that’s already mathematically working.\n\nThe final variable I underestimated was accountability. I noticed I always performed better when other people were watching, when reputation was on the line. So instead of relying on motivation, I engineered pressure. Public goals. Daily execution. External expectations. Systems that make it uncomfortable to stall.\n\nThe conclusion I keep coming back to is this: success in startups isn’t about being smarter or more original. It’s about running the equation enough times without lying to yourself. Fast execution. Real sales attempts. Honest feedback. Kill what doesn’t work. Double down on what does. Statistically, if you do this long enough, something breaks through.\n\nMost people fail not because they lack ideas, but because they don’t run the equation enough times to let probability do its job.\n\nCurious how many people here see startups the same way—or are still stuck optimizing variables the market already solved.",

          "text": "This resonates a lot, especially the shift from treating startups as creative expression to treating them as repeatable experiments.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed, though, is that many founders think they’re copying what works, but they only copy the surface variables. Pricing, features, even positioning can be replicated, but the harder part to copy is the pressure that forced the original business to converge. Real selling, real rejection, and the discomfort of finding out fast that the market doesn’t care.\n\nI’ve seen people “run the equation” many times, but quietly protect themselves from disconfirming feedback. They sell, but only in friendly environments. They ship, but only to audiences that won’t say no clearly. From the outside it looks like iteration, but underneath it’s still avoidance.\n\nYour point about accountability is underrated. Once reputation, time, or money is visibly on the line, the signal becomes much cleaner and decisions get easier. At that point, the market stops being abstract and starts answering very directly.\n\nCurious if there was a specific moment where the feedback became impossible to ignore and forced you to either double down or kill something without debate.",

Frankly a disturbing many think standard business practice is evil. Then they start one. \n\nWay too many are trying to get out of doing business. They seek growth hacks for a business which has no reason to exist. They want a cheatcode to get out of plain vanilla business advice. They crave a workaround for, well ...work. \n\nYes there is discussion about sales here, but not technique. Nobody knows what an objection is, let alone a hidden objection. They want to scale but they don't want to read a book on sales. \n\nWhat they want to do is crap something out market-blind. \n\nWhich is why I have begun to write these forums do not discuss business. They post the problems of refusing to do business then coping with inevitable bad outcomes. \n\nBecause they opted for the easier, gentle form of capitalism. The business that isn't work, it's all fun and games. You don't manage employees, you friend them. Have a problem, just hug it out. You do not 'make' a sale ...sales just sort of, you know, *happen.*\n\nMarketing is just feeling clever about what you've done. Sales is simply an outgoing personality and the gift of gab. Read books? *Why whatever for?* They want out of business and they get their wish.",

          "text": "There is a lot of truth here, especially the part about founders hiding in “product isn’t ready” when the real bottleneck is distribution and language.\n\nThe nuance I would add is that “competitors prove demand” does not automatically mean “copy the model and win.” A market can exist and still be brutal for a newcomer if the channel is saturated, switching costs are high, the incumbent has trust, or the customer’s real constraint is implementation, not the tool. In those cases, you do not need wild innovation, but you do need a wedge that makes adoption easier, cheaper, faster, or safer.\n\nI also think “sell aggressively and kill fast” only works if you are clear what you are testing. A lot of founders think they tested the product when they really tested the wrong audience, the wrong promise, or a channel that was never going to work for them. The honest loop is: pick one ICP, one use case, one offer, one channel, run enough reps to get signal, then decide. Otherwise “kill it” can become another way to avoid learning.\n\nThe core equation I agree with is simpler: stop guessing, run tight experiments, and force decisions based on evidence. The best founders are not romantic. They are disciplined about what they are trying to learn next and they keep the loop short enough that self deception cannot survive.",

Where I tend to be more cautious is that copying surface structure does not guarantee you are copying the hard parts, distribution, timing, and team execution often matter more than the idea itself. I have seen teams run this equation very “honestly” and still fail because they underestimated how context-specific prior success was. that said, I agree that treating startups as experiments rather than personal identity projects is a healthier default. The key question for me is not whether you copy, but whether you can diagnose why something works and which assumptions are still fragile. Without that, repetition can turn into cargo culting instead of learning.",

I don’t fully blame them, when there’s no visible progress, it’s hard for anyone to.\n\nNow I’m financially broke, mentally exhausted, and honestly demotivated. The stress has started affecting my marriage too, which hurts the most.\n\nI keep asking myself:\n- What am I doing wrong?\n- Am I approaching things the wrong way?\n- Is this just how it works before things click, or am I ignoring some obvious mistake?\n- How do you know when to persist vs when to pivot?\n\nI’m not posting this to promote anything or ask for sympathy.\n\nI genuinely want real feedback from people who’ve been through layoffs, failed startups, long job searches, or rebuilding phases.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place:\n- What helped you get unstuck?\n- What would you do differently if you were in my position?\n- Any hard truths I might need to hear?\n\nThanks for reading.

          "text": "The problem is most of entrepreneurship is displayed as \"you get laid off, you build one idea, then you become rich\". The reality is that most times it takes numerous failures for you to become successful. You are welcome to read other subreddits talking about the pain of entrepreneurship: most have failed for almost a decade (broke, bankrupt, 2nd mortgage, etc.) before they started breaking 10M in revenue. So if this is the path you want to take then maybe you should start thinking in the order of decades.\n\nIn terms of what you should do, that is entirely up to you. You can start applying again (aim for 1000+ jobs, my 2nd software gig took 1300!). I would suggest trying to target large industries (1B+) and failing within those because a success will mean a decent sized payout. Target military, health care, etc. As builders, we are more concerned with the product, but company success is not technological: it is strategic, and that takes analyzing the problem for long periods of time.\n\nMy personal strategy is making all the cool shit I want to, state of the art, in public. This a) does not tarnish my skills b) makes getting a job later easier (because I know the SOTA) c) impresses those within industries (non-tech people), because they can see what I CAN make. The only difference between riches and making no money as an engineer is simply making the right thing. By signalling you can make anything, someone in industry will ask you to make something, and that rabbit hole will eventually lead you somewhere.\n\nMy 2 cents",

They sound like the usual boomer telling you “back in my day you just knocked on a few doors and an investor would give you a million. You’re just lazy with victim mentality”\n\nNo, these things are real. People who are actually trying, know the landscape has dramatically changed in just the last 2 years",

          "text": "This some of it seems more like life choices, with all respect, in terms of relevance to this sub. You have to secure your own well being and security first before you undertake any project and entrepreneurship. \n\nOnce you have bread on the table you can experiment more. \n\nHowever out of strong need can come abilities too... is this the case? I don't know. \n\nGet your life in order with stability, then try to work something out. You can try working in partnership with someone too, that can often bring much better results.\n\nTo answer, yes things can take some time and quick success is very rare. Usually though. Getting no traction or users sounds like either lack of proper marketing or your product isn't that good/useful/needed.\n\nTo properly diagnose the issue you need to do lots of A/B testing. If you don't know what you're doing, find someone that knows more. \n\nFor example. I had something many people wanted but our informational resources werent great at first and our product also a bit unreliable (so some failures). People were never getting to point C and kept getting stuck at point A. Or would get to point C but never come back because things failed or something somewhere made them stop. It's been a long process perfecting that pathway but theres lots of factors. The key though is knowing what you're selling is *needed* and working around that. \n\nSo,  as you go, you figure out what's going on by testing. Can be as simple as: \n\n\"People want to see services, faq and pricing together rather than spread across pages\" or \"don't require login to use\" or \"too many things overwhelm the user and makes them take no action and leave\" or \"the offer is confusing/unclear/not good\" or \"too much noise against the CTA\". Lots of things.\n\nDo you know how much reach you have at the moment approximately? If you estimate at least 1,000-10,000 impressions per piece of content and you're getting 0 results  then it must be your offer most likely so yes, time to iterate something. Choose whatever is working best and iterate from that. If it's nothing, then pick your best bet. Iterating what works is what gets you places. You see blue ribbons sell more? Make them more, and 2 variations perhaps. You see someone liked when you said \"my blue ribbons make your room sparkle\"? Keep that same exact phrase and use it later. Keep it very simple. \n\nIf youre hardly getting visitors then find out how to get them. Some of these require you get a bit out of comfort zone if not used to talking to lots of people. If you're getting visitors and visitors and never a single interest for your base product then time to pivot. Rare though useful. \n\nWhen to pivot? Example. You sell shoe laces, meant for use in tying shoes. You fail a thousand ways until you realize people are using them more for boots. Now you pivot to boot laces instead of shoe laces. \n\nWhen to iterate? You sell shoe laces. You see people keep buying the orange laces. You iterate a new version of Orange laces, except this time three length variations and one with another texture. You see what sells. You iterate. \n\nIf you're getting any kind of minimal results, you can do this. As minimal as they are.Then, improve your marketing (get the message to more people), and improve your branding and intake sites for trust, readibility, accessibility and aesthetic for branding. \n\nFirst though, get some bread on the table friend. And second, get a good partner if you can that will help you get things running where you can't. Take things with calm, do as you can but move swiftly and diligently on what you do. Think of everything as logically as you can.",

Any one of those can feel like shouting into the void for months, and doing all three at once tends to create the worst kind of fatigue because you never get enough signal back from any one lane to feel momentum.\n\nI do not think the problem is effort. The problem is focus, sequencing, and the fact that your nervous system is now the limiting factor.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would do two things in parallel, and I would be ruthless about the scope.\n\nFirst, stabilize money. Not because you are giving up on the startup, but because you cannot make good product decisions when you are panicking about rent and your marriage is taking collateral damage. That can mean a smaller target job, contract work, freelance, whatever gets you predictable cash fastest. The goal is a runway, not a perfect role.\n\nSecond, shrink the startup into a two week reality loop instead of a vague “build and post.” Pick one specific customer type, one painful problem, one simple offer, and do ten conversations. Not “would you use this,” but “how are you solving this today, what does it cost you, what have you tried, would you pay for a better outcome.” If you cannot get conversations, that is the signal, and it tells you your distribution plan is missing, not that you are broken.\n\nContent creation should be optional, not a third full time job. If it is not producing leads or recruiters, park it. You can always restart later when you have something concrete to talk about.\n\nOn persist vs pivot, I use a simple test: persist when the problem is real and you are learning from clear experiments, pivot when you are repeating the same actions and getting the same silence. Right now it sounds like a lot of activity without a tight feedback loop, which is why it feels hopeless.\n\nThe hard truth is that “almost zero response” is not a verdict on you. It is a verdict on the current approach. You need fewer bets, tighter experiments, and enough stability to think clearly.",

It felt productive, but in reality nothing had enough focus to actually move.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was separating survival from ambition. If money is tight, I’d prioritize stabilizing income first, even temporarily.

          "text": "You’re receiving a lot of valuable advice here. Hopefully, you’ll be able to identify the recurring patterns in the advice. Focus, narrow down, and even shrink your target market, customer, and product/solution if doing so would likely require the same level of effort to maintain focus across the other elements.\n\nIf you’re committed to pursuing everything long-term, I suggest spending some time considering how you can better integrate and stack your strategies to work together and benefit each other. Even if that means reducing focus to just pushing one or two of these forward at a time and achieving sufficient success or traction, before then either stacking on the next piece or sticking with just one or two, and swapping one out for the other on a regular basis. \n\nI’ve been in a similar situation a few times over the past two to three years. When I was experiencing the same thing, it sounds like you are right now. I narrowed my efforts and focused on only activities that could result in a sale, conversation, or feedback, whatever I needed as a result. I looked at what activity or effort was closest to that result and capable of realistically producing it. I then deprioritized or sacrificed nearly all other efforts until I could return to them later.\n\nOne good example of how this helped a lot was that I needed to acquire my target customer. All the efforts and obstacles I was facing in doing so by selling the SaaS product I was building were taking me on a lot of activity and effort that couldn’t directly result in talking to a prospect and acquiring them as a customer. So, I decided to spin up a marketing agency that offered just a few specific and related services that I had experience fulfilling as a freelancer. I knew that my target customer for the SaaS product was already often actively shopping for and spending money on these services.\n\nI quickly built out the agency website, branding, and messaging, but I only used what I had already worked on for the SaaS product and just shifted it slightly to fit for a marketing service offer instead of the SaaS product. I was able to get some quick traction, generate some much-needed income, and actually acquire my target customer for the SaaS product by offering them a specialized and focused service that was low-cost, had a short sales cycle, and aligned with their existing spending.\n\nThis way, I was still working closely with my target customer, learning a lot that I could transfer over to the SaaS product. I prioritized what I had to do and put the SaaS product just a little on the back burner for a couple of months. After two to three months and a handful of sales, things were much more stable. I then picked back up the SaaS product after stopping all acquisition efforts using the agency/service offer. Well, by this time, I had already learned quite a bit of valuable feedback that I could use to improve the SaaS product I had created. I made a few adjustments before successfully onboarding half of the four total service clients I had worked with onto the SaaS product. The service and SaaS product weren’t directly related but were relevant to the same decision-maker and were designed to be used within the marketing department.\n\nSince then, I’ve been essentially alternating between the services approach and the SaaS approach as needed and as I can to maintain overall stability while simultaneously advancing both efforts.\n\nI’ve noticed that many others, either intentionally or unintentionally, practice a similar approach of offering multiple products or approaches or even business models in an integrated or complementary manner. These usually consist of something that they could succeed with more easily for one reason or another, which they then paired with something that required overcoming significantly larger obstacles or was simply unproven and required a longer runway and testing to figure out. In my opinion, both approaches succeeded in enabling them to pursue something they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to or at least not at the same level of effort and time. In many cases, they eventually transitioned all their efforts to the initially more challenging goal, which, in the long run, had a much higher overall ROI.\n\nI don’t have enough experience with this combined strategy to say how often or how difficult it is to implement, but I can say that it’s working for me. I’ve seen enough evidence of others executing similar strategies that I’m confident it’s not unique to me that it’s been successful.\n\nI hope this triggers an idea or inspires a strategy that can work for your situation. If you’d like to delve into any of the deeper details or need some help finding an angle like this for your situation, feel free to send me a direct message. Good luck!",

If they got lucky at the beginning and didn't suffer through this, they will at some point. As I like to say, entrepreneurship is the fastest way to spirituality. It pushes you so much to grow and into facing your fears that it's the equivalent of those nightmare stories we used to read about \"Saints\" in the past ahahah\n\nBeing a founder is one of those things that looks glamorous from the outside but destroys you from the inside if you're building for the wrong reasons. I paid for this mistake myself too...  \nMost people don't talk about this but the moment you start measuring your worth by traction, by feedback, by investors' replies, you've already lost the game. External validation is a trap that will eat you alive because there's never enough of it, and the silence you're experiencing right now is the universe showing you exactly how that game ends.\n\nThe truth is before any business can work, \"you\" have to work. Not the hustle kind but the inner work that nobody wants to do. Understanding why you're really doing this, what wounds you're trying to heal by building, what validation you're really seeking... that's where the real answers live. The marriage strain, the exhaustion, the demotivation, those are signals not to push harder but to go deeper. And the ridiculous truth is that when you go online and read/watch/hear about the other founders they all seem to play the hustle and KPI game. That's a BS show unfortunately. The illusion of the \"hamster wheel\". Everything fu\\*\\*ing running...  \nThe real hyperscalers, the ones that build for the long term and that are truly resilient, they are all doing the inner work, but they rarely share it. Because until recently, meditating, releasing childhood trauma and so on was the work of \"pussies\"...\n\nTake care of yourself first. The rest follows from there.",

Feeling like an employee usually shows up when decision rights, accountability, and ownership were never made explicit, or stopped being respected as the company got stressed.

The question I would ask is whether there is any realistic path to resetting how decisions and blame are handled, or whether the pattern is now locked in. If it is the latter, staying longer rarely fixes it and often just normalizes behavior you do not want to carry forward. A clean exit usually comes from being boring and factual, framing it as misalignment on execution and leadership style, documenting handoffs, and avoiding moral arguments.

Understand your equity situation, your vesting cliff, and what happens to your shares if you leave. This conversation costs a few hundred dollars and can save you hundreds of thousands.\n\n3.

Even the most diligent teams can feel toxic if leadership doesn’t model accountability and empathy. When I’ve seen founders navigate this, a few things helped: **Document everything clearly**: timelines, agreements, contributions. If you decide to exit, it protects your reputation and shows professionalism. **Separate what you control from what you can’t**: you can grind and contribute, but you can’t fix misaligned co-founders’ mindset.\n\n",

You can have the best intentions in the world, be willing to pivot to anything, and still miss it.  You may simply not be good at discerning what PMF is.  Your customers may not know what they actually want.  You may hit the product right but the customers are on another time frame.  You may be so busy trying to find PMF that you constantly jump to a new solution, never going deep enough on one to see if it works.  And, of course, you may run out of money.  I've seen all of those first hand.\n\nI've never seen pure ego cause a failure.  I've heard of it.  I believe in it.  But it's minor.\n\nEgo is part of the puzzle, but it's only a part and a relatively small one.  Most people get over ego fast when they realize that their ego is going to be bruised in a bigger way when they fail.  Or their co-founders boot them.  Or investors turf them out. \n\n",

      "text": "A lot of people keep asking how to chose or find a co-founder. I have had my fair share of this issue with 3 startups and how to find a co-founder. Twice I needed to find a business acumen co-founder as I am a techie myself and a third time I needed a very highly capable tech co-founder as the idea and the product had grown beyond my tech capabilities. Let me tell you what all went wrong.\n\n\n\n1. First startup: I knew I needed someone who could raise funds for the company which requires very special skills and hence looked in my network, found someone whom I did not know personally but was a heck of a person in story telling (which is the most important aspect when it comes to fund raising). We worked together for almost 18 months and I realised that my co-founder was acting more like a PE fund manager who needed a cut in the funds he/she raised. I got a realisation that I had made the wrong choice as the person was not a company-first thought person but ‘what is in it for me’ person. I have nothing against people who think of their gains before company gains, but as a cofounder it has to be a commitment to the company first approach. The company I sold hastily as I knew we were not going anywhere so thank god it was not completely futile.\n2. Second Startup: I joined hands with a person whom I knew for more than a decade so this time I knew that I am working with someone whom I trust. However, slowly I realised that we were not aligned on ethics. While, for me everything is wither white or black, for him everything was grey and he operated like that only. He would make commitments which we could not fulfil, he would tell numbers that were not true or realistic. However, he was faring well and the company started to do phenomenal. I would go to office every day, make lies to truth, work on hiding actual numbers, create hypothetical scenarios and mark them as reality… This continued to 8-10 months when one fine day I just gave up and relinquished my 47% equity and moved on as I could not handle lying each day. The company has done well and is a household name now.\n3. Third Startup: I needed a tech co-founder who knew more than I did and I moved to a business role (learnings from the two startups helped). From day 0 we connected (while we had not spent more than 2 hours together before I offered him the co-founder role) and worked in unison. While everyone said that co-founders need to have difference of opinion, we seldom did. We reached a state where we would complete each other’s sentences. The company has been doing well (not a unicorn but we are well known now) and we still operate in the same manner.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I realised in the last 13 years, when you are looking for a co-founder… Remember there has to be a compatibility on VALUES. If your values are not aligned, never work together. While we are very very careful in choosing a life partner, we need to be equally careful (if not more) in choosing our co-founder. This is the reason why I have taken the approach that even when hiring, I look for values alignment rather than quantification or capability. I am happy to hire or work with a person who is 8/10 on capability and 10/10 on values alignment vs 8/10 on values alignment and 10/10 on capabilities.",

When he called the waiter politely and said that our orders were wrong, the waiter apologised and took away the dishes from our table. I asked him, you did not get angry at the waiter? He said… No point getting angry at someone for a mistake… I am sure he did not do it purposely. This clearly showed how he would handle the team (I already had a team of 12 developers) and understand every person’s perspective.\n3. Cue 03: We were talking at length and discussed about family, kids, parents and a lot more… I could see that he thought in the same way about relationships the way I did\n\n\n\nIn all, we did not discuss the startup for more than 5 mins, but we knew we would click together if we worked together.

My approach/hope is that I can continue to build multiple products, see what gets traction, and keep the winners alive.\n\nI genuinely love the building part (as I'm sure many do) - ideating, coding, being scrappy, etc. Could do it all day and want to do it all day. I'm hoping to turn being a solopreneur (or with a good cofounder) into meaningful income to live off. To do this, I need to find strategies, frameworks, etc. that can help with distribution\n\nBut distribution is extremely elusive to me.\n\nThe strategies I see that are obvious:\n\n* Build an audience first on Twitter/LinkedIn/YouTube/IG/TT/etc. (can take months/years)\n* Master paid ads (tough to master before burning serious $ on Meta/Google)\n* Cold outreach (slow, manual)\n* SEO (also takes time)\n\nHow do you handle distribution without becoming a full-time content creator or raising money?\n\n**TL;DR:** Has anyone built sustainable profitable products without a large following or big ad budget? Is there a path that doesn't require 10K followers, burning VC dollars, or becoming an influencer?\n\n**EDIT:** This largely applies to B2C products\n\nCurious what's worked for people who are better at building than marketing - please share your thoughts!",

In my first startup over 15 years ago now, we tried so many different things; online ads, magazine ads, trade fairs, meet ups, sponsorships - you name it, we tried it. Some of these found customers, others only raised awareness. Success doesn’t come easy for most people, it takes take. All of these things work to some extent, but there’s no silver bullet and none work as well as you hope.\n\nThe best advice is to spend time talking to real people in person, learning more about the challenges you want to solve. Start with friends and family. Don’t expect to make lots of money quickly, but aim to create growing momentum. Your customers are your biggest advocates - we sold more via word of mouth than any other channel. \n\nBest of luck!",

You can learn that shit in a single afternoon.\n\nThe difficult part is knowing who you're selling to, knowing their very specific pain points, and convincing them that your product is the best solution to those problems. If you know how to do that, you just have to hire creators to execute on your vision and the rest is honestly pretty simple.\n\nThe catch is, this isn't something that just *anyone* can do. The best creative strategist is gonna fail horribly if your product is shit, which applies to probably 95% of the shit that gets spammed in r/SaaS and the like.\n\nYour first initial creatives is probably gonna suck, but if you have a genuinely good product you will get *some* sales. You might not get a positive ROI on your ad spend right away but it won't ALL be a loss, so consider that your tuition fee / learning tax.

          "text": "honestly the content creator advice is such a trap for builders. if you're doing b2c, look into side project marketing. instead of trying to build a personal brand, build tiny free tools that solve a specific problem and lead people to your main app. like calculators, niche directories, or mini-versions of your tech.\n\nanother thing that actually works is finding where your users are already complaining and just helping them. search reddit for keywords like \"how do i \\[problem your app solves\\]\" or \"is there an app for\" and just answer people. it's manual but it converts way better than shouting into the void on twitter.\n\ntbf if you have 4 apps running you're probably spreading yourself too thin to do the distribution work anyway. distribution is like 70% of the game and it sucks, but you can't really code your way out of it. maybe pick the one with the best organic signals and go deep on that instead of juggling four projects.",

Things like targeting a particular workflow pain where users naturally talk to each other, or building something that replaces an existing manual process and spreads inside a team. A lot of solo builders underestimate how much “distribution” can come from narrow positioning and clear use cases, even with small absolute numbers. the hard part is that this usually forces tougher product constraints and slower iteration early on. It also means killing ideas that are fun to build but have no natural path to being discovered. Curious if any of your projects have users who already congregate somewhere offline or in small communities, which often changes the equation.",

These days I can do a similar thing, run 30$ a day to validate an idea and it works. - only thing that has changed dramatically is the creative , having good ad content makes this possible (learn how to do basic design + video editing helps tremendously)\n\nSecond thing I can say is start planting the seed, I think Alex Hormozi has some incredible material, the full 100m$ leads video course on youtube is gold!\n\nI would study the hell out of lead generation and lead magnets, defining your funnel and what channels are you using to push people further down the funnel, you are B2C - i would even explore B2B2C options and launch cold email campaigns to other business that already have your buyers, giving a % of sales that come from them (example a mortgage brokerage partners with real estate agencies to facilitate their buyers mortgages, gives the agency a 10-20% kick back)\n\nIt’s really exciting, understanding the psychology of it all is when the matrix unlocks - once you see it you can never un-see it. 🙂",

          "text": "We had the same problem at a fintech I advised last year. Spent like 6 months trying different approaches because this \"second card syndrome\" was killing our economics.\nFirst we tried the obvious stuff: push notifications reminding people to update merchants, in app prompts after card activation, even gamification with reward points for each merchant they switched. Conversion was maybe 12%. Too much friction.\nWhat actually worked was integrating a card switching API. We tested a couple. There's some legacy players in the card on file space, but they're clunky and expensive. Ended up going with Knot because their API was clean, merchant coverage was solid (hit like 80% of our users' top merchants), and the security model made sense. Everything's encrypted, PCI compliant, we never touch raw card data.\nRolled it out as an optional onboarding step. \"Update your card everywhere in 30 seconds\" kind of pitch. Adoption was around 65% and we saw spend per card jump almost 3x within the first quarter for users who completed the switch. Turns out when your card is actually saved everywhere, people use it.\nThe integration took maybe 3 or 4 weeks with their SDK. Biggest pain point was honestly just the webhook handling and convincing my team this would work well. But compared to the alternatives it was a no brainer.\nHappy to share more details if you want to DM. This problem is solvable, just need the right tooling.",

          "text": "You might be over-indexing on “better product” when what you’re really up against is inertia plus category-level trust. Chase/Amex aren’t winning because their apps are prettier, they’re winning because they’re the card people already have on file everywhere, they have perceived reliability for big/important purchases, and they’ve trained users that “something will go wrong eventually, and I want the issuer with the most leverage when it does.” Competitive rewards and fast support are table stakes, but they don’t create a forcing function to change defaults.\n\n\n\nIf you want wallet share, you need a reason to rewire habits, not just a nicer place to spend. A few pragmatic levers: (1) Pick one or two specific “daily driver” categories and be meaningfully better there (not 1 percent, more like “I’m leaving money on the table if I don’t use this”), then message that relentlessly. (2) Make switching feel like a one-time project with a clear payoff: an in-app “move my bills” checklist, pre-filled instructions, reminders, and a time-boxed accelerator (for example, “set us as default for 5 merchants and spend $X in 30 days to unlock Y”). (3) Reduce the fear of missing a payment: alerts for declined recurring charges, a grace period where you reimburse late fees caused by switching, and proactive “your Netflix charge is coming up, want to update?” nudges. People don’t avoid updating cards because it’s hard, they avoid it because it’s annoying and high-stakes.\n\n\n\nAlso worth asking whether “becoming the daily driver everywhere” is the right hill to die on. Some successful fintechs win by owning a narrow, frequent use case (one category, one behavior) and expanding from there, instead of trying to displace the incumbent’s entire spend graph at once. If you can identify the moment users feel your card is uniquely necessary (travel, subscriptions, groceries, budgeting, credit building, whatever your wedge is), you can build default behavior around that and let the rest follow.",

The solution isn't to \"focus more,\" it's to lower the stakes. Stop thinking of it as a \"launch\" and start thinking of it as an experiment. If you launch and nobody cares, you haven't failed, you've just received your first data point.\n\nI was terrified of my first launch because I spent 8 months building in total isolation. I had everything riding on one single day. Now I \"launch\" tiny pieces of the product every week. The anxiety disappears when you realize that no single day will make or break your company.",

When I was building my first real venture after a previous failure, I had to get ruthless about separating execution days from strategy days. Like literally on my calendar - Mondays and Fridays were for thinking/planning, Tuesday through Thursday were pure execution mode where questioning the direction was off limits. It sounds rigid but it saved me from that constant mental ping pong between doing and doubting. The other game changer was shrinking my validation timeline - instead of waiting for a \"finished\" product, I started testing core assumptions way earlier with basic prototypes and landing pages. Even getting 10 people to sign up for a waitlist or pay a small pre-order gave me enough signal to quiet that revenue anxiety. The key was making the feedback loop as short as possible, so I wasn't operating in a complete vacuum for months. Also learned to track leading indicators instead of just obsessing over the big outcome - like daily progress on features, weekly user interviews, monthly prototype tests. Gave my brain something concrete to focus on instead of spiraling about hypothetical futures.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.\n\n",

Once we launched those we probably made $1,000 in monthly subscriptions that first day, and then they would come in again every month which was great.\n\nB2B spin off of that company, built a product. Sold a couple of small subscriptions at $49 a month before I sold a $10,000/year deal. That was just cold outreach and sales. Now we wouldn't do $10k deals, too low. $80,000 is basically the smallest that comes in and some will be rejected if no growth potential. \n\nSide hustle making stickers - made myself some stickers and posted the extra ones on etsy and sold a handful a year for a couple years until year 3 when orders grew and I made >$1,000 for the first time. My til year ended up being around $64,000 during covid. I do retail space in December every year locally and make a few thousand for no work. \n\nSide hustle 3d printing, I posted a print I liked and thought others would like on fb marketplace last month and have sold $1,350 worth now. Profit around $1,000.\n\nI only stick with a hobby if it makes me money. There's something wrong with me deep inside that has internalized that someone paying for my work is the only true validation 😂",

Loans - if you ever plan to take funding you cannot take out a loan. These loans have to be disclosed as part of Due Diligence and no one is going to invest in a company with large outstanding loans. This is called “throwing money in a debt hole”. If fundraising is your plan, do that from the start of needing money. You can take out loans when profitable for specific projects, but not before profitability. \n\n2. Taking too much money - every industry has their story of a company that took hundreds of millions and was out of business two years later. Take what you need to get to the next round and no more. Reason 1 is that you need to remain hungry. Get to relaxed and fat and you lose steam and the company doesn’t compete. Reason 2 is you need to go up on valuation each round. If you have a lower valuation in a round it is called a “down round” and that will pretty much kill your fundraising chances in the future.\n\nAvoid those. But otherwise enjoy!

And unless you're at the top spots on an infinite long list of choices you won't be allocated any of those resources, you won't get the minutes, and even less so the hours, of their time that you need to build a solid quality audience.\n\nTake a look at the guest lists of people like [Guy Kawasaki](https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/) and [Mark Maron](https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast) as an absolutely overwhelming example.\n\nSo what's your unique selling point to earn and keep some of those extremely finite resources of a quality audience?\n\nAnd, no, versions of \"we're better and genuine because we're not famous and professional\" doesn't fly when the foundation of it is being clueless amateurs.\n\nAbsolutely nothing wrong with using that approach, but it still needs a professional foundation. It still needs that USP. It still needs that network and structure and plan for how to reach, engage, and keep, the audience enough for them to redirect their attention towards your project.\n\nSo how are you going to create that foundation with these 5 first guests that are randoms from r/Startups rather than at least somewhat established names that can make people pay attention to what you're trying to build?",

Then from here I try to use Google slides to come up with a strategic narrative of where we’re at today, where we want to be, and a breakdown of how we get there.\n\nThen tomorrow shows up and everything changes… but at least I have something written down I can share with the team to spark discussion and iterate.",

It’s more like a living hypothesis that you keep stress testing against reality. The inputs you listed mission, customer feedback, market dynamics, delivery constraints are exactly the right ones. The trick is not trying to freeze them into something permanent, but giving yourself a structure that helps you decide what matters right now.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is treating strategy as a lightweight decision filter rather than a roadmap you must defend. Write it down not to be right, but so you can notice when new information actually changes the underlying assumptions versus when it’s just noise. That way, when an email from a prospect shows up, you can ask “does this invalidate our current bet, or is it just one data point?”\n\nThe fact that you’re already capturing where you are, where you’re aiming, and why in something shareable is honestly the hard part. The weekly churn doesn’t mean the strategy failed. It means the document is doing its job by giving the team a common reference point to react to and refine together.",

          "text": "This is an area where many businesses fail, because they chase features that they think excite the target customer but for which these customers wont pay.\n\nYou have two types of features.\n\n1. Features that solve the problems for your target market. As an example, if you were selling an accounting system to customers than ran US only businesses like an ETSY account, the features you need are simple. Tracking income and expenses. You would not then proceed to add support for multiple currencies. Multiple currencies are only needed if you plan to expand your addressable market, i.e., people that sell internationally. So first lesson, understand your target customers and the problems they need solved that they are willing to pay for. Only add features that specifically add value for teh customer and that they are willing to pay for.\n2. Once you have identified the required features for your target market, and you have delivered them, you need to figure out how to grow your market share. You do that, not by adding more cool stuff but by asking how can I improve my customer experience. If we go back to accounting for US businesses that might be, the ability to connect with the business bank account and automatically download and match income and expenses, or even a feature that simplifies expense tracking.\n\nSo ask yourself what am I trying to do\n\nI am trying to grow my market share within my existing market - focus on customer experience  \nI am trying to expand my addressable market - solve the problems for these new target customers\n\nOne more thing. As you consider what features you want to ask, consider when you rank them, how they might improve margins, e.g., if I add this feature that will reduce my COGS by 10%, will that return more profit than a feature that increases my customers by 10%. Or even, if I spend money not on features but quality, will that expense reduce customer churn leading to longer term recurring revenue.\n\nEdit - A comment on strategy\n\nStrategy is\n\nWho is my target audience  \nWhat problems do they need solving  \nWhy will they buy from me and not my competition\n\nIf your strategy contains numbers (increase revenue by 10%, broaden our markey by 20%) it is not a strategy it is a strategic goal. Furthermore if it contains broad statements like - be the world leader in \\[insert industry here\\], it is not a strategy, it is an aspiration.",

You need traffic, but more importantly, you need traffic that converts.\n\n\n\nStart where your ideal users already hang out. If you're building dev tools, go to GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow. If it's e-commerce software, find Shopify Facebook groups. Distribution isn't about scale yet—it's about targeting.\n\n\n\nOnce you get them to your landing page, your conversion rate separates good launches from bad ones. Most early-stage products lose 85-95 percent of visitors because the value prop isn't clear in five seconds. When someone lands on your page, they should instantly know what problem you solve and why they should care.\n\n\n\nTest your signup flow ruthlessly. If it takes more than 30 seconds to create an account and see value, you're dead. Early users have zero patience. Show them the outcome before asking for effort. The best onboarding lets them try the product before signup, not after.",

Here’s what I got out of it:\n\n* **Figured out how they found the app** (through the App Store search, which I hadn’t even thought about).\n* **Learned about a feature I was missing.**\n* **Now I have a direct line to a real user** for more feedback.\n\nI’m planning to set up a simple page on my site to track user requests, bugs, feature ideas, and support stuff so I don’t lose track of them. I also plan to keep talking to this user to see how they actually use the app\n\nIf you’re building something, add a way for users to reach you. It’s worth it.",

The \"regular\" professional liability is more generic and might not have all the tech-specific coverage you actually need as a SaaS company\n\n  \nthat first quote with cyber bundled in is probably your better bet even though its more expensive - cyber coverage is huge for AI/ML stuff since you're probably handling sensitive data. The cheaper one might leave you exposed if something goes wrong with your algorithms or if there's a data incident.

      "text": "I see this a lot with early-stage founders, and I’ve done it myself.\n\nYou launch something, it’s rough around the edges, you’re not fully confident yet, and lowering the price feels like the reasonable move. You tell yourself you’re just trying to get momentum, learn faster, get a few customers in the door. You’ll “fix pricing later”.\n\nThe problem is that early on, pricing isn’t just a revenue lever. It’s part of the signal you’re sending to the market, but also to yourself.\n\nWhat you’re actually trying to figure out at that stage isn’t “will people buy this if it’s cheap enough?”. \n\nAlmost anything sells if it’s cheap enough. What you’re trying to understand is whether you’ve built something that solves a real problem for a very specific type of person.\n\nDiscounting gets in the way of that.\n\nWhen the price is low, people say yes for fuzzy reasons. Curiosity. Convenience. Politeness. Budget cycles. You start hearing feedback that sounds useful but isn’t decisive. “Interesting.” “Promising.” “Could be useful.” None of that tells you whether the problem is painful or just mildly annoying.\n\nStrong product-market fit feels very different. It’s not subtle. People don’t hesitate much. They don’t negotiate much. They’re relieved that something exists.\n\nThe mental image that helped me was simple: if you’re on fire and someone has water, price is not the conversation. You don’t start comparing options or asking for a discount. You just want the fire gone.\n\nEarly pricing is less about being affordable and more about testing urgency.\n\nIf the only way you can get people to commit is by lowering the price, that’s often a signal that the pain isn’t sharp enough yet, or that you’re talking to people who don’t really need what you’re building. And once you build around those people, everything gets harder roadmap decisions, messaging, sales, even your own confidence.\n\nThere *are* cases where discounting makes sense early on. Design partners. Very explicit learning deals. Situations where both sides are clear that this is about feedback, not value. But using discounts as a way to “see if there’s interest” usually just delays clarity.\n\nIf people don’t want it at full price, the answer isn’t to push harder on price. It’s to look harder at the problem, the audience, and the story you’re telling.",

If you keep hearing vague answers, you probably have a positioning or audience mismatch. If you hear a sharp alternative and a clear budget constraint, then you learned something real about segment, packaging, or willingness to pay.\n\nThat is the point of the early loop.

Like you need to cover tech development, marketing/ads money, legal or cover employee salaries (feel free to add how many you have) ?

No saben cómo conseguir clientes de forma constante y piensan que contratar más gente o hacer más producto va a solucionarlo.

O las que necesitan desarrollar algo complejo que requiere tiempo y talento caro.\n\n\n\nPero si estás en modo \"necesito plata para marketing y empleados\" sin tener claridad de qué canal convierte, mejor enfócate en validar eso primero con presupuesto cero o mínimo.

          "text": "Most teams raise when they hit a bottleneck they cannot solve with cash flow, and they can explain what the money will change in concrete terms, not just “we will grow faster.”\n\nCommon reasons, depending on stage:\n\nEarly stage: buy time to reach proof, usually a tight wedge, early revenue, retention, a repeatable acquisition channel. If you are still guessing who it is for, money rarely helps.\n\nPost traction: hire to meet demand and scale what is already working, sales capacity, customer success, infrastructure, compliance, partnerships. This is where capital can actually compress time.\n\nThe trap you are describing is real. Hyper growth without retention turns into a reputation tax and a support nightmare, and then you spend the next year repairing trust while investors still expect the old curve. That is why “raise to fail faster” is a cute line but a dangerous strategy if you care about building something durable.\n\nSlow and healthy is often the better path when you can fund growth with revenue, especially for B2B or any product where trust and reliability are part of the value. Raising makes sense when you have clarity and pull, not when you are trying to buy your way out of ambiguity.",

      "text": "I (29M, single, no kids) need advice on what to do next. Based on the overview below, I'd like to hear what other people's ideas are / what people would do if they were in my position. I'd especially like to hear from people who have faced similar circumstances and what they did -- although all are open to opine.\n\nI have had a bumpy career. I studied math in undergrad; did a masters in statistics (all of this was paid for by scholarship, no loans are dragging me down). Good grades. Not worried there.\n\nI briefly worked at a prestigious company doing some compliance (9 months). I was then poached by a hedge fund to work on their acquisitions team (left after 1.5 years). I made good money and the work was good, too; the people were the stuff of nightmares (my stories would sound fake and a coworker once said she \"wouldn't believe me except for the fact that she saw it herself\"). I left and then helped manage an endowment (\\~3 years).\n\nThe endowment was fine but was \"bad\" in the sense that I was severely understimulated. It was boring beyond belief. After saving some money, I ended up leaving to try starting my own company.\n\nThe new company is going alright. I've been at it for about 8 months. These last few weeks, I started running ads / doing marketing. It is still in its infancy. I genuinely believe it can make a lot of money, assuming I can work out the kinks. It is getting interest; good internet traffic; and I'm about to close my first transaction after about 1 week of ads.\n\nThe problem is that I am running out of money. I still have enough of my own savings for about 9-12 more months (before dipping into retirement funds). I had planned to start looking for a new job in about a month if things weren't immediately promising. This is because, on average, it takes about 6-9 months to get a job if you do not currently have one. I am prepared for a longer search.\n\nI do not know if I should continue to try growing this on the side (which, admittedly, would be very difficult, if not impossible to do). I have thought about trying to raise some funding but want to wait until I have more of a steady flow of revenue before trying to scale -- the business is very ad-spend dependent and some processes need to be worked out before I feel very confident I could return my investor money. Also, having this working revenue flow would make it much easier to raise money.\n\nI could go back to \"high finance\" but it would put me in a position that is \"more junior,\" assuming I return to the same vein as before. This is a possible route but I would have to give up any chance of starting my own thing. This is because I'd probably be working 60-80 weeks. I'm also getting older and those hours are just killer. I think I'd be miserable.\n\nI have a technical background and could probably make the switch to software development / something in that realm. However, I'd be starting all over, and I've heard the job market isn't exactly popping in that sector. It'd also be a lot of work prepping for interviews -- I'm rusty, and I'd have to re-learn a lot.\n\nIdeally, I'd be able to get a job at a new company / startup where I'd be able to earn equity, help the company grow, get valuable business-building experience, then leave and try starting something again.\n\nI've put together a few things that I think will help me pick a new career.\n\nI know this is bad, but I need to make at least $150K+ based on my past jobs.\n\nI'd prefer to like my coworkers but I'd take ones I don't hate.\n\nI need a job that is semi-social.\n\nI need a job that has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI need a job that is stimulating / will let my position \"matter.\" At the endowment, if I didn't do my job for a week or so, I'm pretty sure nothing would change.\n\nSo, my questions are...\n\n* Would you try raising funding?\n   * It'd have a small chance of happening but I am pre-revenue and that is a huge limiter. I think I could make an argument that I have a good \"path to revenue\" but, realistically, you don't know that it'll work out until you are actually generating revenue.\n* Would you go back to a high-paying career at a more junior role, eat shit for a while, and maybe burn out?\n* Would you try switching fields altogether into one that is struggling with extra uncertainty?\n* Would you try finding a new gig doing something perhaps more ambiguous, taking less money, and see if you can get an equity stake in something?\n\nI'd be happy to hear advice that individuals may have that could help with the decision calculus here.",
