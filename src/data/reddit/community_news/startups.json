Hanging out in communities where your target audience is and being genuinely helpful without pitching. It's tedious and slow, but that's kind of the point - you're trading efficiency for learning at this stage.\n\nThe first 10-20 users aren't really about growth anyway. They're about understanding whether what you've built actually solves a real problem for real people. If you can't convince 10 people through direct conversation, ads and marketing won't magically fix that.\n\nA few things that actually work: find where your target users already congregate (forums, Slack groups, subreddits, Discord servers) and contribute genuinely for weeks before even mentioning you're building something. When you do mention it, frame it as \"I'm building X, would love feedback\" not \"check out my product.\" People are way more willing to help a fellow human than to be marketed to.\n\nAlso - referrals from those first users are gold. If someone loves what you're building, ask them directly who else might benefit. Warm intros convert way better than cold outreach.",

Reddit, Twitter, niche forums - wherever your ideal users hang out. Jump into those discussions genuinely, help people out, and you'll often find folks who are actively looking for exactly what you've built.\n\nContent creation is a long game and the algorithm is brutal. But connecting directly with people who already have the problem? That tends to convert much faster because you're meeting them where they already are.\n\nWhat's the app about?

Some content on social, a small follower base, and a bit of history on the page makes ads feel less like they’re coming from a brand that just appeared overnight.\n\nFrom there, A/B testing ads makes a lot of sense. Try a few angles, see what people actually respond to, then build from what works.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m probably the target audience for this stuff. I constantly get IG ads for apps promising better life organization or productivity, and I’m always a sucker for clicking through to see how my life might magically improve.

Best platform I found (depends on your app of course) has generally been X. Tech, finance, weird shit, it’s got it all and their system is pretty good at detecting what people are into. \n\nIn addition to paid, other strategies I’ve had success in before are;\n\nLaunch parties hosted at a bar. Host bingo or some dumb shit, the bar gets people to come in on a Tuesday night, you get people to look at your app and QR codes taped to the tables. \n\nQR code with hook lines posted on everything, even on top of urinals. What’s your app helping with? What’s the benefit? The pain point you’re resolving or fun you are providing? That’ll be your hook. \n\nDM me if you’d like to chat more about strategies and I can help you make something happen to.

Start by identifying where your potential users are already spending time online whether that’s niche subreddits, specialized forums, or social media groups, and engage in those spaces by offering value before directly promoting your app. you might also consider beta testing or offering the app for free to a small group of users to get real feedback. this can help identify if the UX is confusing, if the idea resonates, and if people would be willing to pay for it. lastly, user feedback is crucial, so try reaching out directly to people who fit your target audience and ask for honest opinions. this early stage is tough, but persistence and focusing on one-on-one feedback rather than broad promotional efforts might help you gather the insights you need to iterate and improve.",

Posting on many forums. It takes time. It is not that you just post about it or tell people about your product, you have to figure out what problem are you solving for them, and get it to them according to that problem. In terms of cold DMs, first DM - well, you might not get a response, and to very limited people. Also, you need to reach out to as many people as possible, and then keep following up. Following up is the key! Out of maybe 500 people, 5 might respond, but once they respond, they would be genuinely interested. Probably, and win after that, if two people try it out and keep on regularly using it, then you have two winners.",

A few installs that were either me, testers, or bots. Zero real feedback. That silence messes with your head more than people realize.\n\nOne thing I learned: no users doesn’t automatically mean the app is bad. Most of the time it just means nobody understands it yet, or nobody trusts it enough to try it. Especially if you’re unknown.\n\nProduct Hunt didn’t work for me either. Same with forums and cold DMs. All noise, no signal.\n\nWhat helped a bit was stopping “launch mode” and just trying to get one real person to react. Even paid a little for traffic just to see where people dropped off. It wasn’t growth, but at least it told me something.\n\nAlso, two weeks feels long when you’re staring at dashboards, but in reality it’s nothing. Most products die before they ever get a fair shot because the founder burns out in this phase.\n\nIf you want, I’m happy to take a look at your landing page or flow and give honest feedback. Sometimes you’re way closer than it feels.\n\nYou’re not alone in this stage. It just sucks while you’re in it.",

If you built a mobile app, what subreddits/forums/communities do your target users hang out in? Engage there first (helpfully, not promotional).\n\n\n\n2. ProductHunt timing matters. Don't launch until you have a small group who will upvote/comment in the first hour. Build that audience first through Twitter, your network, etc.\n\n\n\n3. The harsh truth: if you have 0 active users after trying everything, it might be a product-market fit issue, not a distribution issue. Before doing more marketing, talk to 10-20 people in your target market and ask if they'd pay for what you built.\n\n\n\n4. Start with just 10 users who love it, not 1000 who are indifferent. DM people personally. It doesn't scale but it's how you start.\n\n\n\nFocus less on channels and more on who specifically needs this problem solved.",

We threw tournaments,  managed to scale nicely over 5 years (including Covid when we went virtual), and had built enough credibility with gamers (who are notoriously distrustful and skeptical of outsiders), to put ourselves on the precipice of becoming a major (+2,000 participants) event in the community.\n\n2. Root Causes: a) personality conflicts. I ignored my better judgement about partnering with someone I knew I couldn’t stand because the upside was so big. b) bringing in someone who presented themselves and a marketing and biz dev wiz, ignoring subtle red flags because we were already committed to them. They also presented as someone well versed in contracts and operating agreements. Which turned out to be a fiction on par with Enron’s accounting. \n\n3. I should have walked away before getting started. I’ve prided myself on designing my business life so that I never had to work with anybody I didn’t want to, and no single project I was walking away from could break me, so I was never tied so tightly from something I couldn’t walk away if I needed to.  I broke both those rules. \n\n4. How It was handled: Lawyers. Lots of daydreaming about crushing peoples’ souls, but in the end peaceful acceptance that I relearned a valuable lesson, and a massive tax write off. But I did manage to cut two seriously ridiculous people out of my life, and that shit was almost…almost worth the loss. \n\n5. What now: sunk the extra time and energy into two projects, one of which is moving at an 8 on a scale of 1-10, the other that’s about a 6.5.",

The investors got impatient, pulled their money and sold the company for pennies. I spent about 2 years depressed (and working corporate) until I finally got the energy to start a new thing. It's so much easier the second (third) time around. \n\nBefore the glaucoma device I founded an engineering CM that did pretty well.

It took me a year to find a good match for my tech cofounder who was able to quickly deliver on his promises. Here are my points:\n- past experience and education do not matter. I had people from MiT, Amazon, Apple, And other top business and education brands who talked as good game, fail and not deliver a single feature because they got stuck on what’s right vs shipping \n- what matters if you and them are hungry. My current tech cofounder has some experience and is from a mid tier school. We built an mvp in 2 months and are now iterating. \n- ego. Every time somebody wants to own an unequal share as a cofounder, they are usually stuck on the idea that they are a visionary. I had to go through that with myself and a few others and learn that *visionary* [insert title here] = delusional or rigid or egocentric. I’m no exception. \n- make sure you can argue with your cofounder. I don’t mean being nice during … have a meltdown with each other? Can you solve your issues after and come back together?\n- can the two of you ship something within 4 months?\n- can you communicate and trust each other’s words and promises?\n- can you get to mvp? To get seed?\n- do you need more than one cofounder? Don’t be greedy, but don’t be dumb.\n\nAll of the above are very hard things to get through and is what the 2 years of runway is for + one of you is likely to need a place to live so be ready to have a couch buddy when shit goes sideways for one of you. \n\nNow pardon me as I have a pitch deck to complete so we can fund ourselves for the next year… before we run out of our runway + so my technical cofounder can move out from my couch and have a place of her own again.",

If they do not understand it, that doesn't mean you are not able to explain it - sometimes it's them.\n2. Do not build without validating with your users, even if you have a very strong understanding of your user. Build small, test it out in beta with the loyal users.\n3. Be very active in supporting or providing technical support to your users, if it's a product which is online or any other product. Support is what builds loyal users.

This proved to be something which was initially very amazing to look at! \"Hey, I could list my events, every part of the community events over here.\" But soon it became a redundant task in terms of managing everything outside the platform other than listing the events because of the visibility. So the first thing that I did was to code a tool which had a number of forms available and members list, so all the members of my community would always find all their registrations, would always find all my events, all my community activity at one place. This was entirely coded while I was plying from and to office in the Metro. Soon this picked up, so I open sourced it. But you know, open source also comes with several costs, so probably people didn't deploy it much, or maybe the code wasn't that easily understandable. Moving ahead, I took a domain, deployed it live and scaled to around 23 communities within three months, and around 10,000 users in about a year. This was the journey. Initially, once I had the clarity, after being given a chance to attend Google IO twice, out of which once I also gave a talk, I had a lot of interaction in their developer relations space. This in turn gave me clarity on two things:\n\n1. This developer relations space is a place where companies are running blindsided, losing a lot of data, and probably getting reports on only numbers of people who are just a part of the community.\n2. In the long run, this can be a global ecosystem which can enable a lot more developers to learn from each other, build great things together, and most importantly, can be something which I'd want to work for a longer time.",

But by then, you've built a business that requires you to be someone you're not.\n\nSo before you dive into tactics and validation and funding, get clear on:\n- What kind of life do you want to live?\n- What actually matters to you?\n- Are you running toward something or away from something?\n\nThose answers will guide every decision better than any framework.\n\nStart from that clarity, then build.

Here are my two perspectives:\n\nI did a startup abroad that then merged into my VC's other portfolio company, where I ran and scaled to the next phase, then burned out and left to return to the States. In the interim, I was considering doing an MBA. One of my good buddies was pursuing an MBA at UCLA and participating in a startup competition there that I was allowed to join. While doing that, I was able to sit in regularly on a bunch of his courses. A lot of the material they were learning and the case studies they were studying—I had to learn on the fly and apply. So I think 'hands-on' beats that handily; but my situation was very unique and fortunate.\n\nLater on, I became an EIR and startup lecturer at one of the top three accelerators (not YC—lol) and have completed four batches. I believe our content material was better than that of most MBA programs. I think running weekly experiments or doing real simulations and talking to real customers is far superior to reading case studies. Guest lecturers are about the same. In terms of networking, people in an accelerator together are likely more helpful in the near term, but I think people in MBA programs tend to keep in touch and be helpful to each other over longer time horizons.",

Doing it hands on forces you to internalize tradeoffs fast, especially around customers and cash, and that sticks way more than theory.

          "text": ">I do without validation of the core concept and idea is a waste of time and for last couple of weeks I've been posting around trying to validate that idea; and for nothing. No responses, no feedback, nothing.\n\nAnd? Most people would double down, launch anyway. Just Do It dogma clearly doesn't care about market demand. People post to ask if three, six, twelve responses is enough 'market traction' to launch. If you are one of them stop being ridiculous -- just launch market-blind.\n\nMost products fail in the marketplace. To get your head screwed on straight the process should be called *invalidation*. Wantrepreneurs don't like that. They would rather sabotage the validation process and delude themselves. They prefer to spend lots of time, effort, sometimes money.\n\nIt's when they call their launch a Minimum Viable Product in posts here I object. Lean Startup was designed to prevent the sunk cost fallacy of such boondoggles. Instead, wantrepreneurs allergic to reality twisted MVP into Build It And They Will Come. Total repudiation -- they kept the name but hollowed out the process. That's a cargo cult, not business.\n\nGlass Half Full you never made the noises \"em-vee-pee.\" Maybe that means you can cancel, do better next time. Everybody else is going to ignore the silence. Then in a year or two they'll crow about getting a few non-paying users on an internet with almost six billion users. Bless their heart.\n\nThe problem with fake it 'til you make it is *faking making it.*",

One thing that helps is reframing progress as learning, not just building. You can move forward by testing assumptions in very small ways instead of looking for big obvious feedback. Silence usually does not mean the idea is bad, it often means the ask is too heavy or too abstract for people to respond to. Reducing it to one clear question or one tiny experiment can break that loop. Also, momentum matters more than perfect sequencing. Even small improvements or cleanup work can help you feel unstuck. Most founders hit this wall more than once, it is not a sign you are doing it wrong. How are you currently trying to validate it?",

I wrote consulting business reports, website mockups, marketing and ad straegy, even tried helping his shitty old business come to the modern age. Heck, I even saved his fucking life when he was talking about killing himself because he was found out to be a kiddy fiddler and maintained he never was - I'm not sure if he was, but yeah, he seemed to be under investigation. When I asked the my collegues in the government about what to do about this, they told me to leave it until he has been investigated. The fucker literally changed his number and did a runner on me. \n\nDude said he'd pay me in ETH or Fiat, I said I run a legitimate business all by myself, of course I want fucking Fiat for my business. But he kept lying and saying some woman holds his money, and that he is waiting on it. Ended up changing his number. Stupid idiot didn't even know I have friends in the government that will find him and check everything. Turns out they did investigate, and he admitted he was a scammer.\n\nFuck helping people, they are all users and liars. Whether it be friends, clients, or family. Heck I had family stealing all my work, claiming it was them, and took my rightful compensation. \n\nHere's the thing, that money was to help his business thrive, while retaining my profits too. I was going to use those profits to build a product, and finally leave the service industry for good.\n\nBut even when everyone stripped me off everything, and made me the bad guy (alot of people did by lying and keeping everything for themselves), I still went on to build three SaaS projects. \n\nImagine being broke, yet still moving forward. That's what I did. \n\nLife will throw you hardballs, and you will need to adjust. \n\nBuilding and growing something isn't for the weak, especially when you have no financial support, and you've been robbed off your life savings. \n\nYes, starting up, you will cry, lose your mental health and much more.\n\nI did. A lot. \n\nBut you will come out of it stronger. \n\nLook back - you built something. Not many people have the balls to do so. Be proud of yourself. Everytime you feel down or are about to cry, remember - you did this shit yourself. Without help.\n\nMost of us start with nothing, and no help. We are the real warriors. You are real warrior. \n\nSooner or later you will receive everything, and it will all pay off.\n\nAbove all, have faith - whether that is in God or the universe. \n\nKnow things will align for you sooner or later.\n\nI cried every night too, thinking all this bad luck happened because I upset people, asking for forgiveness in my prayers. \n\nTurns out some motherfuckers were hacking me and ruining my reputation by stalking and copying my work and claiming my rightful compensation and destiny. They made multiple fake accounts and spoofed my number to make me look bad. I imagine they did this so they can keep everything and not be held accountable for the shit they did for years.\n\nHeck, I finally found a few projects I loved to work on, and the same fuckers manipulated me out of working on these projects. Being part of a phone startup was my dream. Yet I was derailed and my consulting work was stolen again by two fuckers from different projects, and they blamed me for leaking shit which I never did. I was trying to get these people investors, but they all backed out the minute they saw how these people were and went in another direction. \n\nHeck, I was waiting on some people to pay me a substantial amount too so I could finally invest in the above projects, but those fuckers also kept everything to themselves and avoided me and lied about me.\n\nBut God helps people who are villainised falsely - I ended up connecting with a manufacturer that had a phone built and gave me exclusive rights to it. Not in the same niche as the projects I was in, but something better with a larger target audience. \n\nSome people have no integrity, they will do anything to fuck others over to hide their hands and steal the spotlight.\n\nNot to mention some people made millions from my financial markets page, and didnt pay me a fucking dime either. They lied and took everything themselves, telling others it was them behind the work and profiting by taking other people's money, which was meant for me to manage plus my share for helping people do well. This fucker just kept it all to himself. \n\nThis year broke me man, in more ways than you know. But the last laugh is on everyone that tried fucking me over - I hold evidence, leverage, and information that can cripple multiple people. \n\nNever fuck with a man that has nothing to lose and lots of leverage. \n\nPay your fucking dues and have integrity. That is how business is done.\n\nSame people who laugh, never met a gangster either who takes no shit and will stomp their necks out. A man who has been through hell and back is the one who remains calm and waits patiently to see if others will do the right thing. If they dont, well, don't cry when shit hits the fan either.\n\nSorry, I couldn't keep it in. I've had a lot I've had to bottle up for a couple of years, that I never spoke about. \n\nBut doesn't matter anymore - I couldn't care less and I'm not a people pleaser anymore. Everyone can go fuck themselves, and I will happily tell everything publically when asked in the future.\n\nAt the end of the day, don't let people or stress get you down. God will help you align with the right things and people. \n\nYou will win in the end, and the fatigue, mental breakdown, isolation, and much more will subside soon, and you will have abundance and prosperity with your startup. Never give up. 💪🏽",

      "text": "I have been trying to build and launch things for quite some time now. I also have good experience as a product manager, so ideation and planning are not new to me.\n\nBut I am an ADHD and OCD person. My biggest problem is that I think and plan a lot, and before I finish building one idea, another idea pops up. My brain keeps chasing that dopamine hit of new ideas, new concepts, and new thinking.\n\nBecause of this, I keep jumping. I start something, get excited, build halfway, then move on. Over the last 8–9 months, I have built around 25+ half-baked ideas. None of them were properly launched or given enough time. I ended 2025 with a lot of regret because I was busy all the time, but not actually shipping anything meaningful.\n\nSo for 2026, I am trying to change this.\n\nWhat I am trying now is to restrict myself to one idea per week. Even if the idea is bad or not perfect, I want to stick with it for a week, build it, and launch it. No overthinking, no endless planning, no regrets. Just ship and move on.\n\nAlmost all my ideas are very lean, and I use tech stacks that cost almost nothing until I make a sale. Money is not the problem. Focus and execution are.\n\nNow I am struggling with structure.\n\nI want a proper daily and weekly plan that:\n\n\\- allows me to try new ideas without going crazy,\n\n\\- forces me to finish and launch,\n\n\\- and still gives some space to grow or iterate on ideas that actually show promise.\n\nRight now, I feel like I am still stuck more in thinking than executing, and I keep context-switching a lot.\n\nSo I wanted to ask you all honestly:\n\nIf you have ADHD-style founder brain or idea overload, how are you managing it?\n\nIs the one-idea-per-week approach a good way to break this cycle, or is it a bad idea?\n\nHow do you plan your week so you actually build, launch, and then decide what deserves more time?\n\nI am not looking for motivational quotes. I genuinely want to learn what has worked for others in real life.\n\nBecause I feel like there is no productivity app is right for me? Anyone feels the same? I hate these generic task management apps, I have tried and paid for nearly 10 such apps, so please recommend me the best one please.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏽",

Thats why i am trying hard from this week that i should ship every idea i had partially built one by one. And i am damn sure there is no proper software tool for people like me, all tools are just a gimmick & even if i build one, it wont be enough for other adhd peoples because every one has different level of dopamine shortage and different way of coping mechanisms",

One idea per week can work, but only if the definition of “done” is brutally small. Something like a landing page plus a single user action, not a full product. Otherwise the week just becomes another planning sprint. What helped me was separating idea exploration from execution. I keep a parking lot for new ideas and I’m not allowed to touch it during a build window. I also plan weeks around outputs, not tasks. By Friday, X must exist in the world, even if it’s rough. After shipping, I do a short review and only allow myself to continue if there’s a clear signal, not just excitement.\n\nContext switching is usually a symptom of avoiding the boring middle. Short daily time blocks helped more than any app. Two focused build blocks, everything else is optional. Most tools didn’t stick for me either. A simple doc or notebook with a weekly goal and daily checkmarks worked better than fancy systems. The structure needs to be boring enough that your brain stops trying to optimize it.",

Ela deve estar \"subordinada a você\", mas você deve ter a mente aberta que o ojetivo desta pessoa é entregar seus projetos, então você não pode furar o planejamento de entrega com remodelações ou novas alterações fora do que já foi definido. Entenda que sua função é criar, idealizar e desta passoa finalizar e entregar. Não sei do que se trata, mas 70% das idéias podem não ir para frente. É normal. Foque no objetivo final da idéia: Lucrar, Servir ou Criar. Procure quem possa validar suas idéias com seriedade, de forma científica, com estudo e pesquiza sem idealismo. Produtos e Idéias dependem de necessidade, a necessidade é gerada pelo momento. O Time é importante para entrada no mercado, em contra partida a qualidade faz durar. Aceite que vai precisar de ajuda e vai ser difícil deixar outra pessoa tocar seu projeto e dar opinões contrárias e que vai querer finalizar do jeito que está e não da forma ideal que você imaginou.

      "text": "I’m really tired of reading the endless “I built for 1 year and got $0” so let me tell you what works. \n\nI’ve been selling online for 17+ years. \nI never had a job. \n\nI’ve sold everything that you can imagine. \n\nI’ve finally been able to launch a start up and now have a software business that makes 6 figures+. And this year we are on track to hitting $1M+ ARR. \n\nLook, I’ve made every mistake which everyone here seems to make. But let me share with you what works. \n\nFirst - forget software. \nYou aren’t in the software business. \n\nYou are in the relationship and problem solving business. \n\nFor me, I pivoted to software because I was burned out from coaching and consulting. I wanted the dream of building a great product and then scaling it to the moon. \n\nI wanted the comfort of my IDE. I’m a nerd by nature. I like to plan and build. \n\nA lot of people think this way. \nBut this is the #1 killer. \n\nNo one cares about your product. \nThink about it. \n\nHow much software spam do you see. \nDo you like it? \n\nIn fact, you hate 99% of software out there. \nEven your favorite software you complain about it not being perfect. \n\nSo imagine how users will approach your misaligned, awkward, buggy MVP. \n\nSo if you try to build and build the chance of success is less than 1%. \n\nInstead there is an approach that has 100% chance of success. \n\nHelping solve people’s problems. \n\nFind a group of people already using some software. \n\nFor me, I’ve been using marketing software for 10+ years. So I know those users. They were my past students, coaching, and consulting clients. \n\nThat’s what I did. I started to solve their problems. \n\nIn fact, the BEST way is to start doing projects for other people. That’s how I founded my latest company. \n\nI was hired to build a plugin for a marketing platform. \n\nI discovered there was a big market there. And I built another plugin and started selling it. \n\nBut the big pivot came about not from just selling the software. But helping the users. \n\nThink of your users. \nWhether they are writers. \nOr stay at home moms. \nOr business owners. \nOr marketers. \n\nThey have needs everyday. \nThey have workflows they are doing. \nThey have goals and dreams. \n\nYou can align your products with those people. \n\nRather than focusing on features. \nFocus on their problems and goals. \n\nIn fact, often times they are the ones that will tell you what to build. \n\nA lot of people ask how you can monetize. \nI’ve literally monetized on all levels. \n\nFrom $5 all the way up to $3k\nAnd we are working on getting even to $30k contracts. \n\nHow? \nBy focusing on our users. \nOur customers. \nWhat their needs are. \n\nYou have to forget the idea of how Google or Apple or even major SaaS company operates. You aren’t them. You don’t have a budget. You don’t have a team. \n\nYour main constraint is your energy, motivation, clarity, and your bills. \n\nYou have to operate hyper lean. \n\nSo my users became my everything. \n\nI put together different packages. \nI offered them agency accounts. \nWhite label partnerships. \nInvestment opportunities. \nAffiliate. \n\nThey do QA. \n\nThis is the only way to succeed. \n\nI try to help them with all their problems. \n\nThat’s the relationship building part. \nWhen you over deliver and take care of your users and treat them like clients, not just numbers. They appreciate it. They reciprocate. \n\nThey become your partners and evangelists. \n\nMy users upgrade and upgrade and upgrade and upgrade. \n\nEven though they bought an LTD. They then buy a level 2 agency LTD. Then they buy a white label partnership. Some even became direct investors. \n\nThis is a total game changer from the \n“I built for 12 months and generated $0”\n\nI even read a comment someone who has been building their software for literally 32 years and generated $0. \n\nYou can even go further and sell before you build. And I do that to some extent. And I can even be much more aggressive with sales. \n\nBut I’m like most, a natural builder. Building is my comfort zone. But I had to push myself to be able to survive. \n\nAnd that’s the lesson I want to pass to you. \n\nThink of your users as your clients and partners not just your numbers. \n\nYou aren’t a VC backed start up that can burn through millions to acquire a big herd of users. \n\nYou need to like a village helper who does favors to everyone and helps everyone out and earn’s people’s trust. And slowly bootstrap yourself to the next level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I want to take a “this is what we’re solving, what do you think convo” and then talk over time and see if funding makes sense\n\nDo I reach out cold email? How about cold connect/dm on LinkedIn? What do I ask? Like I said, I’m not looking to ask for money out the gate but just connect with an investor.\n\nHow about for those living in SF? Are there any specific groups I can join? Googles useless here.\n\nI’m looking for specifics outside of general advice.\n\nFWIW our funding ask, if we ever get to it, is to ask between 100 to 250k pre seed SAFE. We have over 2000 signups over the past year with virtually everyone saying the same thing (we’ll pay for it if it can do this) so our traction and story is strong, we just need more dedicated time to solve the problem, hence the need for funding.",

A short cold email that says what you are building, why now, and what signal you have works better than vague “would love feedback” asks. If you truly want a conversation, frame it as learning, not pitching, but be ready to pitch anyway. In SF, the fastest path is still other founders. Go to small demo nights, founder dinners, and operator meetups, not big splashy events. Intros compound once one person takes you seriously. The mistake is waiting to feel ready. Conversations are how you get ready.",

      "text": "I keep hearing the advice \"Build fast, ship fast, fail fast. If it doesn't work, move on to the next thing.\n\nAnd if you watch successful indie hacker build logs or motivational videos, they consistently preach this mindset.\n\nBut I'm genuinely confused about how this works in practice.\n\nI launched my first app a few weeks ago. I got a few downloads, barely any real users. I think these numbers are too small of a sample size to make any real judgment, so I feel like I should focus on increasing exposure first. \n\nBut here's my dilemma: how much time should I actually spend on this?\n\n\n\nHonestly, I think launching isn't the end. it's just the beginning. After you launch, you need to:\n\n\n\n\\- Create marketing materials\n\n\\- Run campaigns across different channels\n\n\\- Analyze user behavior and feedback\n\n\\- Iterate on features based on what you learn\n\n\\- Keep testing and optimizing\n\n\n\nAll of this takes time. Weeks, sometimes months. And it requires consistent effort, not just a quick burst.\n\nSo my questions:\n\nHow do you know when to quit vs. when to keep pushing? Is there a signal you look for? A timeline? A metric threshold?\n\nHow do you balance iteration vs. new projects? If you're supposed to ship multiple things to find what works, but each thing needs months of marketing effort... when do you actually have time to build the next thing?\n\nIf you're running an existing product while developing something new, how do you handle it? Do you keep improving the existing product, and when a new idea comes up, instead of building it right away, do you create mockups or landing pages first to test the response? But some products require users to actually try them before they can judge. so this is where I get confused.\n\nI feel like I might be too caught up in the \"serial builder\" mythology without understanding how it actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from people who've been through this cycle multiple times.",

In practice, “fail fast” usually means being explicit about what you are trying to learn next and how long you are willing to pay for that learning. A few weeks of low signal is not a failure if you have not tested distribution, messaging, or a concrete user workflow yet. On the flip side, pushing indefinitely without a clear hypothesis just turns into inertia.\n\nWhat has helped me is time boxing around questions, not outcomes. For example, spend a month answering whether anyone repeatedly uses a specific feature, or whether you can acquire users below some cost, rather than chasing growth in the abstract. If you cannot get clarity after a few focused iterations, that is often the real signal to move on. The serial builder myth hides how much of the work is actually deciding what not to keep funding with your time.",

The nuance that often gets missed is that the news cycle is dominated by the winners or the heavily funded, so you rarely see the thousands of elite technical startups that die quietly because they built a technical product that nobody actually wanted. Technical brilliance does not automatically equal product-market fit, and as long as there are problems to be solved, startups will always be needed.\n\nThat said, you are right to be cautious because you will face competition from people who are better connected and more technically skilled than you. If you try to simply out-code lets say a Google engineer type of founder, you will lose. The market doesn't ask for your credentials, it asks if you can solve a specific pain better than anyone else. So the real question isn't whether you have the background, but whether you can find a problem you understand deeply enough to deliver a solution uniquely well. If you can do that, the lack of a pedigree matters a lot less.",

I target boring B2B problems that FAANG engineers would never touch.\n\n\n\nAnd distribution matters more than you think. A decent product with great distribution beats a great product with no distribution. Most technical founders suck at marketing - if you can do both even mediocrely, you have an edge.\n\n\n\nDon't try to build the next Stripe.

Do they NEED an app or just want one?\n\n2. Sketch wireframes on paper (free tools: Figma, Balsamiq). What does the app actually DO?\n\n3. Research competitors - who's already solving this? What makes yours different?\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Development path:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Don't hire devs yet. Use no-code tools first (Glide, Bubble, Adalo) to build an MVP for $0-500\n\n\\- If it gets traction, THEN find a technical co-founder (equity, not cash)\n\n\\- Budget: Real app development costs $20k-50k+ for MVP. Kickstarter before validation is risky\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Finding partners:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Join fashion tech accelerators (Fashion for Good, Techstars)\n\n\\- Attend local startup meetups\n\n\\- Post on YC Co-founder matching\n\n\n\nDon't skip validation. Most fashion apps fail because they solve problems users don't have. Good luck!",

Cold outreach works better when it is framed around a very specific contribution tied to what the company is already shipping, not a generic willingness to help. Offering part time work can help in some cases, but only if it reduces risk for the team rather than creating more coordination overhead. I would also be careful assuming accelerators or job boards reflect how most small teams actually hire, a lot of decisions happen opportunistically and off cycle. From the founder's side, commitment matters less than clarity about what you would build and how it fits the roadmap.

I found out it's much more draining than I thought and that leads to me bringing my worst version (being cautiously attached to the person and not heavily invested).\n\nThe last person I dated, previous startup founder who has exited twice and I thought he would understand the unpredictability of this but he ended up breaking up with me 3 months just when I was ready to fully commit and have adjusted some of my plans to make more time for him (his reason, he wants secure & consistent relationship which is valid). There was also a 11 years age gap so not even sure if that might have been a factor.\n\nI know this is a hectic journey with so many unknowns but I also don't want to spend the next few years only on work and then try to find a partner when I am settled.\n\nAnyone have any advice on how to approach this?

Not in an apologetic way, but just matter of fact - \"I'm building a company right now, some weeks are chaos, I won't always be able to text back quickly, and if I cancel plans it's not because I'm not interested.\" Most people will filter themselves out, and that's fine. The ones who stick around tend to be either founders themselves or just genuinely independent people who have their own thing going on.\n\nThe 11-year age gap thing is probably more significant than you think btw. Someone who's exited twice is at a completely different life stage - they've already done the thing you're still grinding through. Easy to misjudge what \"understanding the unpredictability\" means when they're viewing it from the other side.\n\nMy honest take: keep dating if you want to, but adjust expectations. You're not looking for someone who needs consistent attention right now. You're looking for someone comfortable with sporadic intensity. Those people exist, they're just not the majority.",

Most people don’t understand volutarily wanting to work on evenings and/or weekends. I don’t mean working all the time, but not puting boundaries on when work can be performed as needed. Sometimes you just need to sprint and they’ll call u out on burnout or obsession. Joining programs and events to network and befriend other founders in a similar stage is crucial to keep sane.",

People asking to pay usually means the tool fits a very specific workflow they already understand, not that it is ready to survive contact with a broader user base. The real question is whether the value comes from the software itself or from the surrounding context, assumptions, and support that exist inside your team. One low-risk option is to test intent without full productization, for example, a paid pilot with clear constraints and no promises. That can tell you whether demand persists once expectations around polish and support are explicit. A lot of internal tools fall apart when you try to generalize them, so clarity on what problem you are actually solving matters more than the number of requests.",

Internal tools often work because they encode a set of norms, incentives, and habits that are invisible to outsiders.

A constrained pilot is a good way to surface that gap without committing to your roadmap. I would also be explicit with pilot users that this is not a standalone product yet, but an opinionated workflow that demands buy-in. If it only works when teams fully adopt the philosophy, that is not a flaw, but it does shape whether it can coexist with your main product without becoming a distraction.",
