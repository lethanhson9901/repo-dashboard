      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about why some people build multiple successful startups while most others never get one off the ground, and the more I strip away the mythology, the more it looks like a simple equation rather than some mysterious talent.\n\nIf you look closely, the market already gives you most of the variables. Products already exist. Customers already pay for solutions. Pricing models are already validated. Revenue structures are proven. In other words, demand has already been solved. Yet people still act like they need to invent everything from scratch, when in reality that’s usually where momentum dies.\n\nOnce I understood this, my whole approach changed. I stopped treating startups as artistic projects and started treating them like repeatable experiments. If competitors are making money, the correct move isn’t to innovate wildly, it’s to align. Same pricing logic. Same revenue model. Same customer profile. If the market is already paying X for a solution and won’t pay X for yours, the issue isn’t price discovery. It’s sales, positioning, or distribution.\n\nThat’s where most founders lie to themselves. They say the product isn’t ready, or the timing isn’t right, or they need one more feature. But if you already know the market exists, then the only real question is whether you can communicate value well enough to convert attention into money. If you can’t sell after enough real attempts, the math is telling you something, and it’s not subtle.\n\nSo I started optimizing for throughput instead of perfection. Build the smallest thing that can be sold. Ship it fast. Try to sell it aggressively. If it doesn’t move after a meaningful number of attempts, kill it without drama and move on. No emotional attachment. Just data. Repetition compounds. Each cycle sharpens your understanding of what actually works.\n\nSales became the core function, not an afterthought. Not polishing features, not tweaking designs, but improving language. Pitch clarity. Objection handling. Distribution. After enough reps, outcomes become predictable. Either the market pulls, or it doesn’t. Both are valuable answers.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that once even a small amount of traction exists, everything downstream simplifies. Pricing debates disappear. Confidence increases. Even investors behave differently, because you’re no longer presenting a hypothesis, you’re showing evidence. At that point, fundraising isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about scaling something that’s already mathematically working.\n\nThe final variable I underestimated was accountability. I noticed I always performed better when other people were watching, when reputation was on the line. So instead of relying on motivation, I engineered pressure. Public goals. Daily execution. External expectations. Systems that make it uncomfortable to stall.\n\nThe conclusion I keep coming back to is this: success in startups isn’t about being smarter or more original. It’s about running the equation enough times without lying to yourself. Fast execution. Real sales attempts. Honest feedback. Kill what doesn’t work. Double down on what does. Statistically, if you do this long enough, something breaks through.\n\nMost people fail not because they lack ideas, but because they don’t run the equation enough times to let probability do its job.\n\nCurious how many people here see startups the same way—or are still stuck optimizing variables the market already solved.",

          "text": "This resonates a lot, especially the shift from treating startups as creative expression to treating them as repeatable experiments.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed, though, is that many founders think they’re copying what works, but they only copy the surface variables. Pricing, features, even positioning can be replicated, but the harder part to copy is the pressure that forced the original business to converge. Real selling, real rejection, and the discomfort of finding out fast that the market doesn’t care.\n\nI’ve seen people “run the equation” many times, but quietly protect themselves from disconfirming feedback. They sell, but only in friendly environments. They ship, but only to audiences that won’t say no clearly. From the outside it looks like iteration, but underneath it’s still avoidance.\n\nYour point about accountability is underrated. Once reputation, time, or money is visibly on the line, the signal becomes much cleaner and decisions get easier. At that point, the market stops being abstract and starts answering very directly.\n\nCurious if there was a specific moment where the feedback became impossible to ignore and forced you to either double down or kill something without debate.",

Frankly a disturbing many think standard business practice is evil. Then they start one. \n\nWay too many are trying to get out of doing business. They seek growth hacks for a business which has no reason to exist. They want a cheatcode to get out of plain vanilla business advice. They crave a workaround for, well ...work. \n\nYes there is discussion about sales here, but not technique. Nobody knows what an objection is, let alone a hidden objection. They want to scale but they don't want to read a book on sales. \n\nWhat they want to do is crap something out market-blind. \n\nWhich is why I have begun to write these forums do not discuss business. They post the problems of refusing to do business then coping with inevitable bad outcomes. \n\nBecause they opted for the easier, gentle form of capitalism. The business that isn't work, it's all fun and games. You don't manage employees, you friend them. Have a problem, just hug it out. You do not 'make' a sale ...sales just sort of, you know, *happen.*\n\nMarketing is just feeling clever about what you've done. Sales is simply an outgoing personality and the gift of gab. Read books? *Why whatever for?* They want out of business and they get their wish.",

In those cases, you do not need wild innovation, but you do need a wedge that makes adoption easier, cheaper, faster, or safer.\n\nI also think “sell aggressively and kill fast” only works if you are clear what you are testing. A lot of founders think they tested the product when they really tested the wrong audience, the wrong promise, or a channel that was never going to work for them. The honest loop is: pick one ICP, one use case, one offer, one channel, run enough reps to get signal, then decide. Otherwise “kill it” can become another way to avoid learning.\n\nThe core equation I agree with is simpler: stop guessing, run tight experiments, and force decisions based on evidence. The best founders are not romantic. They are disciplined about what they are trying to learn next and they keep the loop short enough that self deception cannot survive.",

After months of silence, I stopped applying as aggressively and decided to finally act on an idea I’ve had for almost 5 years, to build something of my own and be my own boss.\n\nThat’s how my startup idea was born (still very early, mostly just me trying to make things work).\n\nSince then, I’ve tried everything I could think of:\n- applying for jobs\n- building a startup\n- posting on YouTube / Instagram (content cration)\n- learning, building, iterating\n\nAnd the result has been the same everywhere: almost zero response.\n\nNo users, no traction, no recruiter callbacks, no real encouragement.\n\nFriends and family don’t really support it (or maybe don’t believe in it). I don’t fully blame them, when there’s no visible progress, it’s hard for anyone to.\n\nNow I’m financially broke, mentally exhausted, and honestly demotivated. The stress has started affecting my marriage too, which hurts the most.\n\nI keep asking myself:\n- What am I doing wrong?\n- Am I approaching things the wrong way?\n- Is this just how it works before things click, or am I ignoring some obvious mistake?\n- How do you know when to persist vs when to pivot?\n\nI’m not posting this to promote anything or ask for sympathy.\n\nI genuinely want real feedback from people who’ve been through layoffs, failed startups, long job searches, or rebuilding phases.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place:\n- What helped you get unstuck?\n- What would you do differently if you were in my position?\n- Any hard truths I might need to hear?\n\nThanks for reading.

          "text": "The problem is most of entrepreneurship is displayed as \"you get laid off, you build one idea, then you become rich\". The reality is that most times it takes numerous failures for you to become successful. You are welcome to read other subreddits talking about the pain of entrepreneurship: most have failed for almost a decade (broke, bankrupt, 2nd mortgage, etc.) before they started breaking 10M in revenue. So if this is the path you want to take then maybe you should start thinking in the order of decades.\n\nIn terms of what you should do, that is entirely up to you. You can start applying again (aim for 1000+ jobs, my 2nd software gig took 1300!). I would suggest trying to target large industries (1B+) and failing within those because a success will mean a decent sized payout. Target military, health care, etc. As builders, we are more concerned with the product, but company success is not technological: it is strategic, and that takes analyzing the problem for long periods of time.\n\nMy personal strategy is making all the cool shit I want to, state of the art, in public. This a) does not tarnish my skills b) makes getting a job later easier (because I know the SOTA) c) impresses those within industries (non-tech people), because they can see what I CAN make. The only difference between riches and making no money as an engineer is simply making the right thing. By signalling you can make anything, someone in industry will ask you to make something, and that rabbit hole will eventually lead you somewhere.\n\nMy 2 cents",

          "text": "This some of it seems more like life choices, with all respect, in terms of relevance to this sub. You have to secure your own well being and security first before you undertake any project and entrepreneurship. \n\nOnce you have bread on the table you can experiment more. \n\nHowever out of strong need can come abilities too... is this the case? I don't know. \n\nGet your life in order with stability, then try to work something out. You can try working in partnership with someone too, that can often bring much better results.\n\nTo answer, yes things can take some time and quick success is very rare. Usually though. Getting no traction or users sounds like either lack of proper marketing or your product isn't that good/useful/needed.\n\nTo properly diagnose the issue you need to do lots of A/B testing. If you don't know what you're doing, find someone that knows more. \n\nFor example. I had something many people wanted but our informational resources werent great at first and our product also a bit unreliable (so some failures). People were never getting to point C and kept getting stuck at point A. Or would get to point C but never come back because things failed or something somewhere made them stop. It's been a long process perfecting that pathway but theres lots of factors. The key though is knowing what you're selling is *needed* and working around that. \n\nSo,  as you go, you figure out what's going on by testing. Can be as simple as: \n\n\"People want to see services, faq and pricing together rather than spread across pages\" or \"don't require login to use\" or \"too many things overwhelm the user and makes them take no action and leave\" or \"the offer is confusing/unclear/not good\" or \"too much noise against the CTA\". Lots of things.\n\nDo you know how much reach you have at the moment approximately? If you estimate at least 1,000-10,000 impressions per piece of content and you're getting 0 results  then it must be your offer most likely so yes, time to iterate something. Choose whatever is working best and iterate from that. If it's nothing, then pick your best bet. Iterating what works is what gets you places. You see blue ribbons sell more? Make them more, and 2 variations perhaps. You see someone liked when you said \"my blue ribbons make your room sparkle\"? Keep that same exact phrase and use it later. Keep it very simple. \n\nIf youre hardly getting visitors then find out how to get them. Some of these require you get a bit out of comfort zone if not used to talking to lots of people. If you're getting visitors and visitors and never a single interest for your base product then time to pivot. Rare though useful. \n\nWhen to pivot? Example. You sell shoe laces, meant for use in tying shoes. You fail a thousand ways until you realize people are using them more for boots. Now you pivot to boot laces instead of shoe laces. \n\nWhen to iterate? You sell shoe laces. You see people keep buying the orange laces. You iterate a new version of Orange laces, except this time three length variations and one with another texture. You see what sells. You iterate. \n\nIf you're getting any kind of minimal results, you can do this. As minimal as they are.Then, improve your marketing (get the message to more people), and improve your branding and intake sites for trust, readibility, accessibility and aesthetic for branding. \n\nFirst though, get some bread on the table friend. And second, get a good partner if you can that will help you get things running where you can't. Take things with calm, do as you can but move swiftly and diligently on what you do. Think of everything as logically as you can.",

Any one of those can feel like shouting into the void for months, and doing all three at once tends to create the worst kind of fatigue because you never get enough signal back from any one lane to feel momentum.\n\nI do not think the problem is effort. The problem is focus, sequencing, and the fact that your nervous system is now the limiting factor.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would do two things in parallel, and I would be ruthless about the scope.\n\nFirst, stabilize money. Not because you are giving up on the startup, but because you cannot make good product decisions when you are panicking about rent and your marriage is taking collateral damage. That can mean a smaller target job, contract work, freelance, whatever gets you predictable cash fastest. The goal is a runway, not a perfect role.\n\nSecond, shrink the startup into a two week reality loop instead of a vague “build and post.” Pick one specific customer type, one painful problem, one simple offer, and do ten conversations. Not “would you use this,” but “how are you solving this today, what does it cost you, what have you tried, would you pay for a better outcome.” If you cannot get conversations, that is the signal, and it tells you your distribution plan is missing, not that you are broken.\n\nContent creation should be optional, not a third full time job. If it is not producing leads or recruiters, park it. You can always restart later when you have something concrete to talk about.\n\nOn persist vs pivot, I use a simple test: persist when the problem is real and you are learning from clear experiments, pivot when you are repeating the same actions and getting the same silence. Right now it sounds like a lot of activity without a tight feedback loop, which is why it feels hopeless.\n\nThe hard truth is that “almost zero response” is not a verdict on you. It is a verdict on the current approach. You need fewer bets, tighter experiments, and enough stability to think clearly.",

          "text": "You’re receiving a lot of valuable advice here. Hopefully, you’ll be able to identify the recurring patterns in the advice. Focus, narrow down, and even shrink your target market, customer, and product/solution if doing so would likely require the same level of effort to maintain focus across the other elements.\n\nIf you’re committed to pursuing everything long-term, I suggest spending some time considering how you can better integrate and stack your strategies to work together and benefit each other. Even if that means reducing focus to just pushing one or two of these forward at a time and achieving sufficient success or traction, before then either stacking on the next piece or sticking with just one or two, and swapping one out for the other on a regular basis. \n\nI’ve been in a similar situation a few times over the past two to three years. When I was experiencing the same thing, it sounds like you are right now. I narrowed my efforts and focused on only activities that could result in a sale, conversation, or feedback, whatever I needed as a result. I looked at what activity or effort was closest to that result and capable of realistically producing it. I then deprioritized or sacrificed nearly all other efforts until I could return to them later.\n\nOne good example of how this helped a lot was that I needed to acquire my target customer. All the efforts and obstacles I was facing in doing so by selling the SaaS product I was building were taking me on a lot of activity and effort that couldn’t directly result in talking to a prospect and acquiring them as a customer. So, I decided to spin up a marketing agency that offered just a few specific and related services that I had experience fulfilling as a freelancer. I knew that my target customer for the SaaS product was already often actively shopping for and spending money on these services.\n\nI quickly built out the agency website, branding, and messaging, but I only used what I had already worked on for the SaaS product and just shifted it slightly to fit for a marketing service offer instead of the SaaS product. I was able to get some quick traction, generate some much-needed income, and actually acquire my target customer for the SaaS product by offering them a specialized and focused service that was low-cost, had a short sales cycle, and aligned with their existing spending.\n\nThis way, I was still working closely with my target customer, learning a lot that I could transfer over to the SaaS product. I prioritized what I had to do and put the SaaS product just a little on the back burner for a couple of months. After two to three months and a handful of sales, things were much more stable. I then picked back up the SaaS product after stopping all acquisition efforts using the agency/service offer. Well, by this time, I had already learned quite a bit of valuable feedback that I could use to improve the SaaS product I had created. I made a few adjustments before successfully onboarding half of the four total service clients I had worked with onto the SaaS product. The service and SaaS product weren’t directly related but were relevant to the same decision-maker and were designed to be used within the marketing department.\n\nSince then, I’ve been essentially alternating between the services approach and the SaaS approach as needed and as I can to maintain overall stability while simultaneously advancing both efforts.\n\nI’ve noticed that many others, either intentionally or unintentionally, practice a similar approach of offering multiple products or approaches or even business models in an integrated or complementary manner. These usually consist of something that they could succeed with more easily for one reason or another, which they then paired with something that required overcoming significantly larger obstacles or was simply unproven and required a longer runway and testing to figure out. In my opinion, both approaches succeeded in enabling them to pursue something they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to or at least not at the same level of effort and time. In many cases, they eventually transitioned all their efforts to the initially more challenging goal, which, in the long run, had a much higher overall ROI.\n\nI don’t have enough experience with this combined strategy to say how often or how difficult it is to implement, but I can say that it’s working for me. I’ve seen enough evidence of others executing similar strategies that I’m confident it’s not unique to me that it’s been successful.\n\nI hope this triggers an idea or inspires a strategy that can work for your situation. If you’d like to delve into any of the deeper details or need some help finding an angle like this for your situation, feel free to send me a direct message. Good luck!",

We got to \\~300 users and \\~$4k revenue - I know, rookie numbers, but it was my first startup.\n\nThe dynamic was tough. He's more experienced on the technical side and constantly questioned my effort as the business co-founder. After a while it just wore me down. Hard to stay motivated when you're getting criticized all the time, not seeing results, and feeling blocked at every turn.\n\nWe've agreed to basically kill the company. The only thing he offered was to give me the code on a USB stick \"in case I want to do something with it.\" No knowledge transfer, nothing - he said he never got one either when he inherited part of the codebase when we received the MVP from the Devshop.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here with mixed feelings. Frustrated, but also kind of relieved I don't have to work with him anymore. Part of me wonders if I could've pushed harder, but honestly by the end I was just checked out.\n\nThe product is a fully functional MVP. I'm not sure if it's worth trying to continue solo, pivot to something else, or just walk away entirely.\n\nFor those who've been through something similar - what did you do? Is it worth trying to revive something when you're the non-technical founder holding a USB stick of code, requiring a new CTO to build something we never reached real PMF with? ",

Even if messy, you need version control before making any changes.\n\n  \n2. Use an AI coding agent to walk through the codebase with you. Ask it questions like: what does this app do, what are the main components, how do I run it locally, what is the deployment setup. You can have a conversation about your own code without needing to read every file.\n\n  \n3. Get it running locally before thinking about continuing or pivoting. Understanding the current state is step one.\n\n  \nThe fact that you have revenue and users means you already proved there is something there. 300 users and 4k in revenue is not nothing. Most products die before they ever get a paying customer.\n\n  \nOn the relationship side: sometimes the best thing that happens is removing friction from a partnership that was not working. You learned what you do not want in a cofounder next time.\n\n  \nIf you decide to continue, consider finding a technical advisor or fractional CTO before jumping into a new full cofounder relationship. Someone who can help you understand what you have and make a plan, without the commitment risk.\n\n  \nGood luck either way.",

Mostly cold outreach and personal contacts to onboard creators. Demand side was mostly fans who found us through those creators. No real organic flywheel yet.\n\n**Paying users month over month?** Lumpy, not a clean curve. Dependent on which creators were active, not consistent marketplace growth.\n\n**Free to paid migration?** No tiers to test this - we were commission-based (% of each transaction). I wanted to test subscriptions but we split before I could implement it.\n\n**What was I doing?** GTM strategy, scraping leads, building outreach systems, pitching growth ideas. Some got implemented, a lot got shot down by my co-founder as \"not end-to-end\" before we could test them. That friction slowed things down.\n\n**Honest assessment:** You're right that these aren't strong viability signals.

Early on you interpret every wobble as “the startup is dying,” later it’s more like “I’m tired, the funnel is soft this week, and I need to run the next experiment.” What helped me was treating emotions like weather and building “boring” scaffolding that doesn’t care how I feel: weekly metrics review, decision log, and one or two people who can reality check me. The repetition doesn’t disappear, it just becomes less personal once you’ve got enough history to prove you’ve been here before and kept moving.",

Like how could you even know if there's more to business? Do you read all business journals yearly, or at least the entrepreneurship ones? \n\nIntellectual honesty and self awareness go a long way in business. Your beliefs shape whether you look into those things you've mentioned or stop at \"connections and wealth\" = success or \"pour money into marketing\" = guaranteed big business or even \"i understand everything about cashflow\" = I know everything about business.",

You can have the best intentions in the world, be willing to pivot to anything, and still miss it.  You may simply not be good at discerning what PMF is.  Your customers may not know what they actually want.  You may hit the product right but the customers are on another time frame.  You may be so busy trying to find PMF that you constantly jump to a new solution, never going deep enough on one to see if it works.  And, of course, you may run out of money.  I've seen all of those first hand.\n\nI've never seen pure ego cause a failure.  I've heard of it.  I believe in it.  But it's minor.\n\nEgo is part of the puzzle, but it's only a part and a relatively small one.  Most people get over ego fast when they realize that their ego is going to be bruised in a bigger way when they fail.  Or their co-founders boot them.  Or investors turf them out. \n\n",

Met the co-founders through a mutual connection early in my career, jumped in because it seemed like a killer learning opp at this stage.But damn, we're not aligned at all anymore. Moves feel desperate just to scrape by and raise enough cash to stay afloat.\n\nEveryone's learning on the fly—capabilities grow with time and hustle, so we don't need rockstar pros day one. We just need diligent folks who grind out solutions. Fair enough... but it's total bullshit how this only applies to their team, not mine. I don't trash-talk or lowball anyone on my squad, but I'm constantly under fire for timelines while they get a pass.\n\n I'm skilled enough to know when shit's unrealistic, but that doesn't matter.Now I feel straight-up like an employee in my own startup. Don't wanna turn into one of those ego-fueled assholes like Bhavish Aggarwal that every Indian founder seems to idolize. \n\nThe zero empathy and constant blame game is making everything toxic and unfulfilling as hell. To even get heard, I gotta play their game and turn into the same dick.Blaming the team for leadership's competence gaps ain't right. I'm the only one owning my fuck-ups openly (at least publicly), but they won't. \n\nMentally, I'm back in notice-period hell, eyeing the exit.Anyone been here? How'd you decide to bounce without torching your rep, future funding rounds, or job prospects? Tips on smooth exits or better startup ops to jump into next? I need to learn things I missed here and if this is very common I definitely need to learn how to mitigate this, so I feel it's time to work closely with seasoned entrepreneur and not the type my current co-founders are.

Feeling like an employee usually shows up when decision rights, accountability, and ownership were never made explicit, or stopped being respected as the company got stressed. Early stage teams vary a lot here, and cash pressure tends to surface the worst versions of existing dynamics rather than create new ones. The question I would ask is whether there is any realistic path to resetting how decisions and blame are handled, or whether the pattern is now locked in. If it is the latter, staying longer rarely fixes it and often just normalizes behavior you do not want to carry forward. A clean exit usually comes from being boring and factual, framing it as misalignment on execution and leadership style, documenting handoffs, and avoiding moral arguments. Most experienced founders recognize this story more than they admit, and it usually hurts less to leave than to slowly burn out while still technically in charge.",

I have seen exits go cleanest when people document their scope, deliverables, and decision history before making any move. It keeps things factual and reduces the emotional rewriting later. If leadership refuses to own gaps, that culture rarely flips without a major reset.

But there was this constant undercurrent of my team being held to different standards than theirs. I would flag unrealistic timelines and get treated like I was making excuses while they missed their own deadlines with zero accountability.\n\nThe turning point for me was realizing I was spending more energy managing the cofounders feelings than I was building the actual product. That ratio tells you everything you need to know.\n\nHeres what I wish I had done differently: left sooner and with a clearer head. Instead I waited until I was so burned out that my exit was messy and emotional. I said things I regret. I left equity on the table because I just wanted to be done.\n\nPractical advice for your exit:\n\n1. Document everything now. Every decision, every timeline, every commitment that was missed. Not to use as ammunition but to protect yourself if things get ugly later.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before you tell your cofounders. Understand your equity situation, your vesting cliff, and what happens to your shares if you leave. This conversation costs a few hundred dollars and can save you hundreds of thousands.\n\n3. When you do tell them, keep it short and professional. \"I have decided to move on\" is enough. Dont explain, dont justify, dont give them material to argue with. The conversation you want to have about why wont change anything.\n\nThe fact that you are writing this post means you already know the answer. You just need someone to tell you its okay to leave something you helped build.",

      "text": "A lot of people keep asking how to chose or find a co-founder. I have had my fair share of this issue with 3 startups and how to find a co-founder. Twice I needed to find a business acumen co-founder as I am a techie myself and a third time I needed a very highly capable tech co-founder as the idea and the product had grown beyond my tech capabilities. Let me tell you what all went wrong.\n\n\n\n1. First startup: I knew I needed someone who could raise funds for the company which requires very special skills and hence looked in my network, found someone whom I did not know personally but was a heck of a person in story telling (which is the most important aspect when it comes to fund raising). We worked together for almost 18 months and I realised that my co-founder was acting more like a PE fund manager who needed a cut in the funds he/she raised. I got a realisation that I had made the wrong choice as the person was not a company-first thought person but ‘what is in it for me’ person. I have nothing against people who think of their gains before company gains, but as a cofounder it has to be a commitment to the company first approach. The company I sold hastily as I knew we were not going anywhere so thank god it was not completely futile.\n2. Second Startup: I joined hands with a person whom I knew for more than a decade so this time I knew that I am working with someone whom I trust. However, slowly I realised that we were not aligned on ethics. While, for me everything is wither white or black, for him everything was grey and he operated like that only. He would make commitments which we could not fulfil, he would tell numbers that were not true or realistic. However, he was faring well and the company started to do phenomenal. I would go to office every day, make lies to truth, work on hiding actual numbers, create hypothetical scenarios and mark them as reality… This continued to 8-10 months when one fine day I just gave up and relinquished my 47% equity and moved on as I could not handle lying each day. The company has done well and is a household name now.\n3. Third Startup: I needed a tech co-founder who knew more than I did and I moved to a business role (learnings from the two startups helped). From day 0 we connected (while we had not spent more than 2 hours together before I offered him the co-founder role) and worked in unison. While everyone said that co-founders need to have difference of opinion, we seldom did. We reached a state where we would complete each other’s sentences. The company has been doing well (not a unicorn but we are well known now) and we still operate in the same manner.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I realised in the last 13 years, when you are looking for a co-founder… Remember there has to be a compatibility on VALUES. If your values are not aligned, never work together. While we are very very careful in choosing a life partner, we need to be equally careful (if not more) in choosing our co-founder. This is the reason why I have taken the approach that even when hiring, I look for values alignment rather than quantification or capability. I am happy to hire or work with a person who is 8/10 on capability and 10/10 on values alignment vs 8/10 on values alignment and 10/10 on capabilities.",

Walking away from 47% equity takes serious conviction.\n\nWhat I've seen reinforce your point: values misalignment often doesn't surface until there's real pressure - when you're low on runway, when a big customer makes unreasonable demands, when you have to fire someone. That's when the \"grey area\" mindset reveals itself.\n\nCurious about your third startup - how did you assess values alignment after only 2 hours together? Was it intuition, specific conversations, or something else? Most frameworks focus on skills and network, but I rarely see practical advice on how to actually test for values fit before committing.",

Cue 01: We got stuck in traffic and hence by the time we reached the restaurant, both of us were really really hungry but the restaurant was packed to capacity. So we waiting almost 15 mins to get a place. Even though we were hungry, we still remained calm and waited patiently (not asking the guy at the entry every 5 mins on how much time would it take)…. This clearly showed that the person had a major requirement in a startup ‘patience’… After all, in a startup you need to be patient (at least this is what I feel)\n2. Cue 02: The waiter got our orders wrong (may be he brought something which was ordered by another table). We were hungry and realising that our order was wrong, it was frustrating. When he called the waiter politely and said that our orders were wrong, the waiter apologised and took away the dishes from our table. I asked him, you did not get angry at the waiter? He said… No point getting angry at someone for a mistake… I am sure he did not do it purposely. This clearly showed how he would handle the team (I already had a team of 12 developers) and understand every person’s perspective.\n3. Cue 03: We were talking at length and discussed about family, kids, parents and a lot more… I could see that he thought in the same way about relationships the way I did\n\n\n\nIn all, we did not discuss the startup for more than 5 mins, but we knew we would click together if we worked together.

So many things can be wrong, but firstly I don't think you're getting a fair split, secondly 17 months with zero users is a terrible sign. Not sure if they're PE backed, or if it's bootstrapped but that's a pretty poor sign in the co-founders that either they don't recognize the problem isn't worth solving, or they never put this in front of people. I would seriously consider parting ways, or making something yourself.

That’s no small feat!\n\nFrom what you’re describing, it seems like you might be experiencing the classic challenges of scaling a startup. One thing I’ve seen work well in similar situations is focusing on getting user feedback early and often, even after the MVP launch. It can help you identify what features are truly essential and what users are craving. Sometimes, gathering feedback through surveys or direct interviews can reveal insights that you might not have considered.\n\nAlso, consider setting up a clear roadmap for your product development. Prioritize features based on user needs and potential impact. It might help to involve your junior developers in this process - it could lighten your load and empower them to take ownership of smaller projects.\n\nI’ve been in a similar boat and ended up building something to help founders like us streamline the whole MVP process. If you’re ever curious about tactics that helped me along the way, feel free to ask!",

          "text": "This is a very common problem for new founders, so don't be to harsh on yourself. Like most have said here, this is a distribution problem and very obvious one. \n\nBefore moving onto what to do next let's correctly diagnose the situation. Your biggest pinpoint so far isn't that you haven't gotten sales it is that the product has been enriched without any user feedback, meaning that you more than probably have spent a year and half building for users that don't exist. That is not say that some parts of your product/platform isn't salvageable but it definitely needs to be cut down. \n\nSecondly, after removing all the fancy stuff, it's your non-technical cofounders responsibility to organize a cohort of power users to use your product and guide you on what to focus on with their feedback. Please note not to follow the norms of removing all the frictions from sign up. Your power users must be willing to pay for your solution or else their feedback will most likely be useless and again funnel you to build out the wrong feature with there feedback. Your ICP, if it is actually your ICP, must be willing to pay or else move on to someone else\n\nThirdly, this is more of future advice, always presell your solution before moving any step in building it out. Unless your a seasoned founder, well back monetarily, your building within the short term to survive and hopefully thrive as your product progresses. As opposed to said seasoned founder who builds for demand that doesn't exist today but for the future. \n\nIf you and the co-founder have chemistry and work well together, which in my opinion is far more important then anything else, use this as a learning experience and keep working together. I would go back to the drawing boards whether it is for your current product or any other ones and focus on distribution first. \n\n  \nHere is a dumbed down pipeline: Presell -> Insight Data -> Build -> Launch -> Distribute to presolds aka cohort 1 -> Feedback -> Iterate -> Distribute (repeat step 6-8 until your desired outcome).\n\n  \nBonus: Stop with the fundraising crap. Unless you come from target backgrounds without a validated product no one will give you a second look. Time is of the essence and the speed you go through the pipeline decides whether your a winner. \n\n  \nBonus Bonus: Perfection is the enemy of progress, ship until your fingers bleed, let the users tell you what they like and don't like",

Before that I had been freelancing for roughly 10 years. I dropped almost all my freelance clients to focus on building this company.\n\nThe agreement back then:\n\n\\-minimum 4 days a week\n\n\\-reduced day rate compared to my normal freelance rate\n\n\\-1.6% equity, 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff\n\n\\-part of the core team\n\nThat setup made sense to me because it combined stability with long-term upside.\n\nRecently the company raised funding. Not long after that, I was told they want to change the setup.\n\nWhat they’re proposing now:\n\n\\-hire a senior developer\n\n\\-change my role and move me to project-based freelance\n\n\\-stop future vesting\n\n\\-reassign my remaining unvested 0.8% equity to the new hire\n\n\\-I keep the 0.8% that already vested\n\nThe reasoning is that as the company grows and responsibilities shift, equity should be aligned with the roles that carry the next phase of responsibility. The idea is that equity distribution needs to evolve with the business.\n\nMy issue is that this was never stated in the original agreement. There’s nothing in the contracts or emails saying equity is tied to holding a specific role or that it could be reduced if the company later hires someone more senior.\n\nI didn’t initiate the role change. I’m still contributing value and I’m open to continuing. But the proposal effectively moves me from a stable, equity-based position back to freelance, with no guarantees, while giving up half of the future equity that was part of why I committed in the first place. \n\nThey are still very happy with me and I basically self learned all the new emerging tech and build it for the company in the past 2 years. That they still use daily for all their core productions and this tech also reeled in a very good amount of big enterprise clients often commenting about the good quality of the output. but it was all self learned not perfect workflows but it got us there. Now they’ve got the cash to hire someone that has way more experience in this and bring my tech to the next level. \n\nThey’ve suggested a “clean” outcome where I keep what’s vested, maybe get a few extra months of vesting, and then continue on a project basis. I understand the business logic behind wanting flexibility and senior expertise, but from my side this feels like a big shift compared to what I signed up for. \n\nWould appreciate honest opinions.\n\nThanks.",

IMO it’s unfair that they pretend to make you pay for what they now consider a mistake (giving you 1.6%) since that allowance was ment to get them 2 things: \n- Value from your work that they couldn’t pay otherwise and \n- Medium term commitment (at least 4 years) from you\n\nThey have gotten both so far and you are willing to keep your end of the deal (keep providing value, even if it is not enough now, and being there for the agreed term) so they should keep theirs.\n\nI’m sure they are being pressured and told to recover as much as they can and they have felt how their stake has shrunk after getting an external investment, but fighting you for 0.8% from your stake when you helped build what they have now shows their true colors. It might make financial sense, but it doesn’t make human sense and speaks a lot about who they are. \n\nI’m not an expert, but I would recommend that you lawyer up and stick to the original deal, and get out as soon as your shares are fully vested, doesn’t sound like a great place to be after this.

A role change that reduces influence or career trajectory should come with a renegotiation, not just a new org chart. If they’re vague or it’s “same equity, less say,” that’s a signal.\n\n\n\nI’d frame the conversation around outcomes and alignment, not feelings: “I’m open to adjusting to what the company needs post-funding, but I need clarity on scope, decision rights, and how I’m being valued. If I’m moving from X to Y, let’s adjust title/level/comp/equity to match.” If they won’t put it in writing, treat it as not real. And quietly start networking/interviewing anyway... best case it gives you confidence, worst case it gives you options.

You can learn that shit in a single afternoon.\n\nThe difficult part is knowing who you're selling to, knowing their very specific pain points, and convincing them that your product is the best solution to those problems. If you know how to do that, you just have to hire creators to execute on your vision and the rest is honestly pretty simple.\n\nThe catch is, this isn't something that just *anyone* can do. The best creative strategist is gonna fail horribly if your product is shit, which applies to probably 95% of the shit that gets spammed in r/SaaS and the like.\n\nYour first initial creatives is probably gonna suck, but if you have a genuinely good product you will get *some* sales. You might not get a positive ROI on your ad spend right away but it won't ALL be a loss, so consider that your tuition fee / learning tax. From there it's just a matter of refining your positioning and improving your creatives (and of course your product).",

Their users become your distribution. This is basically renting their trust.\n\n3. **\"Watering hole\" strategy** - Your ICP hangs out somewhere specific.

Things like targeting a particular workflow pain where users naturally talk to each other, or building something that replaces an existing manual process and spreads inside a team. A lot of solo builders underestimate how much “distribution” can come from narrow positioning and clear use cases, even with small absolute numbers. the hard part is that this usually forces tougher product constraints and slower iteration early on. It also means killing ideas that are fun to build but have no natural path to being discovered.

These days I can do a similar thing, run 30$ a day to validate an idea and it works. - only thing that has changed dramatically is the creative , having good ad content makes this possible (learn how to do basic design + video editing helps tremendously)\n\nSecond thing I can say is start planting the seed, I think Alex Hormozi has some incredible material, the full 100m$ leads video course on youtube is gold!\n\nI would study the hell out of lead generation and lead magnets, defining your funnel and what channels are you using to push people further down the funnel, you are B2C - i would even explore B2B2C options and launch cold email campaigns to other business that already have your buyers, giving a % of sales that come from them (example a mortgage brokerage partners with real estate agencies to facilitate their buyers mortgages, gives the agency a 10-20% kick back)\n\nIt’s really exciting, understanding the psychology of it all is when the matrix unlocks - once you see it you can never un-see it. 🙂",

Classic \"nice to have\" vs \"need to have\" problem.\n\nThe most frustrating part is that our rewards are competitive, UX is clean, support is fast. But when someone gets a new card from us, they don't bother updating it everywhere… Netflix, Amazon, DoorDash, etc. So we never become the daily driver.\n\nI've been looking at solutions to reduce friction but everything adds complexity.

          "text": "We had the same problem at a fintech I advised last year. Spent like 6 months trying different approaches because this \"second card syndrome\" was killing our economics.\nFirst we tried the obvious stuff: push notifications reminding people to update merchants, in app prompts after card activation, even gamification with reward points for each merchant they switched. Conversion was maybe 12%. Too much friction.\nWhat actually worked was integrating a card switching API. We tested a couple. There's some legacy players in the card on file space, but they're clunky and expensive. Ended up going with Knot because their API was clean, merchant coverage was solid (hit like 80% of our users' top merchants), and the security model made sense. Everything's encrypted, PCI compliant, we never touch raw card data.\nRolled it out as an optional onboarding step. \"Update your card everywhere in 30 seconds\" kind of pitch. Adoption was around 65% and we saw spend per card jump almost 3x within the first quarter for users who completed the switch. Turns out when your card is actually saved everywhere, people use it.\nThe integration took maybe 3 or 4 weeks with their SDK. Biggest pain point was honestly just the webhook handling and convincing my team this would work well. But compared to the alternatives it was a no brainer.\nHappy to share more details if you want to DM. This problem is solvable, just need the right tooling.",

          "text": "You might be over-indexing on “better product” when what you’re really up against is inertia plus category-level trust. Chase/Amex aren’t winning because their apps are prettier, they’re winning because they’re the card people already have on file everywhere, they have perceived reliability for big/important purchases, and they’ve trained users that “something will go wrong eventually, and I want the issuer with the most leverage when it does.” Competitive rewards and fast support are table stakes, but they don’t create a forcing function to change defaults.\n\n\n\nIf you want wallet share, you need a reason to rewire habits, not just a nicer place to spend. A few pragmatic levers: (1) Pick one or two specific “daily driver” categories and be meaningfully better there (not 1 percent, more like “I’m leaving money on the table if I don’t use this”), then message that relentlessly. (2) Make switching feel like a one-time project with a clear payoff: an in-app “move my bills” checklist, pre-filled instructions, reminders, and a time-boxed accelerator (for example, “set us as default for 5 merchants and spend $X in 30 days to unlock Y”). (3) Reduce the fear of missing a payment: alerts for declined recurring charges, a grace period where you reimburse late fees caused by switching, and proactive “your Netflix charge is coming up, want to update?” nudges. People don’t avoid updating cards because it’s hard, they avoid it because it’s annoying and high-stakes.\n\n\n\nAlso worth asking whether “becoming the daily driver everywhere” is the right hill to die on. Some successful fintechs win by owning a narrow, frequent use case (one category, one behavior) and expanding from there, instead of trying to displace the incumbent’s entire spend graph at once. If you can identify the moment users feel your card is uniquely necessary (travel, subscriptions, groceries, budgeting, credit building, whatever your wedge is), you can build default behavior around that and let the rest follow.",

Just in front of people who actually know what they’re doing.\n\nMy hands were shaking, I rushed through half my slides, and I’m pretty sure my voice cracked at one point… But I talked about the product, why I started it, and why I still believe it can work, even after all the mistakes so far. Didn’t “win” anything big, just $8K as initial funding. Didn’t get applause. But I walked off feeling like: okay, I did it once. I can do it again. Small win, but it mattered more than I expected.\n\nIf you’re a student sitting on an idea and waiting for it to be “perfect” before talking about it, this is your sign to just say it out loud once.",

          "text": "Congrats on getting your first pitch through! For first timers, it's a huge step and sitting on the other side of the table, I'll give you a few things we like to see from companies that pitch to us to get funding that should help you feel a bit better and raise your chances of success.\n\nWhen you pitch your project, explain it in one sentence and then build on it. For example, if your project is about dropshipping, it might sound like this: \"My dropshipping business finds products faster and cheaper by searching multiple suppliers.\" A super rudimentary pitch, though hopefully it gives you a better idea of how it should sound in a one-sentence method. This should also be a bit of a guideline for you on how to tackle each section of your extended pitch. If you're talking about competition and showing slides, the one sentence version could be: \"Our competitors are X, Y, Z, and we stand out by having a previously successful team, improved infrastructure, and higher quality products in our company.\" Again, one sentence, then expand on those points. Using the one-sentence method also forces you to slow down and be clear and concise.\n\nSomething we tell companies is that once you do your pitch, stop pitching. It can be annoying when a company finishes its pitch and keeps going. In other words, they can't stop selling their product. If you've pitched and then have to add more information afterward, it means you didn't pitch well enough to start. Here's how we hear it:\n\nClient: We have a coffee mug company with a unique handle that changes how liquids are kept warm.\n\nUs: Sounds great, we'll be in touch after we look at your deck\n\nClient: Oh, and it also has a new feature, X, that we're working on to gain more market share.\n\nUs: Sure, we'll message you when we've looked into the project a bit further.\n\nClient: Yes, and I wanted to tell you about the cup's innovative material that we're developing...  \n  \nYou can see how being on the other side of the table can get annoying, and eventually the funding source might tune you out. As great as your project is, you need to show how awesome you would be to work with. Not being annoying, being organized, clear and timely communication can sometimes be more important than the pitch itself. Think of how many other dropshipping companies are out there, but if you're the one they want to keep talking to and don't feel like it's painful to pick up the phone to say hello, it can go a long way.\n\nTake some time and consider what things would look like if the positions were reversed. Imagine you were the company hearing the pitch and deciding whether to invest in it. What would you want to hear? What would you like to see from the client? What are the key items that would make you go \"Yes, this is something I want to put money in!\"? Most founders fall into the trap of seeing it from their own perspective and fail to consider the other side.\n\nGood luck with the next pitch!",

Hands shaking, talking too fast, losing my place.

It still needs that USP. It still needs that network and structure and plan for how to reach, engage, and keep, the audience enough for them to redirect their attention towards your project.\n\nSo how are you going to create that foundation with these 5 first guests that are randoms from r/Startups rather than at least somewhat established names that can make people pay attention to what you're trying to build?",

Loans - if you ever plan to take funding you cannot take out a loan. These loans have to be disclosed as part of Due Diligence and no one is going to invest in a company with large outstanding loans. This is called “throwing money in a debt hole”. If fundraising is your plan, do that from the start of needing money. You can take out loans when profitable for specific projects, but not before profitability. \n\n2. Taking too much money - every industry has their story of a company that took hundreds of millions and was out of business two years later. Take what you need to get to the next round and no more. Reason 1 is that you need to remain hungry. Get to relaxed and fat and you lose steam and the company doesn’t compete. Reason 2 is you need to go up on valuation each round. If you have a lower valuation in a round it is called a “down round” and that will pretty much kill your fundraising chances in the future.\n\nAvoid those. But otherwise enjoy!

Turns out it was from a real user who found the \"contact us\" button I’d totally forgotten about. They reached out to ask for a feature and also told me they were liking the app.\n\nThis one random email ended up being way more useful than I expected. Here’s what I got out of it:\n\n* **Figured out how they found the app** (through the App Store search, which I hadn’t even thought about).\n* **Learned about a feature I was missing.**\n* **Now I have a direct line to a real user** for more feedback.\n\nI’m planning to set up a simple page on my site to track user requests, bugs, feature ideas, and support stuff so I don’t lose track of them. I also plan to keep talking to this user to see how they actually use the app\n\nIf you’re building something, add a way for users to reach you. It’s worth it.",

      "text": "This is a half business half career advice question, and I hope it's okay for me to post here.\n\nI’m a CS grad/musician, and for the past few months, I've been building a web DAW with integrated video chat. There are other web DAW + video chat apps out there, but mine has a slightly different approach.\n\nI am treating the app as a startup. I've been working on it for mostly 14+ hours a day for months. I want to host the product on its own website, make premium features, etc. I'd absolutely love for this startup to be my job, but I need money, and creative tools are hard to monetize. So I'm looking for my first software job right now, with this project being a passion project that I'd work on the side if I got a job.\n\nThe issue is that it's a brutal market, and I have no internships. So I need to show employers and potential employers evidence that I know how to write clean, maintainable code. This app is my best work.\n\nSo what exactly are the risks of open sourcing my project? I was thinking an AGPLv3 license; I dont care if people run it locally, I could live with small companies or users used it in their open source products, but I could make larger closed-sourced apps pay to license my app (which is a theoretical possibility - my app is a small recorder that could be plopped into another app). I can still run it as my own service.\n\nI see two risks: 1) someone just outright takes my service as their own, which I have heard that in practice doesn't really happen? and 2) security risks, which since I'm a noob with no professional experience, is very possible that I'd make a mistake, especially since I was also planning on using cloud services + webrtc, and I really can't afford a high bill.\n\nI also don't really know how much value I'd be getting career-wise by open sourcing.",

The copyleft nature means anyone using it in a hosted service needs to share their changes too, which protects you while still being open.\n\n  \nOn your two concerns:\n\n  \n1. Someone stealing your service - in practice this almost never happens. Running a service takes effort, marketing, customer support. The people who would clone your project are rarely the same people who would build a real business around it. Your edge is that you are the creator, you know the vision, you can ship faster.\n\n  \n2. Security risks - this is actually a benefit of open source. More eyes on code means bugs get found faster. Just dont hardcode secrets and use environment variables for all sensitive config. Standard stuff.\n\n  \nThe career value is real. Being able to point to a production codebase you built shows employers you can ship. Open source contributions get noticed. Some of my best opportunities came from people finding my GitHub.\n\n  \nOne thing to consider: you can start with a private repo and open source later once you feel more confident about the code quality. No rush.\n\n  \nGood luck with the web DAW. Music tools are a great space to build in.",

What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

The other half, you catch assumptions that only survive happy-path testing.\n\nDatabase queries are the sneakiest.
