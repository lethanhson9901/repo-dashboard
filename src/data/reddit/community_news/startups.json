Met the co-founders through a mutual connection early in my career, jumped in because it seemed like a killer learning opp at this stage.But damn, we're not aligned at all anymore. Moves feel desperate just to scrape by and raise enough cash to stay afloat.\n\nEveryone's learning on the fly—capabilities grow with time and hustle, so we don't need rockstar pros day one. We just need diligent folks who grind out solutions. Fair enough... but it's total bullshit how this only applies to their team, not mine. I don't trash-talk or lowball anyone on my squad, but I'm constantly under fire for timelines while they get a pass.\n\n I'm skilled enough to know when shit's unrealistic, but that doesn't matter.Now I feel straight-up like an employee in my own startup. Don't wanna turn into one of those ego-fueled assholes like Bhavish Aggarwal that every Indian founder seems to idolize. \n\nThe zero empathy and constant blame game is making everything toxic and unfulfilling as hell. To even get heard, I gotta play their game and turn into the same dick.Blaming the team for leadership's competence gaps ain't right. I'm the only one owning my fuck-ups openly (at least publicly), but they won't. \n\nMentally, I'm back in notice-period hell, eyeing the exit.Anyone been here? How'd you decide to bounce without torching your rep, future funding rounds, or job prospects? Tips on smooth exits or better startup ops to jump into next? I need to learn things I missed here and if this is very common I definitely need to learn how to mitigate this, so I feel it's time to work closely with seasoned entrepreneur and not the type my current co-founders are.

Really nobody cares about the reputation, the world is a big place.  Your experience, knowledge, ambition and successes are most of it. \n\nOne warning, it's extremely difficult to find the perfect fit that doesn't end up in the same situation you're already in.  One fact I've come to accept (for me) is that once I lose faith in a company/team, there is nothing that is going to fix that, The best action is to not wait, start looking for something new.

Besides the emotional and physical damage I endured, after I left, the company failed. I learned a lot in the role and the experience, I gained accelerated my growth and skills.

You just havent admitted it yet.\n\nI had a cofounder situation that sounds similar. Not toxic in the obvious way. Nobody was yelling. But there was this constant undercurrent of my team being held to different standards than theirs. I would flag unrealistic timelines and get treated like I was making excuses while they missed their own deadlines with zero accountability.\n\nThe turning point for me was realizing I was spending more energy managing the cofounders feelings than I was building the actual product. That ratio tells you everything you need to know.\n\nHeres what I wish I had done differently: left sooner and with a clearer head. Instead I waited until I was so burned out that my exit was messy and emotional. I said things I regret. I left equity on the table because I just wanted to be done.\n\nPractical advice for your exit:\n\n1. Document everything now. Every decision, every timeline, every commitment that was missed. Not to use as ammunition but to protect yourself if things get ugly later.\n\n2. Talk to a lawyer before you tell your cofounders. Understand your equity situation, your vesting cliff, and what happens to your shares if you leave. This conversation costs a few hundred dollars and can save you hundreds of thousands.\n\n3. When you do tell them, keep it short and professional. \"I have decided to move on\" is enough. Dont explain, dont justify, dont give them material to argue with. The conversation you want to have about why wont change anything.\n\nThe fact that you are writing this post means you already know the answer. You just need someone to tell you its okay to leave something you helped build.",

          "text": "This sounds less like a motivation problem and more like a governance and expectations problem. Feeling like an employee usually shows up when decision rights, accountability, and ownership were never made explicit, or stopped being respected as the company got stressed. Early stage teams vary a lot here, and cash pressure tends to surface the worst versions of existing dynamics rather than create new ones. The question I would ask is whether there is any realistic path to resetting how decisions and blame are handled, or whether the pattern is now locked in. If it is the latter, staying longer rarely fixes it and often just normalizes behavior you do not want to carry forward. A clean exit usually comes from being boring and factual, framing it as misalignment on execution and leadership style, documenting handoffs, and avoiding moral arguments. Most experienced founders recognize this story more than they admit, and it usually hurts less to leave than to slowly burn out while still technically in charge.",

Misalignment around accountability and empathy only gets louder under pressure, especially when cash is tight. I have seen exits go cleanest when people document their scope, deliverables, and decision history before making any move. It keeps things factual and reduces the emotional rewriting later. If leadership refuses to own gaps, that culture rarely flips without a major reset. Leaving without burning bridges is less about being quiet and more about being consistent and professional on the way out. Also worth reflecting on what you would screen for harder next time, especially around how founders handle blame and stress.",

When I’ve seen founders navigate this, a few things helped: **Document everything clearly**: timelines, agreements, contributions.

      "text": "A lot of people keep asking how to chose or find a co-founder. I have had my fair share of this issue with 3 startups and how to find a co-founder. Twice I needed to find a business acumen co-founder as I am a techie myself and a third time I needed a very highly capable tech co-founder as the idea and the product had grown beyond my tech capabilities. Let me tell you what all went wrong.\n\n\n\n1. First startup: I knew I needed someone who could raise funds for the company which requires very special skills and hence looked in my network, found someone whom I did not know personally but was a heck of a person in story telling (which is the most important aspect when it comes to fund raising). We worked together for almost 18 months and I realised that my co-founder was acting more like a PE fund manager who needed a cut in the funds he/she raised. I got a realisation that I had made the wrong choice as the person was not a company-first thought person but ‘what is in it for me’ person. I have nothing against people who think of their gains before company gains, but as a cofounder it has to be a commitment to the company first approach. The company I sold hastily as I knew we were not going anywhere so thank god it was not completely futile.\n2. Second Startup: I joined hands with a person whom I knew for more than a decade so this time I knew that I am working with someone whom I trust. However, slowly I realised that we were not aligned on ethics. While, for me everything is wither white or black, for him everything was grey and he operated like that only. He would make commitments which we could not fulfil, he would tell numbers that were not true or realistic. However, he was faring well and the company started to do phenomenal. I would go to office every day, make lies to truth, work on hiding actual numbers, create hypothetical scenarios and mark them as reality… This continued to 8-10 months when one fine day I just gave up and relinquished my 47% equity and moved on as I could not handle lying each day. The company has done well and is a household name now.\n3. Third Startup: I needed a tech co-founder who knew more than I did and I moved to a business role (learnings from the two startups helped). From day 0 we connected (while we had not spent more than 2 hours together before I offered him the co-founder role) and worked in unison. While everyone said that co-founders need to have difference of opinion, we seldom did. We reached a state where we would complete each other’s sentences. The company has been doing well (not a unicorn but we are well known now) and we still operate in the same manner.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I realised in the last 13 years, when you are looking for a co-founder… Remember there has to be a compatibility on VALUES. If your values are not aligned, never work together. While we are very very careful in choosing a life partner, we need to be equally careful (if not more) in choosing our co-founder. This is the reason why I have taken the approach that even when hiring, I look for values alignment rather than quantification or capability. I am happy to hire or work with a person who is 8/10 on capability and 10/10 on values alignment vs 8/10 on values alignment and 10/10 on capabilities.",

I passed and he went on to build something successful, but I wouldve burned out trying to keep up with the narrative gymnastics.

So we waiting almost 15 mins to get a place. Even though we were hungry, we still remained calm and waited patiently (not asking the guy at the entry every 5 mins on how much time would it take)…. This clearly showed that the person had a major requirement in a startup ‘patience’… After all, in a startup you need to be patient (at least this is what I feel)\n2. Cue 02: The waiter got our orders wrong (may be he brought something which was ordered by another table). We were hungry and realising that our order was wrong, it was frustrating. When he called the waiter politely and said that our orders were wrong, the waiter apologised and took away the dishes from our table. I asked him, you did not get angry at the waiter? He said… No point getting angry at someone for a mistake… I am sure he did not do it purposely. This clearly showed how he would handle the team (I already had a team of 12 developers) and understand every person’s perspective.\n3. Cue 03: We were talking at length and discussed about family, kids, parents and a lot more… I could see that he thought in the same way about relationships the way I did\n\n\n\nIn all, we did not discuss the startup for more than 5 mins, but we knew we would click together if we worked together.

No thinking about outcomes, just executing the process. Same way you'd write a function, test it, move on.\n\n  \nThe other thing -- the discomfort never fully goes away, but it does get boring. After enough cold outreach or posts that flop, your nervous system just stops caring as much. The first 20 are brutal. After 100 it's just Tuesday.\n\n  \nOne more thing that made a huge difference: I stopped trying to sell in outreach and started asking questions instead. \"Hey, I'm building X, can I get your take on this?\" People love giving advice. It takes all the pressure off because you're genuinely learning, not performing. And weirdly, those conversations convert way better than any pitch.",

And curiosity isn't draining the way pitching is.\n\n2. **The 10-minute rule** - you don't need to do 4 hours of outreach. You need 10 minutes, 5 days a week. That's 5 conversations. After a month, you've talked to 100+ people. Compounding applies to relationships too.\n\n3. **Build IN distribution channels** - instead of building then distributing, build WHERE your customers already are. Answer questions on Reddit. Comment on LinkedIn posts. Share your process publicly. The building IS the distribution.\n\n4. **The uncomfortable truth** - nobody cares about your product as much as you do. And that's okay. They care about their problem. When you lead with \"here's how I can help with YOUR problem\" instead of \"here's what I built,\" the emotional dynamic completely changes.\n\nWhat are you building?

Also, early stage teams vary a lot in how they think about this. In practice, if you do not close the loop with real users early, you can end up optimizing something elegant that never ships.

Every SaaS runs on AWS or GCP. Every payment startup runs on Stripe. Nobody calls Shopify a Stripe wrapper.\n\n  \nThe reason most wrapper startups died is they were literally just reskinned API access. The model was the product. When OpenAI made ChatGPT better, the wrapper became pointless. That is a real pattern and it will repeat.\n\n  \nBut agent platforms are doing something slightly different. The value proposition is not access to the model, it is the orchestration layer. Managing context across files, handling errors, running multi-step workflows, keeping state between sessions. That stuff is genuinely hard and the model providers have zero incentive to solve it for every niche use case.\n\n  \nThe ones that will die are the ones where the whole pitch is we put Claude in a browser tab. The ones that might survive are the ones building real workflow tools where the model is an ingredient, not the product.\n\n  \nSame pattern as mobile apps in 2010. Thousands of flashlight apps died. The ones that solved real workflow problems on top of the phone hardware became actual businesses.\n\n  \nSo yeah, some of these are wrappers 2.0. But not all of them. The trick is figuring out which ones actually have a workflow moat vs which ones are just banking on setup friction that will disappear in 6 months.",

When I was building my first real venture after a previous failure, I had to get ruthless about separating execution days from strategy days. Like literally on my calendar - Mondays and Fridays were for thinking/planning, Tuesday through Thursday were pure execution mode where questioning the direction was off limits. It sounds rigid but it saved me from that constant mental ping pong between doing and doubting. The other game changer was shrinking my validation timeline - instead of waiting for a \"finished\" product, I started testing core assumptions way earlier with basic prototypes and landing pages. Even getting 10 people to sign up for a waitlist or pay a small pre-order gave me enough signal to quiet that revenue anxiety. The key was making the feedback loop as short as possible, so I wasn't operating in a complete vacuum for months. Also learned to track leading indicators instead of just obsessing over the big outcome - like daily progress on features, weekly user interviews, monthly prototype tests. Gave my brain something concrete to focus on instead of spiraling about hypothetical futures.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.\n\n",

I stopped calling it a launch and started calling it a test. A test can fail and that is fine. A launch feels permanent.\n\n  \n2. I got 3 people to pay me before the product was done. Not a waitlist, actual money (even small amounts). Having someone pay $20 for early access gave me more confidence than 6 months of building alone ever did. It also forced me to talk to real humans which broke the isolation spiral.\n\n  \n3. I set a hard rule: no thinking about the business after 7pm. Sounds impossible but the anxiety feeds on rumination. When I cut the rumination window, the anxiety dropped way more than I expected.\n\n  \nThe overthinking you are describing is not a focus problem. It is a feedback problem. You have zero signal from the real world so your brain fills the gap with worst case scenarios. The fastest fix is getting any signal at all, even negative signal, because at least then you are reacting to reality instead of imagined futures.",

To do this, I need to find strategies, frameworks, etc. that can help with distribution\n\nBut distribution is extremely elusive to me.\n\nThe strategies I see that are obvious:\n\n* Build an audience first on Twitter/LinkedIn/YouTube/IG/TT/etc. (can take months/years)\n* Master paid ads (tough to master before burning serious $ on Meta/Google)\n* Cold outreach (slow, manual)\n* SEO (also takes time)\n\nHow do you handle distribution without becoming a full-time content creator or raising money?\n\n**TL;DR:** Has anyone built sustainable profitable products without a large following or big ad budget? Is there a path that doesn't require 10K followers, burning VC dollars, or becoming an influencer?\n\n**EDIT:** This largely applies to B2C products\n\nCurious what's worked for people who are better at building than marketing - please share your thoughts!",

You don't need 10k followers - you need to show up when the 100 right people are actively looking.\n\n2. **Integration partnerships** - Find products your users already love and offer a complementary integration. Their users become your distribution. This is basically renting their trust.\n\n3. **\"Watering hole\" strategy** - Your ICP hangs out somewhere specific. For a business validation tool, that's probably incubator Slack channels, indie hacker communities, or even the comments section of startup podcasts.

Things like targeting a particular workflow pain where users naturally talk to each other, or building something that replaces an existing manual process and spreads inside a team. A lot of solo builders underestimate how much “distribution” can come from narrow positioning and clear use cases, even with small absolute numbers. the hard part is that this usually forces tougher product constraints and slower iteration early on. It also means killing ideas that are fun to build but have no natural path to being discovered. Curious if any of your projects have users who already congregate somewhere offline or in small communities, which often changes the equation.",

These days I can do a similar thing, run 30$ a day to validate an idea and it works. - only thing that has changed dramatically is the creative , having good ad content makes this possible (learn how to do basic design + video editing helps tremendously)\n\nSecond thing I can say is start planting the seed, I think Alex Hormozi has some incredible material, the full 100m$ leads video course on youtube is gold!\n\nI would study the hell out of lead generation and lead magnets, defining your funnel and what channels are you using to push people further down the funnel, you are B2C - i would even explore B2B2C options and launch cold email campaigns to other business that already have your buyers, giving a % of sales that come from them (example a mortgage brokerage partners with real estate agencies to facilitate their buyers mortgages, gives the agency a 10-20% kick back)\n\nIt’s really exciting, understanding the psychology of it all is when the matrix unlocks - once you see it you can never un-see it. 🙂",

(ex. people are scrolling though your app but not clicking. you can try to improve icon/screenshots/title/subtitle. people don't even see your app: keywords and text may help you on that)\n\n\\- for a reason to create another app is more if you have some opportunity to chase AND if you can leverage and improve upon your previous app, not just about developing fast. if you first app didn't sell anything but you have an idea on how to do it. try a second. if the second didn't reach the 100 sales but you learned something and know how to improve. you go for the next app.\n\n\\- one last thing. you already have 8 apps. from my point of view you have a lot of space to work on. for me feels easy to try to create one screenshot for one, add one content into another then to create an entire app and go through all these apps from 0 again.",

It’s more like a living hypothesis that you keep stress testing against reality. The inputs you listed mission, customer feedback, market dynamics, delivery constraints are exactly the right ones. The trick is not trying to freeze them into something permanent, but giving yourself a structure that helps you decide what matters right now.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work is treating strategy as a lightweight decision filter rather than a roadmap you must defend. Write it down not to be right, but so you can notice when new information actually changes the underlying assumptions versus when it’s just noise. That way, when an email from a prospect shows up, you can ask “does this invalidate our current bet, or is it just one data point?”\n\nThe fact that you’re already capturing where you are, where you’re aiming, and why in something shareable is honestly the hard part. The weekly churn doesn’t mean the strategy failed. It means the document is doing its job by giving the team a common reference point to react to and refine together.",

          "text": "This is an area where many businesses fail, because they chase features that they think excite the target customer but for which these customers wont pay.\n\nYou have two types of features.\n\n1. Features that solve the problems for your target market. As an example, if you were selling an accounting system to customers than ran US only businesses like an ETSY account, the features you need are simple. Tracking income and expenses. You would not then proceed to add support for multiple currencies. Multiple currencies are only needed if you plan to expand your addressable market, i.e., people that sell internationally. So first lesson, understand your target customers and the problems they need solved that they are willing to pay for. Only add features that specifically add value for teh customer and that they are willing to pay for.\n2. Once you have identified the required features for your target market, and you have delivered them, you need to figure out how to grow your market share. You do that, not by adding more cool stuff but by asking how can I improve my customer experience. If we go back to accounting for US businesses that might be, the ability to connect with the business bank account and automatically download and match income and expenses, or even a feature that simplifies expense tracking.\n\nSo ask yourself what am I trying to do\n\nI am trying to grow my market share within my existing market - focus on customer experience  \nI am trying to expand my addressable market - solve the problems for these new target customers\n\nOne more thing. As you consider what features you want to ask, consider when you rank them, how they might improve margins, e.g., if I add this feature that will reduce my COGS by 10%, will that return more profit than a feature that increases my customers by 10%. Or even, if I spend money not on features but quality, will that expense reduce customer churn leading to longer term recurring revenue.\n\nEdit - A comment on strategy\n\nStrategy is\n\nWho is my target audience  \nWhat problems do they need solving  \nWhy will they buy from me and not my competition\n\nIf your strategy contains numbers (increase revenue by 10%, broaden our markey by 20%) it is not a strategy it is a strategic goal. Furthermore if it contains broad statements like - be the world leader in \\[insert industry here\\], it is not a strategy, it is an aspiration.",

Yes, I'd say that's practically a defining feature of startups, relatively speaking.\n\nBut your question is about regressions. \n\nRegressions are accepted as normal in some organizations (Facebook's infamous \"move fast and break things\"), and are considered significant failures in others (Stripe's [zero downtime](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations) comes to mind). \n\nThere are obviously tradeoffs to both approaches--Facebook's users will tolerate bugs for neat features; Stripe's users will **not** tolerate losing money to downtime. \n\n**Regressions are a tech problem caused by a culture problem.** Every mistake is an opportunity to ensure your team never makes the same category of mistake again, but ensuring that the mistake never happens again takes a lot more work than fixing the bug and moving on. \n\nYou will need to accept that your team will move more slowly in the short term, and may have to completely stop adding new features for a while as they clear tech debt. Tech debt increases the chances that something will break in the future. \n\nBut again, this is a culture problem, because you are tolerating regressions, which follows tolerating bad practices. \n\nAI can help a lot. In my own workflow, I try to add automated test coverage as regressions happen to ensure every class of bug does not re-occur. \n\nAlso, you have developer**s**, plural, and no QA/QC staff? Catching this stuff is the job of a QA/QC person. Might consider making that your next hire before asking your devs to test their work more thoroughly. ",

The question is whether there is a clear definition of done, basic testing expectations, and someone accountable for quality before a build goes out.

As a non technical founder, it is reasonable to ask what testing looks like today and what would need to change to catch these issues earlier.

Stop tracking work in a Google Sheet. Move to Linear or even just GitHub Issues. Sheets have no accountability trail, no status tracking, and things fall through the cracks constantly. A proper tool makes it obvious what is done, what is in progress, and what got skipped.\n\n  \n2. Require a screen recording with every delivery. Before they mark something done, they record a 2 min Loom showing it works. This alone cut my regression rate in half because they actually had to test it themselves before sending the video.\n\n  \n3. Define \"done\" explicitly. \"Done\" means it works on the main flow, does not break existing features, and has been tested on at least one real device or browser. If you do not define it, their version of done will always be different from yours.\n\n  \n4. On finding a technical cofounder, honestly the best way is to hang out where technical people already are. Contribute to open source discussions, go to local meetups, or post on places like YC cofounder matching. Cold outreach rarely works. People want to see you are serious about the problem before they commit.\n\n  \nThe stress does not fully go away but it gets way more manageable once you have a system.

So I built something that connects to their Google Business Profile, pulls in reviews, and uses AI to generate on-brand replies they can approve and publish in one click. Automation rules, analytics, Stripe billing, GDPR compliance for the EU market, the whole thing. It took longer than I expected but the codebase is solid and everything works.\n\nExcept for the part that makes it actually useful. To connect to Google Business Profile you need quota approval from Google for their Management API, and they rejected my request. Turns out you need to own a verified Google Business Profile for 60+ days before they'll even consider granting quota, which is one of those requirements that feels completely reasonable in hindsight but that I only discovered after building the whole product.\n\nSo now I have a production-ready SaaS that can't connect to the one platform it was built for. All the code exists and works, the domain is live, the accounts are all set up, it just needs someone who already has a verified GBP to pick it up and actually launch it. For a local SEO agency or anyone who manages Google Business Profiles for clients, the blocker doesn't even exist.\n\nMy question is really about how to position and sell something in this state. It's pre-revenue, there are no customers, and there's this one real blocker that I'm being upfront about. I've been looking at Acquire and Flippa but I'm not sure if those are the right places for something like this or if there's a better way to find buyers who would actually see the value in it. Has anyone sold a project in a similar state? Curious how you approached pricing it and where you found buyers.",

That almost never works early on because you’re paying for reach you can’t convert yet. What works better on a tight budget is getting smaller creators who actually use your product to post about it consistently. 10-20 creators talking about you regularly will outperform one big influencer post every single time and the effect compounds over time.\n\nThe timing question is less about stage and more about whether people actually like what you’re building. You said decent feedback and steady growth, that’s enough. You don’t need everything perfectly locked in to start. The real risk isn’t starting too early, it’s overpaying for the wrong creator and then writing off the whole channel based on one bad experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "I (29M, single, no kids) need advice on what to do next. Based on the overview below, I'd like to hear what other people's ideas are / what people would do if they were in my position. I'd especially like to hear from people who have faced similar circumstances and what they did -- although all are open to opine.\n\nI have had a bumpy career. I studied math in undergrad; did a masters in statistics (all of this was paid for by scholarship, no loans are dragging me down). Good grades. Not worried there.\n\nI briefly worked at a prestigious company doing some compliance (9 months). I was then poached by a hedge fund to work on their acquisitions team (left after 1.5 years). I made good money and the work was good, too; the people were the stuff of nightmares (my stories would sound fake and a coworker once said she \"wouldn't believe me except for the fact that she saw it herself\"). I left and then helped manage an endowment (\\~3 years).\n\nThe endowment was fine but was \"bad\" in the sense that I was severely understimulated. It was boring beyond belief. After saving some money, I ended up leaving to try starting my own company.\n\nThe new company is going alright. I've been at it for about 8 months. These last few weeks, I started running ads / doing marketing. It is still in its infancy. I genuinely believe it can make a lot of money, assuming I can work out the kinks. It is getting interest; good internet traffic; and I'm about to close my first transaction after about 1 week of ads.\n\nThe problem is that I am running out of money. I still have enough of my own savings for about 9-12 more months (before dipping into retirement funds). I had planned to start looking for a new job in about a month if things weren't immediately promising. This is because, on average, it takes about 6-9 months to get a job if you do not currently have one. I am prepared for a longer search.\n\nI do not know if I should continue to try growing this on the side (which, admittedly, would be very difficult, if not impossible to do). I have thought about trying to raise some funding but want to wait until I have more of a steady flow of revenue before trying to scale -- the business is very ad-spend dependent and some processes need to be worked out before I feel very confident I could return my investor money. Also, having this working revenue flow would make it much easier to raise money.\n\nI could go back to \"high finance\" but it would put me in a position that is \"more junior,\" assuming I return to the same vein as before. This is a possible route but I would have to give up any chance of starting my own thing. This is because I'd probably be working 60-80 weeks. I'm also getting older and those hours are just killer. I think I'd be miserable.\n\nI have a technical background and could probably make the switch to software development / something in that realm. However, I'd be starting all over, and I've heard the job market isn't exactly popping in that sector. It'd also be a lot of work prepping for interviews -- I'm rusty, and I'd have to re-learn a lot.\n\nIdeally, I'd be able to get a job at a new company / startup where I'd be able to earn equity, help the company grow, get valuable business-building experience, then leave and try starting something again.\n\nI've put together a few things that I think will help me pick a new career.\n\nI know this is bad, but I need to make at least $150K+ based on my past jobs.\n\nI'd prefer to like my coworkers but I'd take ones I don't hate.\n\nI need a job that is semi-social.\n\nI need a job that has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI need a job that is stimulating / will let my position \"matter.\" At the endowment, if I didn't do my job for a week or so, I'm pretty sure nothing would change.\n\nSo, my questions are...\n\n* Would you try raising funding?\n   * It'd have a small chance of happening but I am pre-revenue and that is a huge limiter. I think I could make an argument that I have a good \"path to revenue\" but, realistically, you don't know that it'll work out until you are actually generating revenue.\n* Would you go back to a high-paying career at a more junior role, eat shit for a while, and maybe burn out?\n* Would you try switching fields altogether into one that is struggling with extra uncertainty?\n* Would you try finding a new gig doing something perhaps more ambiguous, taking less money, and see if you can get an equity stake in something?\n\nI'd be happy to hear advice that individuals may have that could help with the decision calculus here.",

If they stall after a month or two, at least you have income and can pivot without desperation.\n\n  \nThe worst position to be in is fundraising when you are running out of money. Investors smell desperation. The second worst is taking a soul-crushing job that kills the startup entirely.\n\n  \nThe middle path (consulting + building) is harder to execute but it keeps all your options open. And at 29, single, no kids, you have way more flexibility than you think.",

If you can land a decent paying job (and with your background you should), you can always build on the side. Some of the most successful founders I know started their companies while employed.

Your gut feeling about them building the product is important, but can they also fire someone, make architecture decisions that wont break at 10x scale, and handle the stress of being the only technical decision maker when everything breaks at 2am?",

For the first version of the app, probably not, and with enough competence in your early hires, you could use both languages. I've worked in a lot of \"Haskell Startups\", great language, but the infrastructure around it makes a lot of things \"hard mode\" because hiring is tricky and there's a ton of missing libraries. Nonetheless, those businesses weren't rescued by using the language, but they weren't directly harmed by it either.\n\nThat said, if you want to pick a single language, I'd lean towards python if your biggest problems are going to be how you build and integrate AI, and lean towards C#/Java if you need to build a lot of performant backend services where operational concerns (logging/metrics/deployments) matter.\n\nMost of the code should be written with AI anyway, so \"what people know already\" should be less of a factor than it was even 3 years ago.\n\n",

Yes and are there some things that really should just be brought in house easily (like a bespoke CRM for say aged care, meeting room booking system, or a truly bespoke system where the are few competitors and none of them really match needs/budget). At any rate, the work to build those SaaS’s are likely to go to a consultant and I can tell you right now that list of trusted AI vibe code consultancies does not exist yet.

I’m using it to stress test my own thinking, find gaps, challenge assumptions, tighten the reasoning. The conclusions are still mine. That’s not relying on AI, that’s just having a better editing process.",

That’s a compounding layer, not a thin interface layer AI can just replace.\n\nBut also, always in demand doesn’t mean always profitable at current margins. If AI makes it cheaper to build competing tools and the big platforms (Google, Meta) keep pulling more of the ad stack in-house, you get squeezed from both sides.\n\nPeople will always want this. The question is whether a specific product can hold pricing power when the cost of building a competitor keeps dropping. My view is that the ones that survive sit on data or distribution that’s hard to replicate, not just good ad logic, because logic gets commoditised first.",

SaaS that just orchestrates steps... form builders, basic CRMs, simple dashboards... is genuinely exposed. AI can replicate those workflows cheaply and the operational burden is low enough to self-host.\n\nBut SaaS that owns a system of record, handles compliance, or sits on network effects? That gets harder to replace, not easier. You can vibe-code a meeting room booking app in a weekend. You can't vibe-code SOC 2 compliance, multi-tenant data isolation, or the integrations ecosystem that took Salesforce a decade to build.\n\nIt's not SaaS dying, it's the low-value application layer getting compressed while the platform layer absorbs more of the spend.",
