      "text": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

Once you do and realize the business didn’t collapse once you let go, you’ll be able to breathe a bit easier and repeat the process.",

A lot women want resources from men. Its nasty. Ive seen it first hand. My Dad had a 6 fig income, retired, married... divorced just recent and maaaaan.... Its painful to see him in the finacial state. Wiped out by woman. He thought prayers and not taking action to protect himself would save him. Nope. So protect yourself at all times. Its a concrete jungle out there. Dont let nooooooo body, especially women that want to soften you up and, \"you cant be that way\", dude. Theyre their to open you up, never there when theyre wrong. You hold the cards. Hold them close. Use your best judgement. Keep your wits. Vet first, love later. A mans greatest folly, is his heart and his 2nd head. Good job. Proud of you. Now get to buying some hard assets, a trust, a finacial team etc. Still ways to go. congrats on cracking the 100k barrier.\nLadies , its not a shot at women. Its a warning to men , that I wasnt taught young, to guard your hearts. Mothers always warn girls about boys. Rarely do boys get warned about girls. Its no shade, just a grounding.",

In retrospect I think entrepreneurship is one of the worst life paths for people and probably not something you should aspire towards explicitly. I think you can NOW start to live again and prioritise life fulfilling things outside of work but since you hadnt achieved it previously you really couldnt afford to do so mentally. \n\nHonestly, I would just be grateful you finally succeeded because imagine if you had failed and were in the same position.

It helps keep me accountable to ALL my goals, not just my business ones. Making friends as an adult is harder, but you’ll get out of it what you put into it.\n\nSo many strangers helped me, never hesitate to DM if you want to hop on a Zoom call or something.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "(I will not promote)\n\nI've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

What I meant was, one should still consider their startup and even their own momentum in terms of the list as you have built it. \n\nIt's important that one also acknowledge that there are certain... caveats because you can't always show immediate adoption numbers, so you have to come up with other ways. \n\nYour list is a map, and a map is an approximation of the territory, so adjust accordingly. :)\n\nFor example, with my surgical robot I was able to present a list of over 200 surgeons in the field that had used the robot in a simulation setting and validated the potential clinical value of the technology. They weren't a direct adopter (yes), but they were experts who provided their insight of the future value of the device. \n\nRegardless of that outlier, I say your list is spot on.",

And that point about founders trying to “convince” instead of tell a clear story really resonates. The best conversations we’ve had were when we stopped over-explaining and just focused on what we understood deeply and why it mattered.  Feels like confidence comes from clarity, not from fancy words.",

I’m a 40-year-old father trying to understand how this new world works.\n\nTo talk to you, I spent hours researching your terminology like \"Technical Debt.\" I am sorry if my usage is awkward, but I found a deep connection to my world of finance.\n\nIn banking, we think about \"Amortization\" (how long an asset lasts). \nIf you build a \"Pop-up store\" (a prototype), move fast. Use AI and libraries. That's good business. \nBut if you are building a \"Shrine\" (a core system) to last 20 years, the cheapest way is actually \"**The Forging**\" (鍛錬) way. In Japan, the best katanas are forged by folding the steel thousands of times. Software is the same. You must fold the logic again and again by building from scratch until it becomes part of you.\n\nI see many startups drowning in \"Technical Interest.\" They take \"loans\" by using easy AI code without understanding the core. In banking, a loan without a repayment plan is just a disaster.\n\nIn Japan, we have a concept: \"Chiko-Goitsu\" (知行合一). Knowledge and action are one. \nReading about code isn't enough if your hands move slower than your brain. The friction of struggling without AI—**The Forging**—is where the real skill is born.\n\nIs the \"move fast\" culture making us forget the value of **The Forging**? I am just a banker, but I wanted to hear your professional thoughts.\n\n\n**Edit: 7 Lessons Learned from this discussion**\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone who joined this thread. As a rural banker from Japan, your insights have been an incredible \"Ethical OS\" for me. Here is what I’ve learned from your collective wisdom:\n\n**1. Technical Debt as a \"Strategic Loan\"**: Speed is an essential investment in the early stages (MVP). It's okay to \"borrow\" speed, as long as you have a plan to repay it. (Thanks Ray and others!)\n\n**2. The \"Shrine\" vs. \"Cathedral\"**: Don't over-design before you understand the soul of the product. Building a small \"shrine\" first and listening to users is the key to avoiding toxic debt. (Thanks Ok-Kaleidoscope5627!)\n\n**3. Forging is about \"Understanding\"**: Writing code is easy (AI can do it), but \"Forging\" is the process of truly understanding the logic. Re-writing is not a waste; it's how you master the foundation. (Thanks Capt-Kowalski!)\n\n**4. Leadership is Debt Management**: A good leader values the time spent \"repaying\" technical debt. Blindly chasing \"one-hit reversals\" while ignoring the foundation is a gamble that leads to bankruptcy.\n\n**5. Avoid the \"Museum Piece\" Trap**: No matter how much soul you forge into a blade, it loses its life as a tool the moment it stops being a \"weapon for battle.\" True \"Forging\" must be aligned with the battlefield of reality (PMF).\n\n**6. Strategic Survival vs. Capitalist Pivot**: Giants can afford to \"Pivot\" as if they are totaling a supercar and just ordering the next one. But for small founders, a single project is often their whole life; there is no second chance. Therefore, an **\"Exit Strategy\"** is essential. Ideally, we shouldn't just \"discard\" a debt-heavy module. If we can find a buyer or redefine its value for a future \"Buyout,\" high interest turns into a massive \"investment.\" (In reality, this is more often a lucky result than a planned strategy, but it’s the ultimate goal!)\n\n**7. Debt is like Alcohol**: It gives you a temporary high and power, but the \"hangover\" (interest/debt) is inevitable. Success depends on the \"care\" you take before, during, and after drinking. (Thanks Kaidomaru!)\n\nI will take these lessons back to my small bank in Gunma to refine my philosophy. I am truly honored to have met such \"legendary\" mentors here. \n\nArigato (Thank you) from Japan!\n\n",

For example, I consult for startups, and many of them must create their idea as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to demonstrate their potential so that they can get funding from investors. This is what Facebook did; they created a poorly crafted product then actually rebuilt the whole thing once they had the money.\n\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, there are serious drawbacks to accumulating technical debt. A business owner will have to fix their product sooner or later. AI code has made the issue much worse. AI makes the kinds of mistakes that even a bad programmer wouldn't make, creating issues that are very difficult to solve. Furthermore, as you pointed out, in many cases no one actually understands what the code is doing.\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, startups create more technical debt than they need to because they try to do too much too soon. The more features something has, the more expensive it is to make. It's better to create a product that does one thing well than five things badly.",

But startups are trying to discover what the market actually needs before investing in optimizing and forging because premature optimization will be useless if it's not a product that is needed. It's also a reason why big companies in tech struggle to innovate - they focus on scalabilty and quality to reduce tech debt before getting their product out and getting customer feedback which makes them slower to change and respond.\n\nA knife is a well understood product on the need and use case and design parameters which then makes sense on why it should justify upfront forging and great quality. But there was probably a prototyping stage hundreds of years before where blacksmiths tried different shapes and techniques (while taking shortcuts on quality) to find the best for different needs.\n\nUsually new software has multiple personas working with it and multiple potential solutions where it's not clear what to focus on first. Some people like to collect and document extensive requirements upfront to try to be more methodical, but often that fails too because what is documented isn't what is actually needed and you only see that when you build something quick and get it in front of users.",

You have woven an elegant tapestry of wisdom, but there is a loose thread I cannot help but pull: **we often do not know how long a piece of software will live when we write it**\n\nStartups often pivot and big companies can invest a lot towards initiatives that make sense at the time but ultimately don’t pan out, like Meta’s “metaverse” or the dozens of projects created and killed by Google. \n\nIn that case technical debt is less like taking on a burdensome loan, and more like putting clothes on a high interest credit card and hoping you decide whether or not to keep it before the return period is over. In that case what is kept is expected to be roughly within the clothing budget, including expected cost of care through its useful lifetime. \n\nAs long as the new features are not too coupled with the rest of the system to be easily removed or swapped out, there is less risk in knowingly incorporating modules with high technical debt, which has been a fundamental lesson of software engineering long before AI and will always continue to guide development practices.",

          "text": "I think an important thing to understand about software is that we don't know what we're building. Sometimes we know the high level idea but the details are not known when we start.\n\nSo if you think about a shrine, as software developers we are told to make a place for people to pray. When we start, we don't know if it is a shinto, or a Buddhist shrine, or even a Christian church. We don't know how many people will use it. Which people will use it. Where it needs to be built. What materials we will have to build with etc.\n\nSoftware projects are generally developed under two approaches - waterfall, or agile:\n\nWith waterfall we try to find out all the details and plan everything in advance and then build to that design. The problem is that because software is often trying to solve problems that we don't fully understand - we end up building a Catholic cathedral to handle thousands of worshippers when we wanted a small neighbourhood shrine. You are left with a well designed system but in a sense the entire system is tech debt that we then try to modify to do what the actual goal was.\n\nWith Agile we accept that we don't know all the answers and we start by building something simple, checking with the users to see if it works, and then iterating until we get it right. This means we start with a small personal shrine in their home, talk to the users, they tell us that they actually wanted it dedicated to Inari and they want it built on a nearby mountain. Okay, so now rebuild it or move it and add some fox statues. Then we learn that it's really popular and we need to accommodate thousands of visitors, so now we start building it to handle all those visitors. We still have tech debt because of all the previous versions that didn't really solve the problem, and because all of our solutions were designed by reacting to the requirements rather than planning for them. It's a different type of debt though.\n\nWe use waterfall when we write software for spaceships or things that can be dangerous if they don't work the first time. This approach can be expensive and takes a lot of time and results in large hard to work with software. We use agile when we write software for requirements that we expect will be changing and where it's okay to fail because we can try again. Most software is written with an agile approach as a result.\n\nWe get tech debt either way but different types and for different reasons. The only reliable way that we've found to prevent tech debt is by hiring highly experienced and skilled engineers who thanks to their experience can make decisions that avoid the tech debt before it occurs. Good leadership also plans for it and gives their engineers time to learn from their successes and failures, and fix the tech debt. Bad leadership sees something that is \"working\" and doesn't understand the value in paying down the debt, they just accumulate more and more debt until everything has to be torn down and started from scratch.",

If you are building a foundation for your software, you need to understand it in and out to be able to bend it to your will into something that is both performant and easy to understand. This writing and rewriting the code logic a 1000 times is exactly the (and the only) way to achieve that.\n\nThe goal of forging is not to write the code (AI could do it) but to understand what you are writing. Without that you won’t be able to change the code, it will be a security liability and likely a lot slower than it should have been.",

No one has a crystal ball and it would be arrogant to assume we know where our startup is in two years. Building all the foundation to last is often futile, and is a sign of inexperienced teams. The answer isn’t at single-use throwaway code either, really the only thing experienced teams do differently is recognise when you can be relatively sure where things go so you build enough foundation to support and enable future development without rework, but only when applicable.\n\nThe hardest part about this is that it’s not just a technical question, it requires superb customer and productisation understanding that is often with completely different people than the technical know how. Getting those people to talk, not to mention to agree, is very difficult. Which yet again brings us to the benefit of being fast in a smart way because the faster you get things exposed to the market, the faster you can learn and align.\n\nIt’s never 100% this or 100% that.

I also think asking for feedback on a very specific decision works better than “can I get your thoughts,” it gives them something concrete to react to.

The best conversations usually happen *after* the official thing ends (we all know this, right?).\n\n**- talk about the problem, not the startup.** When you frame it as \"I'm exploring X because I keep seeing Y break\" investors drop into pattern recognition mode instead of pitch-evaluation mode - this is what you want.\n\n**- follow operators, not VCs, and build sideways.** A lot of intros come from founders who've already been through it and say \"you should talk to this person\". There's a lot more power in intros than we think.\n\n**- ask for perspective, not money.** \"Does this problem feel real to you?\" gets better engagement than anything resembling a pitch. They can smell a pitch from a mile away, beware.\n\n**- let it compound... slowly.** One good conversation often leads to two more if you keep showing up in the same circles. Let yourself be seen - however difficult it might be... you have to.\n\nCold DMs and demo days aren't useless, but they're noisy, the signal tens to come from repeated proximity and curiosity, not formal outreach.\n\nIf you're getting thoughtful feedback already that's a sign you're already in the right rooms, you just need to stay in there longer!

They can watch you think and execute over time.\n\nThe other thing that worked was asking founders who've raised for warm intros, not to pitch but literally just \"I'd love 15 mins to learn from someone who's seen a lot of companies in this space.\" Most investors will take that call because there's no pressure and they're always looking for deal flow anyway. Half the time those coffee chats turn into \"let me know when you're raising.\"\n\nAlso worth finding out where they actually hang out. Some are active on Twitter/X, some do office hours, some speak at small events. Way easier to start a real conversation after commenting on their stuff for a few weeks than cold DMing out of nowhere.\n\nThe accidental chat you had worked because it was genuine.

He couldn't invest personally due to firm conflict rules, but because I spent time selling him on the vision (not just paying his bills), he became a believer. He introduced me to his HNW son in law who is also very well connected to other HNWI's. The best part is I didn't have to do the selling, his father in law did the selling for me, and it came from a very trusted source.\n\nTLDR: Stop cold DM'ing VCs.

Mockups Only (No Code)** Don't build the product. Just sketch the concepts or make high-fidelity mockups. Put those on a simple landing page. That is your \"product\" for now.\n\n**2. The \"Validation Gate\" (No Payments)** Instead of setting up payments (which is a hassle), make the \"Join Waitlist\" button trigger a form with 5 specific questions. This is how you validate without charging money yet:\n\n* **Current Situation:** \"Which best describes your current situation?\" (Who are they?)\n* **Goal:** \"Which best describes what you're trying to achieve?\"\n* **Obstacle:** \"What is your biggest obstacle?\" (The problem you solve).\n* **The Price Check:** \"How much would you be willing to pay?\" (This validates the business model without needing a payment gateway).\n* **Context:** \"What else should we know?\"\n\n**3. Analyze & Pivot** If people sign up but type \"$0\" for willingness to pay, or can't articulate their \"biggest obstacle,\" you saved yourself months of building. If they *do* give you real answers and real price points, *then* you start building.\n\nYou can set this up in a few hours. Good luck with the college launch!",

No funding, no big plan, mostly evenings and weekends. The idea was pretty simple: a tool that creates mind maps with the help of Al, mainly for structuring websites and ideas faster. I called it MindmapWizard.\n\nFor a long time, it was just me improving things step by step, fixing stuff, learning as I went, wondering if anyone would ever care. A few people started using it, then more, and slowly it turned into something real.\n\nNow I've been approached by a few interested buyers who want to acquire the site. The offers go up to £34,000, which honestly blows my mind. I never built this with selling in mind. I just wanted to solve a problem I personally had.\n\nI'm currently trying to figure out: • whether selling now makes sense • if I'm massively under or overvaluing it • or if I should keep going and see where it leads.\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation? Built something solo, then suddenly had acquisition interest? I'd love to hear how you handled it or what you wish you had done differently.",

Just take your projected MRR growth (minus churn) and sum the growth to ARR for year-3 and use a 5x-10x multiplier as your min-max range. You can keep it simple or calculate in a \"sale\" price increase to $1.99 for new users, annual subscriptions, etc. If you have a \\*few\\* offers, that signals demand to me and having your own valuation with numbers to back it up gives you a solid basis for negotiation.\n\nEven if you decide not to sell, I would be inclined to engage with all offers, see the numbers for their valuation, and try to ascertain where they see value. You will inevitably learn from it. Also, if you keep it, consider closing the incognito loophole :)",

That is not living money yet, but a nice side hussle, but the question is, can you get that number up and are you interested in doing that.\n\nI might expect that competition will pop-up, Miro or something like that sherlocking this is a risk. The question comes down to: what kind of bet do you want to make. Sell it for 50k or try to 10x this in 12-24 months, with the risk of being outcompeted because I don't feel this is extremely unique as a piece of software. Still, I don't know your unit economics and your traction numbers to evaluate how realistic 10x is.\n\nTo be frank, if the number of 140k+ mindmaps generated is true, 5k is quite a low conversion rate? Also, you say a few thousand visitors, but that should be higher, as 18 months in existence requires 8k monthly mindmaps made, so likely double the visitors. Also the fact that most traffic is organic shows you haven't really found a controllable channel yet, which might lead to scalability issues: perhaps mind mapping software ads and clicks are quite expensive due to tools like Miro with deep pockets. Again, I don't know this market, but not sure how easy it is to scale this tool.",

A small early push (newsletter, Slack groups, Twitter/X, hunters) creates a snowball effect. Once a product hits the top spot early in the day, it gets more visibility on the homepage, email digests and notifications, which brings in more organic upvotes. That is how #1 can run away to 300+ while #2 stalls at 230. It is momentum and visibility compounding, not a linear race.\n\nSo yeah, its less about “best product wins” and more about who shows up with distribution ready on day one.

      "text": "Over the last few years, I’ve had the privilege of working on zero-to-one products, scaling systems, shipping fast, and experiencing the real chaos of startup life.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I realised the problems I felt most compelled to solve were the same ones I kept running into myself.\n\nAlongside a 9–5, I spent nights and weekends building small products with a few tech friends. We made some money, and one of those products was even acquired for a few dollars. Still, despite those early wins, we never had the confidence to quit everything and go all in.\n\nThose experiences taught me something important: working full-time on something you truly believe in creates far more momentum than treating it as a side project.\n\nDropping out early and starting up on day one often sounds glamorous, until you’re responsible for putting food on the table. Reality has a way of grounding ambition.\n\nComing from a humble, lower middle-class background, my first five years of employment were essential. They helped me build financial stability and ensured my family didn’t carry the risk of my ambition. I strongly believe that starting up should never come at the cost of your family’s well-being.\n\nIn hindsight, choosing the right startups for my 9–5 was an education in itself. You get to experiment, learn, and fail on someone else’s capital while building real conviction about what works and what doesn’t. I’m deeply grateful to the founders who trusted me and allowed me to witness their zero-to-one journeys up close. Many great founders began their paths the same way.\n\nAll of this combined gave me the confidence, skills, and clarity to finally take the leap.\n\nI’ll share more updates as this journey unfolds.  \nIf you’re a founder, builder, or hustler working in tech, I’d love to connect and learn from your experiences too.",

You quit your job but won't say what you're building or why anyone should care.\n\n\"I'll share more updates as this journey unfolds\" sounds like you're trying to build an audience before you have a product. That usually doesn't work.\n\nIf you actually have conviction about the problem you're solving, lead with that. Otherwise this reads like every other \"I quit to startup\" post that disappears in 6 months.\n\nGood luck though.",

          "text": "What stood out to me is that you didn’t frame quitting as courage for its own sake, but as the *result* of preparation. Many startup content pieces skip over that part and turn risk into a personality trait. In reality, timing and responsibility matter a lot, especially when other people depend on you.\n\nI also really agree with the idea that choosing the *right* 9–5s can be an education. Working inside early-stage companies teaches you things you simply don’t learn building alone at night: tradeoffs, prioritization, customer reality, and how messy zero-to-one actually is. Doing that on someone else’s capital isn’t laziness, it’s leverage.\n\nThe side-project phase is underrated, too. Shipping small things, seeing what breaks, and making a bit of money (even if it’s not life-changing) builds pattern recognition and confidence that no amount of theory can replace. It’s not glamorous, but it compounds.\n\nTo me, this doesn’t read like “I finally escaped the 9–5.”  \nIt reads like “I earned the right to focus.”\n\nWishing you clarity, rather than speed, in this next phase. Looking forward to seeing what you learn when all the momentum points in one direction.",

In the early startup days, you have to do unconventional things be it your strategy, market opportunity or product in order to win. If you just follow conventional wisdom and what everyone else is doing it tends to lead to mediocrity and you lose to bigger companies who can do that at scale.\n\nHowever once a startup grows bigger it starts to adopt conventional practices because that's the only way to organise everyone to operate in a cohesive manner. I'm not trying to say one is better than the other, but it's an apples to oranges comparison and success looks very different in each case. Your first paying customer in a startup can feel more rewarding than breaking 100 million annual revenue.",

You'll see what level of work is normal, and so on.\n\nThat makes it much easier to prioritize and do what you can and must do in a small startup, than if you go at it clueless without knowing what normal looks like.\n\nI'll give you an example from a project that I'm currently working on that has to do with improving marketing and growth for small business owners:\n\nMy biggest problem is that since they haven't seen what a normal success level is at they don't see how badly they're doing, and that means that they don't even see the point of what actually are miraculous improvements that'd be possible.\n\nSo, yes, out of context we're talking about two different environments when we're talking about 5 person startup or a 100 people successful business; but within context it's crucial to have seen and learn from the inside of a 100 people successful business before you work in a 5 person startup.\n\nYou'll know the level things should be at, and it'll help you make the right compromises and priorities, not to mention that it'll give an idea of what it is that you're working towards when you're able to grow the teams.\n\nA 5 person startup that haven't even seen how to successfully work will always have less chance of success than a 5 person startup that in their mind have clear picture of what they should be doing, what they're building towards.",

      "text": "I used to work in a very large bureaucratic organization where I was involved in data cleaning- NOT data analytics, NOT AI engineering, but literally cleaning messy data to be sent to statisticians for analysis. I was miserable. On top of that, I realized I hated having no impact on a company and being told what to do every second of the day with little upside for my career/life.\n\nI had been sitting on an idea for a business in the hotel industry for a while, though, because I love hospitality and saw I gap in the market I believed others did not see. I was doing a lot of thinking/ research about the product, market, as well as how the business would be executed and truly thought it could work. However, I was really stuck on making such a drastic leap of faith because I was so focused on the downside instead of the upside.\n\nBut one day I woke up more miserable than normal, and heard a podcast about someone who I went to school with that was running a 7-figure events business. One of the things he kept harping on was that fortune favors the bold, and that it's fine to feel afraid or skeptical, but you need to have the guts to put your feelings to the side and just go for it.  \n  \nComing from someone I perceived as a normal guy I went to class with, this hit me really hard. Because if he was able to take the risk, why couldn't I?\n\nNeedless to say, I drafted up a resignation letter and sent it to my former boss the same day\n\nThe next 18 months were more grueling than I ever imagined:\n\n* I dealt with more rejection & embarrassment in that time span than the rest of my life combined\n* My family was not encouraging on my leap of faith & let me know about it constantly\n* I had burned a significant amount of savings building a prototype\n* I had many sleepless nights as well as missed workouts/meals, leading to occasional bouts of sickness\n* Good friends & I completely drifted apart due to the time I had to take to work on my business\n\nOn top of all that, for a variety of reasons, I unfortunately had to shut down the business.\n\nHowever, I couldn't help but feel pride in this difficult situation I found myself in. Not only did I understand how to conduct proper customer discovery, manage financials, reach out to & close potential clients, & be a good leader (at least this was my goal), but I became a better version of myself. My confidence is at its peak, my mental acuity has never been sharper, and my network is pretty dang good. Lastly, I've learned to acknowledge and overcome fear to pursue what matters to me- the most valuable skill you can have imo.\n\nNow, because of my previous experience & connections, I secured a paid position with solid equity at a new startup. It's a great placeholder for now and I think it will lead to venture #2 down the road. I guess it all works out in a way and I would not have changed it for anything.\n\nWondering if anyone has a similar experience with their first venture?\n\n\n\nP.S.  \nIf you were in a similar position to me and want to start something, really think about your burn and what would happen if the company didn't work out after x months. I was in a position where I had enough savings/resources that I was able to spend the first few months with $0 in revenue. I am a big advocate for taking a risk to pursue a startup opportunity, but even I was somewhat calculated about it.",

You will regret it in years to come if you went through all those expenses and potential student loans for nothing when you’ve really not got that long left.\n\nAt the rate you’re seeing growth anyhow you may be able to go full time straight after your degree as you’re already pulling in a fat amount.",

Got quite a few solid clients signed up. Then many other competitors started popping up, with investment and a much larger advertising budget. I got discouraged, burnt out, and ultimately decided to turn it into a background recurring rev business.\n\nMistake was not tripling-down on the outreach (efforts and ad budget/opportunities) to get more clients.  We had a unique niche (marketing agencies and partners who wanted our white-label solution under their brand). They did all the work of selling and building websites using our platform. Training was minimal (once they learnt the platform, very occasional support was needed - highly scalable), commitment was very high (some of them are still paying/using the platform - since they have many client sites on it). The problem was that they doubted that small businesses would still need their services, with all these DIY responsive website builders popping up, and hence it was harder to get clients.\n\nIn hindsight I gave up too soon. I should have stuck around much longer, and changed my pitch to the agencies. Our few existing clients are doing just fine and using our platform to build websites for their small business clients (who are not technical and don't want to mess with website builders, even now, with AI).\n\nBtw, many website builder competitors in those days with large budgets on VC money disappeared a few years later. I now tend to believe that the secret is in having the guts to stick around longer than others.\n\nWhat have I learnt from this? When evaluating opportunities, I think: any venture would take a massive effort and time commitment to succeed, and does this one pump me up enough to commit.",

It took me longer to figure this out than I'd like to admit, it really slowed down our ability to ship features quickly and get feedback from pilot customers/design partners. \n\nI learned two things:   \n  \n(1) just because you have great engineers, it doesn't mean they are doing great work. We had some early well-tenured engineers working on the prototype who were solid - and quite proud of their work - but they never shared that the prototype they built wasn't meant for commercial use. \n\n(2) related to #1, great engineers (or any role) can be lousy communicators, and what I didn't know, I didn't know. So while we had some early engineers who never communicated the limitations of our MVP, our FTE engineers could not clearly articulate the extent of the problem - even though they knew. That made it hard for me to assess the depth of the slop (which seemed Grand Canyon deep). I asked a lot of questions because refactoring was taking a long time, and I was finally able to define it. But that took far too long and it was lost time not knowing what I could sell & how to adapt.

              "text": "This is a very classic startup problem. Sometimes chaos does evolve into structure, clear goals, and transparency, but more often it gets stuck at the chaos stage. In those cases, a lot of time, money, and energy are burned with very little to show for it.\n\nChaos can actually be useful early on. Ideas and teams transform quickly, and that often only happens in a chaotic environment. But the key is that chaos has to be controlled. Very often, the push for structure comes from the bottom, with people asking for basic processes to normalize the work. Leadership doesn't always see immediate value in that and stays in chaos longer than it should.\n\nI agree with you that it's still a valuable experience. The most important part is recognizing it for what it was and taking the lessons forward.",

Real momentum, bigger clients, team growing, work coming in fast.\n\n\n\nWhat went wrong (the mistake that changed me):\n\nI scaled trust faster than I scaled structure.\n\n\n\nWhen the agency started taking off, I brought partners in to cover gaps like retention, CRO, and ops. The intention was right. Move faster. Cover blind spots. Build something bigger than me.\n\n\n\nBut I made a few mistakes that compounded:\n\n\n\nI built the company on verbal alignment.\nWe had a lot of “we’re good” conversations. Not enough written agreements that spelled out roles, ownership, decision-making, financial controls, expectations, and what happens when things get hard.\nI handed over leverage without guardrails.\nI stayed locked into what I do best: strategy, creative direction, production, client trust. I let other people control operational levers without the protections in place. Approvals. Access. Reporting. SOPs. Clear boundaries on who owns what.\nI ignored early friction because growth was loud.\nWhen you’re winning, shipping, and clients are happy, it’s easy to downplay misalignment. I treated red flags like stress. I told myself it was temporary. It wasn’t.\nI didn’t treat partnership like something that needs maintenance.\nNo scorecards. No measurable accountability. No documented decisions. No consistent cadence of “this is what done looks like.” So when pressure hit, reality turned into three different stories depending on who you asked.\n\n\n\n\nThe business grew, but the foundation didn’t. And when tension showed up, the lack of structure turned into confusion, conflict, and real financial and emotional damage.\n\n\n\nWhat I learned afterward:\n\nGrowth doesn’t fix instability. It exposes it.\n\n\n\nMy rules now:\n\n\n\nPartnerships need contracts, not vibes.\nIf it’s serious enough to build your life around, it’s serious enough to document. Roles, ownership, pay, access, decision rights, exit terms. Everything.\nControl isn’t ego. It’s responsibility.\nIf I can’t see the numbers, the approvals, the pipeline, and the output clearly, I’m not leading. I’m hoping.\nIf alignment isn’t written, it isn’t real.\nI document decisions when things are calm, so it’s clear when things aren’t.\nProtect the core before you scale the shell.\nSOPs, financial controls, client agreements, org chart clarity, and delivery systems come before bigger retainers and bigger teams.\n\n\n\n\nThat season hurt. Bad. But it forced me to level up into a real operator, not just a creative builder. I still believe in trust and collaboration. Now it’s built on structure that protects everyone",

      "text": "Hey all - this is an update to my late 2024 post *Crossing $750k annual revenue as a team of three* (cannot link here but on still on my profile) which had quite a bit of interest. Posting to share learnings and updates from the past year, as we seem to be in a position many here aspire to be. Got lots of DM's asking if we were hiring, wanting me to be on podcasts/etc., but candidly - I prefer to stay under the radar. And no, we're not hiring.\n\nAs a reminder, we're in the construction SaaS/document management space. Fully bootstrapped.\n\n**Headcount**\n\n* One of our team members went part-time/just wanted to contract with us for some personal reasons, which we encouraged - hence our loss of 1 headcount. No drama, no fights - it was just the best for them at the time.\n* In fact - I should probably only count as 0.5 headcount, as I picked up a full time W2 role mid-year in addition to running sales here.\n   * Why would I do so if the business is doing so well? I probably only have 5 calls a week, so it's easy to juggle calendars. And candidly - a combination of reasons. Health insurance, for one. I also moved to a VHCOL area, and wanted to save for upcoming life expenses rather than sending all of my income out the door. In doing so, it's also allowed our founder to recover some cash during his 2 years of working for free early on.\n* And no - my W2 gig doesn't know about this side hustle.\n* As a benchmark, we spoke with another founder who is doing about 2x our revenue, but has 10 people (versus our two). I can tell he's envious of our position, and\n* **Learning**: **Staying lean** has been an enormous leg up on the competition and our personal takehome. We can spin up and down resources at will which is super valuable, especially if planning for a conference or feature launch.\n\n**Engineering**\n\n* As before, not my domain - but Claude Code has driven *extreme* efficiency gains and we're pushing features faster than ever before. We've also been able to decrease our reliance on design contractors, as a lot of the designs it pushes after learning our codebase are really good.\n* **Learning**: We're not a \"vibe code\" shop - our primary founder has a decade of full stack SWE experience. But Windsurf/Claude Code/Etc. Help with all of the tedious stuff that otherwise may not have happened - e.g., deeper planning.\n\n**Marketing/Pipeline**\n\n* Pipeline is slow, but manageable. We really don't do any outbound marketing - it's all word of mouth, and we have a strong reputation in the space.\n* **Learning**: Cold outreach is really, really hard in construction - **it's a relationships industry**. Email is a blackhole.\n* We pay a flat 15% of first-year revenue for referrals from technology consultants, and that seems to keep people coming back.\n* We go to one conference a year, which keeps us top of mind for our most critical accounts and safely lands us $100-200k in revenue a year.\n* Forecast for the next month or so has about $90k net new ARR closing.\n\n**Churn**\n\n* Near zero. I haven't done the actual calculation, but I imagine we're at 90-95% gross retention, given at least one customer went bust last year.\n* The majority of our churn is on those companies that purchase per-project, which is entirely expected.\n* **Learning**: Check your metrics constantly. At 6 months, offer free training if you see usage is below average. It makes a renewal conversation easier, and adds value for your customer.\n\n**Sales/pricing**\n\n* We're still focused on land-and-expand motion. Land a small project, prove value, expand to a few dozen more.\n* We have 1 annoying foreign-based competitor who's cropped up and kept us honest on pricing, but we tend to be pretty competitive. Our product and expertise blows them out of the water, and I've never lost a deal to them head-to-head.\n* Our enterprise deals are now 24-month agreements rather than 12. As a single salesperson, it's saved me a ton of phone calls. We invoice once each year, and I haven't had *anyone* push back on the 24 months - if anything, they like the predictability and knowing we won't raise rates.\n\n**Financials**\n\n* Our revenue grew about 25% YoY, but leaned heavily into ARR (probably 85+% ARR vs NRR) as we pushed to convert single-project licenses into enterprise licenses.\n* All things considered, our expenses were about $350k in 2025 (contractors, marketing, SaaS apps, etc).\n* We grossed about $940k in 2025, leaving about $600k to split between the two of us doing the heavy lifting.\n* **Learning:** Look for bloat! We anticipate expenses will be abut 25% lower this year after focusing on tech spend efficiency, both on infra and business apps (migrating off Heroku, ditching ZoomInfo, etc.).\n\n**Next priorities**\n\n* Honestly? Life is really, really good. We solve a boring problem with minimal competition and fly totally under the radar.\n* My partner was able to spend a couple of weeks on holiday out of the country recently and only had to open his laptop twice for technical support (on items I couldn't help with). We know this won't last forever, but we're very grateful for where we are.\n* We've kicked around starting a second business that solves a problem unrelated to our current app, and even have a working POC for it. But that's more to diversify income than anything (we could easily market to our existing book of business). We'll see if anything comes of that, as it's still early.\n\nQuestions? As before - will not share our company name.",

I started working on this while I was still in the marine corps, so a little over 2 years now.\n\nI had two co-founders. One of them wasn't interested after we pivoted, we remained friends and I decided to learn UI design myself. The other, a developer, wasn't putting in any work - we cut ties, so I started developing with Claude.\n\nI tried to look for another co-founder. I had a few conversations here and there but no luck. The assistant I hired is set to start soon but is already showing red flags.\n\nI work 15 hour days. No co-founder. No emotional support. No days off. No dating from lack of time. My family only contacts me when they need something from me. The only thing carrying me is the vision I have in my mind of what the world could be like if this succeeds.\n\nBut some days...I just can't do it. My body and mind gives up. I'll get sick for a day or two. Sleep it off. And then keep going.\n\nHow do you stay motivated?",

What you are describing sounds less like a motivation problem and more like sustained burnout without any margin. Vision can carry you for a while, but it cannot replace rest, feedback, or shared load forever. One thing I have seen help is narrowing the definition of progress for a bit, smaller wins, shorter horizons, fewer 15 hour days if possible. The people who made it long term were not the ones who pushed hardest every day, but the ones who figured out how to keep showing up without breaking themselves. You are not weak for feeling this way, this is a very human response to a lot of pressure and isolation.",

What helped me in similar stretches was separating belief in the vision from the daily execution grind. You can still believe in the idea and admit the current setup is unsustainable.\n\nI also stopped asking “how do I stay motivated” and started asking “what would make this week slightly less punishing.” That often meant cutting scope, slowing pace, or letting something be imperfect instead of pushing through exhaustion. Working solo with no emotional buffer is brutally hard, and getting sick is often your body forcing a stop you are not allowing yourself. If possible, find even one external anchor, a peer, a weekly check-in, or a fixed shutdown time. The goal is not to quit, it is to survive long enough to make a clear decision from a non-burned-out state.",

What helped me in similar stretches was shrinking the time horizon, focusing on the next concrete win instead of the whole future world. I also had to accept that grinding 15 hour days without support was not a badge of honor, it was a warning sign. Building solo is already hard, doing it while emotionally cut off makes everything heavier. Sometimes the most productive move is to pause one piece, whether that is hiring, scope, or expectations, just to get your footing back. Motivation usually returns once the system around you is less punishing. You are not weak for hitting limits, you are human.

This sucks.\n\nI have a genuinely okay idea and amazing advisors who are genuinely interested in the startup including one who has helped IPO two startups/run engineering at a FAANG company and one who has founded his own successful VC firm and has plenty of connections.\n\nIn short, my network is quite strong and I am pretty business savvy, but I cannot find a tech co-founder through them as most of the folks they know are doing their own thing or settled at Series B+ companies.\n\nI have MOST of the non-tech work done and a vibe coded MVP. (I know vibe coding sucks and expect it this to be discarded.)\n\nTo be clear, I am happy doing 100% of the work OTHER than coding, and would support my CTO in whatever way they need. (If we need a smaller marketing team to have the budget for their SWE/game dev team, then so be it, etc.)\n\nI expect equity to be AT LEAST 45/55 and whatever salary I make (post funding) they would make.\n\nIn short, I would show them basic human decency.\n\nI do not anticipate funding being hard\\* as I already have a few interested investors, but all they want is a qualified CTO for the field I am in (game design meets EdTech…  either, really). \n\nSo… my wonderful tech/eng humans… **where and how can I convince you all to give me a shot?**\n\n\\*all funding is hard, and I am fine carrying the funding rounds, but due to my previous connections, it may be less hard than cold emailing.\n\n(EDIT: THANK YOU to all the folks giving critical feedback, I genuinely appreciate it.)",

It’s hard to make a game people want to play. Very hard.\n\n2) You need to integrate test prep in a way that players will actually learn and enjoy. I assume this is the more magical part. \n\n3) This needs to be as effective or more so than current prep methods like reading the books, practice exams, buying a course. This is another very hard problem. \n\nIt also sounds like there isn’t much technical challenge which makes it less interesting for a CTO and less defensible. ",

However as a potential technical founder I would rather work on my own things solo then team up for this idea. \n\nYou're going to have all of the problems of an indie game studio and a startup combined if you start from scratch. \n\nYou need to secure funding to acquire an existing game that didn't sell to it's potential and re-release it, or find someone who is pretty far along the process of building a game and is willing to partner with you, add educational content for you finding funding for the rest of the game. \n\nHere were my initial questions/thoughts though that led me to the above conclusion. \n\n1. How did you validate it? Validating a game is hard, but you're also an educational tool, so you need to validate both sides. \n\n2. I don't think this is a startup, there's no way to scale this since games make 80% of their sales within the first few months and if you do a subscription model, you'll have constant churn since people only need to pass these tests once.\n\n3. What's your moat? Someone could vibe code a LSAT study mod into Skyrim in a weekend, Stardew Valley already has an ANKI study mod. I've never played Roblox, but I would be surprised if no one has done an educational game there already.\n\nI do think educational games will be a big thing in the future. It's just going to be hard to pull off and there's lots of competition. \n\nIf you're able to make the next Roblox/Minecraft/Stardew and show positive educational outcomes you'll be huge. There's also lots of ways to pivot/specialize along the way to keep going.",

If you don’t have any technical friends or folks from your network that’ll join in, then you need money. Money solves this problem and it’ll enable you to give away an order of magnitude less of your company. If I was you, I would focus on fundraising. Lots of smart, non-technical people raise on an idea or brittle MVP.\n\nEvery VC at every stage is going to tell you to derisk. At your stage, that’s proving you can hire a critical engineer. When they don’t follow up with an offer, that’s a signal.\n\nWhat this signal means is that the investors don’t believe in you yet; they know they’ll have to pay more if you get farther along and have a team. If they believe in you they’ll invest. So reading the books the VCs read, getting letters of intent from potential customers, refining your pitch, and practice-pitching to friendly VCs in your network - those are the types of things I would focus on.\n\nA couple other tips when talking to technical co-founders:\n\n1. Like investors, technical cofounders need to believe you. Saying things like “I’ve done most of the non-tech work” is definitely not true and makes it seem like you don’t know what you’re getting into. The non-technical work of running a business is never finished. \n2. Being generous or valuing the company inexpensively is not attractive to great engineers. Great engineers would rather have a smaller piece of something great than half of nothing. If you have something valuable, your offers to a technical co-founder - and frankly, everyone who wants a piece of your company - should reflect that confidence. Cheaper isn’t better. \n\n\nGood luck!",

I have a pretty good ICP defined and a way to find leads. I don’t have much in the way of warm intros though so I think it’s mostly going to have to be cold outreach. I’m prepared to spend the next few weeks full time grinding on outreach in the hopes of signing my first 10 customers.\n\nIt’s been tempting to just go back to building since my fear is also that if the product isn’t good enough then my sales efforts won’t be worth much.

          "text": "Def a task. I’m nontechnical, but here’s what’s worked for me.\n\nReach out to your ICP and run real discovery calls. Start by introducing yourself and letting them know you’re running an experiment around X. Ask if it’s something that’s top of mind or a priority for them right now.\n\nIf they’re not interested, always ask why. Lean into curiosity instead of trying to get a specific answer. That usually opens people up. Even if they’re not your ICP, they often know someone in their network who is.\nDuring the call, ask about the problem, what they’ve tried to solve it, and what it’s actually been like dealing with it day to day. Go deep.\n\nOnce you clearly understand the problem from their perspective, then introduce what you’re building and see if they’re open to testing it to gauge real value and priority. Please don’t spend a lot of time speaking about the product you’ve built, or the architecture and why it’s better than your competitors. Keep the conversation around the value and how it helps solve the issue better than the other solution out there. Communicate the vision and inform them on the current state, integrity is soo important. And emphasize on how they have a say so on tailoring the solution to be the exact thing that they need since they’re an early customer vs. when it’s fully baked. That’s the benefit of going with you vs. anyone else. \n\nI usually start discovery calls with:\n“What’s top of mind for you this quarter?” or “What are you trying to accomplish right now?”\nThat quickly shows what actually matters to them and whether there’s alignment with what I’m building. As a technical founder, doing this in the early stages will help you tremendously on iterating on the right product, my technical co-founder haven’t spent enough time in the trenches with customers early on and once we’ve started having the back and forth, I started including him in our discussions which allows to align a lot better on the why behind the demand I would give insight on so we’re on the same page. But eventually, as demand picks up with your company you’ll be able to delegate. Spending time with your earlier customers is SO important…especially as a technical founder. Hope this is helpful, best wishes with it all, happy to stay in touch.",

You’ve got your ICPs, now identify the top 20 or so companies that you would like to have as customers and who you think would be most likely to want your software.

From copy to imagery, to small features or anything that comes to your mind. The end game version is to personalise it even to the individual decision maker.

In end, a sale is derived from some sort of persuasion that what you providing is going to enhance the end users experience, make their life better, etc. You want to do this in a fashion where you are not trying to sell them on your product features, rather the transformative experience. You genuinely want to have an interest in your customer, and show that you are going to be with them throughout the lifecycle le of them using your product. It almost creates a life long relationship. I will say cold calling is difficult, especially to generate buzz without people trying to immediately turn you away, which is why i recommend really focusing in on the non transactional piece. These people will be your evangelists and they will spread your company organically through word of mouth.

The temptation to \"improve the product first\" will hit constantly and you have to resist it. Our clients who break through as technical founders usually set rules like \"no coding until I've done 10 outreach activities today.\"\n\nThe mindset shift that matters: sales conversations aren't just about closing deals, they're the fastest product research you'll ever do. Every rejection teaches you something. Every objection reveals what's missing or unclear. The feedback from 50 sales conversations will improve your product more than 50 hours of building in isolation.\n\nThe practical tips for cold outreach as a technical founder:\n\nKeep the first email stupidly short. Three to four sentences max. What problem you solve, why you're reaching out to them specifically, and a low-commitment ask. Technical founders tend to over-explain.\n\nSell the conversation, not the product. Your goal in cold outreach is getting a call, not convincing them to buy. \"Worth a 15 minute conversation?\" is easier to say yes to than \"Ready to sign up?\"\n\nTrack everything from day one. Sent, opened, replied, call booked, objection heard. The patterns in that data tell you what to adjust.\n\nThe product quality fear is valid but backwards. You'll learn what \"good enough\" means from prospects, not from your own judgment. If they say no because of missing features, you'll know exactly what to build. If they say no for other reasons, building more wouldn't have helped anyway.",

But instead of manually doomscrolling, I built a small “engine” for myself: it sweeps across communities, cleans duplicates, flags threads that look like real intent (not just opinions), then gives me a short list with receipts (the actual lines people wrote) so I can reply like a human.\n\nThat’s it.

The classic pain point is the client or colleague who just needs temporary access without creating an account.\n\nMy persona is something like: \"A consultant or accountant who just spent 10 minutes trying to explain to a client why they need to log into a portal just to view a simple spreadsheet, and is now worried that file is sitting in an email thread forever.\"\n\nThe quote I often see in the wild is: \"Ugh, I just need to send this spreadsheet securely for a quick review, but I don't want it living in my Google Drive forever, and my client refuses to sign up for another tool.\"\n\nWould love your take on sharpening that into a searchable \"persona quote.\" Your method of building a small engine to find these exact cries for help is brilliant—it turns marketing into a service, which is exactly the right vibe.",

Getting your initial pricing right, understanding where to spend your time, and figuring out who the early adopters are in your ICP and figuring out how to get them to pay you, is pretty tough.

I think a lot of people will chime in telling you this early stage is the hardest because it's one of the stages a lot of startups hit first. And it's one of the stages lots of people in this sub likely have direct experience with.\n\nThink of it like a marketing funnel. Lots of startups hit this early pre-pmf stage -- if not top of funnel at least very near the top --  and fail. Very few hit the \"we just hired our 1,000th employee and coordination across an org this big is a nightmare\" stage of the funnel. They're both tough, though.\n\nPut it this way, the hardest stage of a startup is probably the one you're currently in. Whatever stage that happens to be.",

Sure you've got revenue, but now you've got employees, lots of users, and growth expectations that just keep ratcheting up and getting harder and harder to meet. You're always reaching for more, and as a result always operating somewhat over your skis. \n\nI've fallen into the trap of thinking \"oh, if we just get that next round of investment\", \"if we just hit that revenue goal\", \"if I just get this hire made\"...then...then it'll be easier. But it never really is, the challenges are just different. And in many ways the stakes are a lot higher, which makes it worse. \n\nBut really this is all subjective anyway. It's definitely not wrong thinking the early PMF stages are the hardest, because they're damn hard.",

At my second company we were iterating on it pretty much up until the point we were acquired and we were at multiple millions in arr. \n\n\nThink of pricing and packaging like any other feature. It isn't precious. Iterate on it as you learn more. Just don't do dumb stuff that screws your currently paying customers.\n\n\nE: I feel the need to illustrate that last point with an example. Years ago, my second company, Codecov, charged per unit and you purchased in blocks. For those familiar with software dev a \"unit\" was one private repo and you could pay $10/mo for a bundle of five private repos. This was jaw droppingly cheap, but we didn't know what we were doing. \n\n\nThrough looking at our sales data we saw that a huge (thousands of developers) company was paying us $10/mo to use Codecov with thousands of developers on one repo. Turns out they were using a monorepo (one big repo that holds all their code) which was starting to become popular at the time. \n\n\nWe realized with the move to monorepos that we weren't capturing anywhere near the value we were creating for our customers, so we moved to per developer pricing and grandfathered our current paying customers into per repo pricing. \n\n\nThis one change -- over the next year -- 3x'd our arr. It was probably the single most important technical and business change we made in terms of revenue. \n\n\nYour pricing isn't precious. Practices and expectations change, your customers change. Make sure your pricing changes accordingly or you may be, like Codecov was at the time, leaving millions on the table.",

I was never the best talker or the best at objection handling, but I led teams because I just asked everyone for the sale. \n\nMost founders I've met are scared of rejection so they hid behind things like having a perfect product, or getting VC money, or running ads to avoid conversations, or crafting the perfect pitch deck, etc. At the end of the day, if you can have 10 conversations per day for the next 3 months, you'll talk to 650 people. If you ask every single one of them for the sale, you'll probably get 50-100 new customers and 500 more people telling you why they're not buying right now (equally valuable). Whether that's a product deficiency or something else. Lean into the law of averages. Plenty of shitty products with large customer bases because this is exactly what they do. I know this first hand because my first real business was a magazine publishing firm that sold magazine advertising. Objectively not the best product in 2016 when we started, but I talked to 20 people a day for 10 years and now we have lots of customers. \n\nAnd when I say conversations, I mean get on the phone with people.

Even if you have a B2C app, find your ICP locally and pitch / talk to them in person.\n- iterate on your Lean Canvas before updating your product\n\n\nFounders often talk about “an MVP” as if they build one then enhance it. The reality is you should be building lots of small MVPs to test theories - like multiple landing pages with different value props to test ideas before building or clickable prototypes to share with interested users before fully implementing.\n\n\nIf you skip he market research (which includes testing with small MVPs not just talking to people) and instead just build the product then try to sell…. you’re probably in for a world of hurt.",

That’s one of the key benefits of remote work). If the remote org I was a part of last tried this approach it’d require the continental US dev team uprooting their lives to probably still frequently zoom with devs in Eurasia. The org could transition theoretically to an in-office one but I feel like it’s a Ship of Theseus situation that’d also be hugely expensive for productivity not even talking about relocation.",

I had thought that it might, and I was worried that it would, but it wasn't for the reasons I had thought it would just be people filling the available time, but I found: \n\n- It had a 'quiet car' effect -- people were less likely to want to interrupt someone to help them with a blocker because they didn't want to disturb\n\n- People had less opportunity to see what other people were working on when, so handoffs were way slower\n\nEither way, we did *most* of our meetings on \"meeting day\" but otherwise I found that adding back morning standups made people happier (in a way I never expected) and also made everyone more productive. Also it pierced the veil on not disturbing others, so we'd kind of see a little spike of cross-communication just ahead of and just after standup in which people would get their dependencies situated before it settled back down\n\nWe did alternate in-person (video) standups with digital (text-only) standups day to day, which people liked (and in weird ways was also more productive because text is a more efficient means of delivery) but people liked the connection\n\nAgain, YMMV",

There is nothing preventing people from doing a sync call outside the one day - I want everyone to feel empowered to do what they think is best for the business\n\n2) Quiet car effect - culturally I want people to do what they think is best for the business and if that means interrupting someone or doing a sync meeting on other days so be it\n\n3) We are striving hard to make everything 100% transparent.  It will still require individuals to post information that is concise and important for others to read as well as require individuals to take the time to read and comment\n\n4) I generally dislike traditional scrum standups for various reasons but perhaps a less formal optional daily sync meeting would make sense.

Thank god I go in on a regular basis or else I'd never get anything done\" (heavy sarcasm). Most people agree that the office is a distracting environment and they get less done.\n\nHowever there are a few exceptions....\n\n* It is nice on occasion to get together in person just to be able to chat/hangout/meeting in person. It's different in person that on Zoom and the change of pace is nice. It \\*can\\* be more productive - when it's well planned and executed.\n* You live in an environment where your home life is more chaotic and/or disruptive than an office. I once had a subordinate who went to the office every day, even in the height of covid, because home was small, several young kids, and he had no quiet/private work space.\n* You are the sort of person that \"thrives\" on the energy of a buzzing office. This is more for the sales types.\n\nBoth \"all remote all the time\" and \"all office all the time\" are imperfect. It strongly depends on who you are, what you do, your personality and a whole host of other factors. Myself? I \\*love\\* WFH. My work is more quiet and individual, I hate people interrupting my flow and fortunately my wife (who also WFH) is the same - we barely speak to each other during the work day. But I'd love for my company or at least larger group to get together once a month to have a day (or two) of big thought leading meetings. Not boring presentations, keep that on zoom, but brainstorming-lets-really-just-hash-it-out meetings. Unfortunately we're distributed across the entire USA so that's a little too expensive.",

Top AI experts get salaries of $500k+ and getting them to work for you can be worth 5M+ per employee. So just a good team of 20 experts, who will now all work for Nvidia, can be worth $100M.\n\n\n * They might be good at selling. Enterprise sales is hard, mastering it is a skill and building an effective sales team is valuable. Your product needs to be only half as good if you are a great at selling.\n\n\n * Maybe they had lots of revenue already. For sure they still had a high multiple but if they had $XXM of revenue already with a steep growth curve then obviously the company is worth a lot.\n\n\n * They could have had an internal champion that pushed the acquisition inside Nvidia. Additionally that person might have benefitted from the sale - an easy $50M is life-changing for everyone. I am not saying it happened here but these things happen.\n\n\n * There could have been an external champion, maybe the CEO of Nvidia is on good terms with one of the investors of 12AI and the investor spoke highly of them.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of non-technical reasons for a high valuation, many of which are probably hard to replicate for the average wantrepreneur on this sub. It's about a lot more than just \"build the features\".\n\n\nAlso tech companies follow the power law so just achieving 10% of what they built doesn't net you 10% of their financial outcome but probably something close to $0.",

This means the company has proprietary model architectures and research that complement NVIDIA’s compute platforms.\n  - Highly Specialized Talent Pool. AI21 employs roughly 200 researchers and engineers, many with advanced degrees and specialized expertise in AI research and development. This kind of Senior AI researchers with deep expertise are scarce and difficult to recruit organically.\n- By acquiring AI21 Labs, NVIDIA accelerates its research and development capacities and gains strategic advantages against direct competitors on the software and services side.\n  - They are buying the ability to more tightly couple hardware, software, and model development.\n  - Their GPUs already power many of the AI models, but owning the software stack and model expertise enables broader control of the AI industry.\n- NVIDIA’s acquisition strategy is focused on locking-in talent and innovation sources to dominate the future of AI.\n\n> People continue to rave about amazing AI coding tools are, why aren't people building tools like these to make big bucks in this space?\n\n- Because they lack the highly specialized skills and tools needed for AI scientific and technological research and development. \n- You don’t substitute 200 top scientists in the field with comercial LLMs and hope to generate highly valuable innovations that drive AI even further. So no, those highly hyped AI tools are not capable of substituting human talent yet.\n- You need access to great amounts of compute hardware to innovate in this field and it is expensive.\n\n> Tell me why is it fundamentally a bad idea to spend time and energy to replicate software that a12labs made called maestro using claude code.\n- As told already, NVIDIA bought a valuable company, their intellectual property, expertise and human talent, not just “a software” but all they have done and all they will do in the future.\n- You and Claude code won’t be able to replicate AI21 Labs and I don’t think there are many companies of NVIDIA size and interests to buy it.\n\n\n> with hopes of making 20% what they make.

For most of the people alive in the world even 100x less that that: 0.2% (6M) would be considered enough for retirement and generational wealth. I’m glad that you only want 20% (600M).

Building such a system is complex and I suspect they have many such systems in place.\n\nIt also has a nice bog in how they use parallel flows for the same problem and then assess which is working.",

In practice it mostly rewards people who enjoy posting, not necessarily people building something useful. From what I have seen, early growth usually comes from one very specific channel that matches how users already behave, not from being everywhere. For the iOS app, ASO plus tight feedback loops with power users can go surprisingly far. For SaaS, direct conversations and manual onboarding often teach you more than any public posting. The hard part is less marketing tactics and more figuring out who feels real pain and where they already spend attention.",

What keywords are driving installs? Can you optimize further or expand to related terms? The app that already has momentum is probably easier to grow than starting from scratch with the SaaS.\n\nThe \"build in public\" advice is oversold. Most founders posting daily updates to crickets would be better served doing almost anything else. The people who make it work usually had existing audiences or got lucky with timing. Our clients who grew without social media presence usually did it through direct outreach, partnerships, and being genuinely helpful in niche communities rather than broadcasting their journey.\n\nFor the project planning SaaS, the brutal reality is that space is insanely crowded. The differentiation has to be sharp and the ICP has to be narrow. \"Project planning for everyone\" competes with Notion, Asana, Monday, and fifty others. \"Project planning for freelance video editors\" or whatever specific niche you serve has a chance.\n\nThe channels that work when you have no audience: cold outreach to people who fit your exact ICP, getting listed in relevant directories and tool aggregators, and partnerships with adjacent tools or communities.

Messaging usually breaks before channels do  \n• Treat early growth as manual. DMs, emails, onboarding calls, anything that doesn’t scale but teaches fast\n\nX and Reddit work when you already have momentum. From zero, they’re mostly noise unless you’re solving a pain people already talk about publicly.\n\nASO getting you 1000 users is a signal.

          "text": "# I made lovable for mobile apps[](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qa1jrw/building_a_screen_recording_tool_community_for/)\n\nI'm Mark, a solo and bootstrapped founder based in NYC who spent the last 8 months building [Mozy.ai](http://mozy.ai/) because I kept watching non-technical friends hit the same wall. They could vibe-code a web app with Bolt or Lovable (albeit after spending thousands in credits), but the moment they wanted a mobile app, they were stuck.\n\nMozy lets you build production-ready mobile apps by chatting with AI, then publish to the App Store with one click. Design screens, connect Supabase or Firebase for your backend, add payments with Stripe, preview on your phone, and ship; all without writing code.\n\n**What makes it different from other ai-development tools:**\n\nMost tools are trying to do everything because software is a massive market. I built Mozy to be world-class at building mobile apps for iOS and Android. Simply describe what you want, watch it build, and iterate along the way. And unlike Bolt or Lovable, I leverage MorphLLM’s agents to write code faster (10,500+ credits per second) and use credits efficiently when making edits to save users money. Mozy handles all the brutal parts of mobile including App Store submission, TestFlight builds, in-app purchases, push notifications, etc.\n\n**About me:**\n\nI'm a full time consultant at a large firm working on construction projects, who's been building side projects for years. This time, I devoted the past year to building the thing I wanted to exist. I believe more creators will become founders and I hope to help usher in this next wave of builders. I launched on Product Hunt the other day but admittedly left it to chance (dumb, I know). Honestly, I thought I would build it and users would come. Now I’m a developer learning marketing :) If you have any advice, I'm all ears!",

Context is: I’m getting married this year and I am splitting my time between two different countries. I had a \\~similar feedback before from a friend who runs an accelerator.\n\nOf course I understand that being 100% obsessed helps with speed and all that, but how necessary is that, really?\n\nFirst of all, I don’t give a flying fuck to valuation - I want my business to give me free cash flow. It feels to me, however, that this whole “be obsessed” chat, 996, etc, is purely performative and nothing more than illusion fuelled by VCs who always need another round to pump valuation up. Similar to companies telling you to go above and beyond only to later lose a promotion to the CEO’s nephew or whatever.\n\nBesides, I don’t want to, say, postpone my wedding with the woman I love to please VCs. I don’t want to end up like Ebenezer Scrooge with my late partner’s ghost visiting me as I sit alone on Christmas Eve or spend it in St Barth’s with a plastic-ridden trophy wife.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I won’t work hard - I will and I do, but not to the point where I would be sacrificing other things in life that matter a lot to me too, like building a family.\n\nRegardless, VCs present that full focused obsession as the only way to get a startup off the ground, and I really wonder how real that is in practice, or, as I suspect, if it is pure ideology - nonsense that serves the purpose of keeping people in line.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

I've seen seasoned founders run a very even keel and build very successful businesses with minimal drama. From the outside their approach seems so casual that you could confuse it for nonchalance. I've seen big exits from full blown hyper fixating control freaks where anyone watching them would say 'yeah that guy's obsessed'. \n\n\nI think what's important is figuring out what you want from the business and setting your focus and output to meet that goal. When it comes to venture backed startups I've seen lots of different manifestations of obsession, but one thing always looked the same at the successful ones: everybody worked really fuckin hard.\n\n\nAlso, to be blunt, based on your stated goals: bootstrap your business.",

It's possible to get \"we'll wait\" at any round of financing, from seed to very late ones. It usually sounds plausible, something like \n\n* \"We'll wait until you get an MVP\" , or\n* \"We'll wait until you get past $1M revenue\", or\n* Or, or, or...\n\nThey do this to \"keep the door\" open to \"not to alienate\" the entrepreneur because who knows the future and you might run into them one day again. That's why it's always non-committal on their side. \n\nActing on such \"feedback\" such as setting a milestone and going back to them is a deadly mistake. It's pure dating in nature.

VC funds must return a significant premium to their LPs for 1/ the high risk they incur and 2/ the lack of liquidity (equity cycles from seed to exit are often 5-10 years).\nFor the fund to return that premium, and considering its investing at a very high risk on dozens of companies that are most likely going to fail, it needs to only invest in companies that have the potential to return the entire fund size. \n\nExample: VC firm raises $100M, invests $2M per company. It must only invest in companies they believe have the potential to turn $2M into $100M. It’s a common VC heuristic to “return the fund.”\n\nIt makes no sense whatsoever for a VC firm to invest in a lifestyle company that’s going to grow steadily but slowly. The math only makes sense for high growth high risk.\n\nThus, if the founder is signaling wanting a slower lifestyle with more family life etc, it signals potentially a lifestyle business (nothing wrong with this! Just not a VC-compatible business).\n\nToo often founders get stuck into thinking VCs are a-holes or greedy, but it’s misunderstanding: they might be just as broke as you are. It’s not their money, they’re managing other people’s, and they need the math to work. \n\nSo yeah they’re gonna look for obsessiveness in founders, unless you’re already a serial entrepreneur like Richard Branson and you’ve proven that you can make money while kitesurfing on your private island. \n\nIf I was in the room with you I’d ask you: are you sure you have a venture-scale business or is this a lifestyle business? I myself have a kid, and am not sure my new business is venture compatible. I’m bootstrapping it for now because I’m not willing to take on VC money and be stuck having to perform at that crazy fast pace. Because that’s what they’ll expect; and rightfully so. Maybe I’ll raise later if it makes sense, if the company needs it, and if I can build a team in the meantime which means I don’t have to sell my soul.",

They have a timeline that you're on the moment they put capital in.\n\nMy advice; assess whether your startup even really needs VC money. Try to do without. If you really can't, find a VC that actually clicks with you (they are not all the same, there are some amazing teams out there with ex founders that do know how startups work). Be ready to just ditch the others and don't even think about it. Focus on your company. \n\nLastly, full focused obsession is key, but that you can't combine it with a family or split living is nonsense. There are many founders that have raised families and have built multi billion dollar companies. It's super, super intense, and is 996 if you're growing, but it can be done.

I did weekly dev logs on Twitter showing real metrics and actual problems I was solving, not just polished product pitches. Demo videos of workflow improvements got way more traction than marketing content. I even open-sourced some non-core parts of my stack which got attention from devs who became early advocates.\n\n\n\nPartnership channels are super underrated. Other SaaS tools in your ecosystem (integrations, not competitors), agencies who recommend tools to clients, and implementation partners who need specific workflows. For Shopify apps specifically, the partner community and Editions releases were goldmines.\n\n\n\nThe ratio that worked: 80% genuinely helping people, 20% casually mentioning \"oh I built something for this.\"\n\n\n\nYou're right about cold email not scaling for big audiences.

A newsletter with 5k subscribers in your exact vertical beats 50k generic eyeballs. Find the newsletters your target users actually read and reach out directly to the writer rather than going through ad platforms.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that most early users come from doing things that don't scale. Direct outreach to people you've genuinely helped, asking early users for introductions, being present in the three or four places your ICP actually pays attention.

In other words - this is the framework that we are using at Leadsie - who are **hiring for the job to be done** that your software or service is solving for.\n\nIn order to find users for that, there's really no one-size-fits-all answer. The reason why jobs to be done is so useful is that you can put yourself into the shoes of your users to find out what triggered them to wanting to make that change in their lives. In jobs to be done, we always want to be thinking about what progress is someone trying to make in their life and what led them there.\n\nSo, for example, for us: agency owners who are sick of the back-and-forth with clients which is delaying their campaign launches and putting strain on their internal resources, they may be looking for a solution to streamline their onboarding.\n\nSo for this trigger, we can think about where would they be looking for the solution? The answers would be probably searching Google for for example access guides for different platforms, where we will be promoting our tool as an even better solution. Or it could be optimizing for certain queries and LLMs to appear for these. Or it could also be Reddit threads where agency owners are asking for a better way of onboarding their clients without the back-and-forth.\n\nMy short answer is the channel doesn't really matter. Think about the triggers and where your main ICP is going to be searching for answers. This could also be offline events. By the way, the book [Traction](https://www.amazon.es/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1F7L7SCJCMS9Z) actually talks about pretty much all the channels that exist and gives you a good scoring system on how to think about them for your business, which may be a good combination with the Jobs To Be Done methodology that I outlined.",

With a high risk of failure.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just saying that you will do better if you take a step back, focus on finding out what's local to you, and get that one person that you can work with as a first client. Then you build on that. You expand your network through that. You establish the business. You bring in clients to that business.

      "text": "In my calls with founders, I’ve sensed a lot of frustration with the lack of VC interest in funding a follow-on round. While I don’t want to provide any excuses, I think it is important to understand the constraints VCs face when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nTo start, when they raised their fund, they most likely promised their limited partners at least a 15% gross annual rate of return on their investment. Over the course of five years, that is a doubling of the initial investment.\n\nUnfortunately, only 1 out of 5 (in the best case) of a VC’s investments achieves an exit within five years. That means that the ones that do exit have to cover for the rest of the portfolio, or achieve **a minimum of a 10x return.**\n\nTherefore, when a VC is looking at a potential investment, the question at the forefront of their mind is “does this company have the potential to 10x within 5 years?” If you assume the revenue multiple stays the same, that means **the company’s revenue has to grow a minimum of 59% per year for five years!**\n\nThat is an incredible growth rate, met by very few private or public companies. Above a certain size, this becomes extremely difficult. For example, using the Q4 2025 median Series A pre-money value of $165 million and assuming 20% dilution, a company would have to grow to a $2.1 billion valuation within 5 years.\n\nOne can achieve personal and financial success without trying to strive for this growth rate. And there are plenty of sources of capital who can fund lower-growth strategies. Please do not look at VC funding as the only solution for your success.",

However, this approach has mostly led me to ideas that feel either non-profitable or extremely niche. Maybe I’m misjudging their potential, or maybe I’m not thinking big enough—but it often seems hard to turn these ideas into something scalable.\n\nAnother approach I’ve experimented with (and I know this might be controversial) is using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. I provided it with my background (CV), the geographic area where I’d like to build the startup, my budget constraints, and my risk tolerance, hoping it could help identify relevant problems and possible solutions. I’m curious to hear what you think about this method—useful tool, or a trap?\n\nHow do you personally approach idea generation? Are there frameworks, habits, or paths you’ve found particularly effective?\n\nThanks in advance for your advices.",

Reddit, Quora, Google reviews, industry forums. Find patterns. If 50 different restaurant owners are all pissed about the same thing, that is a signal. If one guy on twitter has a hot take, that is noise.\n\nThe scalability question is a trap at your stage to be honest. Most founders worry about scale before they have a single customer. Find something 10 people will pay for first. Then figure out if it scales. You cannot think your way to a scalable idea - you gotta test small and see what has pull.\n\nYour engineering background is an advantage but do not let it push you toward building complicated stuff.

We have a strong roadmap to $100K MRR within the next 6 months.  We are 3 founders, all with strong resumes. 1 founder has worked for Tim Cook, led the Auth0 exit to Okta and was a data lead for the Artemis II lunar project. Another has led two successful exits and has extensive front-end experience. I am leading the sales & marketing and have built a network of 4M target niche leads.  We have just hired our first employee.\n\n***Here is the meat and potatos of it all***. Recruiters from various organizations (SXSW Pitch, a16z, YC, NEXT AI, Vector, ISED, TechStars, etc) have reached out to us requesting that we apply for their event / accelerator / incubator. We fill out the requested applications, build strong custom pitch decks, tell a compelling story and ship our good numbers to them in our application. Heck, we have even had some big players sponsor us to apply.\n\nAnd every single time - rejected. In fact, one rejected yesterday. \"Thank you for your application. We are thoroughly impressed with your company's growth and trajectory, but unfortunately ...\".  (This was SXSW and we received our sponsorship to apply from Paddle/ProfitWell).  I am fine with it, if anything it strengthens our resolve. I can handle the rejection well. The primary issue is that I have no idea what I am doing wrong? I don't know how to course correct because I don't know where we are dropping the ball. I am sure that I am not presenting well, or perhaps the timing is wrong ... I don't know.

A couple of hours a week can be useful if it’s targeted, like listening for user pain points or tracking how adjacent teams talk about problems. Once it drifts into posting for visibility or vague networking, it tends to balloon without much signal. In practice, the teams that seem healthiest time box it pretty aggressively and treat it as input, not output.

If a firm is serious, associates will send you to the next round where you will either meet their LP/principals or they will forward your information to their investment committee for approval.\n\nAs a founder, what I am doing nowadays when an VC investor approaches me:\n\nIf I’m not ready, I don’t have to talk to them now, the pipeline is always open for me. This is very different from finding a job. \n\nIf I want to get started fundraising, try my best to present yourself, the team and my traction. Early investment decisions is not about TAM but founder’s quality. Experienced investors understand it takes time for a business to get momentum, they invest in the people not the early idea. \n\n\nTo your questions, most common questions I have encountered are:\n- Who are you and your team? \n- What’s your business? Business model? \n- What’s your market? Who’s your customers? \n- Who are your competitors? How do you know you will win the competition?\n\n\nHope this will help, and good luck 🤞",

I used to spend weeks building complex automations becuase I thought they were cool, only to realize nobody actually wanted the product yet. \n\nMy advice? Keep it dead simple. If you can't run the business out of a messy spreadsheet for the first month, you're probably over-engineering. It saves a ton of money on wasted dev time. Regarding your international question, I'd look for one specific niche in a smaller market liek the Nordics or Benelux rather than trying to \"go global\" on day one. \n\nAre you currently spending more time on the product features or actually talking to potential users?",

No marketing, no PR, no bss, just talk to prospective users and see what they would pay for \n- do not hire a seasoned strategy consultant since the only thing they know how to do well is bullshitting and they are going to do so even when you call them off for doing it. They work well in big corporates because they are good at hiding and walk their way out of troubles but they will sink your project.",

Not that companies were not working on AI before...but ChatGPT really break every rule there is. Before that, I was only concentrated on working and earning and slaving myself. I decide to change all that one night.   \nLesson no. 1 - Be ready to sacrifice everything for your startup. If you cannot do that don't think of a startup.Go all in.\n\nThere is a lack of platforms where startups are encouraged. You cannot fucking advertise yourself on any platform like Reddit for instance. Let's say you made something, I don't care if it is AI #slopware or who build that but lack of self promotion is a very big void in the space. And no one gives a damn to a running ad between two posts. No one clicks that. \n\nEven the damn investor or banks or anyone you go for money all say the same thing - they won't invest in a pre-revenue business. To wit my only answer is if I could make some money, I would not be here begging from you. \n\nLesson no. 2 - You will face a lack of support. Denials, a lot of denials and rejection. \n\nand lesson no. 3 - Always, always spend the money you have wisely. You would be required to take exceptional amount of risks. Because you won't have a lot of it unless you are born with a golden spoon or have generational wealth. \n\nWhat would I do differently? - I think I was not careful with money. So lesson no. 3 I will re read that chapter this year. lol.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

I'd been posting about the specific problems I was solving in my niche (bookkeeping/accounting automation), and people who'd connected with me months earlier started reaching out.\n\nThe pattern I noticed: they'd seen maybe 4-5 posts over time, built some familiarity, then when the problem became painful enough they remembered I was working on it.\n\nWhat didn't work was the content marketing playbook everyone recommends. SEO, blog posts, landing page optimization - all useful eventually, but useless for getting from 0 to 1. Too slow, too indirect.\n\nWhat worked was being genuinely present in spaces where my target users already gathered. Not lurking or pitching - actually contributing. Someone always knows someone who needs what you're building.",

Not running ads or working leads obtained externally, but cold calling your own contact list.\n\nLiterally, just open your phonebook contacts, and think who all can benefit from your service, or more importantly, who all are likely to know people who can benefit from your service.\n\nIf you have the runway, please do all work for throwaway prices initially (0-6 months). The goal is to build a solid testimonial base. And ofcourse, ask your happy clients to refer any leads to you. Nothing beats word of mouth advertising. Nothing even comes close.\n\nOnce you have a settled happy client base and you also know what works for your clients based on experience.... Then, and only then, should you target external agencies, ads, outreach, campaigns etc.\n\nP.S. In a service based business, the learning curve is extremely steep. Doing work for throwaway prices also helps you protect your reputation in the initial days.\n\nAll the best! Happy to help if you have any other questions.",

Design experiments to test things by making prospects put skin in the game. “Enter your email to be notified of our launch” is VERY different than pay $1 to be the first to access our product. Validate messaging, does a different CTA cause more or less button clicks? Validate with calendly, make people put skin in the game by spending time. \n\nI feel like I’m rambling at this point. Long story short, there are literally hundreds of micro experiments you can run to validate your business. Some give much more signal than others. The worst thing you can do is to give yourself false positive validation and then waste time building something that no one will pay for.",

If you're building a simple software app, it's probably a lot easier in many cases to validate your solution. If it's something like a surgical robot, you can't pre-sell it or you will go to jail. So you need to find other methods of validating the market and getting enough signals to know if you've got something that will eventually sell when you're ready. Even for consumer devices, this can be tricky. The Magic Link, which in many ways inspired the iPhone over a decade before its release, seemed to check all of the boxes for the kinds of things people were wanting to do with the internet. And yet, it just couldn't take off. On the other hand, the iPhone had so many detractors, it surprising anybody would have taken a product to market that was being openly ridiculed almost a year before it came out. And yet, 13 million units were sold in the first quarter, giving rise to a brand new product category and trillions of dollars in new market revenue that the so-called experts said had absolutely no demand.",

I’m curious how other founders approach this phase.\n\nIf you don’t hire full-time engineers early on:\n\n* What alternatives do you use?\n* Freelancers, agencies, fractional engineers, or part-time contractors?\n* Do you rely on your core engineering team to cover these responsibilities temporarily?\n* At what stage did you decide it was worth hiring full-time?\n\nI’m especially interested in hearing:\n* What worked well for you\n* What didn’t work and why\n* Any mistakes you’d avoid if you were starting again\n\nWould love to hear real experiences from founders at different stages (bootstrapped, VC-backed, solo, small teams, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!",

After these are achieved and only after is when we start transitioning to full-time employees. This system has helped all of our start-ups thrive with particularly low investments, making a path to consistency due to a very specific timing before hiring employees, essentially guaranteeing your company is in the position for onboarding real employees. Plan everything out, keep it consistent. Create details onboarding SOPs and create a training process to ensure new employees don't hold you back with: Time, Cost, or Confusion/Consistency.

It lets you share sensitive data—like financial models, client info, or project estimates—without leaving a permanent trace in the cloud. The sheet self-destructs after a set time or views, and recipients don’t need to log in or install anything. We’re targeting professionals who need to share data quickly but worry about privacy, lingering files, or friction for their clients.\n\\* Technologies Used: Next.js, React, Node.js, end-to-end encryption (client-side), Vercel hosting.\n\\* Feedback Requested: We’d love feedback on our landing page clarity and value proposition. Does it immediately communicate the “secure, temporary, no-login” benefit? Also, any thoughts on the user flow for creating and sharing a sheet—is it intuitive? We’re also curious if the self-destruct feature feels like a solution to real pain points around data anxiety.\n\\* Seeking Beta-Testers: \\[yes\\] – we’re looking for early users to test the core sharing experience and provide usability feedback. If you regularly share spreadsheets with sensitive data or collaborate temporarily, we’d appreciate your input. You can sign up via https://dev-ephemereal.vercel.app/.\n\\* Additional Comments: We built this after seeing teams struggle with overkill encryption tools or the risk of leaving data in Google Sheets/Dropbox. The goal is to be simple and focused—like a disposable notepad for structured data. All feedback is welcome, and we’re happy to return the favor for others in the thread.",

The actual first users almost always come from manually finding people who have the problem and reaching out directly.\n\nFor a voice-to-text app, the people with the strongest need are pretty identifiable: people with RSI or typing difficulties, accessibility communities, professionals who write a lot and hate the friction. Reddit communities like r/RSI, r/accessibility, productivity spaces where people complain about typing. Don't pitch, just be helpful and mention you built something when it's genuinely relevant.\n\nOur clients launching mobile apps usually find the first 20 users came from direct messages to people they identified as having the exact problem, not from waiting for organic discovery. You're looking for forums, Discord servers, or Twitter threads where someone has explicitly complained about the thing you solve.\n\nThe thing most founders obsess over too early is trying to scale before they've validated. You don't need growth tactics for the first 20 users, you need manual hustle and individual conversations. Each person who uses it and gives feedback teaches you something that makes the next 20 easier to get.\n\nAndroid app stores are a graveyard of undiscovered tools. Organic installs at zero reviews and zero downloads basically don't happen.",

The first use case that I can think of is the category of writers. It could be content writers, blog writers, story writers, voice note taking and folks like that. You could begin with bringing them together and just discuss, without focusing on Zavi right now, on how do they improve their productivity in terms of typing or writing things. \n\nAnother category could be founders who write a lot of emails, or maybe sales folks, and how Zavi could help them in the longer term, but right now focus on just creating engagement on genuine problems or genuine things that they do. Don't just directly choose a platform like Discord or anything else. Think about it, how do you want to do it? It could even begin with a newsletter, where people are sharing their responses. And it takes time to build up, it is not going to be overnight. Probably at the end of three months, you'll start seeing some results on engagements with a lot of strategizing and hit n trials. \n\nTry adding this prompt to ChatGPT, and then brainstorm with it to decide the steps you want to go ahead with. To me, it gave pretty decent results. I agreed with most of the things it said. \n\n\\#marketing, sales, community strategy expert\n\nI'm building Zavi AI- Voice Typing Keyboard\n\nNeed to build community around it, what and how should I do it\n\nIn short, decide on a set of problems, find the right set of people who face those problems, categorize them, choose one category, and then start.",

          "text": "Honestly, the \"closed\" part of the beta is actually your best marketing tool right now. Scarcity often drives way more buzz than general availability.  \nInstead of blasting links everywhere, try the \"Velvet Rope\" strategy**.** Go to where your users hang out like Discords, niche subreddits and instead of asking them to download your app, say \"I'm looking for 10 users to specifically test/break this one feature we just built. DM me for an invite code.\"  \nUsers who feel like insiders or founding members usually become your loudest evangelists because they feel invested in product's success.",

Sharing small progress updates in places where you already participate helps, like what surprised you this week or what broke and why. No links and no pitch, just learning out loud. The right people usually follow up on their own because they relate to the problem, and that interest is higher quality than forced buzz.",

          "text": "Closed beta is usually less about buzz and more about learning. The mistake I see a lot is trying to manufacture excitement before you really understand who gets value and why. A few dozen engaged users who give honest feedback is way more useful than a big signup number that never converts.\n\nWhat tends to work better is being visible where your target users already hang out, not pitching, just talking about the problem space and sharing what you are learning. People get curious when they recognize their own pain in your posts or comments. Also make it very easy for early users to talk to you directly, that loop is where momentum actually comes from.\n\nOnce you can clearly explain who it is for and what it replaces, the buzz part gets much easier.",
