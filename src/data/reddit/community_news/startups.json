      "text": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

Once you do and realize the business didn’t collapse once you let go, you’ll be able to breathe a bit easier and repeat the process.",

A lot women want resources from men. Its nasty. Ive seen it first hand. My Dad had a 6 fig income, retired, married... divorced just recent and maaaaan.... Its painful to see him in the finacial state. Wiped out by woman. He thought prayers and not taking action to protect himself would save him. Nope. So protect yourself at all times. Its a concrete jungle out there. Dont let nooooooo body, especially women that want to soften you up and, \"you cant be that way\", dude. Theyre their to open you up, never there when theyre wrong. You hold the cards. Hold them close. Use your best judgement. Keep your wits. Vet first, love later. A mans greatest folly, is his heart and his 2nd head. Good job. Proud of you. Now get to buying some hard assets, a trust, a finacial team etc. Still ways to go. congrats on cracking the 100k barrier.\nLadies , its not a shot at women. Its a warning to men , that I wasnt taught young, to guard your hearts. Mothers always warn girls about boys. Rarely do boys get warned about girls. Its no shade, just a grounding.",

In retrospect I think entrepreneurship is one of the worst life paths for people and probably not something you should aspire towards explicitly. I think you can NOW start to live again and prioritise life fulfilling things outside of work but since you hadnt achieved it previously you really couldnt afford to do so mentally. \n\nHonestly, I would just be grateful you finally succeeded because imagine if you had failed and were in the same position.

It helps keep me accountable to ALL my goals, not just my business ones. Making friends as an adult is harder, but you’ll get out of it what you put into it.\n\nSo many strangers helped me, never hesitate to DM if you want to hop on a Zoom call or something.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "(I will not promote)\n\nI've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

What I meant was, one should still consider their startup and even their own momentum in terms of the list as you have built it. \n\nIt's important that one also acknowledge that there are certain... caveats because you can't always show immediate adoption numbers, so you have to come up with other ways. \n\nYour list is a map, and a map is an approximation of the territory, so adjust accordingly. :)\n\nFor example, with my surgical robot I was able to present a list of over 200 surgeons in the field that had used the robot in a simulation setting and validated the potential clinical value of the technology. They weren't a direct adopter (yes), but they were experts who provided their insight of the future value of the device. \n\nRegardless of that outlier, I say your list is spot on.",

And that point about founders trying to “convince” instead of tell a clear story really resonates. The best conversations we’ve had were when we stopped over-explaining and just focused on what we understood deeply and why it mattered.  Feels like confidence comes from clarity, not from fancy words.",

I’m a 40-year-old father trying to understand how this new world works.\n\nTo talk to you, I spent hours researching your terminology like \"Technical Debt.\" I am sorry if my usage is awkward, but I found a deep connection to my world of finance.\n\nIn banking, we think about \"Amortization\" (how long an asset lasts). \nIf you build a \"Pop-up store\" (a prototype), move fast. Use AI and libraries. That's good business. \nBut if you are building a \"Shrine\" (a core system) to last 20 years, the cheapest way is actually \"**The Forging**\" (鍛錬) way. In Japan, the best katanas are forged by folding the steel thousands of times. Software is the same. You must fold the logic again and again by building from scratch until it becomes part of you.\n\nI see many startups drowning in \"Technical Interest.\" They take \"loans\" by using easy AI code without understanding the core. In banking, a loan without a repayment plan is just a disaster.\n\nIn Japan, we have a concept: \"Chiko-Goitsu\" (知行合一). Knowledge and action are one. \nReading about code isn't enough if your hands move slower than your brain. The friction of struggling without AI—**The Forging**—is where the real skill is born.\n\nIs the \"move fast\" culture making us forget the value of **The Forging**? I am just a banker, but I wanted to hear your professional thoughts.\n\n\n**Edit: 7 Lessons Learned from this discussion**\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone who joined this thread. As a rural banker from Japan, your insights have been an incredible \"Ethical OS\" for me. Here is what I’ve learned from your collective wisdom:\n\n**1. Technical Debt as a \"Strategic Loan\"**: Speed is an essential investment in the early stages (MVP). It's okay to \"borrow\" speed, as long as you have a plan to repay it. (Thanks Ray and others!)\n\n**2. The \"Shrine\" vs. \"Cathedral\"**: Don't over-design before you understand the soul of the product. Building a small \"shrine\" first and listening to users is the key to avoiding toxic debt. (Thanks Ok-Kaleidoscope5627!)\n\n**3. Forging is about \"Understanding\"**: Writing code is easy (AI can do it), but \"Forging\" is the process of truly understanding the logic. Re-writing is not a waste; it's how you master the foundation. (Thanks Capt-Kowalski!)\n\n**4. Leadership is Debt Management**: A good leader values the time spent \"repaying\" technical debt. Blindly chasing \"one-hit reversals\" while ignoring the foundation is a gamble that leads to bankruptcy.\n\n**5. Avoid the \"Museum Piece\" Trap**: No matter how much soul you forge into a blade, it loses its life as a tool the moment it stops being a \"weapon for battle.\" True \"Forging\" must be aligned with the battlefield of reality (PMF).\n\n**6. Strategic Survival vs. Capitalist Pivot**: Giants can afford to \"Pivot\" as if they are totaling a supercar and just ordering the next one. But for small founders, a single project is often their whole life; there is no second chance. Therefore, an **\"Exit Strategy\"** is essential. Ideally, we shouldn't just \"discard\" a debt-heavy module. If we can find a buyer or redefine its value for a future \"Buyout,\" high interest turns into a massive \"investment.\" (In reality, this is more often a lucky result than a planned strategy, but it’s the ultimate goal!)\n\n**7. Debt is like Alcohol**: It gives you a temporary high and power, but the \"hangover\" (interest/debt) is inevitable. Success depends on the \"care\" you take before, during, and after drinking. (Thanks Kaidomaru!)\n\nI will take these lessons back to my small bank in Gunma to refine my philosophy. I am truly honored to have met such \"legendary\" mentors here. \n\nArigato (Thank you) from Japan!\n\n",

For example, I consult for startups, and many of them must create their idea as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to demonstrate their potential so that they can get funding from investors. This is what Facebook did; they created a poorly crafted product then actually rebuilt the whole thing once they had the money.\n\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, there are serious drawbacks to accumulating technical debt. A business owner will have to fix their product sooner or later. AI code has made the issue much worse. AI makes the kinds of mistakes that even a bad programmer wouldn't make, creating issues that are very difficult to solve. Furthermore, as you pointed out, in many cases no one actually understands what the code is doing.\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, startups create more technical debt than they need to because they try to do too much too soon. The more features something has, the more expensive it is to make. It's better to create a product that does one thing well than five things badly.",

But startups are trying to discover what the market actually needs before investing in optimizing and forging because premature optimization will be useless if it's not a product that is needed. It's also a reason why big companies in tech struggle to innovate - they focus on scalabilty and quality to reduce tech debt before getting their product out and getting customer feedback which makes them slower to change and respond.\n\nA knife is a well understood product on the need and use case and design parameters which then makes sense on why it should justify upfront forging and great quality. But there was probably a prototyping stage hundreds of years before where blacksmiths tried different shapes and techniques (while taking shortcuts on quality) to find the best for different needs.\n\nUsually new software has multiple personas working with it and multiple potential solutions where it's not clear what to focus on first. Some people like to collect and document extensive requirements upfront to try to be more methodical, but often that fails too because what is documented isn't what is actually needed and you only see that when you build something quick and get it in front of users.",

You have woven an elegant tapestry of wisdom, but there is a loose thread I cannot help but pull: **we often do not know how long a piece of software will live when we write it**\n\nStartups often pivot and big companies can invest a lot towards initiatives that make sense at the time but ultimately don’t pan out, like Meta’s “metaverse” or the dozens of projects created and killed by Google. \n\nIn that case technical debt is less like taking on a burdensome loan, and more like putting clothes on a high interest credit card and hoping you decide whether or not to keep it before the return period is over. In that case what is kept is expected to be roughly within the clothing budget, including expected cost of care through its useful lifetime. \n\nAs long as the new features are not too coupled with the rest of the system to be easily removed or swapped out, there is less risk in knowingly incorporating modules with high technical debt, which has been a fundamental lesson of software engineering long before AI and will always continue to guide development practices.",

It works, and it's too expensive to tear it all down and start from scratch, because by the time you've finished building a new building, there will always be features and rooms you did not plan for. That is the burden of marching forward into progress; Nothing ever settles. ",

          "text": "I think an important thing to understand about software is that we don't know what we're building. Sometimes we know the high level idea but the details are not known when we start.\n\nSo if you think about a shrine, as software developers we are told to make a place for people to pray. When we start, we don't know if it is a shinto, or a Buddhist shrine, or even a Christian church. We don't know how many people will use it. Which people will use it. Where it needs to be built. What materials we will have to build with etc.\n\nSoftware projects are generally developed under two approaches - waterfall, or agile:\n\nWith waterfall we try to find out all the details and plan everything in advance and then build to that design. The problem is that because software is often trying to solve problems that we don't fully understand - we end up building a Catholic cathedral to handle thousands of worshippers when we wanted a small neighbourhood shrine. You are left with a well designed system but in a sense the entire system is tech debt that we then try to modify to do what the actual goal was.\n\nWith Agile we accept that we don't know all the answers and we start by building something simple, checking with the users to see if it works, and then iterating until we get it right. This means we start with a small personal shrine in their home, talk to the users, they tell us that they actually wanted it dedicated to Inari and they want it built on a nearby mountain. Okay, so now rebuild it or move it and add some fox statues. Then we learn that it's really popular and we need to accommodate thousands of visitors, so now we start building it to handle all those visitors. We still have tech debt because of all the previous versions that didn't really solve the problem, and because all of our solutions were designed by reacting to the requirements rather than planning for them. It's a different type of debt though.\n\nWe use waterfall when we write software for spaceships or things that can be dangerous if they don't work the first time. This approach can be expensive and takes a lot of time and results in large hard to work with software. We use agile when we write software for requirements that we expect will be changing and where it's okay to fail because we can try again. Most software is written with an agile approach as a result.\n\nWe get tech debt either way but different types and for different reasons. The only reliable way that we've found to prevent tech debt is by hiring highly experienced and skilled engineers who thanks to their experience can make decisions that avoid the tech debt before it occurs. Good leadership also plans for it and gives their engineers time to learn from their successes and failures, and fix the tech debt. Bad leadership sees something that is \"working\" and doesn't understand the value in paying down the debt, they just accumulate more and more debt until everything has to be torn down and started from scratch.",

If you are building a foundation for your software, you need to understand it in and out to be able to bend it to your will into something that is both performant and easy to understand. This writing and rewriting the code logic a 1000 times is exactly the (and the only) way to achieve that.\n\nThe goal of forging is not to write the code (AI could do it) but to understand what you are writing. Without that you won’t be able to change the code, it will be a security liability and likely a lot slower than it should have been.",

No one has a crystal ball and it would be arrogant to assume we know where our startup is in two years. Building all the foundation to last is often futile, and is a sign of inexperienced teams. The answer isn’t at single-use throwaway code either, really the only thing experienced teams do differently is recognise when you can be relatively sure where things go so you build enough foundation to support and enable future development without rework, but only when applicable.\n\nThe hardest part about this is that it’s not just a technical question, it requires superb customer and productisation understanding that is often with completely different people than the technical know how. Getting those people to talk, not to mention to agree, is very difficult. Which yet again brings us to the benefit of being fast in a smart way because the faster you get things exposed to the market, the faster you can learn and align.\n\nIt’s never 100% this or 100% that. It’s more 80/20 one way or the other depending on maturity, team, circumstance, market, etc.",

I can only imagine how you felt when that first email popped up that someone purchased a subscription.\n\nHave fun! This is where the real work begins! Give the users some time to form some opinions on the experience and either reach out personally or send a request for feedback via a survey form or something. You'll want to find out what drew them to the app, what convinced them that there was enough value to justify the subscription, are there things that they feel are missing or are there any things that annoy them, etc\n\nYou don't want to take the feedback of a handful of users as gospel, but if there are patterns across the feedback you get, that should help give you some insight and help perhaps prioritize what to work on next. There might also be some low-hanging fruit annoyances that you could quickly fix and keep your users happy.",

A small early push (newsletter, Slack groups, Twitter/X, hunters) creates a snowball effect. Once a product hits the top spot early in the day, it gets more visibility on the homepage, email digests and notifications, which brings in more organic upvotes. That is how #1 can run away to 300+ while #2 stalls at 230. It is momentum and visibility compounding, not a linear race.\n\nSo yeah, its less about “best product wins” and more about who shows up with distribution ready on day one. If you launch cold, the disparity feels brutal, but its mostly the mechanics of the platform rather than outright manipulation.",

I also think asking for feedback on a very specific decision works better than “can I get your thoughts,” it gives them something concrete to react to.

The best conversations usually happen *after* the official thing ends (we all know this, right?).\n\n**- talk about the problem, not the startup.** When you frame it as \"I'm exploring X because I keep seeing Y break\" investors drop into pattern recognition mode instead of pitch-evaluation mode - this is what you want.\n\n**- follow operators, not VCs, and build sideways.** A lot of intros come from founders who've already been through it and say \"you should talk to this person\". There's a lot more power in intros than we think.\n\n**- ask for perspective, not money.** \"Does this problem feel real to you?\" gets better engagement than anything resembling a pitch. They can smell a pitch from a mile away, beware.\n\n**- let it compound... slowly.** One good conversation often leads to two more if you keep showing up in the same circles. Let yourself be seen - however difficult it might be... you have to.\n\nCold DMs and demo days aren't useless, but they're noisy, the signal tens to come from repeated proximity and curiosity, not formal outreach.\n\nIf you're getting thoughtful feedback already that's a sign you're already in the right rooms, you just need to stay in there longer!

Half the time those coffee chats turn into \"let me know when you're raising.\"\n\nAlso worth finding out where they actually hang out. Some are active on Twitter/X, some do office hours, some speak at small events. Way easier to start a real conversation after commenting on their stuff for a few weeks than cold DMing out of nowhere.\n\nThe accidental chat you had worked because it was genuine. Try to recreate that energy rather than the formal pitch environment. Investors are just people who happen to write cheques, they prefer normal conversations too.",

      "text": "Over the last few years, I’ve had the privilege of working on zero-to-one products, scaling systems, shipping fast, and experiencing the real chaos of startup life.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I realised the problems I felt most compelled to solve were the same ones I kept running into myself.\n\nAlongside a 9–5, I spent nights and weekends building small products with a few tech friends. We made some money, and one of those products was even acquired for a few dollars. Still, despite those early wins, we never had the confidence to quit everything and go all in.\n\nThose experiences taught me something important: working full-time on something you truly believe in creates far more momentum than treating it as a side project.\n\nDropping out early and starting up on day one often sounds glamorous, until you’re responsible for putting food on the table. Reality has a way of grounding ambition.\n\nComing from a humble, lower middle-class background, my first five years of employment were essential. They helped me build financial stability and ensured my family didn’t carry the risk of my ambition. I strongly believe that starting up should never come at the cost of your family’s well-being.\n\nIn hindsight, choosing the right startups for my 9–5 was an education in itself. You get to experiment, learn, and fail on someone else’s capital while building real conviction about what works and what doesn’t. I’m deeply grateful to the founders who trusted me and allowed me to witness their zero-to-one journeys up close. Many great founders began their paths the same way.\n\nAll of this combined gave me the confidence, skills, and clarity to finally take the leap.\n\nI’ll share more updates as this journey unfolds.  \nIf you’re a founder, builder, or hustler working in tech, I’d love to connect and learn from your experiences too.",

Many startup content pieces skip over that part and turn risk into a personality trait. In reality, timing and responsibility matter a lot, especially when other people depend on you.\n\nI also really agree with the idea that choosing the *right* 9–5s can be an education. Working inside early-stage companies teaches you things you simply don’t learn building alone at night: tradeoffs, prioritization, customer reality, and how messy zero-to-one actually is. Doing that on someone else’s capital isn’t laziness, it’s leverage.\n\nThe side-project phase is underrated, too. Shipping small things, seeing what breaks, and making a bit of money (even if it’s not life-changing) builds pattern recognition and confidence that no amount of theory can replace. It’s not glamorous, but it compounds.\n\nTo me, this doesn’t read like “I finally escaped the 9–5.”  \nIt reads like “I earned the right to focus.”\n\nWishing you clarity, rather than speed, in this next phase. Looking forward to seeing what you learn when all the momentum points in one direction.",

We had some early well-tenured engineers working on the prototype who were solid - and quite proud of their work - but they never shared that the prototype they built wasn't meant for commercial use. \n\n(2) related to #1, great engineers (or any role) can be lousy communicators, and what I didn't know, I didn't know. So while we had some early engineers who never communicated the limitations of our MVP, our FTE engineers could not clearly articulate the extent of the problem - even though they knew. That made it hard for me to assess the depth of the slop (which seemed Grand Canyon deep). I asked a lot of questions because refactoring was taking a long time, and I was finally able to define it. But that took far too long and it was lost time not knowing what I could sell & how to adapt.

Got quite a few solid clients signed up. Then many other competitors started popping up, with investment and a much larger advertising budget. I got discouraged, burnt out, and ultimately decided to turn it into a background recurring rev business.\n\nMistake was not tripling-down on the outreach (efforts and ad budget/opportunities) to get more clients.  We had a unique niche (marketing agencies and partners who wanted our white-label solution under their brand). They did all the work of selling and building websites using our platform. Training was minimal (once they learnt the platform, very occasional support was needed - highly scalable), commitment was very high (some of them are still paying/using the platform - since they have many client sites on it). The problem was that they doubted that small businesses would still need their services, with all these DIY responsive website builders popping up, and hence it was harder to get clients.\n\nIn hindsight I gave up too soon. I should have stuck around much longer, and changed my pitch to the agencies. Our few existing clients are doing just fine and using our platform to build websites for their small business clients (who are not technical and don't want to mess with website builders, even now, with AI).\n\nBtw, many website builder competitors in those days with large budgets on VC money disappeared a few years later. I now tend to believe that the secret is in having the guts to stick around longer than others.\n\nWhat have I learnt from this?

Accounting and cash management was messy. \n2. There was no planning in terms of money. So we ran out of cash eventually since it’s a business that requires a lot of cash to buy inventory. \n3. We aimed too big, we wanted to build our own brand, so we designed and made our own product before business flow was stable and cost a lot of money. \n4. We hired too many “specialists” that burnt our cash too, marketing specialist, lawyer, PR etc. we should just do it ourselves.\n5. Some partners were not really putting in their best efforts. If you partner with someone, make sure you both work like a start up founder.\n6. Economic factors, lead time and shipping cost increased substantially. There were signs but no one actually took action to prepare for these uncontrollable external factors. \n\nMany more rookie mistakes. The most critical mistake is no proper financial and business planning. I learned it the hard way, key takeaways for me were: don’t aim big in early stage, control your spending, manage cash wisely, and look out for external risks.",

Real momentum, bigger clients, team growing, work coming in fast.\n\n\n\nWhat went wrong (the mistake that changed me):\n\nI scaled trust faster than I scaled structure.\n\n\n\nWhen the agency started taking off, I brought partners in to cover gaps like retention, CRO, and ops. The intention was right. Move faster. Cover blind spots. Build something bigger than me.\n\n\n\nBut I made a few mistakes that compounded:\n\n\n\nI built the company on verbal alignment.\nWe had a lot of “we’re good” conversations. Not enough written agreements that spelled out roles, ownership, decision-making, financial controls, expectations, and what happens when things get hard.\nI handed over leverage without guardrails.\nI stayed locked into what I do best: strategy, creative direction, production, client trust. I let other people control operational levers without the protections in place. Approvals. Access. Reporting. SOPs. Clear boundaries on who owns what.\nI ignored early friction because growth was loud.\nWhen you’re winning, shipping, and clients are happy, it’s easy to downplay misalignment. I treated red flags like stress. I told myself it was temporary. It wasn’t.\nI didn’t treat partnership like something that needs maintenance.\nNo scorecards. No measurable accountability. No documented decisions. No consistent cadence of “this is what done looks like.” So when pressure hit, reality turned into three different stories depending on who you asked.\n\n\n\n\nThe business grew, but the foundation didn’t. And when tension showed up, the lack of structure turned into confusion, conflict, and real financial and emotional damage.\n\n\n\nWhat I learned afterward:\n\nGrowth doesn’t fix instability. It exposes it.\n\n\n\nMy rules now:\n\n\n\nPartnerships need contracts, not vibes.\nIf it’s serious enough to build your life around, it’s serious enough to document. Roles, ownership, pay, access, decision rights, exit terms. Everything.\nControl isn’t ego. It’s responsibility.\nIf I can’t see the numbers, the approvals, the pipeline, and the output clearly, I’m not leading. I’m hoping.\nIf alignment isn’t written, it isn’t real.\nI document decisions when things are calm, so it’s clear when things aren’t.\nProtect the core before you scale the shell.\nSOPs, financial controls, client agreements, org chart clarity, and delivery systems come before bigger retainers and bigger teams.\n\n\n\n\nThat season hurt. Bad. But it forced me to level up into a real operator, not just a creative builder. I still believe in trust and collaboration. Now it’s built on structure that protects everyone",

If you cannot scrape enough FFF money together to do that, then what are you actually bringing to the table? Great programmers are constantly coming up with ideas they are weighing in their mind – what is the business potential / market size relative to risk and relative to how difficult and time consuming the product is to program and support. If you bring an idea and not sales/contacts/money then it's a bad deal for any programmer.",

However as a potential technical founder I would rather work on my own things solo then team up for this idea. \n\nYou're going to have all of the problems of an indie game studio and a startup combined if you start from scratch. \n\nYou need to secure funding to acquire an existing game that didn't sell to it's potential and re-release it, or find someone who is pretty far along the process of building a game and is willing to partner with you, add educational content for you finding funding for the rest of the game. \n\nHere were my initial questions/thoughts though that led me to the above conclusion. \n\n1. How did you validate it? Validating a game is hard, but you're also an educational tool, so you need to validate both sides. \n\n2. I don't think this is a startup, there's no way to scale this since games make 80% of their sales within the first few months and if you do a subscription model, you'll have constant churn since people only need to pass these tests once.\n\n3. What's your moat? Someone could vibe code a LSAT study mod into Skyrim in a weekend, Stardew Valley already has an ANKI study mod. I've never played Roblox, but I would be surprised if no one has done an educational game there already.\n\nI do think educational games will be a big thing in the future. It's just going to be hard to pull off and there's lots of competition. \n\nIf you're able to make the next Roblox/Minecraft/Stardew and show positive educational outcomes you'll be huge. There's also lots of ways to pivot/specialize along the way to keep going.",

If you don’t have any technical friends or folks from your network that’ll join in, then you need money. Money solves this problem and it’ll enable you to give away an order of magnitude less of your company. If I was you, I would focus on fundraising. Lots of smart, non-technical people raise on an idea or brittle MVP.\n\nEvery VC at every stage is going to tell you to derisk. At your stage, that’s proving you can hire a critical engineer. When they don’t follow up with an offer, that’s a signal.\n\nWhat this signal means is that the investors don’t believe in you yet; they know they’ll have to pay more if you get farther along and have a team. If they believe in you they’ll invest. So reading the books the VCs read, getting letters of intent from potential customers, refining your pitch, and practice-pitching to friendly VCs in your network - those are the types of things I would focus on.\n\nA couple other tips when talking to technical co-founders:\n\n1. Like investors, technical cofounders need to believe you. Saying things like “I’ve done most of the non-tech work” is definitely not true and makes it seem like you don’t know what you’re getting into. The non-technical work of running a business is never finished. \n2. Being generous or valuing the company inexpensively is not attractive to great engineers. Great engineers would rather have a smaller piece of something great than half of nothing. If you have something valuable, your offers to a technical co-founder - and frankly, everyone who wants a piece of your company - should reflect that confidence. Cheaper isn’t better. \n\n\nGood luck!",

I do all the work now and consult in dev, but, as soon as we need more help, I will just get people to work for me, pay them handsomely (always did this in 2 decades) and that's it. 100% ownership. After reading so many horror stories with cofoundings going south, I don't cofound with my husband, lest a stranger I found online.\n\n  \nAnyways .. I do hope you will be able to find what you are looking for, I worked in the past 5 years in fintech SaaS with people who are financial experts and had no idea what a SaaS even looks like. Not to mention some were women and they're not as geeky as I am. They have remote teams in place (mothly retainers, not employees) and are killing it.",

If the remote org I was a part of last tried this approach it’d require the continental US dev team uprooting their lives to probably still frequently zoom with devs in Eurasia. The org could transition theoretically to an in-office one but I feel like it’s a Ship of Theseus situation that’d also be hugely expensive for productivity not even talking about relocation.",

I had thought that it might, and I was worried that it would, but it wasn't for the reasons I had thought it would just be people filling the available time, but I found: \n\n- It had a 'quiet car' effect -- people were less likely to want to interrupt someone to help them with a blocker because they didn't want to disturb\n\n- People had less opportunity to see what other people were working on when, so handoffs were way slower\n\nEither way, we did *most* of our meetings on \"meeting day\" but otherwise I found that adding back morning standups made people happier (in a way I never expected) and also made everyone more productive. Also it pierced the veil on not disturbing others, so we'd kind of see a little spike of cross-communication just ahead of and just after standup in which people would get their dependencies situated before it settled back down\n\nWe did alternate in-person (video) standups with digital (text-only) standups day to day, which people liked (and in weird ways was also more productive because text is a more efficient means of delivery) but people liked the connection\n\nAgain, YMMV",

There is nothing preventing people from doing a sync call outside the one day - I want everyone to feel empowered to do what they think is best for the business\n\n2) Quiet car effect - culturally I want people to do what they think is best for the business and if that means interrupting someone or doing a sync meeting on other days so be it\n\n3) We are striving hard to make everything 100% transparent.  It will still require individuals to post information that is concise and important for others to read as well as require individuals to take the time to read and comment\n\n4) I generally dislike traditional scrum standups for various reasons but perhaps a less formal optional daily sync meeting would make sense.

The ones that mandated RTO because vibes felt off generally just pissed off their best people who had other options.\n\nThe deeper issue is that remote exposes management weakness that offices hide. Bad managers can't tell who's performing without watching them type. Unclear priorities become obvious when there's no hallway conversation to course correct. Companies with strong async communication and clear ownership metrics don't suddenly need everyone in a room.\n\nThe cynical read is that some of these mandates are quiet layoffs. Announce RTO, let the people who moved away or structured their lives around remote self-select out, reduce headcount without severance.",

But if you mean startups in the traditional sense then it generally boils down to a few factors:\n\n* They've still got an office lease they want to do something with\n* They think having \"butts in seats\" looks more attractive to prospects/customers/investors.\n* They have a lot of useless middle managers\n* They lean old school or micro-managery.\n* They want to RIF a bunch of people without having to do a real layoff.\n\nALMOST no one I've spoken with says \"Man, I'm SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE in the office. Thank god I go in on a regular basis or else I'd never get anything done\" (heavy sarcasm). Most people agree that the office is a distracting environment and they get less done.\n\nHowever there are a few exceptions....\n\n* It is nice on occasion to get together in person just to be able to chat/hangout/meeting in person. It's different in person that on Zoom and the change of pace is nice. It \\*can\\* be more productive - when it's well planned and executed.\n* You live in an environment where your home life is more chaotic and/or disruptive than an office. I once had a subordinate who went to the office every day, even in the height of covid, because home was small, several young kids, and he had no quiet/private work space.\n* You are the sort of person that \"thrives\" on the energy of a buzzing office. This is more for the sales types.\n\nBoth \"all remote all the time\" and \"all office all the time\" are imperfect. It strongly depends on who you are, what you do, your personality and a whole host of other factors. Myself? I \\*love\\* WFH. My work is more quiet and individual, I hate people interrupting my flow and fortunately my wife (who also WFH) is the same - we barely speak to each other during the work day. But I'd love for my company or at least larger group to get together once a month to have a day (or two) of big thought leading meetings. Not boring presentations, keep that on zoom, but brainstorming-lets-really-just-hash-it-out meetings. Unfortunately we're distributed across the entire USA so that's a little too expensive.",

Sure you've got revenue, but now you've got employees, lots of users, and growth expectations that just keep ratcheting up and getting harder and harder to meet. You're always reaching for more, and as a result always operating somewhat over your skis. \n\nI've fallen into the trap of thinking \"oh, if we just get that next round of investment\", \"if we just hit that revenue goal\", \"if I just get this hire made\"...then...then it'll be easier. But it never really is, the challenges are just different. And in many ways the stakes are a lot higher, which makes it worse. \n\nBut really this is all subjective anyway.

Distribution for that may be different than building, say, a vendor referral network for brides to be. Or maybe they're the same, I dunno I gave this example minimal thought 😆.\n\n\nPackaging last imo of the three. You will iterate on pricing and packaging until the end of time. At my second company we were iterating on it pretty much up until the point we were acquired and we were at multiple millions in arr. \n\n\nThink of pricing and packaging like any other feature. It isn't precious. Iterate on it as you learn more. Just don't do dumb stuff that screws your currently paying customers.\n\n\nE: I feel the need to illustrate that last point with an example. Years ago, my second company, Codecov, charged per unit and you purchased in blocks. For those familiar with software dev a \"unit\" was one private repo and you could pay $10/mo for a bundle of five private repos. This was jaw droppingly cheap, but we didn't know what we were doing. \n\n\nThrough looking at our sales data we saw that a huge (thousands of developers) company was paying us $10/mo to use Codecov with thousands of developers on one repo. Turns out they were using a monorepo (one big repo that holds all their code) which was starting to become popular at the time. \n\n\nWe realized with the move to monorepos that we weren't capturing anywhere near the value we were creating for our customers, so we moved to per developer pricing and grandfathered our current paying customers into per repo pricing. \n\n\nThis one change -- over the next year -- 3x'd our arr. It was probably the single most important technical and business change we made in terms of revenue. \n\n\nYour pricing isn't precious. Practices and expectations change, your customers change. Make sure your pricing changes accordingly or you may be, like Codecov was at the time, leaving millions on the table.",

I was never the best talker or the best at objection handling, but I led teams because I just asked everyone for the sale. \n\nMost founders I've met are scared of rejection so they hid behind things like having a perfect product, or getting VC money, or running ads to avoid conversations, or crafting the perfect pitch deck, etc. At the end of the day, if you can have 10 conversations per day for the next 3 months, you'll talk to 650 people. If you ask every single one of them for the sale, you'll probably get 50-100 new customers and 500 more people telling you why they're not buying right now (equally valuable). Whether that's a product deficiency or something else. Lean into the law of averages. Plenty of shitty products with large customer bases because this is exactly what they do. I know this first hand because my first real business was a magazine publishing firm that sold magazine advertising. Objectively not the best product in 2016 when we started, but I talked to 20 people a day for 10 years and now we have lots of customers. \n\nAnd when I say conversations, I mean get on the phone with people.

Even if you have a B2C app, find your ICP locally and pitch / talk to them in person.\n- iterate on your Lean Canvas before updating your product\n\n\nFounders often talk about “an MVP” as if they build one then enhance it. The reality is you should be building lots of small MVPs to test theories - like multiple landing pages with different value props to test ideas before building or clickable prototypes to share with interested users before fully implementing.\n\n\nIf you skip he market research (which includes testing with small MVPs not just talking to people) and instead just build the product then try to sell…. you’re probably in for a world of hurt.",

Top AI experts get salaries of $500k+ and getting them to work for you can be worth 5M+ per employee. So just a good team of 20 experts, who will now all work for Nvidia, can be worth $100M.\n\n\n * They might be good at selling. Enterprise sales is hard, mastering it is a skill and building an effective sales team is valuable. Your product needs to be only half as good if you are a great at selling.\n\n\n * Maybe they had lots of revenue already. For sure they still had a high multiple but if they had $XXM of revenue already with a steep growth curve then obviously the company is worth a lot.\n\n\n * They could have had an internal champion that pushed the acquisition inside Nvidia. Additionally that person might have benefitted from the sale - an easy $50M is life-changing for everyone. I am not saying it happened here but these things happen.\n\n\n * There could have been an external champion, maybe the CEO of Nvidia is on good terms with one of the investors of 12AI and the investor spoke highly of them.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of non-technical reasons for a high valuation, many of which are probably hard to replicate for the average wantrepreneur on this sub. It's about a lot more than just \"build the features\".\n\n\nAlso tech companies follow the power law so just achieving 10% of what they built doesn't net you 10% of their financial outcome but probably something close to $0.",

          "text": "I’ll try to answer some of your questions:\n\n> can anyone explain what so special about AI12Labs that can't be replicated and they had the MRR for Nvidia to acquire them for cool $3 billion dollar?\n\nTo sell something at that astronomical prices you need:\n  \n1.- Something valuable to sell\n  \n2.- Someone willing and capable to buy it.\n\nFor this question let’s focus on the first element, having something valuable.\n\n- AI21 Labs is a specialized AI software company focused on large language models and generative AI products. \n- Nvidia bought AI12 Labs as an entity, not one of their products.\n- AI12 Labs as a company is valuable not because of their ARR (which is around 50M) but because of their intrinsic value, which includes:\n  - Leadership in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI Technology. This means the company has proprietary model architectures and research that complement NVIDIA’s compute platforms.\n  - Highly Specialized Talent Pool. AI21 employs roughly 200 researchers and engineers, many with advanced degrees and specialized expertise in AI research and development. This kind of Senior AI researchers with deep expertise are scarce and difficult to recruit organically.\n- By acquiring AI21 Labs, NVIDIA accelerates its research and development capacities and gains strategic advantages against direct competitors on the software and services side.\n  - They are buying the ability to more tightly couple hardware, software, and model development.\n  - Their GPUs already power many of the AI models, but owning the software stack and model expertise enables broader control of the AI industry.\n- NVIDIA’s acquisition strategy is focused on locking-in talent and innovation sources to dominate the future of AI.\n\n> People continue to rave about amazing AI coding tools are, why aren't people building tools like these to make big bucks in this space?\n\n- Because they lack the highly specialized skills and tools needed for AI scientific and technological research and development. \n- You don’t substitute 200 top scientists in the field with comercial LLMs and hope to generate highly valuable innovations that drive AI even further. So no, those highly hyped AI tools are not capable of substituting human talent yet.\n- You need access to great amounts of compute hardware to innovate in this field and it is expensive.\n\n> Tell me why is it fundamentally a bad idea to spend time and energy to replicate software that a12labs made called maestro using claude code.\n- As told already, NVIDIA bought a valuable company, their intellectual property, expertise and human talent, not just “a software” but all they have done and all they will do in the future.\n- You and Claude code won’t be able to replicate AI21 Labs and I don’t think there are many companies of NVIDIA size and interests to buy it.\n\n\n> with hopes of making 20% what they make. This is more than enough for me to retire and build generational wealth\n- This is beyond laughable. For most of the people alive in the world even 100x less that that: 0.2% (6M) would be considered enough for retirement and generational wealth. I’m glad that you only want 20% (600M). Good luck with that.",

I use Manus, but often when it finishes a task I have to go back correcting parts.\n\nAccuracy can be achieved many ways. \nBuilding tools that validate answers, especially with data.\n\nBuilding tools the agent can use, so AI is not even doing the work.\n\nContext engineering will come more important. A smaller context with the right information rather than a large context with the right information present amongst wrong information yields higher accuracy.\n\nHaving a library of prebuilt architecture of workflows would improve accuracy. E.g. here a good template to follow for this task, adjust as appropriate. A more densely populated library of templates means less thinking is done by the AI.\n\nI am not in this space, but these are just ideas I have around improving accuracy. There will be a whole myriad of approaches where the more help you implement the more accurate the results will be. It’s a lot of work to make all these and then benchmark them and tune them so the right tools and approaches are used at the right time.\n\nEssentially it takes not much work to make an llm/AI/agent tool work at the demo level. To make it work at an accurate level gets incrementally harder and harder.\n\nEdit: Here is a nice blog post about the backend system they wrote to achieve higher accuracy then standard RAG: https://www.ai21.com/blog/structured-rag-enterprise-accuracy/\n\nEssentially deriving a scheme for the information (not sure if this done on the fly or via a long list of templates) then storing in the an SQL database to then be able to more traditional queries on it. Building such a system is complex and I suspect they have many such systems in place.\n\nIt also has a nice bog in how they use parallel flows for the same problem and then assess which is working.",

Context is: I’m getting married this year and I am splitting my time between two different countries. I had a \\~similar feedback before from a friend who runs an accelerator.\n\nOf course I understand that being 100% obsessed helps with speed and all that, but how necessary is that, really?\n\nFirst of all, I don’t give a flying fuck to valuation - I want my business to give me free cash flow. It feels to me, however, that this whole “be obsessed” chat, 996, etc, is purely performative and nothing more than illusion fuelled by VCs who always need another round to pump valuation up. Similar to companies telling you to go above and beyond only to later lose a promotion to the CEO’s nephew or whatever.\n\nBesides, I don’t want to, say, postpone my wedding with the woman I love to please VCs. I don’t want to end up like Ebenezer Scrooge with my late partner’s ghost visiting me as I sit alone on Christmas Eve or spend it in St Barth’s with a plastic-ridden trophy wife.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I won’t work hard - I will and I do, but not to the point where I would be sacrificing other things in life that matter a lot to me too, like building a family.\n\nRegardless, VCs present that full focused obsession as the only way to get a startup off the ground, and I really wonder how real that is in practice, or, as I suspect, if it is pure ideology - nonsense that serves the purpose of keeping people in line.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

I've seen seasoned founders run a very even keel and build very successful businesses with minimal drama. From the outside their approach seems so casual that you could confuse it for nonchalance. I've seen big exits from full blown hyper fixating control freaks where anyone watching them would say 'yeah that guy's obsessed'. \n\n\nI think what's important is figuring out what you want from the business and setting your focus and output to meet that goal. When it comes to venture backed startups I've seen lots of different manifestations of obsession, but one thing always looked the same at the successful ones: everybody worked really fuckin hard.\n\n\nAlso, to be blunt, based on your stated goals: bootstrap your business.",

VC funds must return a significant premium to their LPs for 1/ the high risk they incur and 2/ the lack of liquidity (equity cycles from seed to exit are often 5-10 years).\nFor the fund to return that premium, and considering its investing at a very high risk on dozens of companies that are most likely going to fail, it needs to only invest in companies that have the potential to return the entire fund size. \n\nExample: VC firm raises $100M, invests $2M per company. It must only invest in companies they believe have the potential to turn $2M into $100M. It’s a common VC heuristic to “return the fund.”\n\nIt makes no sense whatsoever for a VC firm to invest in a lifestyle company that’s going to grow steadily but slowly. The math only makes sense for high growth high risk.\n\nThus, if the founder is signaling wanting a slower lifestyle with more family life etc, it signals potentially a lifestyle business (nothing wrong with this! Just not a VC-compatible business).\n\nToo often founders get stuck into thinking VCs are a-holes or greedy, but it’s misunderstanding: they might be just as broke as you are. It’s not their money, they’re managing other people’s, and they need the math to work. \n\nSo yeah they’re gonna look for obsessiveness in founders, unless you’re already a serial entrepreneur like Richard Branson and you’ve proven that you can make money while kitesurfing on your private island. \n\nIf I was in the room with you I’d ask you: are you sure you have a venture-scale business or is this a lifestyle business? I myself have a kid, and am not sure my new business is venture compatible. I’m bootstrapping it for now because I’m not willing to take on VC money and be stuck having to perform at that crazy fast pace. Because that’s what they’ll expect; and rightfully so. Maybe I’ll raise later if it makes sense, if the company needs it, and if I can build a team in the meantime which means I don’t have to sell my soul.",

Unless you're very close to the person personally.\n\nIMO, A fair amount of VC's don't really know what they're talking about and work with the heuristics they know. That said, a lot of VC's want to bet on >100x opportunities for their fund to work. They have a timeline that you're on the moment they put capital in.\n\nMy advice; assess whether your startup even really needs VC money. Try to do without. If you really can't, find a VC that actually clicks with you (they are not all the same, there are some amazing teams out there with ex founders that do know how startups work). Be ready to just ditch the others and don't even think about it. Focus on your company. \n\nLastly, full focused obsession is key, but that you can't combine it with a family or split living is nonsense. There are many founders that have raised families and have built multi billion dollar companies. It's super, super intense, and is 996 if you're growing, but it can be done. But, with some obsession.",

Demo videos of workflow improvements got way more traction than marketing content. I even open-sourced some non-core parts of my stack which got attention from devs who became early advocates.\n\n\n\nPartnership channels are super underrated. Other SaaS tools in your ecosystem (integrations, not competitors), agencies who recommend tools to clients, and implementation partners who need specific workflows. For Shopify apps specifically, the partner community and Editions releases were goldmines.\n\n\n\nThe ratio that worked: 80% genuinely helping people, 20% casually mentioning \"oh I built something for this.\"\n\n\n\nYou're right about cold email not scaling for big audiences.

In other words - this is the framework that we are using at Leadsie - who are **hiring for the job to be done** that your software or service is solving for.\n\nIn order to find users for that, there's really no one-size-fits-all answer. The reason why jobs to be done is so useful is that you can put yourself into the shoes of your users to find out what triggered them to wanting to make that change in their lives. In jobs to be done, we always want to be thinking about what progress is someone trying to make in their life and what led them there.\n\nSo, for example, for us: agency owners who are sick of the back-and-forth with clients which is delaying their campaign launches and putting strain on their internal resources, they may be looking for a solution to streamline their onboarding.\n\nSo for this trigger, we can think about where would they be looking for the solution? The answers would be probably searching Google for for example access guides for different platforms, where we will be promoting our tool as an even better solution. Or it could be optimizing for certain queries and LLMs to appear for these. Or it could also be Reddit threads where agency owners are asking for a better way of onboarding their clients without the back-and-forth.\n\nMy short answer is the channel doesn't really matter. Think about the triggers and where your main ICP is going to be searching for answers. This could also be offline events. By the way, the book [Traction](https://www.amazon.es/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1F7L7SCJCMS9Z) actually talks about pretty much all the channels that exist and gives you a good scoring system on how to think about them for your business, which may be a good combination with the Jobs To Be Done methodology that I outlined.",

      "text": "In my calls with founders, I’ve sensed a lot of frustration with the lack of VC interest in funding a follow-on round. While I don’t want to provide any excuses, I think it is important to understand the constraints VCs face when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nTo start, when they raised their fund, they most likely promised their limited partners at least a 15% gross annual rate of return on their investment. Over the course of five years, that is a doubling of the initial investment.\n\nUnfortunately, only 1 out of 5 (in the best case) of a VC’s investments achieves an exit within five years. That means that the ones that do exit have to cover for the rest of the portfolio, or achieve **a minimum of a 10x return.**\n\nTherefore, when a VC is looking at a potential investment, the question at the forefront of their mind is “does this company have the potential to 10x within 5 years?” If you assume the revenue multiple stays the same, that means **the company’s revenue has to grow a minimum of 59% per year for five years!**\n\nThat is an incredible growth rate, met by very few private or public companies. Above a certain size, this becomes extremely difficult. For example, using the Q4 2025 median Series A pre-money value of $165 million and assuming 20% dilution, a company would have to grow to a $2.1 billion valuation within 5 years.\n\nOne can achieve personal and financial success without trying to strive for this growth rate. And there are plenty of sources of capital who can fund lower-growth strategies. Please do not look at VC funding as the only solution for your success.",

Recruiters from various organizations (SXSW Pitch, a16z, YC, NEXT AI, Vector, ISED, TechStars, etc) have reached out to us requesting that we apply for their event / accelerator / incubator. We fill out the requested applications, build strong custom pitch decks, tell a compelling story and ship our good numbers to them in our application. Heck, we have even had some big players sponsor us to apply.\n\nAnd every single time - rejected. In fact, one rejected yesterday. \"Thank you for your application. We are thoroughly impressed with your company's growth and trajectory, but unfortunately ...\".  (This was SXSW and we received our sponsorship to apply from Paddle/ProfitWell).  I am fine with it, if anything it strengthens our resolve. I can handle the rejection well. The primary issue is that I have no idea what I am doing wrong? I don't know how to course correct because I don't know where we are dropping the ball. I am sure that I am not presenting well, or perhaps the timing is wrong ... I don't know.

      "text": "Hello everyone,  \nI’m an engineering university student and aspiring entrepreneur, and I’m currently struggling with one of the most common questions: where do scalable and profitable startup ideas actually come from?\n\nI’ve tried starting from problems I personally face in everyday life and thinking about how to solve them in a way that could benefit others. However, this approach has mostly led me to ideas that feel either non-profitable or extremely niche. Maybe I’m misjudging their potential, or maybe I’m not thinking big enough—but it often seems hard to turn these ideas into something scalable.\n\nAnother approach I’ve experimented with (and I know this might be controversial) is using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. I provided it with my background (CV), the geographic area where I’d like to build the startup, my budget constraints, and my risk tolerance, hoping it could help identify relevant problems and possible solutions. I’m curious to hear what you think about this method—useful tool, or a trap?\n\nHow do you personally approach idea generation? Are there frameworks, habits, or paths you’ve found particularly effective?\n\nThanks in advance for your advices.",

Not that companies were not working on AI before...but ChatGPT really break every rule there is. Before that, I was only concentrated on working and earning and slaving myself. I decide to change all that one night.   \nLesson no. 1 - Be ready to sacrifice everything for your startup. If you cannot do that don't think of a startup.Go all in.\n\nThere is a lack of platforms where startups are encouraged. You cannot fucking advertise yourself on any platform like Reddit for instance. Let's say you made something, I don't care if it is AI #slopware or who build that but lack of self promotion is a very big void in the space. And no one gives a damn to a running ad between two posts. No one clicks that. \n\nEven the damn investor or banks or anyone you go for money all say the same thing - they won't invest in a pre-revenue business. To wit my only answer is if I could make some money, I would not be here begging from you. \n\nLesson no. 2 - You will face a lack of support. Denials, a lot of denials and rejection. \n\nand lesson no. 3 - Always, always spend the money you have wisely. You would be required to take exceptional amount of risks. Because you won't have a lot of it unless you are born with a golden spoon or have generational wealth. \n\nWhat would I do differently? - I think I was not careful with money. So lesson no. 3 I will re read that chapter this year. lol.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

The goal is to build a solid testimonial base. And ofcourse, ask your happy clients to refer any leads to you. Nothing beats word of mouth advertising. Nothing even comes close.\n\nOnce you have a settled happy client base and you also know what works for your clients based on experience.... Then, and only then, should you target external agencies, ads, outreach, campaigns etc.\n\nP.S. In a service based business, the learning curve is extremely steep.

Design experiments to test things by making prospects put skin in the game. “Enter your email to be notified of our launch” is VERY different than pay $1 to be the first to access our product. Validate messaging, does a different CTA cause more or less button clicks? Validate with calendly, make people put skin in the game by spending time. \n\nI feel like I’m rambling at this point. Long story short, there are literally hundreds of micro experiments you can run to validate your business. Some give much more signal than others.

A penniless schmuck playing *fake it 'til you make it* is just a plain vanilla impostor.\n\nThis propagandizing, these delusions of adequacy distort the validation process because the founders are allergic to reality. Whatever the technique, however long it takes, they just screw themselves.\n\nI think some people may await ultimate truth.

If you're building a simple software app, it's probably a lot easier in many cases to validate your solution. If it's something like a surgical robot, you can't pre-sell it or you will go to jail. So you need to find other methods of validating the market and getting enough signals to know if you've got something that will eventually sell when you're ready. Even for consumer devices, this can be tricky. The Magic Link, which in many ways inspired the iPhone over a decade before its release, seemed to check all of the boxes for the kinds of things people were wanting to do with the internet. And yet, it just couldn't take off. On the other hand, the iPhone had so many detractors, it surprising anybody would have taken a product to market that was being openly ridiculed almost a year before it came out. And yet, 13 million units were sold in the first quarter, giving rise to a brand new product category and trillions of dollars in new market revenue that the so-called experts said had absolutely no demand.",

I’m curious how other founders approach this phase.\n\nIf you don’t hire full-time engineers early on:\n\n* What alternatives do you use?\n* Freelancers, agencies, fractional engineers, or part-time contractors?\n* Do you rely on your core engineering team to cover these responsibilities temporarily?\n* At what stage did you decide it was worth hiring full-time?\n\nI’m especially interested in hearing:\n* What worked well for you\n* What didn’t work and why\n* Any mistakes you’d avoid if you were starting again\n\nWould love to hear real experiences from founders at different stages (bootstrapped, VC-backed, solo, small teams, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!",

At the same time, some investors clearly back people and market theses early.\n\nSo my honest question to founders and investors here:\n\nHave you seen pre-seed rounds happen without an MVP in recent years? Under what conditions did it work - and when didn’t it?\n\nI’m not looking for hype, just real-world experiences and perspectives.",

This phase for us is about proving clarity of thinking and execution logic before scaling.\nWe’re aware that without prior exits or Bay Area pedigree, the bar is higher - that’s part of the learning curve we’re actively working through.

Even with $30MM in the bank, folks still love their Excel becuase it’s the only place you can actually \"fix\" a weird Stripe edge case before an investor sees it.\n\nMy advice: don't over-engineer it yet. A simple SQL-to-Sheets script or a basic connector is usually enough. You don't need a full BI suite to tell you if you're growing. The trade-off is always speed vs. \"perfect\" live data—and at your stage, speed wins. Wasting dev hours on a fancy Mixpanel setup nobody looks at is just burning money for vanity.\n\nHow often are your investors actually asking for these updates?

I kept thinking the core technical problem was really hard, so I spent months building a custom system around it. I hired some engineers, failed miserably to find the right engineers, it’s a niche technical skill in AI, wasted time on wrong hires and honestly just ended up me tightening mg sleeves and building it all by myself. (And poorly, lot of bugs)\n\nA few weeks ago I decided I am done fixing these bugs, it’s never ending. (The problem is my product requires very low latency to even verify my MVP. I could not have launched it unless it was functional). I didn’t even reach the phase of fail fast because I really thought I was just a few weeks away, and it’s been months now. I finally tried a different open-source framework that I repurposed… and it basically solves the core problem way better than what I built. It removes a huge chunk of complexity 70% of my codebase and makes everything cleaner and more scalable.\n\nObjectively, this feels RIGHT - as I can finally launch, and do the actual hard part, which is adding value in this world and gaining users. \n\nBut emotionally I feel awful. A big part of the last 5 months of work is basically throwaway, and I keep thinking “how did I not see this sooner?”. Yes hindsight is 20/20, but the cost of getting to December has been high emotionally, and financially. It feels like I lost a lot of time because of my lack of experience in this space. \n\nI know this is on me - some of you will say it’s part of the journey, but to me - it’s been an incredibly painful lesson and I can’t shake the feeling where I have to question my judgement skills or skills of a high efficient CEO if I want to build a 100M startup. And honestly it’s gut wrenching. \n\nTLDR;\n\nSpent 5-6 months building my MVP, living in delusion on the engineering scale. Now realize my entire work is throw away work because of an easier route to launch. Incredibly sad and embarrassed at my utter lack of good decision making skills. ",

      "text": "I keep running into a weird paradox and I’m curious how technical founders think about it.\n\nEveryone says ship fast. Get an MVP out. Talk to users. Iterate.\n\nI agree with that. I’m building a consumer product right now and I’m trying to move fast on features and experiments.\n\nBut I come from a marketing and product design background. And I’ve seen, over and over, how brutally sensitive conversion and activation is to “small” stuff (especially in consumer). One headline change. One extra sentence that makes the user feel safe (or even better, one sentence less). Slightly different layout. Less cognitive load. Suddenly signup rate doubles, activation moves, retention looks different. Same product, different packaging.\n\nSo here’s my question.\n\nWhen you ship an MVP fast with rough copy and rough UX, and it converts poorly, what are you actually learning?\n\nAre you learning that the idea is weak, or that you presented it like a confused person at a loud party.\n\nMy suspicion is that a non trivial number of potentially great products died early because the first version looked and felt bad, and the data said “users don’t want this” when the real answer was “users didn’t understand it or trust it enough to try.”\n\nAs a non technical founder, I can obsess over copy and landing pages because that’s my world. But if you’re technical and shipping quickly, how do you avoid that trap without slowing down to a crawl?\n\nSome concrete questions I’d love honest answers to, from technical founders:\n\n* How do you decide what level of UX and copy quality is “good enough” to test the idea fairly?\n* Do you bake in a basic design system and reusable components from day one so everything looks credible, even when the product is incomplete?\n* Do you treat early conversion numbers as mostly noise and focus on qualitative feedback first?\n* Do you have a process where you fix obvious UX issues before you draw conclusions from metrics?\n* How do you separate “bad funnel” from “bad product” when you’re moving fast?\n\nI’m not talking about polishing for months. I’m talking about that minimum viable level of clarity and trust where a user can understand the value, feel safe, and take the next step.\n\nWould love to hear how you handle this in practice. Especially from people who’ve done a lot of rapid prototyping and actually killed or saved products based on early data.",

          "text": "I think \"MVP Launch\" can be an overstatement as it can imply \"ready for marketing, promotion, and sales.\" It should be limited in scope, hence the term minimum, but it should be polished. You get polished by involving potential customers, sitting with them and asking for their feedback. Feedback on messaging and positioning, feedback on UI and UX. I like to think of it more of a draft for iteration and refinement. Once refined, then launch.\n\nEssentially, get close with potential customers to understand them and their unmet need, develop a proposed solution and present it to them. This presentation in early iterations might be simple drawings, or mockups, then maybe you develop what you think is your MVP based on the learnings and feedback. Then get feedback and iterate on the MVP. Finally, with that refinement in hand, launch the MVP to start gathering metrics such as conversion rate and some scale.",

Someone ships something that looks like it was designed by a developer who hates users, gets no signups, and concludes the market doesn't want it. Maybe the market just didn't trust the landing page enough to try.\n\nThe \"good enough\" bar for me is whether the core value prop is clear within 5 seconds of landing on the page. Not polished, not beautiful, just clear. If a stranger can't immediately understand what this does and why they should care, you're testing your copy skills not your product idea.\n\nWith our clients doing rapid validation the approach that works is ugly but clear beats pretty but confusing. A basic landing page with one headline, one sentence of explanation, and one CTA will tell you more than a beautifully designed page where the value prop is buried. Template design systems like Tailwind UI exist specifically so technical founders can ship something credible-looking without spending weeks on design.\n\nThe qualitative versus quantitative split matters here. If your first 50 visitors all bounce without understanding what the product does, that's presentation. If they understand it clearly and still bounce, that's the idea.",

I've seen plenty of solid ideas go to the graveyard just becuase the landing page looked like a ransom note. You don't need a month of polish, but you do need a \"trust baseline.\" My rule of thumb is to use a standard UI kit so it looks \"pro\" out of the box, and spend an afternoon on the headline. If the copy doesn't clearly say what problem you're solving, you aren't testing the product, you're testing people's patience. It's liek trying to sell a car with the hood welded shut. Quick question: are you getting any qualitative feedback yet, or just staring at the bounce rates? Sometimes five minutes watching a user struggle on Zoom is worth more than a month of data.",
