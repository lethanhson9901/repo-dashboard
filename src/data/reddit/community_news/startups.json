It’s a corporate owned sub that they manage actively, so I specifically said, this is directly yc related and useful for Canadians who were thinking of applying (like I once was before proceeding with better options). Within 3 minutes it was taken down, and their mod stated no reason why + no response to direct outreach\n\nJust another reminder these companies aren’t shining beacons on a hill, and don’t generally have your best interests in mind; they are a VC with good marketing. If it fits your path awesome, but don’t fall for the propaganda it’s what you need to grow (we ended up going with another accelerator that fit our growth better)",

Canada is now being treated like nearly every other country in the world by YC.\n\nThat said - I agree a lot with your conclusion, even though I feel like it has little to do with the Canadian company change. YC is just trying to make money like everyone else (that’s how capitalism works). They are not our friend or magical in some way, and VC funding in general is not for every startup - there are huge down sides to consider for sure.",

Do you feel like they have/have always had somehow a negative attitude about, say, European applicants (since they have never invested in European companies)?

It’s not that they do investments in companies from the Cayman Islands because they love applicants from there, but rather because it’s common and advantageous for companies to incorporate there (from outside of the Cayman Islands).",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some honest perspective here.\n\nI recently joined a company of 200+ employees as a VP (strategy-focused role). The people are great, the values are strong, culture is good, and overall it feels like there’s a ton of potential.\n\nBut I’ve been kind of shocked by how the executive team actually operates day to day.\n\nMost of the leadership time seems to go into very operational stuff. Weekly meetings are basically project-by-project check-ins, super granular. Monthly meetings are mostly just reporting on last month’s results. Like…this meeting could have been an email kind of vibe. And in the last three months, I honestly haven’t seen a real strategic conversation… like working on the business instead of just in it.\n\nWhat also throws me off is how unprepared a lot of these meetings feel. No agenda, no pre-read, no notes, no follow-up. People show up and kind of wing it. It’s not toxic or anything, the vibe is friendly, but it feels… soft? Like this company could seriously level up if the exec layer was more structured and intentional.\n\nMy issue is: I’m new, and this isn’t technically “my job” to fix right now. I really don’t want to be the guy who walks in and starts criticizing everything or trying to change the culture overnight.\n\nBut at the same time, it feels like such a missed opportunity.\n\nSo I’m torn. Do I bring it up privately with the CEO? Do I just focus on modeling better structure in my own area first? Do I suggest an external consultant to come in and help with exec operating rhythm? Or do I accept that changing leadership culture is a massive uphill battle and not worth spending political capital on this early?\n\nCurious if anyone’s been in a similar situation. Would love any advice on how to approach this without coming off negative or naïve.\n\nThanks ❤️",

The people that successfully found a company are rarely the same one who grow it into a stable, thriving enterprise because doing so requires vastly different skills. \n\nWhen you’re small and fighting to survive, you can’t afford to be strategic and process heavy, and every detail matters, so you have things like project-by-project check-ins. As the company grows, it needs more structure, more strategy, and less focus on tactics… but the people who got it to this point are tacticians! You may be the first hire of the second wave. \n\nI suggest modeling the new behavior in your department and see if any of your peers gets the hint that the business is changing. Tbh, _true_ change has to come from the top to be effective. Hopefully, your CEO will notice that your team is performing much better than everyone else and s/he will begin to emulate it and push it down to everyone else (or more likely, replace them with other second-wavers)",

Many studies show that latest when you reach 18 - 20 people you need to start introducing processes and structures. These are boring, slow you down, but they are necessary, cause the number of communication paths among people grows exponentially, and roughly at that size there are too many people to still be able to communicate ad hoc. So, processes and practices keep being sloppy even with 200 people.\n\nThe second problem is that founders want to stay cool founders, rather than become ordinary managers of a mid-sized company. It's a self-image thing. Also a control thing. So, they become the bottleneck. Founders, to be successful after a certain size, need to go through a stage of maturing from creative visionaries to people leading a running organisation. Running implies that things also run without them for some time. That requires trust, among other things. Some founders know their own limitations and intentionally move on once they have founded a company of a certain size and then start the next thing exactly cause of that. Some succeed in outgrowing their own behavior, but without any help from outside that's actually not all that easy.\n\nThere are quite a few books and podcasts, often from the background of organisational development, dealing with these types of phenomena. The question is whether the executive team has any intention to become managers or not. If no, well, there's nothing you can do, things will stay chaotic. (Which may be charming too, to some extent. Or become toxic, to another extent.)\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you want to cope with that or not.",

I brought in someone with startup experience doing exactly this type of thing.\n\nWhen he first started I kinda hated him. He was picking apart things we had done and changing things. Probably too quickly. I avoided our meetings sometimes and felt personally attacked a lot. But deep down, I knew we needed to go through this. I had the typical, “I’ve been busting my ass for six years scraping by on scraps to build this thing and now you are calling my baby ugly” feelings. But the baby WAS a little ugly.\n\nSo, we powered through and now I could not imagine not having this guy. He has made us so much better. We have a process, clients know what to expect, releases are clear and documented, client requests are tracked and they have realistic timelines that meet their goals, and most importantly I get to do what I am good at without having to force myself to be a process person.\n\nSo, my advice is do your job and bide some time. Make your department efficient and get to know the leadership team. Then after a while start the conversations. They want to do well, they want to be better, but they have also battled through a lot to get here and you need to respect that. When you do start the conversations you need to not shit on the past, the best opening is “you guys did an amazing thing getting this startup off the ground, but we aren’t really a startup anymore and we have to make the transition to a sustainable company.”\n\nBuild the rapport before you start throwing bombs, but it sounds like the bombs need to happen at some point.",

          "text": "I’ve been in your shoes. What you’re describing is a common growth plateau for companies of 200+ people, the leadership habits that worked at 50 employees are now causing a 'strategic vacuum.'\n\nSince you are new, you have the advantage of fresh eyes.  Here are three tactics I’ve used to shift the needle without burning political capital:\n\nOpen each meeting with strategic thinking or a strategic window (The 15-Minute Rule): In your next 1-on-1 with the CEO, suggest that the team is so efficient at operations that you'd love to dedicate the first 15–20 minutes of every meeting to 'Horizon 2 and 3' thinking. Think of it as checking the flight path before discussing the meal service. This ensures the team looks at the 'why' before the 'what,' preventing you from getting lost in the granular 'blades of grass.'\n\nIntroduce 'ELMO' to Protect Time: High-performing teams often adopt the ELMO rule (Enough, Let’s Move On). It’s a low-friction, playful way for any leader to flag when the conversation has veered into 'beating the dead horse' territory or unnecessary detail. It creates a self-policing culture that values everyone's time and keeps the focus on high-leverage topics.\n\nHave an offsite retreat with a facilitator. Since you mentioned a lack of structure (no agendas or pre-reads), suggesting an external facilitator for a leadership retreat is a 'safe' way to introduce rigor. A third party can objectively point out the lack of KPIs or clear vision without you looking like the 'new guy' who's being overly critical. This allows the team to design a new 'Operating Rhythm' collectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Don’t wait too long. Start modeling the behavior in your own team but if the executive team is misaligned, your department will eventually hit a ceiling. Frame these changes as a way to unlock the potential you already see in the team.\n\nAlternately, you could suggest a code of conduct that everyone buys into, but you might be too new to make this proposal since everyone seems to get along.",

          "text": "Oye, there is so much bad advice in the comments here from people who have clearly never worked at a 200-ish size company.\n\nThis is actually really simple. OP - you clearly come from a very corporate world. The thing you need to understand is that a 200 person company is TINY. It's honestly, operationally, not a whole lot different than a 20 person company.\n\nThey are reaching an inflection point where the size of the company will start to require the introduction of more process. But you need to understand that companies this size are process adverse. Trying to bring in process that 10000+ person companies have to a 200+ person company is heavy handed and will be perceived as \"work in order to do the work\". Introducing process is _hard_ as you're in a company with the mindset of a 20 person company still. Process has been a dirty word for so long when they're so used to just doing what needs to be done because for the longest time they had to operate in a very reactive manner. They had to be flexible, they had to be nimble, they had to be able to completely pivot a feature area or shelve it and do something totally different on a dime.\n\nThis isn't Amazon. This is still a company that could, in the span of 3 months, totally implode. In the years to get here, living day by day has been the founders' lives and they are hesitant to introduce anything that will slow them down or mire things in red tape.\n\nHowever, as you grow, your lack of process eventually starts to be the thing that actually slows you down.\n\nSo - when trying to introduce process, it has to demonstrate a clear solve for a real problem. Also move slowly, iteratively. Trying to burden a small company with the process overhead of a much larger company is too much too fast and does not solve for problems they are necessarily experiencing.\n\nAll the people telling you to stay in your lane have clearly never worked at a startup. This company is still very small and people who step in to do things that need to be done even if it isn't in their \"lane\" is valued.\n\nSo, maybe, after your first, say 3 months there, in the next leadership meeting - maybe raise the thought that \"We talk about a lot of things in these meetings and there is action that is kind of agreed to, but to be honest, \"none of us\" (include yourself, you're a part of the team) seem to really follow up on those things because we all kinda just forget about them after the meeting. Maybe we should just document the simple bullet points of action that we talked about in each meeting, send out a post meeting email with those points, then we can bring up the points from the last meeting and talk about those first in the next meeting. It'd be a simple way to hold ourselves accountable and maybe decide that things have changed and the action is no longer necessary or a different action is more important. What do you all think?\"\n\nBoom - thinking about a problem, toe dip into a SIMPLE, low overhead way to maybe try to get a handle on it, non-accusatory as you include yourself, and it's presented as the kind of idea that is easy to get people around as it's minimal effort, and solves for a problem of a lot of loose ends that keep getting dropped.\n\nGrow into process. Solve actual problems. Process that is introduced as \"this is how it's done\" is an attack on the company culture and reads as you being out of touch.",

All companies hate wasting money and to lose both talent and salary because the business isn't right will leave an impression. 2 of the start ups I walked away from failed fairly shortly after I left, not because of me but because they could not handle the changes needed so they drove themselves into extinction. The third is still doing well, but almost failed due to slow implementation.\n\n2) \"Are the standards and protocols you are used to having in place achievable in the next 90 days? \"\n\n     This timeframe is important as it allows all employees, top to bottom, the time to work on repeated consistency utilizing and performing the new workflows and standards. The most difficult part of moving a mountain are the first few inches of movement. Once momentum builds the focus will shift away from the change and will start to focus on optimization and further areas of improvement.\n\nBE PREPARED FOR SOME ATTRITION!! Like others have said, there may be unknown politics and power dynamics at play. Presuming you said yes to question one, part of the conversation with the CEO/Founder is that some of the people that got the company to where it is are fine staying just where they are and may not want to grow much bigger,  faster or want more responsibility yet talk about the company as if they are the sole owner. These \"Heartstring Holdover Hires\" will cause issues for all involved later on down the line if they are not dealt with properly early on. \n\nIf you answer yes to both questions, charge ahead and the best of luck to ya! \n\nIf you answered at least one question no, I'm sorry that you are in that situation. Remember, FAIL stands for \"First Attempt In Learning\"! and when you move on to your next opportunity, you are better versed on how to handle similar situations.",

      "text": "A year ago, after leaving a big company, I decided to start a startup. I had been working with a technical cofounder for 3 months, we had a clear idea of what we wanted to build.  \nAfter two months of working together, he left. First hard hit.\n\nI found another cofounder in two weeks (spoiler: we’ve been working together for a year now and it’s going really well).\n\nI put insane pressure on myself. I worked 12 hours a day, every weekend, no days off, no vacations. I’ve always had a strong work capacity, so it didn’t really alert me. I was just a bit physically tired, but I didn’t see any issue.\n\nWe launched a product. It didn’t work the way I expected. I made a lot of mistakes, put my energy in the wrong places, developed 80% useless features. I applied to YC without much conviction, got rejected. Basically: first-time founder life.\n\nThen, overnight, my body gave up. Impossible to get up in the morning to work. As soon as I tried to work, I felt anxiety (I had never experienced that before). Loss of meaning, loss of bearings, loss of confidence.\n\nI’m convinced this small burnout was linked to the “almost success” of the project:  \nwe had early traction signals, but no PMF.\n\nSo I stopped everything. I went to another country for 5 days and I wrote a lot: what I don’t like doing, what I like doing, what I want to achieve\n\nI realized I had a very unhealthy relationship with time. I was always thinking about the next move without having succeeded at the previous one. I had big ambitions, a tendency to get carried away for nothing. That’s what led me to mistakes, loss of focus, and eventually to this state.\n\nSo I gave myself a single goal this year: make enough revenue to live from the company and pay myself + my cofounder properly. I have until the end of the year. If I don’t make it, I’ll ask myself what’s next at that point.\n\nI’m not rushing blindly anymore. I have a clear new direction, but everything that doesn’t bring business is cut. I’m very pragmatic about what can generate revenue (we’re a card payment gateway, with payouts in USDC)\n\nWhat drove me crazy was comparing myself to other founders. My relationship with success and time, feeling like I wasn’t moving fast enough (I’m 28).\n\nAnd for the past two months, living my founder life more simply, things have been much better. I’ve regained the joy of building, iterating, discussing. One clear goal with a defined timeframe. Plan B can wait.\n\nIn a world as complex as today’s, I chose to try simplicity. It doesn’t take anything away from my ambition to build a huge company and work hard on it.",

It might literally be *1* small thing, that is you never knew about, never thought about, never knew existed: that can literally make things 90% easier.\n\n\nImagine the whistle on Mario 3 (go look it up if you're not old school).\n\n\nIt's always a whistle out there where you can skip a few levels. Finding it may come from the grind, and / or extensive research, and a combination of luck. (The only thing you can control is staying in the race. Those who keep going will always find the whistle in the end while the others quit the marathon. As others drop out, your knowledge continues to grow. Any new entrants in the race (they will come forever) will be further and further and further behind you, the more time goes on. So by year 3 (or 10, depends) you'll be 95/100 level while the new entrants are 20/100. The ones who were 90/100 just quit, so things get easier and clearer for you.\n\n\nThe 20/100 can't do any damage (competition) because you're so far ahead in knowledge and skill now.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\nThis all, I know for a fact.\n\n\n\n\nTranslation: it's dam near impossible for Anybody unless your parents can casually loan you $300k like bezos did (probably worth a few mil back then before inflation).\n\n\n\n\nP.s., what is your actual product type?",

Early traction signals can actually be more mentally exhausting than outright failure because they keep you in limbo, always feeling like you're one pivot away from PMF.\n\nThe shift to simplicity and a single, measurable goal (revenue to sustain the team) is underrated wisdom. Most advice tells founders to \"think big\" but rarely mentions that sustainable progress often comes from radically narrowing focus.\n\nTwo things that stood out:\n\n1. You recognized that your relationship with time was the root issue, not the product itself. That's rare self-awareness that many founders never develop.\n\n2. Setting a hard deadline (end of year) forces clarity. Without that, it's easy to stay in indefinite \"almost there\" mode forever.\n\nAt 28, you're actually in a good spot. The founders who burn out young and learn from it tend to do much better on their second or third attempt than those who never hit that wall. Good luck with the payment gateway.",

This means leading a healthy lifestyle in general so that you can get through the intense moments and the less intense ones, but keep running overall. A healthy lifestyle means getting enough sleep and eating healthy foods that contain all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Exercising. Most of the time, we are very mentally tired after a long day at work, but our bodies need to release their energy. In addition, exercise releases beneficial hormones that help the mind. Having a supportive environment (friends, family, partner, colleagues). Taking time to get out of the tunnel effect. \n\nUltimately, we are on this journey to enjoy the journey and not just the final destination.\n\nTake care and good luck :)",

I have developed the spine for the architecture, done some testing to validate my logic and it works. This will be my first mvp. I still don’t know a lot of mvp stuff but I still keep going. Always pausing to validate and breathe coz working alone on a whole project can be brutal. I’m glad it made me spend my time well now. No more video games until this works.

Based on your comment \"she kept pushing on proof and GTM\" it sounds to me like you were telling here your assumptions - why you ***think***  the product will be successful and we was asking for ***evidence*** that it will be.\n\nFor example, before building the product it is common to put up marketing sites and build a waitlist, get LOIs for a B2B app, pre-sell orders for a consumer app, run \"wizard of oz\" or \"concierge\" MVPs without a product. All of these things - and many more - can be done before building in order to show more concrete proof.\n\nTo give an example, before Zappos was funded, Tony Hsieh went around his town and took photographs of shoes. He put them up on a static website and when someone placed an order he would go buy them and ship them to customers. This cost a lot of money and wasn't profitable but Tony did this specifically to prep for calls like you just had. Had he shown up and said, \"I haven't built Zappos yet but I believe people will buy shoes online\" he probably never would have gotten investment - so he did this - proof.\n\nIf you want to learn more and get on the same page as investors check out \"Lean Methodology\" and try filling out a Lean Canvas for your startup. I am actually building a webapp right now to help people do this online because I have a cohort of new foudners going through an accelerator that I mentor through and we generally do this on paper.",

The convo becomes “what do you need the money for, and what level will it get you to” and then it’s a lot more about just making some sensible economic case. \n\nRight now you’ll have to prove even the most basic things - is your product worth it, are your competitors gonna eat you, what’s the market size, what’s the GTM, who the fuck are you and why would I trust you - a stranger - with my money, have you ever done this before, who is going to be on your team, etc ad nauseum.

Please stop, take a moment and decide if you really want to to do this. Entrepreneurship SUCKS, and even if you get good at it, it's like being a surgeon, you're only gonna be that from now on, with out swimming way up river. \n\nNow to answer, that VC doesn't have money. THAT VC is gonna make money on you. Gonna let that sink in... \n\nThat person is or is going to raise a fund, so they're going to High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) and do the same thing you're doing. Can you give me money? I promise I'll give you it back plus extra. Now these are all people who have make their money in finance, and the first thing they are going to ask is, are these companies self supporting. That's because most companies 95% or more never make dollar one. And that's assuming you get an exit which is even rarer. In fact they have marginally better odds betting in Vegas, then they do betting on you. I'm sorry that's just VC math. They're better bet is to bet on Gold, which is going through the roof, and hasn't reported a loss since the Roman Empire. \n\nBut they have to do something in High Risk Assets, and the VC is going to promise in the 15 to 30 stinkers, 1 of them is going to get a mid range exit of 300M. Which will yield a 20x return in 5 years, and in the mean time they can use it as a write off on their tax credits. (google it) \n\nSo they are going to say, they are all revenue generating firms, with scalable products, with veteran teams. \n\n**That's what you need to be. That's all you need to communicate. Remember you're not selling the VC, you're writing a pitch that they can sell to someone else. Once you do that, raising is easier. Just remember your first 100k will be the hardest.**",

If your answers are speculative and haven't been validated with potential customers, then you're just early. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it just tells you where you are at. These are great questions to consider, though, as part of your own normal staging process as you develop as a company.  \n  \nIf you have competition that is already installed, are you able to displace them? I was once working on a SaaS product where the primary competition was interestingly famous in the industry because even though it was the most heavily installed, customers almost universally hated the product and the company. It's pretty wild when you can have a marketing campaign based on \"We aren't them.\" At the same time, it costs money to switch off of an old system, so even if everybody hates your competitor and will throw you a parade just for having an MVP, can you make it brain-dead easy and simple to switch? That is an essential part of your GTM strategy.  \n  \nDepending on your particular situation, I might make a slide dedicated to just that point. We have competition deeply entrenched. This is why we're better. This is why the potential customers think it's better. How do we know? We talked to them. We asked them questions about using the product today: What do they hate about it? What is a hassle? Don't ask speculative questions like, \"If we were selling today, would you switch to us?\" Customers are either going to answer that politely and outright lie or you're just not going to know because people are horrible at answering future predictive behavioral questions. You need to make that process seem like an assembly line. That's part of your GTM strategy.  \n  \nThose four questions are almost the same question. That VC gave you a roadmap; use it wisely.",

If the person responsible for business results didn't fund the venture out of their own pocket, move on. Being so penniless you can't hire a coder is the very worst reason to partner. It disqualifies the business partner as someone worth partnering with. \n\nPlenty of founders were floored when an investor told them \"Why should I invest my money when you risk none of yours.\" \n\nI have begun to call these forums amateur coder forums because the only posts about business are the resulting problems from missing business management. These people want nothing to do with business, they cope rather than manage. \n\nIf you are a technical founder make damn sure you partner with a business founder, not somebody just saying the words.",

They are just trying to be part of the hype and nonsense that flows around there.\n\nMy two cents are that I would be much more interested in what you are working on and your story behind it than whether you founded the company or not. At the early stage, I feel like we are more creators than founders, because you are building the next great service, technology, product, etc., and that is the story people want to hear.\n\nOne last thing I'd say mention is that over the years, when talking to people about titles, I have always encouraged them to worry less about the title and more about the impact and money they are making.

Payments, compliance, lending, and financial infrastructure kept appearing in their spin-offs.\n\n\\- **AI labs → AI startups**\n\nPeople leaving AI- and research-heavy orgs like DeepMind often founded AI-native startups, often moving quickly because core technical and scaling risks were already familiar.\n\n\\- **Marketplaces and platforms**\n\nAlumni from OLX, Skyscanner, and Zalando frequently launched new marketplaces or SaaS tools adjacent to pricing, logistics, and demand aggregation.\n\n**Repeated operating exposure looks like this:** owning products, launching markets, handling customers at scale, navigating regulation, and living through failure.\n\nThis changed how I think about preparing to found a startup.\n\nIf your goal is to build a scalable company one day, a practical checklist that emerged from the data:\n\n\\- Choose roles where you own outcomes, not just tasks\n\n\\- Stay close to customers, revenue, and real constraints\n\n\\- Work in environments where products ship often and feedback is immediate\n\n\\- Get exposure to scale, regulation, or failure, not just growth narratives\n\n\\- Learn how systems break before trying to build your own\n\n\\- If possible, spend time in a company that has already scaled or exited\n\nI’ll add a comment with a link to the dataset for anyone who wants to dig into the details.",

Then business model fit (scale) then finally founder-investor fit. \n\nI think you list can be adapted into principles for early stage founders that guide them in later choices when scaling. \n\nFor example “Choose roles where you own outcomes, not just tasks” could be changed to: “Own outcomes, not just the tasks.” This is one of the biggest initial mistakes where first time founders don’t understand traction and fall into vanity metrics. \n\nHope that makes sense.

Just look at all the teachers and coaches that have helped lift people up to their full potential. Also all the moms and dads and grandparents and in some cases even neighbors that have made people's success possible.\n\nA mentor help you be better, they don't do the work for you, they just give you more tools to work with. It could be ideas, techniques, stories, advice, flowcharts, decision trees, documents, or anything else. But at the end of the day it's up to you to make it all into something that is your unique path forward.\n\nA bad mentor is a bad mentor, and there's nothing uniquely and absolutely superior about one guy having done something 2-3 times compared to a guy having seen and worked with people that have done it 20-30 times.\n\nIf you're a decent enough founder working with a decent enough mentor those 20-30 stories will help you choose your path forward more than if you were to work with that one guy that says \"this is what you should do because it's what I did that one time I was in a similar situation\".\n\nAs a founder it's on you to find the mentor that best fits in with what you need, and if you think that a mentor will hold your hand and show you the one true way forward you're thinking like a child looking for comforting, not like a business leader (which is what a founder is/should be).\n\nThis is also why you in most cases don't want to work with an angel investor that's fresh from their first or second exit. They'll walk into your business with the biggest ego ever, thinking that because they ended up with cash they are money-making machines that should copy-paste everything from how they did it into your business.\n\nIt's even more obvious in sports, where having been the world champion doesn't automatically make you a better trainer than the trainers that actually help elevate people to that level.\n\n>Having a prior founder is a must for mentorship.\n\nNope. Not a must.\n\nEdit: As an example, look at how OP from the start has acted like an emotional child throwing a tantrum because they've got a fixed view on how the world should work according to them, and it doesn't. While this comment by me was filled with what's meant to be relatable examples. I'm leaving you with ideas and concepts that you can evaluate and incorporate into how you see things; while with OP you can get emotional/angry and jump up and down while screaming at the world that it must work a certain way or you'll get upset at it. You choose which of those approaches works best for you as a business leader trying to grow a startup.",

I got none of that SPAC.\n\nSo, then I took my fancy 60k$ contract, that had an acquisition clause, that came out of  a top five law firm in the Valley (\"F\"), and I learned \"contracts ain't shit without 100M$ on tap\" (The Hulk Hogan Rule).\n\nTHEN a year later, they made me an offer I couldn't legally refuse, and brought me into a court case when THEY got screwed...by a bigger company that was patent troll-y (\"T\") and then it went to hell for them.  How?  The other side's attorneys used a P.I. and the \"powers of the Equity Court\" (like a search warrant) to prove that someone they had worked with had been moonlighting, and, this company V's source code was the moonlighter's day job company (\"C\") computer, at their facility.  On weekly backup tapes.  For a year.  That would (in that jurisdiction) give C a claim against V, easily.\n\nCase abandoned, then, a quiet settlement.\n\n2 years later, this company that, er, did me wrong, was locked out of their own facility with chains on the doors via the California Marshalls and a court order, by the very same SPAC entity.\n\nMe + F < C + V < Q < T\n\nInsane Factoid?  Product is still on sale after many, many years, and, I get nothing.\n\nAnd that's how I learned a lot from basically, a foe.\n\np.s. How did V get me to participate in the court case against in support of Q against T, with indeminities of 15M$, and more than just minimally?  I said, \"sure, I'll do it, but have this <amazing Swiss clock> delivered to me by 5 pm, which is in 2 hours, and, no contract btw since I'm subpoenaed, but I want a 15M$ indemnity.\" I intentionally made this so weird and extreme they would not do it.  Clock delivered, sealed, in 90 minutes, was never in their hands (my watchmaker was MY watchmaker).  Bond in two days.  \"Raise your right hand...\"\n\np.p.s. I still see the V people in the airports, once in a while.  I say \"hi\".",

Obviously other people can help you in some ways in your journey, but they won’t give you specific advice that’s useful and will move you forward in early stage startup, More often than not, they will give you bad advice. \n\nThe reason is simple - founding a company and early stage startup is veeeeery unintuitive to people. The choices and method of operating and founding principles are perceived as extreme by practically everyone who hasn’t done it. It’s preposterous how many times I have seen some professor or grey haired corporate dude try to convince young founders to invest their time and limited money into distractions like a website, or IP, or consultants, or some other ridiculous thing. Concepts like selling before you have a product are bizarre to people and you’ll have people convince you to make a perfect product instead of pushing something broken to market. \n\nObviously every situation is a bit different, but I’d say the vast majority of advice is shamefully bad when not by a founder, or maybe an extremely well experienced investor. \n\nI’m definitely not trying to sound clever in saying this. I don’t know why you’d think so. I have very sharp experiences of my own, and many peer founders who say the exact same things.",

They have stories.  \n\nOur job as Founders is to seek out a lot of advice and information, measure and weigh all factors, and then make sense out of a jumble of contradictory results.  I call this: \"Tuesday\".  It's gonna happen, every day.  Sometimes that's too much for some folk, or, any folk at certain times.\n\nReal Operators: I recently was doing interviews for a project, centered on a certain kind of Tech Startup Participant.  36 in I realized, \"wait a minute...a lot of these people are barely operators, I'll add a question: 'How many startups have you operated, directly?'\"  This happened at interview 17.  I went back and most of the previous interviews rapidly supplied their numbers.  Average was 1.4.  Participant type was Angel Investor.  I was at 1.4 by the time I was 18... \n\nSo, yeah, I am now more selective in that particular way!\n\n\"Mentor is useless if he doesn’t have real network of successful founders or VC or customers.\"\n\nI think I see where you're coming from.  My feels is \"a Mentor should have some of these, and/or, have operated companies that survived until elective exit.\"  I thought about it, and that seems like the right list.  \n\nBut,... fails are very, very useful.  At UCLA Grad School of Mgmt, they had two MBA programs: \"The children\" aka age 24-26, day time, M-Th.  \"Executive\" meant  people who were there Tue/Thu night, and Saturday, and during the week, ahem, arrived in a preserved state, more than not.  These were the real deal: The J. Jonah Jameson type, either loud or silent.  38-45.  There were several criteria to getting into the Executive as pre-quals: the most popular listed on applications (I saw them all as part of my function) was \"Taken a company into, and out of, bankruptcy\".  Dang.\n\nThat being said, I got my first three startup experiences from those Executive people  Full of fail, and Priceless!",

I had a biz called 'sales coach for startups' in which I coached and aided founders in achieving their first 10 B2B sales, and other aspects of go-to-market. I worked in a number of early phase startups as rep doing early deals - never founded a startup till now. FWIW,  I've just pivoted my product so I'm still building and working with my \"founder MVP\" which is the smartest decision I've ever made wrt product.\n\nMy clients found my advice and assistance INVALUABLE. I never told them how to run the biz. But over time, my work with dozens of founders (and meeting and speaking with hundreds) gave me a POV that most people will never have. I was able to destress them about sales, which is what most product/engineering focused founders fail at and are very anxious about. They'd learn how to actually sell (most founders suck at sales) and build a 'founder sales process' that became the basis of a sales process for a rep they'd eventually hire. Sales failure in early phase companies identifies lots of strategic flaws, which is why most startups fail, so I'd often get involved in strategy and product discussions and pivots with these founders.\n\nReal advice? Check the background and experience of who you take advice from. If they have experience in 1 or 2 startups - founders or not - their advice may be suboptimal. Look for those who've worked with 5 or more.  Then the patterns start to pop. By over 20? You see patterns and issues that you'll never learn on Reddit, LinkedIn etc. Above all, be calm and analytical, not emotional...\n\n  \nFear is the mind killer...So is greed. ",

We're solving a critical gap in music technology: there's currently no way to understand why people listen to what they listen to, or even how those listening patterns reflect emotional states, psychological tendencies, and behavioural drivers over time.\n\nEunoia's emotional fingerprinting system combines music listening behaviour with optional mood and health inputs to uncover recurring emotional patterns and build an evolving psychological profile for each user. The goal isn't just better recommendations, but helping users understand themselves, how their emotions shift, what they gravitate toward in different mental states, and how music both reflects and influences their inner world.\n\nWe're an early stage startup and are targeting an MVP release within the next 3 months.\n\nAs of the moment we have;\n\n* A clear product vision and long-term roadmap.\n* A detailed MVP scope (Spotify auth, emotional fingerprint quiz, journal + insights dashboard)\n*  Branding, positioning, & user flows already thought through.\n*  Active work underway on scoping and architecture decisions\n\nWho we're looking for:\n\nWe're looking for a \\*technical co-founder\\* who can own execution of the map end-to-end.\n\nOur Ideal Profile:\n\n* Strong experience with mobile development (React Native preferred, Swift acceptable)\n* Comfortable designing backend systems (auth, data models, API's, real-time or near-real-time data)\n* Has shipped at least one consumer product (not just demos)\n* Can make pragmatic MVP tradeoffs and cut scope intelligently\n\nThis is not a large team effort right now, we're intentionally looking for one strong builder who wants real responsibility and equity.\n\nFeel free to send me a dm if this sounds like you!",

      "text": "I’m currently a software engineer at a startup. I love the environment, the founder, and the product. I work from home and get some nice perks (like $100/week for food). I’m currently at $170k with 1% equity.\n\nThe company is in a bit of a tight spot. We have $500k ARR but are cash-flow negative with 6-8 months of runway left. We’re currently trying to raise a Seed round (pre-seed is done), but some VCs are being picky about our numbers so not the best look but just started. Also recently another engineer quit, and I’ve taken on a massive chunk of their workload. Between the extra stress and the market rate, I started feeling undervalued and took a few interviews.\n\nI just received a verbal offer for $200k. I value peace and comfort, and I genuinely believe in my current company. I don’t want to leave, but I also don't want to leave $30k on the table; especially when I’m doing the work of two people and the company’s future is uncertain.\n\n1. How do I approach the founder? Since we haven’t closed the Seed round yet, a $30k salary bump may be a big ask for our runway.\n2. Is a lump sum better? I’m considering asking for a $20k retention bonus instead of a permanent salary hike to help the company's burn rate. And later ask for an increase.\n3. Equity vs. Cash: Should I use the offer to negotiate for more than my 1%? I feel though its not smart given the rockiness.\n4. What’s the \"fair\" play? I don't want to hold them over a barrel while they’re raising, but I also need to look out for myself if we don't clear the next 8 months.\n\nAny advice from people who have negotiated during a fundraise or stuck it out through a rocky Seed round?\n\n  \n",

          "text": "Alrighty. It’s a good dilemma and it’s really just about you and what you’re willing to do. In neither scenario are you starving, maybe there’s something more or less compared to market for your role but I dunno. Doesn’t matter. \n\nHere’s the facts. Theres no comfy startup like that. While you’re working and focussing, the founders are sweating every night as the bank account dives toward zero and they don’t have the next financing lined up. It’s not comfy. That company must raise a round definitely within 6 months, which means they need a term sheet in 3 months. And honestly, nobody likes to fund companies about to cash out. They get picked apart on terms. But whatever, you do what you gotta do to live. Long story short - it’s risky and there’s just no guarantee at all that it doesn’t go down. \n\nHowever. If you leave, that could compound the issues and make the company even worse. It’s really a question of whether the risk is that risky to you? How secure are in your industry. Are you confident that you could find a new job if/when this one ends? Can you finance a job search for a month or 3 months? Is that a big deal to you or just a small inconvenience. Do you like the company and vision and would you derive satisfaction from seeing it succeed and being a part of that?\n\nIt’s a matter of taste. You can take the stable 200k, or give 170k a run for a few more months and really give it your best and see if it works out. \n\nWhat you can’t do at this stage is- you can’t ask for a raise. It will only make things worse, that 30k is not going to make your job easier, and it will make it tougher for the company. You can try to ask for more equity but with 1% already and going out to market, it will weaken the funding narrative giving out grants like that. \n\nIt’s just a question for you. Do you wanna give it a shot and try to get to a win understanding that it’s risky. Or do you wanna take that stable job.",

If you believe in the product and the founder, sticking around could be worth it, especially if you think they can turn things around in the next few months. However, the financial stability of the company is a huge factor. If the other offer is solid and provides more security, it might be worth considering, especially if you have responsibilities or financial goals to meet. In situations like this, it’s often about weighing your passion against financial security. I've seen founders navigate similar choices, and sometimes keeping an eye on the potential for growth in your current role can pay off big time if the company succeeds. I’ve worked on projects that help startups get through tough times, so I get the struggle. Whatever you choose, make sure it aligns with your personal goals too!",

That experience may make you attractive to recruiters at bigger companies, but bigger companies won't give you nearly as much equity.\n\nEither stick it out and see if the equity pays off, or go elsewhere for higher cash comp.

You’re giving access to repos, infra, sometimes customer data.\n\nYou don’t need to be SOC 2 or enterprise to reduce the risk.\n\nWhat we do now:\n\n* Ask for official ID (passport or national ID)\n* Use an identity check (selfie + ID, e.g. Stripe Identity or any KYC service)\n* Make sure the same identity is used across contract, GitHub, Slack, payroll\n* Track IPs when something feels off (DB access, repo activity, Zoom calls)\n* Run a basic background check there are decent services online\n\nThis isn’t anti-remote and not about geography.  \nMost people are honest.\n\nBut the cost of being naïve is going up and it can cost you a lot.",

A few months ago, I quit my job and decided to pursue this SaaS product we made a couple of months ago. \n\nI happened to come across an investor and they decided to fund us quite elaborately, more than what we ever thought of.\n\nAnyway, the idea itself isn't mine, but my friends decided to make me the CEO. Problems with ego was apparent with the CTO (The real founder) was obvious from the start. But I've dealt with people like this before and honestly I myself was one in my early teens and twenties. However these people don't have much business experience and I'm having a hard time to make them do things, simple things like a daily update call on the morning. Telling to fix the scope etc. Plus they come in late to the office and two of them are working other jobs on the side. \n\nI'm tempted to inform the investor to take over, but I sort of believe that it'll make the team and myself look incompatible. I seriously want to put some structure in place and I seriously want to put the product out to the market. But it feels like a big pain in the a\\\\\\*\\\\\\*se and it's draining me out both creatively and mentally.\n\nInstead of taking responsibility for things I'm getting trash talk back, for instance if I asked someone when are you shipping this next feature their answer would be like \"Where's the social media post\". \n\nI dunno if this is a me problem, I thought startups were about unity and fun and building together setting aside egos and this is the complete opposite, and the frustrating part is that we haven't even shipped the product yet.",

They work when everyone's committed to the same destination. When they're not, those tools just create friction.\n\nThe real problem isn't that they won't show up on time. It's that you don't share values, commitment level, or clarity on what you're actually building.\n\nYou can't manage people toward an unclear destination.\n\nI've been the founder trying to impose structure on a misaligned team. It's exhausting because you're fighting the foundation, not fixing execution problems. Every \"simple\" request becomes a negotiation because there's no shared understanding of what matters.\n\nTwo things helped me:\n\nFirst, stop trying to manage the symptoms. The trash talk, the side jobs, the resistance - those are signals that this team never clarified what they're building together or what they're willing to sacrifice for it.\n\nSecond, before you talk to the investor, have a direct conversation with the team. Not about daily standups. About whether you're actually aligned on building this company. What are they willing to commit? What do they want out of this? Is this their priority or a side project?\n\nIf they can't answer those clearly, or if their answers don't align with yours, no amount of structure will fix it. You'll be fighting this battle every single day.\n\nHave you had that direct conversation about commitment and alignment yet?",

Or you get clever.\n\nMy advice to you is to focus less on the CTO/problem right now, and more on the constructive process of leveling yourself up as a CEO. And get a mentor through/in collaboration with the investor.\n\nHere's the trick in that:\n\nYou running to the investor saying that the team are idiots makes both you and the team look bad. It's a no win situation. And the investor won't be happy getting dragged into a \"he said, she said\"-type of a catfight when they've put their money into that team. (The investor might be friendly, but he's not your friend!!)\n\nBut, if you work on your growth and get yourself a CEO mentor that the investor is friends with, then they'll be there either (passively, through discussions) helping you sort out the team, or they'll over a cup of coffee tell their investor friend about the disastrous CTO.\n\nThat's a win-win type of a situation for you.\n\nAt the end of that you've either both grown as a CEO and sorted out the mess, or you have put yourself in the good seat for whatever crash is about to happen. Making you able to walk away in a better position, and keep growing your career as a startup CEO (as compared to having just failed at your first and only attempt).\n\nThe only risk is of course if it turns out that you're the too incompetent person that accidentally caused all the problems. But even in that case it's better to learn that through showing that you've had the maturity to want to learn and level up, rather than you just causing a fight with others.\n\n(imo, and all the other usual caveats, of course. including that I was imagining a western-style work culture.)",

I don't mean to say that it's a you problem, but I will say that you're the only one that can change you, and rise above the situation to turn things around. That sounds a little trite, and I get that. It's easier said than done.\n\n\n\nSometimes I look to real-world situations for a bit of inspiration. Here's one that I'll throw out there. When General Norman Schwarzkopf was a colonel, he was assigned the worst regiment in the entire US army. He didn't turn things around overnight, but by the end of the Vietnam conflict, without getting rid of people, without layoffs or firings or whatever corporate equivalent you would have in the army, he had one of the most decorated regiments in the army. His leadership is credited with turning things around and is actually taught at West Point.\n\n\n\nThe point that I hope is relevant for you is that there's a way that you can bring these people together. Part of that is going to require a clear vision of what you're bringing them together for. If you're right now having a difficult time articulating what the North Star is for the entire company, then asking for status meetings is just start-up theatre, and that is definitely not something you want to do.\n\n\n\nSo again I'm going to be a little bit trite and quote Stephen Covey: one of the seven habits is \"Begin with the end in mind.\" What is it that you're trying to achieve? What's the big goal that everyone shares? Identify that and build upon it. What are the next steps you need from everyone to move you towards that goal? Not from a start-up theatre standpoint but an actual achievement. Might be a little step, might be a big step, doesn't matter. All you want is to get people moving in the same direction. You're the CEO, you're the quarterback, you're on the same field as everyone else. Find a way to communicate the goal and rally people around that. It's not about you; it's about what you're all trying to achieve. Make that the focus.",

      "text": "So we're a two person very early(4 months in) cofounders who's building an mobile app. Currently 0 revenue, a few sum of alpha testers from our friends mostly, not bad retention(Around 30 \\~ 40% are still using after 3 weeks even when we didn't push them to), Got early angel investment(sum of $10k), now we're almost ready to get a big angel investment(sum of $100k) soon.\n\nSo all in all, not a bad start right? But here's the problem: My cofounder is kinda not fully commited.\n\nI'm the CTO, 100% bootstrapped from the beginning full time, no wages, spent my money for upkeep costs. Built and manage the total flow of mvp - which is UI/UX design, wireframes, backend, frontend, db, cicd, testings, deployment, appstore optimizations, etc. Basically built a full mvp in 3 months with no help but me. So I took 60% of the share and he agreed.\n\nHe's the CEO and also bootstrapped, but he was and still is a part-timer. He works around 10\\~15 hours a week allegedely. He acquired most of our alpha testers(around 30) and still is acquiring some, was supposed to have full responsibility with marketing but apart from making our social accounts, he has produced 0 visible items. I would say his most contribution so far was his initial idea and his ability to horde angel investors to our side.\n\nI have to tell, he is very good with investor relations and managing them. But like that's it so far. He would sometimes give me okayish idea about our products, I deny like 90% of them cos it is just not worth it... I guess the product is so far so good since most of our investors and testers were satisfied with it.\n\nThe problem now stems from me doing additional work. Yes he does fetch us investors, but negotiating, drafting contracts, finding lawyers is all my work so far. I even had to make him a pitch deck, draft submissions for VC investments, research other investment opportunities, etc etc... I had to attend most of the investor's meeting since he wanted me there to support him(Which I would happily if he did his works...). My breaking point was when I was doing more \"business\" then \"building\" stuffs. I couldn't focus on what I was building and forgetting what I was even building sometimes.\n\nThe other problem is that he just wants all of the fruits from our business + his current job. He wants to take a few(Not big but also not small) stipend while also having his shares(40%) and his job. He is about to be promoted as a marketing lead so I think that's why he just wants his job also. He works like 10+ hours a day, sometimes 12 with his job. I know he is not lazy, he's just greedy and wants everything and don't want to give up a few.\n\nI opened up a serious talk with him about this issue, he just shrugged with saying that we are already doing great, we will get more investors, he will convert to full time once we're \"successful\" enough... He told me I can take \"whatever I want\" as stipend from our investment fund. If I were to take a huge pay, let's say around $3500/month(Which is quite a decent salary from where I live), we will still have 20 months of runway left with our expense and $400/month marketing budget, which is not bad I think.\n\nBut I feel this is so wrong. I can take much less(Like $1800/month) and he can take much less and we can save up for more runway or more marketing budget. But he insists that we should \"reward\" ourselves more. I'm so conflicted right now what to do at this point. I even suggested he stays part time and be a fundraiser and he takes 0.5% as bonus every round but he said no to that.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Do you think we can pull it off still? Or is this not sustainable long term?",

Y Combinator's Michael Seibel estimates ninety-eight percent of founders claim to have product-market fit when they don't. This focus inward is keeping the partners from crucial market learning and customer discovery. Well ... unless you two have a quarter million friends. \n\nPlenty have posted their shock that all the positive opinion dried up and blew away the instant they asked for payment. Not half. Not most.

Mostly to avoid answering the question will enough customers pay enough money to make this a viable venture. \n\nI expect lame excuses about this all around. What's not happening is growth, word-of-mouth, any signal anybody is willing to pay under any circumstance. That's a serious failure. All too convenient to consider an bug hunter a user and a user as an eventual customer.

Most of my work experience has been in stores and warehouses, so the problem I’m trying to solve comes directly from seeing how slow and repetitive certain manual tasks are in real life. \n\nI’m still very early in the process. My LLC is pending, I don’t have funding yet, or ask friends and family to help with Boot strapping either and I haven’t filed any patents. I’ve only made a very rough, non functional concept prototype just to visualize the idea, nothing that works or could be used. I’m intentionally not sharing design or implementation details here because I want to handle IP the right way. \n\nI plan to work with independent mechanical designers and material specialists, and hire contractors as needed for prototyping, testing, and manufacturing prep. What I’m struggling with isn’t the idea itself, but the order of operations and funding. \n\nI’ve read a lot online and honestly it’s overwhelming and often contradictory. I don’t have a founder network, and I don't have any technical skills or knowledge so I’m trying to learn without making expensive mistakes. I’m fine moving slow if it means doing it right.\n\nI’m mainly looking for guidance on what should come first for a non electrical hardware startup like this and funding. \nIt would help me a lot to get some answers from the following questions based on your own experience as a founder. \n\nWhen did you personally involve a patent attorney, and what did you wait on? \n\nHow did you validate demand before spending serious money on manufacturing? \n\nWhat funding paths actually worked for you for physical products, whether that was grants, accelerators, pilots, LOIs, SBIR, or something else? \n\nAnd what early mistakes cost you time or money that you wish you had avoided? Is it realistic to try and keep 100% of the company? \n\nDid you find giving up equity for expertise or capital was necessary? \n\nAnd since I am a hardware start up, most of the time will be spend on product development and quality testing and collecting feedback and give it back to the team of contractors so that they can make revisions and improvements to the product before we can move on to manufacturing. My long term goal is to offer this as Hardware as a Service. Does that change anything in the early validation or funding stage?\n\nI want to keep things lean, avoid unnecessary steps, and reduce risk as much as possible and learn from everyone. I’m not looking for feedback on the product itself, just advice on process, sequencing, and how to approach this the right way. \nIf you’ve taken a physical product from idea to testing to manufacturing, or even failed trying, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective. And I also want to keep the company private. Thanks in advance.",

          "text": "It’s a tough question. I’m building an electronic hardware product, but the overall process is essentially the same. You have to start by fully understanding your goal and identifying the closest realistic milestone you need to reach. To get to a fully implemented product, you’ll usually need some combination of collaborations, investment, and a functional prototype. The key is to focus on the minimum you need to do right now in order to move forward without overbuilding. That usually starts with writing a simple but clear business or requirements document that defines the problem, the target customer, the value you’re delivering, and what the first usable version of the product must achieve. From there, you need to be honest about what you can financially commit to on your own and build the smallest possible prototype that can clearly demonstrate proof of concept. It doesn’t need to be 100% functional or production-ready just enough to show that the idea works and creates real value. Once you have that, you can start reaching out to companies for collaboration, but only if you know exactly what you’re offering them, whether that’s a pilot, efficiency gains, or early access. This stage involves a lot of small, detailed work. If you can secure one or two LOIs or a pilot and explore relevant grants at the same time, you’ll be in a much stronger position when approaching investors. You don’t need thousands of customers or many partnerships early, credible signals are enough. At this stage, it’s also important to be careful with IP: avoid oversharing, use NDAs when appropriate, understand the laws in your country specific about this, and focus on protection after you’ve validated the core technology and market. Everything depends on context, but a minimal, milestone driven approach is usually the most efficient and lowest risk way forward.",

          "text": "Speaking from the outside looking in, the biggest risk early hardware founders face is over indexing on IP and building before they have real evidence of pull. In practice, most teams I have seen delay patent work until they have clearer signals from pilots or LOIs, because a provisional only really buys time, not certainty. demand validation usually looks less like surveys and more like someone committing budget, access, or time to test a crude version of the workflow you are targeting. Funding paths for physical products tend to follow that same logic, grants and accelerators care about technical feasibility, while angels and strategics care about whether a buyer is already leaning in. Keeping 100 percent ownership is theoretically possible, but it often trades speed and learning for control, which can be costly in hardware. Hardware as a service does not change the early steps much, but it raises the bar on reliability and unit economics earlier than many first time founders expect.",

I am fortunate enough to have the experience, tools and expertise to do all the design and prototyping myself, so it is a huge advantage. I have been mechanical designer for over 20 years and have designed dozens of products across various industries for large companies and startups, and it can be very daunting even when you have a full complement of resources. If you lack the expertise or resources to design and build a prototype of the concept yourself then you will have to go the contractor route that you mentioned. Be forewarned though, this can get expensive very quickly. Be sure to lay out in as much detail what each “phase” of this development requires (just a rough 3D concept versus a fully vetted production ready product). This initial concept process, if you hire the right people, will work out most of your manufacturing questions. Is it going to require machining processes? Is it going to be sheet metal? Is it going to be assembled with fasteners? Or welded? Are injection-molded parts required? All these combined? Can my prototype be designed and built in a way that can transition to higher production volumes easily? It is one thing to 3D print some parts and hobble together a prototype, it is another thing entirely to take that idea and manufacture it on a production level scale. Be warned that there are many, many people who can create a 3D model of something, I taught my kids to model stuff in Solidworks when they were 8 years old LOL. What you want to find is someone who can work through that design and define these manufacturing processes as they design, keeping DFM, DFA and cost in mind throughout the process. That usually requires years of experience.\n\n \n\nAnd all of this is after you have done the research to even see if your product is a viable solution to an existing problem.",

My designer and I have prototyped key screens of the app and gotten great user feedback so far (means relatively nothing in the long run but it’s decent early signal that we’re building soldering that solves real problems) and I’m in the process of building the landing page that will enable me to validate the target user group’s willingness to pay, my GTM strategy and my messaging strategy. If users pay, I’ll consider my idea validated and start looking for someone technical to actually build the product. This thread has convinced me I don’t necessarily need a technical cofounder and more-so need someone that fits the mold you describe… advise, write code, make durable thoughtful decisions. \n\nI’ve been a product manager for 9 years so I have a sense for when a relationship between eng and product feels right. It’s surprisingly tricky to get it right. Well, maybe not tricky, but it requires thoughtfulness and trust for both parties. \n\nAny suggestions on how I might find someone that fits the description you laid out?",

Many technical cofounder relationships come from working together first on a small project, open source, freelancing, or even just jamming on a prototype. The biggest signal isnt skills its alignment on quality, pace, and how decisions get made. Trust usually forms before equity conversations do.",
