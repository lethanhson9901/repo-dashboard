      "text": "Specifically asking founders whose startup is their primary job and source of income.\n\nPurely from a financial standpoint, are you better or worse off than if you had stayed at a job  in your field? If you have a spouse or family, how are you managing your finances and is it enough? Are you working for an exit, or is running this company your long-term goal? \n\nI understand a startup is more challenging than a job, you need to care about the problem not the money, there's a high chance of failure, etc. But founders still need to support themselves and fulfill other goals outside of work, especially if you're taking on more risk than in a job.      \n\nI'm full-time building a company with enough interest / traction to raise and hire more people. But my SO and I want to get married and eventually start a family, not to mention other goals like buying a home / car, traveling, etc. My former career on its own can certainly support a comfortable life, but hers can't. Plus I don't have any successful role models in my network of founders - everyone is either not stable enough in personal life yet, living off spouse's income / came from money, or went back to corporate. So I've been thinking a lot about going back to a job especially before I take outside money or decide to bring more people along for the ride. \n\nPlease no snarky bs like \"if you think about money or family, you're not cut out to be a founder\" ",

But I would still go out for drinks with friends regularly, what suffered most was my sleep. I still don’t believe much in work life balance, mainly because you are only one person, the same that work is the same with friends, and I had no problem to take some time on weekend to code, mostly because I was very curious about the outcome. \n\n3rd startup now, I have a little kid and my wife is pregnant. So I don’t stay working until late in the office because I rather play with my kid before he goes to sleep. Then, I sometimes go back to work after he sleeps. Weekends, if children with grandparents I may work a bit, but it is less volume then before. However, I want to believe that the past experience makes me work in a more right direction now, with less errors and chaos. By the way I date my wife since the first startup, so, we managed to survive.\n\nWhen the 1st startup failed it was the hardest part in the journey. I was in personal debt, returned to my mother’s house, and stayed like that for almost a year. Took some freelancing to get some money and go thru it. After surviving that and coming out ok, I felt very strong that I could survive anything, and need not to be afraid any longer.\n\nIt’s a real roller coaster.",

The best way to go about this is to just get a job for some type of income to feed the machine (the start-up) and your family. Unless you've got adequate savings and can bet on yourself. It needs oil& gas to run.

I consider myself one of the bests local professionals in my field.  \nRight now things are pretty hard and challenging. I'm single employee, I would like to scale and hire more people, but I don't have enough workload right now.\n\nI don't have kids, but recently I got a wife. She is supporting me a lot, and helping sometimes with some basic marketing tasks which are outside of her experience, but she can handle them. Tbh, she is less responsive comparing to an employee, she rejects some tasks when she is in a bad mood.\n\nSeveral years ago I was working as an employee for an USA company, my salary ( comparing to local market was pretty HIGH ) . I left that company because:\n\n1. I was tired of poor management.\n2. bad decisions\n3. I wanted to try myself as a business man.\n\nRight now I can't say that I'm a business man. I fell myself more like a freelancer, who is TRYING to become a business man and scale the projects.\n\nWhen I was an employee, I was working less and receiving more $$$. When I left the company, some local managers were really surprised, because they were realising that probability to find a company with a higher salary is pretty low. Recently, I had several months with a high income, but I was working really a lot. I was working so much, that I don't think that everyone could handle it.\n\nRight now it is challenging because:\n\n1. IT market significantly decreased. I have a lot of IT friends who were laid off, some of them are searching for job for months\n2. Some of the projects are not stable. Recently main customer decreased amount of hours, and probably another client will drop shortly.\n3. I'm living in a 3rd world country where my experience in majority cases is not applicable for local SMBs. My services are mostly needed for huge corporations and very technological startups.\n   1.  It is hard to escape boundaries of the bubble, and reach directly decision makers from foreign companies.\n4. I have to handle a lot of things that I wouldn’t deal with as a regular employee:\n   1.  some customers are paying with huge delays, I need to spend some time sending reminders\n   2. I need to think about marketing. In some busy days I don't have enough energy for that\n   3. I need to handle some random stuff. For example, recently I replaced my accountant with another one, and spend several days on calling different companies, negotiating the transitioning to another company\n\n**Next plan**:  \nAfter some projects dropped, I had more time for marketing, research and brainstorm. Started to write more linkedin posts with successful cases, update website, ask for clutch reviews from current and old customers, writing some website blog posts with finished work, and launched several outreach campaigns. Hopefully it will bring some positive results.\n\nStill considering that I'm located in a wrong place. My local taxes are pretty low, but still hard to find some local good customers. From local companies, my ICT are banks and telecom, but it is mostly impossible to reach their decision makers, or to get a good rate.",

The trade is usually optionality and ownership versus predictable income, and that gap matters a lot once you factor in family planning, housing, and stress outside of work. A lot of early traction still does not translate into personal financial stability for a long time, especially if you want to run the company responsibly and not just optimize for founder cash flow. I would not frame this as a lack of founder mindset, it is more about risk tolerance and timing. plenty of technically strong people step back into a job to de risk their personal life and return to building later with more leverage. the hard part is that there is no clean signal early on that tells you when staying all in is rational versus when it is just hope.",

      "text": "My recent posts were about how we faced a forced pivot under intense runway pressure in 2024.\n\nWhat I didn’t explain is that our company would never have survived that moment if we hadn’t fixed something much earlier: a broken founder partnership.\n\nBefore we raised our $7M Series Pre-A, between 2021 and 2023, things inside the company were rough. I’m a non-technical, finance-background CEO. My co-founder is a deeply technical AI/CS engineer. At our lowest point, we were fighting constantly. He once yelled at me in the office. We were genuinely close to becoming unable to work together.\n\nI forced ourselves to rebuild. Here’s what I learned, especially as a non-technical founder working with a very strong technical co-founded.\n\nThe first three lessons are especially specific to non-technical founders working with a CTO:\n\n1. **Respect their technical taste or you don’t do this at all.** This is what I believe foundational! As a non-tech founder, normally you can't even judge code quality. What you can judge is their taste and integrity as an engineer or a person. If you don't fundamentally trust that, maybe you need a new partner.\n2. **Never treat your CTO like a cost center.** They're not an outsourced delivery machine. Dumping all deadlines and customer pressure onto them destroys trust. If you treat a CTO co-founder like a contractor, you don't have a real CTO.\n3. **Even when everything is on fire, don't bypass them.** When deliveries were burning, I learnt to not go around my CTO to direct his team. My job was to calm customers to buy some time, order some late-night food for the team and trust him to lead.\n\nThe next two lessons helped our relationship, and I think they apply more broadly to founding teams in general:\n\n1. **We eat together a lot**. We have at least (in average) three 1:1 working lunches a week. This is where fast decisions, alignment, and mutual learning happen. Shared context compounds.\n2. **Radical transparency around cash.** I give him unfiltered access to our cash position. When I push back on expensive ideas, it doesn't feel arbitrary, cause we're reacting to the same number. Shared urgency comes from shared reality.\n\nFast forward to late 2024. The AI wave hits. Our product is obsolete. But this time, instead of yelling, we were in a foxhole together. Because we had built that foundation of trust, we could make the hard decisions as a team.  \n  \nI’m not sharing this as advice or a playbook, it's just one founder’s experience. If there’s a takeaway at all, it’s probably this: treat your CTO like a true partner, especially when things are hard. It might not feel urgent when everything is going well, but it matters a lot when the storm hits.\n\nWould genuinely love to hear how others invest in their founder partnerships before they’re stress-tested.",

One thing that helps is reframing progress as learning, not just building. You can move forward by testing assumptions in very small ways instead of looking for big obvious feedback. Silence usually does not mean the idea is bad, it often means the ask is too heavy or too abstract for people to respond to. Reducing it to one clear question or one tiny experiment can break that loop. Also, momentum matters more than perfect sequencing. Even small improvements or cleanup work can help you feel unstuck. Most founders hit this wall more than once, it is not a sign you are doing it wrong. How are you currently trying to validate it?",

Here are my two perspectives:\n\nI did a startup abroad that then merged into my VC's other portfolio company, where I ran and scaled to the next phase, then burned out and left to return to the States. In the interim, I was considering doing an MBA. One of my good buddies was pursuing an MBA at UCLA and participating in a startup competition there that I was allowed to join. While doing that, I was able to sit in regularly on a bunch of his courses. A lot of the material they were learning and the case studies they were studying—I had to learn on the fly and apply. So I think 'hands-on' beats that handily; but my situation was very unique and fortunate.\n\nLater on, I became an EIR and startup lecturer at one of the top three accelerators (not YC—lol) and have completed four batches. I believe our content material was better than that of most MBA programs. I think running weekly experiments or doing real simulations and talking to real customers is far superior to reading case studies. Guest lecturers are about the same. In terms of networking, people in an accelerator together are likely more helpful in the near term, but I think people in MBA programs tend to keep in touch and be helpful to each other over longer time horizons.",

      "text": "A few years ago during the George Floyd protests I had an idea of creating a decentralized streaming network not tied to any mainstream social media network. The idea was that people could live stream anything that was happening at a protest and it would basically put the footage in two places:\n\n1) a server with strong data protection laws in a country outside of the US where governmental and political influence by Silicon Valley could not touch it\n\n2) in a distributed file sharing / data sharding architecture where people could host bits of the file on their devices\n\nShould footage need to be retrieved it could be done so with watermarking to ensure no modification of the footage had taken place. \n\nI want to revisit this idea and could probably whip something together this weekend, but I want to expand on this idea and create a social network not powered and populated by bots like Reddit or X or Meta. I realize the irony of doing this here but there has to be a starting point. \n\nWhat has been happening in the past few weeks has me absolutely shaken to my core. I don’t want to sit around and do nothing. If there are people with the same level of conviction I want to work with you so we can use our collective brain power for doing something good. I don’t care for the negative viewpoints and quitter attitudes of people who don’t think we can’t make a change. If you want to build something that can help our fellow citizens both here and in any country that’s facing a repressive government, then let’s do it. ",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I hope your Friday is going well. Please be safe with the snowstorm, especially those in the South.\n\nAbout six months ago, I started a company. I thought it might be interesting to share a founder’s perspective from the Midwest, especially while building something fairly technical.\n\nBefore this, I worked as a DevOps engineer and most recently as an SRE at Cloudflare. I spent a lot of late nights inside a lot of tools, watching teams ship software faster than I could realistically maintain it. Over time, it became clear that while tooling had improved, the underlying problem had not. There was no real end in sight that would meaningfully improve both my work life and my personal life.\n\nThat realization is what ultimately pushed me to leave a job I genuinely liked and start a company.\n\nI am from the Midwest, and because I have worked in big tech, I was fortunate to build relationships with many incredibly talented people here, including local investors. It is a small ecosystem, with both challenges and strengths. After Missouri Startup Weekend, shout out to everyone who runs it, I decided to lean fully into building from here. See you there again this year.\n\nIn doing so, I learned a lot about what it means to try to build a venture-backed company in the Midwest. I want to share a few observations, not as complaints, but as context for anyone on a similar path.\n\n**Raising capital feels meaningfully different here.**  \nMidwest investors tend to be more conservative. They are thoughtful, kind, and deeply focused on fundamentals, but often operate on different cycles than the coasts. Pattern matching leans toward fintech, healthcare, and vertical SaaS. We leaned into this ecosystem anyway because some people believed in what we were building and believed in us.\n\nAt the same time, we found ourselves spending a lot of energy on education. When we spoke to investors on the West Coast, many immediately understood the problem space. The challenge then became valuation expectations and alignment. Midwest valuations can be strong for great companies, but the gap between coastal expectations and a great Midwest company can make it difficult to pull in certain types of partners early on.\n\nThis is not a value judgment. It is simply a reality worth understanding if you are building here.\n\n**Cross-collaboration takes more intentional effort.**  \nThere are incredibly talented builders across Midwest cities, but fewer accidental collisions. Trying another founder’s product, trading early feedback, or discovering what someone else is building often requires deliberate outreach or travel. The serendipity you get in denser hubs is harder to come by, which makes community building even more important.\n\n**Specialization shapes what gets built.**  \nMany Midwest investors are generalists rather than deep tech or AI infrastructure specialists. Generalists tend to fund general companies. That is why you see so much excellence in healthcare and fintech here. What we see less of are companies attempting truly wild or category-defining technical bets.\n\nThat said, this is not a criticism. It is an opportunity.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to tear down Midwest VCs or compare regions. I have met outstanding founders and investors here who are doing real, meaningful work. I want to celebrate them, learn from them, and meet more of them.\n\nIf you are building something in the Midwest, whether it is early, strange, ambitious, or simply useful to a handful of people, I would genuinely love to see it. Share your company. Reach out. Try other people’s products. Offer feedback. Cross-pollination matters, even if the outcome is not a billion-dollar business.\n\nAt the end of the day, building something that helps even one other person is still worth doing.",

Outside of them, every connection is intentional - which is exhausting but arguably produces higher quality relationships.\n\nBuilding in the UK (smaller tech scene than London specifically), I've found the same pattern: investors who immediately get it are often coastal, and the education gap with local capital is a real time sink. You end up becoming a translator between your problem space and their pattern library.\n\nOne thing that helped: treating online communities as the accidental collision layer that physical proximity would normally provide. Reddit, HN, Discord servers for your niche. Not a perfect substitute for grabbing coffee with someone, but it fills part of the gap.\n\nThe 80/20 rule another commenter mentioned is painfully accurate. Building is the easy part.

If it doesn't work, move on to the next thing.\n\nAnd if you watch successful indie hacker build logs or motivational videos, they consistently preach this mindset.\n\nBut I'm genuinely confused about how this works in practice.\n\nI launched my first app a few weeks ago. I got a few downloads, barely any real users. I think these numbers are too small of a sample size to make any real judgment, so I feel like I should focus on increasing exposure first. \n\nBut here's my dilemma: how much time should I actually spend on this?\n\n\n\nHonestly, I think launching isn't the end. it's just the beginning. After you launch, you need to:\n\n\n\n\\- Create marketing materials\n\n\\- Run campaigns across different channels\n\n\\- Analyze user behavior and feedback\n\n\\- Iterate on features based on what you learn\n\n\\- Keep testing and optimizing\n\n\n\nAll of this takes time. Weeks, sometimes months. And it requires consistent effort, not just a quick burst.\n\nSo my questions:\n\nHow do you know when to quit vs. when to keep pushing? Is there a signal you look for? A timeline? A metric threshold?\n\nHow do you balance iteration vs. new projects? If you're supposed to ship multiple things to find what works, but each thing needs months of marketing effort... when do you actually have time to build the next thing?\n\nIf you're running an existing product while developing something new, how do you handle it? Do you keep improving the existing product, and when a new idea comes up, instead of building it right away, do you create mockups or landing pages first to test the response? But some products require users to actually try them before they can judge. so this is where I get confused.\n\nI feel like I might be too caught up in the \"serial builder\" mythology without understanding how it actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from people who've been through this cycle multiple times.",

In practice, “fail fast” usually means being explicit about what you are trying to learn next and how long you are willing to pay for that learning. A few weeks of low signal is not a failure if you have not tested distribution, messaging, or a concrete user workflow yet. On the flip side, pushing indefinitely without a clear hypothesis just turns into inertia.\n\nWhat has helped me is time boxing around questions, not outcomes. For example, spend a month answering whether anyone repeatedly uses a specific feature, or whether you can acquire users below some cost, rather than chasing growth in the abstract. If you cannot get clarity after a few focused iterations, that is often the real signal to move on. The serial builder myth hides how much of the work is actually deciding what not to keep funding with your time.",

It's a note-taking app where AI auto-categorizes your notes and reminds you before you forget them. pretty simple.\n\nBut I have a bigger vision: integrating notes scattered across multiple platforms, auto-processing shared links, voice/image analysis, eventually building toward a true AI assistant. None of that exists yet.\n\nAnd that's kind of my insecurity  what if the lemonade stand version just isn't compelling enough to attract anyone? Like, maybe people need to see the full restaurant to even care?\n\nBut I guess that's the whole point of testing early. If nobody wants the lemonade, building the restaurant won't fix that.\n\nReally appreciate you taking the time. Saving this comment.",

      "text": "I have been trying to build and launch things for quite some time now. I also have good experience as a product manager, so ideation and planning are not new to me.\n\nBut I am an ADHD and OCD person. My biggest problem is that I think and plan a lot, and before I finish building one idea, another idea pops up. My brain keeps chasing that dopamine hit of new ideas, new concepts, and new thinking.\n\nBecause of this, I keep jumping. I start something, get excited, build halfway, then move on. Over the last 8–9 months, I have built around 25+ half-baked ideas. None of them were properly launched or given enough time. I ended 2025 with a lot of regret because I was busy all the time, but not actually shipping anything meaningful.\n\nSo for 2026, I am trying to change this.\n\nWhat I am trying now is to restrict myself to one idea per week. Even if the idea is bad or not perfect, I want to stick with it for a week, build it, and launch it. No overthinking, no endless planning, no regrets. Just ship and move on.\n\nAlmost all my ideas are very lean, and I use tech stacks that cost almost nothing until I make a sale. Money is not the problem. Focus and execution are.\n\nNow I am struggling with structure.\n\nI want a proper daily and weekly plan that:\n\n\\- allows me to try new ideas without going crazy,\n\n\\- forces me to finish and launch,\n\n\\- and still gives some space to grow or iterate on ideas that actually show promise.\n\nRight now, I feel like I am still stuck more in thinking than executing, and I keep context-switching a lot.\n\nSo I wanted to ask you all honestly:\n\nIf you have ADHD-style founder brain or idea overload, how are you managing it?\n\nIs the one-idea-per-week approach a good way to break this cycle, or is it a bad idea?\n\nHow do you plan your week so you actually build, launch, and then decide what deserves more time?\n\nI am not looking for motivational quotes. I genuinely want to learn what has worked for others in real life.\n\nBecause I feel like there is no productivity app is right for me? Anyone feels the same? I hate these generic task management apps, I have tried and paid for nearly 10 such apps, so please recommend me the best one please.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏽",

One idea per week can work, but only if the definition of “done” is brutally small. Something like a landing page plus a single user action, not a full product. Otherwise the week just becomes another planning sprint. What helped me was separating idea exploration from execution. I keep a parking lot for new ideas and I’m not allowed to touch it during a build window. I also plan weeks around outputs, not tasks. By Friday, X must exist in the world, even if it’s rough. After shipping, I do a short review and only allow myself to continue if there’s a clear signal, not just excitement.\n\nContext switching is usually a symptom of avoiding the boring middle. Short daily time blocks helped more than any app. Two focused build blocks, everything else is optional. Most tools didn’t stick for me either. A simple doc or notebook with a weekly goal and daily checkmarks worked better than fancy systems. The structure needs to be boring enough that your brain stops trying to optimize it.",

Eu não tenho diagnóstico confirmado, mas muitas vezes me identifico com esta dificuldade, ja tive vários projetos concluídos na minha cabeça, mas a maioria não pude implementar. Com isto, vendo seu post que diz, que \"dinheiro\" não é o problema e que você tem qualificação organizacional de produto, o que eu acredito que seja o maior impedimento de todos os \"idealizadores\", assim acho que você precisa de uma pessoa externa a esta condição como um apoio ou parceiro de contraparte, mas não necessáriamente pessoal, pode ser um terceiro comprometido com metas e objetivos, que possa levar a conclusão dos seus projetos, uma pessoa ateta aos prazos e objetivo final. Ela deve estar \"subordinada a você\", mas você deve ter a mente aberta que o ojetivo desta pessoa é entregar seus projetos, então você não pode furar o planejamento de entrega com remodelações ou novas alterações fora do que já foi definido. Entenda que sua função é criar, idealizar e desta passoa finalizar e entregar. Não sei do que se trata, mas 70% das idéias podem não ir para frente. É normal. Foque no objetivo final da idéia: Lucrar, Servir ou Criar. Procure quem possa validar suas idéias com seriedade, de forma científica, com estudo e pesquiza sem idealismo. Produtos e Idéias dependem de necessidade, a necessidade é gerada pelo momento. O Time é importante para entrada no mercado, em contra partida a qualidade faz durar. Aceite que vai precisar de ajuda e vai ser difícil deixar outra pessoa tocar seu projeto e dar opinões contrárias e que vai querer finalizar do jeito que está e não da forma ideal que você imaginou. Ha muita coisa pra falar, mas se fosse fácil eu não teria esta dificuldade também. Espero ter contribuido com algo.",

The nuance that often gets missed is that the news cycle is dominated by the winners or the heavily funded, so you rarely see the thousands of elite technical startups that die quietly because they built a technical product that nobody actually wanted. Technical brilliance does not automatically equal product-market fit, and as long as there are problems to be solved, startups will always be needed.\n\nThat said, you are right to be cautious because you will face competition from people who are better connected and more technically skilled than you. If you try to simply out-code lets say a Google engineer type of founder, you will lose. The market doesn't ask for your credentials, it asks if you can solve a specific pain better than anyone else. So the real question isn't whether you have the background, but whether you can find a problem you understand deeply enough to deliver a solution uniquely well. If you can do that, the lack of a pedigree matters a lot less.",

Most technical founders suck at marketing - if you can do both even mediocrely, you have an edge.\n\n\n\nDon't try to build the next Stripe.

      "text": "Right now, I am running a startup with my cofunder. It’s just the two of us, and while we’ve raised a tiny bit of VC money, it is enough for us to survive for now.\n\nBased on current situation, the two of us simply can’t handle everything ourselves anymore, so we’ve had to start hiring. And honestly, **hiring has been one of the most painful parts**:\n\n* Good talent is expensive, especially in the U.S., and we just can’t afford it at this stage;\n* So we started looking into hiring oversea, but remote work bring a new challenge: unstable work quality\n* After quite a bit of trial and error, we’ve finally managed to find a few decent people at a reasonable price.\n\n**But then came the next big challenge: management**. My co-founder and I both come from big tech companies where we were just IC. We’ve never really had to manage people before. Now that we do, we’re realizing just how hard it is to get it right:\n\n* If we’re too blunt, it kills motivation;\n* If we’re too soft, things get dragged out and quality suffers;\n* Striking the right tone and level of direction feels incredibly tricky. and especially i am the person working more with remote ppl and i am very straight forward person.\n\nI know some people would say, “Well, if someone isn’t working out, just replace them.” But in reality:\n\n* We’re already overwhelmed with the amount of work on our plates;\n* Given how stretched we already are, investing time into interviewing and onboarding could further disrupt our current workflow and introduce additional risks to output quality.\n\nAs for equity, i am very hesitant. I have seen friends fall out badly over equity disputes in their startup. So for now, we'd rather keep things simple and stick with paid employees.\n\nSo I'm throwing this out to the community:\n\n1. How did you get through this stage of your startup?\n2. Did you just power through, duct-taping things together until you had more stability and could afford better hires?\n3. Or is there a smarter way to navigate this messy, uncertain middle ground?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or stories from others who’ve been there. Thank you for your time.",

I sympathize with your situation; it is tricky to navigate. \n\nThe first 10ppl you hire are critical in defining the company culture for the next 100s you will bring on board. In particular, the 3rd and 4th person you hire are immensely critical - they can break your entire business if they don't fit culture-wise with you and your co-founder. \n\nBased on that, I suggest you make culture fit a component as important as expertise in your hiring decision. If you are a straightforward person, you can't hire someone who is touchy-feely. \n\nRegarding lack of management skills, you will need to pick them over time, unless you plan to carve an IC role for yourself as the company grows (you will still need leadership skills, but that is slightly different than having people report to you). Having said that, it should not matter much for the first 10 hires, because they should not need to managed - you should really be looking for people who tell \\_you\\_ what needs to happen and how, not juniors who require baby-sitting. \n\nGood luck!",

But putting it into practice is where I struggle.\n\n1. For being nice and tough \n\nYou mentioned how it’s hard to go from being warm and easygoing to suddenly becoming intense. I couldn’t agree more. That’s very much my situation. By nature, I’m an easygoing person. I don’t get worked up about a lot of things in life, but I do have high standards when it comes to work. So most of the time, before problems arise, I’m pretty laid-back and approachable. But when something goes wrong, I suddenly flip into a tough, no-nonsense mode and that shift catches people off guard. I honestly don’t know yet how to adjust that dynamic. I feel I have wear a mask now, cant be myself in work hours which is all my awak hours.\n\n2. As for the idea of demanding a lot without reciprocating, in terms of money, I think we’re being fair. \n\nBut if we’re talking about emotional investment or effort, that’s where I’m genuinely confused. It’s a tiny startup, and it’s not like we have clear top-down goals. Most of the time, I’m still figuring out the goals myself. And on top of that, I’m expected to manage and motivate a team it’s a lot to handle, and I don’t always know how to do it right.\n\n3. About to know better about your employees\n\nWhat you said about knowing people’s strengths and weaknesses really resonated with me. That’s actually how I try to assign work now. I put in a lot of effort trying to drive this forward. Not everyone is interested in discovering their own strengths and weaknesses. In fact, I often feel like I’m the one pushing them to figure it out, more than they’re pushing themselves.\n\n  \n3. About company goal\n\nRegarding your question about weekly updates or communicating company goals. We do have weekly meetings but we are currently in a period of turbulence due to changes in the external environment, so the business is still shifting quite a lot. I’m still figuring out the direction myself.\n\nWhat you said made me realize that so much of this, leadership, goal-setting, expectation management, really depends on me having clarity about what we are doing.\n\n**But the reality I'm facing is that I need to figure things out while also trying to be a good leader. Honestly, this is the hardest job I've ever had. I know how to build a product, and I know how to sell one but this part, the leadership part, is where I’m still very new and honestly not confident at all.**\n\n  \nSo yeah… it's a lot.

          "text": "It’s a significant stage and firstly congrats!\nWell you are planting your future company culture at the moment so management is a process reflects that.\nWhen hiring, most important things is to ask yourself:\n1. What type of people I want to work with ( it’s more about the personality part. Criteria would be passionate, quick learner, structured, builder, high work ethic, ok to work longer hours… list may go on. Quick tip, mostly people tend to hire people are similar to themselves and it may create bottlenecks. You may more seek for complementary personalities selected for the right places) \n\n2. What skills you are looking for ( you can identify the hard criteria) and try to hire the top talent. Going oversees is a good strategy. But if the oversees in Europe, within Europe you still have many countries with different cost of living. If the level you are looking for is still high budget I would go one step more junior but with a strong culture fit so they can learn fast \n\n3. Management. There is no one fits all and it’s a lot about understanding psychology rather than applied management methodologies at this stage. The best approach for remote first teams are setting very clear time bound deliverables, engaging them on daily to bond as a team, boosting trust and to do not micromanaging.\nFor instance you can create team rituals such as morning 10 mins coffee and 1h team lunch on a selected day where you talk about anything and bonding as people. Then every Friday all members set weekly targets and submit them to you, once approved they start working on it on Monday. You either have daily progress huddles or twice a week.\n\nRemote teams thrive with rituals and as much comms as possible in my opinion (leading remote teams for the last 6 years)\n\nIf you wanna discuss deeper feel free to dm me happy to support",

Team is great, culture is great, pay is great, I basically have no problem, its all remote so it might get lonely but that’s it.\n\nI open this up to my current employers and they basically said they will allow me to be in charge of companies expansion to other products where I can feel the entrepreneurial parts of it, gather more experience, and have a % cut or better financial upside if the new expansions reach the target goals etc.\n\nAm I doing a stupid decision here by leaving something good, or since this is also a great incubator its probably never going to be the same with trying your own thing.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.",

Otherwise they replace your internal conviction with external validation. That’s not always a bad trade but its something to think about.\n\nAlso,\n\nWanting to create a startup is often a proxy for wanting control, narrative ownership, and asymmetric upside.\n\nYou already kinda have 2.5 of those at your current job.\n\nWhatever you decide i hope you succeed. I hope some of this helped, even a little.\n\nGood luck!",

It’s the safest path, sounds like you are doing well and seems like you might have a career in front of you that can be both rewarding and successful. That’s also what any person who crunches numbers for a living will tell you.\n\nNow if after reading that paragraph you are like “well who tf is this guy telling me I should play it safe, he doesn’t even know me.”, well maybe that tells you deep down you don’t want to play it safe. And if the next couple of paragraphs don’t scare you or bother you, than maybe it’s worth a shot.\n\nBuilding a company is hard. It’s the hardest thing I ever did. People will hate you, even when you try to do the right thing. Customers will cancel for no reason. If you are lucky and are even mildly successful you’ll be responsible for expenses that are more than what both your parents used to make in a year. And those expenses will come in monthly. \n\nWhen things go right, everyone else gets the credit, when things go wrong it’s your fault. The only problems you’ll get to deal with are the absolutely soul crushing, hair on fire type of shit only the top and most thick skinned customer support agents deal with.\n\nYour phone will ring on vacation, and at the dinner table. You will be absolutely consumed to the point where you will actually forget about things in your personal life until it’s too late.\n\nWith all that being said, it’s also like a drug. You’ll have some of the highest highs and greatest moments in your life, and it’s a rush that you’ll never replace with a 9-5.\n\nI miss it and hope when my transition period ends I can have another go.\n\nEither way best of luck.

Startup narratives flatten impact into growth curves, which makes anything that does not map to revenue feel invisible or fake. At the same time, neither startups nor academia has a monopoly on meaningful work, they just optimize for very different incentives. In practice, a lot of academic research never reaches patients either, and a lot of startups are not pretending to cure cancer, they are solving narrower problems. The frustration usually comes from the mismatch between stated mission and actual day to day decisions. If you are craving alignment between effort and human value, it is reasonable to question the environment you are in. A PhD can make sense if you are motivated by the work itself rather than the story around it. The harder question is what kind of contribution you want to make and under what constraints, because every system trades something off. It is worth giving yourself time before making a sharp pivot, especially when emotions are raw.",

Switch because you're clear about what matters.\n\nThe startups that actually help people? They're built by people who know exactly what problem they're solving and why it matters. Not because it's a good market opportunity. Because they can't not work on it.\n\nWhatever path you choose, build from that. Not from trying to prove your life has meaning.\n\nYou already know it does. You saw what matters when you witnessed that suffering.",

My brother and I are working on developing an online card game and we have been discussing making an LLC for opening business accounts and so we have that structure in place early (as well as other benefits a business entity would provide). However, we are concerned that we may not have anything out until next year (2027) and therefore will not have any profit in 2026 for this entity, only expenses.\n\nWill this hurt us for taxes next year when we file? Or will we not be penalized since we had no profit for the business? We are just wanting to play it safe and not end up in a large financial hole due to an unexpected tax hit.\n\n(We are aware of the annual fees for LLC's and the initial filing fee. Luckily we are based in Missouri, where the filing is $50 and there does not seem to be an annual renewal fee).\n\nAny advice or help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

You can run either LLC or C-Corp without having any profit for a while - you just don't pay taxes. \n\nAs someone mentioned, you can also start as an LLC and convert to C-Corp later when you pick up investors. In fact, this is exactly what I have done with one of my startups (Fusebit). It was a bit of a paperwork (around $10k), but at that point you already have inverstor's money. However, there are disadvantages to the LLC->C-Corp conversion. Generally, when you start a C-Corp, as a founder, you give yourself founder stock. If you hold onto it for 5 years, it gets preferential tax treatment (effectively, you don't pay the long-term capital gain taxes on it - read up about QSBS). The clock for the 5 year holding period starts ticking when you start the C-Corp, so it is beneficial to do it early if you know you will be picking up investors later.",

Startup costs have their own rules too, so a lot of those expenses don’t get deducted until the year you’re actually up and running.

Something like \"cool, let's revisit this after we hit X milestone\" (first 10 users, working prototype, whatever makes sense). That gives everyone an out without awkwardness, and by then you'll have data - did they actually show up? Did they deliver? That makes the comp conversation 10x easier because it's based on reality not hypotheticals.\n\nIf you do need something formal now, cliff vesting is your friend.

If you really agree on the excitement level, share the same values and can influence each other (meaning that you are committing to each other rather than the business idea) thats great because even if the initial idea wouldnt work in the market, you can keep motivating each other and pivot - thats the ideal scenario, however, its not always easy to find a person to share this\n\n2. You can start working with multiple people on a very small projects, such as preparing the tech roadmap, KPIs that they plan to deliver, tech stack they want to use etc. You can do like 2-4 weeks projects with each simultaneously. This is not to take advantage or go behind people. Its more to see how's the style of each. You can be transparent about it to them by saying lets get to know our working style for the next 2 weeks to see if we align. Maybe some of them will drop on the way, become less responsive. Or the ones you are less optimistic will align better with your vision and working style. Based on that you may have a healthier judgement.\n\nOverall the most risky approach would be to ignore red flags and just to focus on having an MVP with whomever agrees.",

In practice, uncertainty is normal at this stage, but ambiguity about expectations tends to hurt later. The bigger risk is not people dropping off, but misaligned assumptions about effort, ownership, and decision-making. Getting those explicit early usually matters more than enthusiasm.",

My waitlist is 100s of people long (B2C at $70/mo) and still growing with 0 marketing spend.\n\nI have posted about it briefly on LinkedIn and VCs reached out to me about it. I am not yet ready to raise (for reasons that will be obvious) but already have \"coffee chats\" lined up/booked solid. (TBF, it is partially due to outreach as well as inbound, and I live in NYC, a very VC-dense area, so \"luck\" is on my side.)\n\nI have a team of folks who want to work on the project (all non-technical) and several people genuinely excited.\n\nThe issue is the technical side of it is just... not exciting. Technically dull.\n\nWe are meshing two existing, pretty boring systems for another boring-ish system. There is very minimal AI integration and none of the tech-y buzz words that are popular right now.\n\nWe are also in EdTech, which some prefer to avoid, and I am a first-time, young founder.\n\nI get why folks would not want to take the tech lead here. The thing is, we already have an MVP (not vibe coded, I have eng friends who I paid) and the software, while immense/complex, could be built by 3-4 engineers once we have funding.\n\nFurther, one of my friends made the point that I could do a 6-8 week coding bootcamp and know 80-90% of the things I needed to know and just call myself \"technical\" since I would technically have the skills to build the (admittedly rudimentary) software with that knowledge (and, likely, the help of cursor).\n\nThat feels kind of like \"duping\" the real engineers who would join the company, and I am much more comfortable in the CEO/vision role than tech. That being said, I am sort of willing to do \"whatever it takes,\" and once we have a founding eng, I could hand most control to them.\n\n(If I choose to do this, my co-founder would be a non-technical person who has expressed interest and has a very relevant masters degree from Harvard who is super passionate about the field and would be (on paper) perfect for the co-founder role.) \n\nWhat are folks thoughts on this? Is this as terrible an idea as it feels?",

If you want to dilute yourself, go ahead, but it makes me think you have no idea what you're doing.\n\nI don't know who you're trying to fool by doing a bootcamp either tbh. If you wanted to do a bootcamp so that you could finish the project that would would be reasonable, but if you're not actually going to do that it seems like a waste of time. The point of having a technical cofounder is for them to be able to write the product and not cost a lot (relative to their skill) because they have a lot of equity.",

So, what’s preventing you from selling the MVP to these users? According to your estimates you should be able to start generating 10s of thousands of dollars per month - that will pay for a lot of development and is a great position to find a legitimate founding engineer or technical co-founder.\n\nYou don’t need to raise, you don’t need to impress anyone … I’m not understanding your problem.",

That's a lot more than most founders have, haha. Regarding the boot camp issue... I would advise against doing it merely to claim to be \"technical\" in the field of optics. Engineers will quickly see through it, and it might backfire. But if you really want to learn more about the product and have better communication with your future engineering team? That's really useful; in fact, the \"boring tech\" factor could work to your advantage. Many developers are tired of the hoopla around AI and want to create something reliable, functional, and useful for actual people.",

Boring tech means less risk, greater stability, and lower costs.\n\nA 6-8 week bootcamp won't give you the experience you need to plan and implement a tech product for real paying users by yourself. At best, it'll make you a junior developer able to work independently on passion projects, at worst the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) will tank your product.\n\nIt will give you some technical background, usually very execution-heavy and in one specific programming environment. It won't give you the strategic understanding and breadth to plan tech and product strategically, assess tech work by others, or lead a small tech team.\n\nSince it sounds like you have some budget, I'd continue working with the people you trust and find an outsourced contractor if you need more bandwidth. For tech leadership, you may get by with an advisor or fractional partner for quite a while. This is another advantage of boring tech, you don't need a specialist to do groundbreaking R&D for months, just someone with experience who helps you find and assemble the right tools for the job.\n\nFeel free to DM if you'd like to discuss further. I founded an edtech startup myself and helped many other founders with their tech since, would be happy to help out where I can!",
