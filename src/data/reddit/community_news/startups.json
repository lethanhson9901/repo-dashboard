Short videos or simple demos that show what it actually does usually work better than anything vague.\n\nI’ve also found it helps to have a bit of organic groundwork first. Some content on social, a small follower base, and a bit of history on the page makes ads feel less like they’re coming from a brand that just appeared overnight.\n\nFrom there, A/B testing ads makes a lot of sense. Try a few angles, see what people actually respond to, then build from what works.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m probably the target audience for this stuff. I constantly get IG ads for apps promising better life organization or productivity, and I’m always a sucker for clicking through to see how my life might magically improve. When the message is clear, it works.\n\nAds aren’t a magic fix, but they’re a solid accelerator once the basics are in place.",

They're about understanding whether what you've built actually solves a real problem for real people. If you can't convince 10 people through direct conversation, ads and marketing won't magically fix that.\n\nA few things that actually work: find where your target users already congregate (forums, Slack groups, subreddits, Discord servers) and contribute genuinely for weeks before even mentioning you're building something. When you do mention it, frame it as \"I'm building X, would love feedback\" not \"check out my product.\" People are way more willing to help a fellow human than to be marketed to.\n\nAlso - referrals from those first users are gold. If someone loves what you're building, ask them directly who else might benefit. Warm intros convert way better than cold outreach.",

Start by identifying where your potential users are already spending time online whether that’s niche subreddits, specialized forums, or social media groups, and engage in those spaces by offering value before directly promoting your app. you might also consider beta testing or offering the app for free to a small group of users to get real feedback. this can help identify if the UX is confusing, if the idea resonates, and if people would be willing to pay for it. lastly, user feedback is crucial, so try reaching out directly to people who fit your target audience and ask for honest opinions. this early stage is tough, but persistence and focusing on one-on-one feedback rather than broad promotional efforts might help you gather the insights you need to iterate and improve.",

Posting on many forums. It takes time. It is not that you just post about it or tell people about your product, you have to figure out what problem are you solving for them, and get it to them according to that problem. In terms of cold DMs, first DM - well, you might not get a response, and to very limited people. Also, you need to reach out to as many people as possible, and then keep following up. Following up is the key! Out of maybe 500 people, 5 might respond, but once they respond, they would be genuinely interested. Probably, and win after that, if two people try it out and keep on regularly using it, then you have two winners.",

      "text": "I used to work in a very large bureaucratic organization where I was involved in data cleaning- NOT data analytics, NOT AI engineering, but literally cleaning messy data to be sent to statisticians for analysis. I was miserable. On top of that, I realized I hated having no impact on a company and being told what to do every second of the day with little upside for my career/life.\n\nI had been sitting on an idea for a business in the hotel industry for a while, though, because I love hospitality and saw I gap in the market I believed others did not see. I was doing a lot of thinking/ research about the product, market, as well as how the business would be executed and truly thought it could work. However, I was really stuck on making such a drastic leap of faith because I was so focused on the downside instead of the upside.\n\nBut one day I woke up more miserable than normal, and heard a podcast about someone who I went to school with that was running a 7-figure events business. One of the things he kept harping on was that fortune favors the bold, and that it's fine to feel afraid or skeptical, but you need to have the guts to put your feelings to the side and just go for it.  \n  \nComing from someone I perceived as a normal guy I went to class with, this hit me really hard. Because if he was able to take the risk, why couldn't I?\n\nNeedless to say, I drafted up a resignation letter and sent it to my former boss the same day\n\nThe next 18 months were more grueling than I ever imagined:\n\n* I dealt with more rejection & embarrassment in that time span than the rest of my life combined\n* My family was not encouraging on my leap of faith & let me know about it constantly\n* I had burned a significant amount of savings building a prototype\n* I had many sleepless nights as well as missed workouts/meals, leading to occasional bouts of sickness\n* Good friends & I completely drifted apart due to the time I had to take to work on my business\n\nOn top of all that, for a variety of reasons, I unfortunately had to shut down the business.\n\nHowever, I couldn't help but feel pride in this difficult situation I found myself in. Not only did I understand how to conduct proper customer discovery, manage financials, reach out to & close potential clients, & be a good leader (at least this was my goal), but I became a better version of myself. My confidence is at its peak, my mental acuity has never been sharper, and my network is pretty dang good. Lastly, I've learned to acknowledge and overcome fear to pursue what matters to me- the most valuable skill you can have imo.\n\nNow, because of my previous experience & connections, I secured a paid position with solid equity at a new startup. It's a great placeholder for now and I think it will lead to venture #2 down the road. I guess it all works out in a way and I would not have changed it for anything.\n\nWondering if anyone has a similar experience with their first venture?\n\n\n\nP.S.  \nIf you were in a similar position to me and want to start something, really think about your burn and what would happen if the company didn't work out after x months. I was in a position where I had enough savings/resources that I was able to spend the first few months with $0 in revenue. I am a big advocate for taking a risk to pursue a startup opportunity, but even I was somewhat calculated about it.",

So that is what I started doing towards the latter half of my first company- surrounded myself with others who had entrepreneurial ventures through relevant events, groups, and established networks like the one I mentioned. When it was time for me to make a change, it was a lot easier because not only did I know people similar to me, but I also knew what they were working on as well as where I could add value- knowing how to add value is key as well.\n\nIn short, go to where the people you want to be like are and understand how you can provide real value to what they're doing.",

In the early startup days, you have to do unconventional things be it your strategy, market opportunity or product in order to win. If you just follow conventional wisdom and what everyone else is doing it tends to lead to mediocrity and you lose to bigger companies who can do that at scale.\n\nHowever once a startup grows bigger it starts to adopt conventional practices because that's the only way to organise everyone to operate in a cohesive manner. I'm not trying to say one is better than the other, but it's an apples to oranges comparison and success looks very different in each case.

You'll see what level of work is normal, and so on.\n\nThat makes it much easier to prioritize and do what you can and must do in a small startup, than if you go at it clueless without knowing what normal looks like.\n\nI'll give you an example from a project that I'm currently working on that has to do with improving marketing and growth for small business owners:\n\nMy biggest problem is that since they haven't seen what a normal success level is at they don't see how badly they're doing, and that means that they don't even see the point of what actually are miraculous improvements that'd be possible.\n\nSo, yes, out of context we're talking about two different environments when we're talking about 5 person startup or a 100 people successful business; but within context it's crucial to have seen and learn from the inside of a 100 people successful business before you work in a 5 person startup.\n\nYou'll know the level things should be at, and it'll help you make the right compromises and priorities, not to mention that it'll give an idea of what it is that you're working towards when you're able to grow the teams.\n\nA 5 person startup that haven't even seen how to successfully work will always have less chance of success than a 5 person startup that in their mind have clear picture of what they should be doing, what they're building towards.",

It took me a year to find a good match for my tech cofounder who was able to quickly deliver on his promises. Here are my points:\n- past experience and education do not matter. I had people from MiT, Amazon, Apple, And other top business and education brands who talked as good game, fail and not deliver a single feature because they got stuck on what’s right vs shipping \n- what matters if you and them are hungry. My current tech cofounder has some experience and is from a mid tier school. We built an mvp in 2 months and are now iterating. \n- ego. Every time somebody wants to own an unequal share as a cofounder, they are usually stuck on the idea that they are a visionary. I had to go through that with myself and a few others and learn that *visionary* [insert title here] = delusional or rigid or egocentric. I’m no exception. \n- make sure you can argue with your cofounder. I don’t mean being nice during … have a meltdown with each other? Can you solve your issues after and come back together?\n- can the two of you ship something within 4 months?\n- can you communicate and trust each other’s words and promises?\n- can you get to mvp? To get seed?\n- do you need more than one cofounder? Don’t be greedy, but don’t be dumb.\n\nAll of the above are very hard things to get through and is what the 2 years of runway is for + one of you is likely to need a place to live so be ready to have a couch buddy when shit goes sideways for one of you. \n\nNow pardon me as I have a pitch deck to complete so we can fund ourselves for the next year… before we run out of our runway + so my technical cofounder can move out from my couch and have a place of her own again.",

If they do not understand it, that doesn't mean you are not able to explain it - sometimes it's them.\n2. Do not build without validating with your users, even if you have a very strong understanding of your user. Build small, test it out in beta with the loyal users.\n3. Be very active in supporting or providing technical support to your users, if it's a product which is online or any other product. Support is what builds loyal users.

                  "text": "I actually started this as a side project for my own community because we were handed [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) to run and build our developer community. This proved to be something which was initially very amazing to look at! \"Hey, I could list my events, every part of the community events over here.\" But soon it became a redundant task in terms of managing everything outside the platform other than listing the events because of the visibility. So the first thing that I did was to code a tool which had a number of forms available and members list, so all the members of my community would always find all their registrations, would always find all my events, all my community activity at one place. This was entirely coded while I was plying from and to office in the Metro. Soon this picked up, so I open sourced it. But you know, open source also comes with several costs, so probably people didn't deploy it much, or maybe the code wasn't that easily understandable. Moving ahead, I took a domain, deployed it live and scaled to around 23 communities within three months, and around 10,000 users in about a year. This was the journey. Initially, once I had the clarity, after being given a chance to attend Google IO twice, out of which once I also gave a talk, I had a lot of interaction in their developer relations space. This in turn gave me clarity on two things:\n\n1. This developer relations space is a place where companies are running blindsided, losing a lot of data, and probably getting reports on only numbers of people who are just a part of the community.\n2. In the long run, this can be a global ecosystem which can enable a lot more developers to learn from each other, build great things together, and most importantly, can be something which I'd want to work for a longer time.",

Ask yourself - is this really what you want to spend the next 5 or 10 years of your life on ? If it’s not fulfilling, you are going to regret it but it won’t bring the lost years back.",

We threw tournaments,  managed to scale nicely over 5 years (including Covid when we went virtual), and had built enough credibility with gamers (who are notoriously distrustful and skeptical of outsiders), to put ourselves on the precipice of becoming a major (+2,000 participants) event in the community.\n\n2. Root Causes: a) personality conflicts. I ignored my better judgement about partnering with someone I knew I couldn’t stand because the upside was so big. b) bringing in someone who presented themselves and a marketing and biz dev wiz, ignoring subtle red flags because we were already committed to them. They also presented as someone well versed in contracts and operating agreements. Which turned out to be a fiction on par with Enron’s accounting. \n\n3. I should have walked away before getting started. I’ve prided myself on designing my business life so that I never had to work with anybody I didn’t want to, and no single project I was walking away from could break me, so I was never tied so tightly from something I couldn’t walk away if I needed to.  I broke both those rules. \n\n4. How It was handled: Lawyers. Lots of daydreaming about crushing peoples’ souls, but in the end peaceful acceptance that I relearned a valuable lesson, and a massive tax write off. But I did manage to cut two seriously ridiculous people out of my life, and that shit was almost…almost worth the loss. \n\n5. What now: sunk the extra time and energy into two projects, one of which is moving at an 8 on a scale of 1-10, the other that’s about a 6.5.",

In practice it mostly rewards people who enjoy posting, not necessarily people building something useful. From what I have seen, early growth usually comes from one very specific channel that matches how users already behave, not from being everywhere. For the iOS app, ASO plus tight feedback loops with power users can go surprisingly far. For SaaS, direct conversations and manual onboarding often teach you more than any public posting. The hard part is less marketing tactics and more figuring out who feels real pain and where they already spend attention.",

What keywords are driving installs? Can you optimize further or expand to related terms? The app that already has momentum is probably easier to grow than starting from scratch with the SaaS.\n\nThe \"build in public\" advice is oversold. Most founders posting daily updates to crickets would be better served doing almost anything else. The people who make it work usually had existing audiences or got lucky with timing. Our clients who grew without social media presence usually did it through direct outreach, partnerships, and being genuinely helpful in niche communities rather than broadcasting their journey.\n\nFor the project planning SaaS, the brutal reality is that space is insanely crowded. The differentiation has to be sharp and the ICP has to be narrow. \"Project planning for everyone\" competes with Notion, Asana, Monday, and fifty others. \"Project planning for freelance video editors\" or whatever specific niche you serve has a chance.\n\nThe channels that work when you have no audience: cold outreach to people who fit your exact ICP, getting listed in relevant directories and tool aggregators, and partnerships with adjacent tools or communities.

Messaging usually breaks before channels do  \n• Treat early growth as manual. DMs, emails, onboarding calls, anything that doesn’t scale but teaches fast\n\nX and Reddit work when you already have momentum. From zero, they’re mostly noise unless you’re solving a pain people already talk about publicly.\n\nASO getting you 1000 users is a signal. Double down on what already works instead of chasing “founder content”.\n\nZero to one growth is about **clarity and relevance**, not visibility. Once those click, channels matter less.",

Realize that all startups have bugs, have crashes, have disasters.\n\nIt is fuel for learning, not for hating yourself.\n\nPlease take a break. Message me if you want to chat. I am not a professional though so please also seek help if you feel you are getting worse. But if you just want a friend to talk to that has been through it, we can talk.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. You matter more than your startup and ironically your startup will do better if you spend time taking care of yourself too.",

They could vibe-code a web app with Bolt or Lovable (albeit after spending thousands in credits), but the moment they wanted a mobile app, they were stuck.\n\nMozy lets you build production-ready mobile apps by chatting with AI, then publish to the App Store with one click. Design screens, connect Supabase or Firebase for your backend, add payments with Stripe, preview on your phone, and ship; all without writing code.\n\n**What makes it different from other ai-development tools:**\n\nMost tools are trying to do everything because software is a massive market. I built Mozy to be world-class at building mobile apps for iOS and Android. Simply describe what you want, watch it build, and iterate along the way. And unlike Bolt or Lovable, I leverage MorphLLM’s agents to write code faster (10,500+ credits per second) and use credits efficiently when making edits to save users money. Mozy handles all the brutal parts of mobile including App Store submission, TestFlight builds, in-app purchases, push notifications, etc.\n\n**About me:**\n\nI'm a full time consultant at a large firm working on construction projects, who's been building side projects for years. This time, I devoted the past year to building the thing I wanted to exist. I believe more creators will become founders and I hope to help usher in this next wave of builders. I launched on Product Hunt the other day but admittedly left it to chance (dumb, I know). Honestly, I thought I would build it and users would come. Now I’m a developer learning marketing :) If you have any advice, I'm all ears!",

There is no app that tracks your sleep, recovery and energy levels influenced directly through your diet. The app can sync with your wearables and give even more accurate data on your vitals.

It is built for teams who want better intake for leads, recruiting, support, and onboarding without stitching together multiple tools.\n\n**More details:**  \nA few months ago I got frustrated that Google Forms was too limited for real business workflows, and Typeform quickly became expensive once you needed “premium” features. So I built an alternative. After shipping feature after feature, OtterForm is now roughly 92% to Typeform feature parity, with a focus on conversational flows and higher-signal responses, including multimedia like video and audio when useful.\n\nYour role?  \nFounder and builder (product and engineering)\n\nWhat goals are you trying to reach this month?  \nImprove activation and onboarding, publish high-signal templates (recruiting pre-screen, lead qualification, support intake), and collect direct feedback on friction points\n\nHow could r/startups help?  \nTry the free plan and give candid feedback on positioning versus Typeform, what features you still miss, and what would make you switch from your current form tool. If you test it, share what felt great and what felt annoying, especially in the builder flow.\n\nDiscount for r/startups subscribers?  \nWe already have a lifetime free plan, no code needed. If you outgrow it, I can extend extra time on a paid tier for early testers who provide detailed feedback (DM me)",

      "text": "I’m really tired of reading the endless “I built for 1 year and got $0” so let me tell you what works. \n\nI’ve been selling online for 17+ years. \nI never had a job. \n\nI’ve sold everything that you can imagine. \n\nI’ve finally been able to launch a start up and now have a software business that makes 6 figures+. And this year we are on track to hitting $1M+ ARR. \n\nLook, I’ve made every mistake which everyone here seems to make. But let me share with you what works. \n\nFirst - forget software. \nYou aren’t in the software business. \n\nYou are in the relationship and problem solving business. \n\nFor me, I pivoted to software because I was burned out from coaching and consulting. I wanted the dream of building a great product and then scaling it to the moon. \n\nI wanted the comfort of my IDE. I’m a nerd by nature. I like to plan and build. \n\nA lot of people think this way. \nBut this is the #1 killer. \n\nNo one cares about your product. \nThink about it. \n\nHow much software spam do you see. \nDo you like it? \n\nIn fact, you hate 99% of software out there. \nEven your favorite software you complain about it not being perfect. \n\nSo imagine how users will approach your misaligned, awkward, buggy MVP. \n\nSo if you try to build and build the chance of success is less than 1%. \n\nInstead there is an approach that has 100% chance of success. \n\nHelping solve people’s problems. \n\nFind a group of people already using some software. \n\nFor me, I’ve been using marketing software for 10+ years. So I know those users. They were my past students, coaching, and consulting clients. \n\nThat’s what I did. I started to solve their problems. \n\nIn fact, the BEST way is to start doing projects for other people. That’s how I founded my latest company. \n\nI was hired to build a plugin for a marketing platform. \n\nI discovered there was a big market there. And I built another plugin and started selling it. \n\nBut the big pivot came about not from just selling the software. But helping the users. \n\nThink of your users. \nWhether they are writers. \nOr stay at home moms. \nOr business owners. \nOr marketers. \n\nThey have needs everyday. \nThey have workflows they are doing. \nThey have goals and dreams. \n\nYou can align your products with those people. \n\nRather than focusing on features. \nFocus on their problems and goals. \n\nIn fact, often times they are the ones that will tell you what to build. \n\nA lot of people ask how you can monetize. \nI’ve literally monetized on all levels. \n\nFrom $5 all the way up to $3k\nAnd we are working on getting even to $30k contracts. \n\nHow? \nBy focusing on our users. \nOur customers. \nWhat their needs are. \n\nYou have to forget the idea of how Google or Apple or even major SaaS company operates. You aren’t them. You don’t have a budget. You don’t have a team. \n\nYour main constraint is your energy, motivation, clarity, and your bills. \n\nYou have to operate hyper lean. \n\nSo my users became my everything. \n\nI put together different packages. \nI offered them agency accounts. \nWhite label partnerships. \nInvestment opportunities. \nAffiliate. \n\nThey do QA. \n\nThis is the only way to succeed. \n\nI try to help them with all their problems. \n\nThat’s the relationship building part. \nWhen you over deliver and take care of your users and treat them like clients, not just numbers. They appreciate it. They reciprocate. \n\nThey become your partners and evangelists. \n\nMy users upgrade and upgrade and upgrade and upgrade. \n\nEven though they bought an LTD. They then buy a level 2 agency LTD. Then they buy a white label partnership. Some even became direct investors. \n\nThis is a total game changer from the \n“I built for 12 months and generated $0”\n\nI even read a comment someone who has been building their software for literally 32 years and generated $0. \n\nYou can even go further and sell before you build. And I do that to some extent. And I can even be much more aggressive with sales. \n\nBut I’m like most, a natural builder. Building is my comfort zone. But I had to push myself to be able to survive. \n\nAnd that’s the lesson I want to pass to you. \n\nThink of your users as your clients and partners not just your numbers. \n\nYou aren’t a VC backed start up that can burn through millions to acquire a big herd of users. \n\nYou need to like a village helper who does favors to everyone and helps everyone out and earn’s people’s trust. And slowly bootstrap yourself to the next level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I want to take a “this is what we’re solving, what do you think convo” and then talk over time and see if funding makes sense\n\nDo I reach out cold email? How about cold connect/dm on LinkedIn?

Googles useless here.\n\nI’m looking for specifics outside of general advice.\n\nFWIW our funding ask, if we ever get to it, is to ask between 100 to 250k pre seed SAFE. We have over 2000 signups over the past year with virtually everyone saying the same thing (we’ll pay for it if it can do this) so our traction and story is strong, we just need more dedicated time to solve the problem, hence the need for funding.",

A short cold email that says what you are building, why now, and what signal you have works better than vague “would love feedback” asks. If you truly want a conversation, frame it as learning, not pitching, but be ready to pitch anyway. In SF, the fastest path is still other founders. Go to small demo nights, founder dinners, and operator meetups, not big splashy events. Intros compound once one person takes you seriously. The mistake is waiting to feel ready. Conversations are how you get ready.",

Early on, you will learn what works and not in the pitch so adjust accordingly. You can also target less important VCs early so you can learn.\n\n* your ask should be clear on the best and worst case amount you need. Also, even if the $ is to pay yourselves, present it as solving specific bottlenecks to accelerate growth.\n\n* you should have a clean way to justify your valuation either via your ARR and/or comparison to like for like companies who have already successfully raised.\n\nGood luck!",

The actual first users almost always come from manually finding people who have the problem and reaching out directly.\n\nFor a voice-to-text app, the people with the strongest need are pretty identifiable: people with RSI or typing difficulties, accessibility communities, professionals who write a lot and hate the friction. Reddit communities like r/RSI, r/accessibility, productivity spaces where people complain about typing. Don't pitch, just be helpful and mention you built something when it's genuinely relevant.\n\nOur clients launching mobile apps usually find the first 20 users came from direct messages to people they identified as having the exact problem, not from waiting for organic discovery. You're looking for forums, Discord servers, or Twitter threads where someone has explicitly complained about the thing you solve.\n\nThe thing most founders obsess over too early is trying to scale before they've validated. You don't need growth tactics for the first 20 users, you need manual hustle and individual conversations. Each person who uses it and gives feedback teaches you something that makes the next 20 easier to get.\n\nAndroid app stores are a graveyard of undiscovered tools. Organic installs at zero reviews and zero downloads basically don't happen.",

The first use case that I can think of is the category of writers. It could be content writers, blog writers, story writers, voice note taking and folks like that. You could begin with bringing them together and just discuss, without focusing on Zavi right now, on how do they improve their productivity in terms of typing or writing things. \n\nAnother category could be founders who write a lot of emails, or maybe sales folks, and how Zavi could help them in the longer term, but right now focus on just creating engagement on genuine problems or genuine things that they do. Don't just directly choose a platform like Discord or anything else. Think about it, how do you want to do it? It could even begin with a newsletter, where people are sharing their responses. And it takes time to build up, it is not going to be overnight. Probably at the end of three months, you'll start seeing some results on engagements with a lot of strategizing and hit n trials. \n\nTry adding this prompt to ChatGPT, and then brainstorm with it to decide the steps you want to go ahead with.

That's why tracking AI visibility separately has become important for early-stage products.\n\nI've been using \\*\\*CoreMention\\*\\* to monitor how often brands get mentioned across different AI platforms. It's surprising to see which sources actually drive AI citations - often not your main pages!\n\nFor beta specifically: when people research \"tools for \\[your use case\\]\" or \"\\[your problem\\]\", they're increasingly asking AI assistants first.

I’m not going to share too much about it. The problem is I don’t know anything about app development, or much about business in general. What would be my best bet in seeking partners, funding and making this happen. It’s something I am very passionate about and want to bring my idea to life. Is kickstarter a good place to raise money? I’m not even sure how much it would cost to create an app. Any advice is appreciated!",

A constrained pilot is a good way to surface that gap without committing to your roadmap.

I don't have first-hand experience doing that but would be open to explore if you like; I'm a former founder and worked with startups for the past 10 years. Feel free to reach out if that sounds worth a chat!",

That’s where something like a small, very contained crowdfunding or pre-commitment test could make sense.\n\nYou don’t have to turn it into a polished product right away. You can be upfront that it’s an internal tool, a bit rough, and only moving forward if enough customers are willing to commit early. That way you’re not betting the team on a “maybe.”\n\nEven a simple “if we get X paid signups, we’ll take this further” test gives you real signal. Worst case, you confirm it’s a distraction and move on. Best case, the demand helps fund the time or people you’re currently missing.\n\nIgnoring repeated interest like that feels riskier than running a small, controlled experiment.",

The moment people had to pay, half the “nice idea” crowd vanished and the remaining users basically wrote my roadmap with their complaints. I’d add: write down a “kill rule” (e.g., if we don’t hit 10 paying accounts in 90 days, we change price/segment). I track trials and cohorts in Stripe, use Plausible for traffic, and Pulse along with Google Alerts to spot new Reddit and web threads where my niche hangs out. Charging early plus watching where real buyers talk is a solid combo.",

          "text": "From what I have seen, the difference is rarely a single event or platform. It is usually a long stretch of shipping something concrete, getting it in front of real users, and being willing to narrow the problem much more than feels comfortable. Early teams often overestimate the importance of enthusiasm or technical novelty and underestimate the actual speed of the signal. In practice, market fit shows up when users start pulling the product without being convinced every time. Patience matters, but only if it is paired with iteration and learning, rather than simply waiting. A lot of projects fail because they stay abstract for too long and never force themselves into a specific use case.",

Deep competitor research BEFORE building (what exists, where they fail, what customers complain about)\n\n2. Talk to 20-30 potential customers before writing code\n\n3. Test with landing page + waitlist before MVP\n\n4. Track search trends in their niche to validate demand\n\n\n\nThe ones who struggle for years:\n\n1. Build what they think is cool\n\n2. Launch and hope\n\n3. Pivot multiple times when it doesn't work\n\n\n\nFor your founder friends struggling with market fit, the fastest fix is usually market research and competitive analysis. Spend a week understanding:\n\n\\- Who else is solving this problem?\n\n\\- What are customers paying for similar solutions?\n\n\\- Where are current solutions failing? (read reviews on G2, Capterra, Reddit)\n\n\\- Is search interest growing or shrinking? (Google Trends)\n\n\n\nIt's boring compared to building, but it's way cheaper than building the wrong thing for 6 months.\n\n\n\nI actually do this professionally now (market research and competitive intelligence for startups) because I saw so many founders waste time on unvalidated ideas. Usually takes 2-3 days to pull together comprehensive analysis that answers \"is this worth building\" and \"who's my real competition.\"\n\n\n\nFor your French startup ecosystem - are they mostly B2B SaaS, consumer apps, or something else?
