      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some honest perspective here.\n\nI recently joined a company of 200+ employees as a VP (strategy-focused role). The people are great, the values are strong, culture is good, and overall it feels like there’s a ton of potential.\n\nBut I’ve been kind of shocked by how the executive team actually operates day to day.\n\nMost of the leadership time seems to go into very operational stuff. Weekly meetings are basically project-by-project check-ins, super granular. Monthly meetings are mostly just reporting on last month’s results. Like…this meeting could have been an email kind of vibe. And in the last three months, I honestly haven’t seen a real strategic conversation… like working on the business instead of just in it.\n\nWhat also throws me off is how unprepared a lot of these meetings feel. No agenda, no pre-read, no notes, no follow-up. People show up and kind of wing it. It’s not toxic or anything, the vibe is friendly, but it feels… soft? Like this company could seriously level up if the exec layer was more structured and intentional.\n\nMy issue is: I’m new, and this isn’t technically “my job” to fix right now. I really don’t want to be the guy who walks in and starts criticizing everything or trying to change the culture overnight.\n\nBut at the same time, it feels like such a missed opportunity.\n\nSo I’m torn. Do I bring it up privately with the CEO? Do I just focus on modeling better structure in my own area first? Do I suggest an external consultant to come in and help with exec operating rhythm? Or do I accept that changing leadership culture is a massive uphill battle and not worth spending political capital on this early?\n\nCurious if anyone’s been in a similar situation. Would love any advice on how to approach this without coming off negative or naïve.\n\nThanks ❤️",

The people that successfully found a company are rarely the same one who grow it into a stable, thriving enterprise because doing so requires vastly different skills. \n\nWhen you’re small and fighting to survive, you can’t afford to be strategic and process heavy, and every detail matters, so you have things like project-by-project check-ins. As the company grows, it needs more structure, more strategy, and less focus on tactics… but the people who got it to this point are tacticians! You may be the first hire of the second wave. \n\nI suggest modeling the new behavior in your department and see if any of your peers gets the hint that the business is changing. Tbh, _true_ change has to come from the top to be effective. Hopefully, your CEO will notice that your team is performing much better than everyone else and s/he will begin to emulate it and push it down to everyone else (or more likely, replace them with other second-wavers)",

Framing it to the CEO might be \"I have an idea that I think will help our leadership meetings...\" and draw up an agenda. Maybe don't ask for homework ahead of the first one, but do it yourself.

          "text": "Are they the original founders? If yes, then that'd be a classic situation.\n\nFounders are starting out small, then company is growing. Many studies show that latest when you reach 18 - 20 people you need to start introducing processes and structures. These are boring, slow you down, but they are necessary, cause the number of communication paths among people grows exponentially, and roughly at that size there are too many people to still be able to communicate ad hoc. So, processes and practices keep being sloppy even with 200 people.\n\nThe second problem is that founders want to stay cool founders, rather than become ordinary managers of a mid-sized company. It's a self-image thing. Also a control thing. So, they become the bottleneck. Founders, to be successful after a certain size, need to go through a stage of maturing from creative visionaries to people leading a running organisation. Running implies that things also run without them for some time. That requires trust, among other things. Some founders know their own limitations and intentionally move on once they have founded a company of a certain size and then start the next thing exactly cause of that. Some succeed in outgrowing their own behavior, but without any help from outside that's actually not all that easy.\n\nThere are quite a few books and podcasts, often from the background of organisational development, dealing with these types of phenomena. The question is whether the executive team has any intention to become managers or not. If no, well, there's nothing you can do, things will stay chaotic. (Which may be charming too, to some extent. Or become toxic, to another extent.)\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you want to cope with that or not.",

I brought in someone with startup experience doing exactly this type of thing.\n\nWhen he first started I kinda hated him. He was picking apart things we had done and changing things. Probably too quickly. I avoided our meetings sometimes and felt personally attacked a lot. But deep down, I knew we needed to go through this. I had the typical, “I’ve been busting my ass for six years scraping by on scraps to build this thing and now you are calling my baby ugly” feelings. But the baby WAS a little ugly.\n\nSo, we powered through and now I could not imagine not having this guy. He has made us so much better. We have a process, clients know what to expect, releases are clear and documented, client requests are tracked and they have realistic timelines that meet their goals, and most importantly I get to do what I am good at without having to force myself to be a process person.\n\nSo, my advice is do your job and bide some time. Make your department efficient and get to know the leadership team. Then after a while start the conversations. They want to do well, they want to be better, but they have also battled through a lot to get here and you need to respect that. When you do start the conversations you need to not shit on the past, the best opening is “you guys did an amazing thing getting this startup off the ground, but we aren’t really a startup anymore and we have to make the transition to a sustainable company.”\n\nBuild the rapport before you start throwing bombs, but it sounds like the bombs need to happen at some point.",

          "text": "I’ve been in your shoes. What you’re describing is a common growth plateau for companies of 200+ people, the leadership habits that worked at 50 employees are now causing a 'strategic vacuum.'\n\nSince you are new, you have the advantage of fresh eyes.  Here are three tactics I’ve used to shift the needle without burning political capital:\n\nOpen each meeting with strategic thinking or a strategic window (The 15-Minute Rule): In your next 1-on-1 with the CEO, suggest that the team is so efficient at operations that you'd love to dedicate the first 15–20 minutes of every meeting to 'Horizon 2 and 3' thinking. Think of it as checking the flight path before discussing the meal service. This ensures the team looks at the 'why' before the 'what,' preventing you from getting lost in the granular 'blades of grass.'\n\nIntroduce 'ELMO' to Protect Time: High-performing teams often adopt the ELMO rule (Enough, Let’s Move On). It’s a low-friction, playful way for any leader to flag when the conversation has veered into 'beating the dead horse' territory or unnecessary detail. It creates a self-policing culture that values everyone's time and keeps the focus on high-leverage topics.\n\nHave an offsite retreat with a facilitator. Since you mentioned a lack of structure (no agendas or pre-reads), suggesting an external facilitator for a leadership retreat is a 'safe' way to introduce rigor. A third party can objectively point out the lack of KPIs or clear vision without you looking like the 'new guy' who's being overly critical. This allows the team to design a new 'Operating Rhythm' collectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Don’t wait too long. Start modeling the behavior in your own team but if the executive team is misaligned, your department will eventually hit a ceiling. Frame these changes as a way to unlock the potential you already see in the team.\n\nAlternately, you could suggest a code of conduct that everyone buys into, but you might be too new to make this proposal since everyone seems to get along.",

          "text": "Oye, there is so much bad advice in the comments here from people who have clearly never worked at a 200-ish size company.\n\nThis is actually really simple. OP - you clearly come from a very corporate world. The thing you need to understand is that a 200 person company is TINY. It's honestly, operationally, not a whole lot different than a 20 person company.\n\nThey are reaching an inflection point where the size of the company will start to require the introduction of more process. But you need to understand that companies this size are process adverse. Trying to bring in process that 10000+ person companies have to a 200+ person company is heavy handed and will be perceived as \"work in order to do the work\". Introducing process is _hard_ as you're in a company with the mindset of a 20 person company still. Process has been a dirty word for so long when they're so used to just doing what needs to be done because for the longest time they had to operate in a very reactive manner. They had to be flexible, they had to be nimble, they had to be able to completely pivot a feature area or shelve it and do something totally different on a dime.\n\nThis isn't Amazon. This is still a company that could, in the span of 3 months, totally implode. In the years to get here, living day by day has been the founders' lives and they are hesitant to introduce anything that will slow them down or mire things in red tape.\n\nHowever, as you grow, your lack of process eventually starts to be the thing that actually slows you down.\n\nSo - when trying to introduce process, it has to demonstrate a clear solve for a real problem. Also move slowly, iteratively. Trying to burden a small company with the process overhead of a much larger company is too much too fast and does not solve for problems they are necessarily experiencing.\n\nAll the people telling you to stay in your lane have clearly never worked at a startup. This company is still very small and people who step in to do things that need to be done even if it isn't in their \"lane\" is valued.\n\nSo, maybe, after your first, say 3 months there, in the next leadership meeting - maybe raise the thought that \"We talk about a lot of things in these meetings and there is action that is kind of agreed to, but to be honest, \"none of us\" (include yourself, you're a part of the team) seem to really follow up on those things because we all kinda just forget about them after the meeting. Maybe we should just document the simple bullet points of action that we talked about in each meeting, send out a post meeting email with those points, then we can bring up the points from the last meeting and talk about those first in the next meeting. It'd be a simple way to hold ourselves accountable and maybe decide that things have changed and the action is no longer necessary or a different action is more important. What do you all think?\"\n\nBoom - thinking about a problem, toe dip into a SIMPLE, low overhead way to maybe try to get a handle on it, non-accusatory as you include yourself, and it's presented as the kind of idea that is easy to get people around as it's minimal effort, and solves for a problem of a lot of loose ends that keep getting dropped.\n\nGrow into process. Solve actual problems. Process that is introduced as \"this is how it's done\" is an attack on the company culture and reads as you being out of touch.",

          "text": "30 plus years in corporate environments, 5 of which were with 3 different start ups before retirement.\n\nAll advice at high level are good guidelines, but there are 2 big questions you MUST answer for yourself first: \n\n1) \"Do I want this headache?\"\n\n     Whether it's fighting to help introduce the structure and change needed to push the company forward or realizing that the company is not going to move fast enough to make it a satisfactory job for you and your life. Too often I've seen people flame and rage out because they realized far too late that the work environment and culture were not compatible with their sanity. Knowing EXACTLY what you yourself are about to do and take on makes a world of difference in the attitude you exude to those around you. \n\nEveryone likes good vibes, especially in start ups, and if you are the vibe king, they will want to do what you do to be peaceful. \n\nConversely, if it's going to be a negative experience, be direct with the CEO/Founder with what your expectations are, why you need to have the ball rolling in the new direction, and most importantly, your employment ultimatum of you leaving for a better fit for yourself. Remember what your job title is and what you were hired for. All companies hate wasting money and to lose both talent and salary because the business isn't right will leave an impression. 2 of the start ups I walked away from failed fairly shortly after I left, not because of me but because they could not handle the changes needed so they drove themselves into extinction. The third is still doing well, but almost failed due to slow implementation.\n\n2) \"Are the standards and protocols you are used to having in place achievable in the next 90 days? \"\n\n     This timeframe is important as it allows all employees, top to bottom, the time to work on repeated consistency utilizing and performing the new workflows and standards. The most difficult part of moving a mountain are the first few inches of movement. Once momentum builds the focus will shift away from the change and will start to focus on optimization and further areas of improvement.\n\nBE PREPARED FOR SOME ATTRITION!! Like others have said, there may be unknown politics and power dynamics at play. Presuming you said yes to question one, part of the conversation with the CEO/Founder is that some of the people that got the company to where it is are fine staying just where they are and may not want to grow much bigger,  faster or want more responsibility yet talk about the company as if they are the sole owner. These \"Heartstring Holdover Hires\" will cause issues for all involved later on down the line if they are not dealt with properly early on. \n\nIf you answer yes to both questions, charge ahead and the best of luck to ya! \n\nIf you answered at least one question no, I'm sorry that you are in that situation. Remember, FAIL stands for \"First Attempt In Learning\"! and when you move on to your next opportunity, you are better versed on how to handle similar situations.",

I don’t fully blame them, when there’s no visible progress, it’s hard for anyone to.\n\nNow I’m financially broke, mentally exhausted, and honestly demotivated. The stress has started affecting my marriage too, which hurts the most.\n\nI keep asking myself:\n- What am I doing wrong?\n- Am I approaching things the wrong way?\n- Is this just how it works before things click, or am I ignoring some obvious mistake?\n- How do you know when to persist vs when to pivot?\n\nI’m not posting this to promote anything or ask for sympathy.\n\nI genuinely want real feedback from people who’ve been through layoffs, failed startups, long job searches, or rebuilding phases.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar place:\n- What helped you get unstuck?\n- What would you do differently if you were in my position?\n- Any hard truths I might need to hear?\n\nThanks for reading.

The reality is that most times it takes numerous failures for you to become successful. You are welcome to read other subreddits talking about the pain of entrepreneurship: most have failed for almost a decade (broke, bankrupt, 2nd mortgage, etc.) before they started breaking 10M in revenue. So if this is the path you want to take then maybe you should start thinking in the order of decades.\n\nIn terms of what you should do, that is entirely up to you. You can start applying again (aim for 1000+ jobs, my 2nd software gig took 1300!). I would suggest trying to target large industries (1B+) and failing within those because a success will mean a decent sized payout. Target military, health care, etc. As builders, we are more concerned with the product, but company success is not technological: it is strategic, and that takes analyzing the problem for long periods of time.\n\nMy personal strategy is making all the cool shit I want to, state of the art, in public. This a) does not tarnish my skills b) makes getting a job later easier (because I know the SOTA) c) impresses those within industries (non-tech people), because they can see what I CAN make. The only difference between riches and making no money as an engineer is simply making the right thing. By signalling you can make anything, someone in industry will ask you to make something, and that rabbit hole will eventually lead you somewhere.\n\nMy 2 cents",

Any one of those can feel like shouting into the void for months, and doing all three at once tends to create the worst kind of fatigue because you never get enough signal back from any one lane to feel momentum.\n\nI do not think the problem is effort. The problem is focus, sequencing, and the fact that your nervous system is now the limiting factor.\n\nIf I were in your position, I would do two things in parallel, and I would be ruthless about the scope.\n\nFirst, stabilize money. Not because you are giving up on the startup, but because you cannot make good product decisions when you are panicking about rent and your marriage is taking collateral damage. That can mean a smaller target job, contract work, freelance, whatever gets you predictable cash fastest. The goal is a runway, not a perfect role.\n\nSecond, shrink the startup into a two week reality loop instead of a vague “build and post.” Pick one specific customer type, one painful problem, one simple offer, and do ten conversations. Not “would you use this,” but “how are you solving this today, what does it cost you, what have you tried, would you pay for a better outcome.” If you cannot get conversations, that is the signal, and it tells you your distribution plan is missing, not that you are broken.\n\nContent creation should be optional, not a third full time job. If it is not producing leads or recruiters, park it. You can always restart later when you have something concrete to talk about.\n\nOn persist vs pivot, I use a simple test: persist when the problem is real and you are learning from clear experiments, pivot when you are repeating the same actions and getting the same silence. Right now it sounds like a lot of activity without a tight feedback loop, which is why it feels hopeless.\n\nThe hard truth is that “almost zero response” is not a verdict on you. It is a verdict on the current approach. You need fewer bets, tighter experiments, and enough stability to think clearly.",

You have to secure your own well being and security first before you undertake any project and entrepreneurship. \n\nOnce you have bread on the table you can experiment more. \n\nHowever out of strong need can come abilities too... is this the case? I don't know. \n\nGet your life in order with stability, then try to work something out. You can try working in partnership with someone too, that can often bring much better results.\n\nTo answer, yes things can take some time and quick success is very rare. Usually though. Getting no traction or users sounds like either lack of proper marketing or your product isn't that good/useful/needed.\n\nTo properly diagnose the issue you need to do lots of A/B testing. If you don't know what you're doing, find someone that knows more. \n\nFor example. I had something many people wanted but our informational resources werent great at first and our product also a bit unreliable (so some failures). People were never getting to point C and kept getting stuck at point A. Or would get to point C but never come back because things failed or something somewhere made them stop. It's been a long process perfecting that pathway but theres lots of factors. The key though is knowing what you're selling is *needed* and working around that. \n\nSo,  as you go, you figure out what's going on by testing. Can be as simple as: \n\n\"People want to see services, faq and pricing together rather than spread across pages\" or \"don't require login to use\" or \"too many things overwhelm the user and makes them take no action and leave\" or \"the offer is confusing/unclear/not good\" or \"too much noise against the CTA\". Lots of things.\n\nDo you know how much reach you have at the moment approximately? If you estimate at least 1,000-10,000 impressions per piece of content and you're getting 0 results  then it must be your offer most likely so yes, time to iterate something. Choose whatever is working best and iterate from that. If it's nothing, then pick your best bet. Iterating what works is what gets you places. You see blue ribbons sell more? Make them more, and 2 variations perhaps. You see someone liked when you said \"my blue ribbons make your room sparkle\"? Keep that same exact phrase and use it later. Keep it very simple. \n\nIf youre hardly getting visitors then find out how to get them. Some of these require you get a bit out of comfort zone if not used to talking to lots of people. If you're getting visitors and visitors and never a single interest for your base product then time to pivot. Rare though useful. \n\nWhen to pivot? Example. You sell shoe laces, meant for use in tying shoes. You fail a thousand ways until you realize people are using them more for boots. Now you pivot to boot laces instead of shoe laces. \n\nWhen to iterate? You sell shoe laces. You see people keep buying the orange laces. You iterate a new version of Orange laces, except this time three length variations and one with another texture. You see what sells. You iterate. \n\nIf you're getting any kind of minimal results, you can do this. As minimal as they are.Then, improve your marketing (get the message to more people), and improve your branding and intake sites for trust, readibility, accessibility and aesthetic for branding. \n\nFirst though, get some bread on the table friend. And second, get a good partner if you can that will help you get things running where you can't. Take things with calm, do as you can but move swiftly and diligently on what you do. Think of everything as logically as you can.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about why some people build multiple successful startups while most others never get one off the ground, and the more I strip away the mythology, the more it looks like a simple equation rather than some mysterious talent.\n\nIf you look closely, the market already gives you most of the variables. Products already exist. Customers already pay for solutions. Pricing models are already validated. Revenue structures are proven. In other words, demand has already been solved. Yet people still act like they need to invent everything from scratch, when in reality that’s usually where momentum dies.\n\nOnce I understood this, my whole approach changed. I stopped treating startups as artistic projects and started treating them like repeatable experiments. If competitors are making money, the correct move isn’t to innovate wildly, it’s to align. Same pricing logic. Same revenue model. Same customer profile. If the market is already paying X for a solution and won’t pay X for yours, the issue isn’t price discovery. It’s sales, positioning, or distribution.\n\nThat’s where most founders lie to themselves. They say the product isn’t ready, or the timing isn’t right, or they need one more feature. But if you already know the market exists, then the only real question is whether you can communicate value well enough to convert attention into money. If you can’t sell after enough real attempts, the math is telling you something, and it’s not subtle.\n\nSo I started optimizing for throughput instead of perfection. Build the smallest thing that can be sold. Ship it fast. Try to sell it aggressively. If it doesn’t move after a meaningful number of attempts, kill it without drama and move on. No emotional attachment. Just data. Repetition compounds. Each cycle sharpens your understanding of what actually works.\n\nSales became the core function, not an afterthought. Not polishing features, not tweaking designs, but improving language. Pitch clarity. Objection handling. Distribution. After enough reps, outcomes become predictable. Either the market pulls, or it doesn’t. Both are valuable answers.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that once even a small amount of traction exists, everything downstream simplifies. Pricing debates disappear. Confidence increases. Even investors behave differently, because you’re no longer presenting a hypothesis, you’re showing evidence. At that point, fundraising isn’t about convincing anyone. It’s about scaling something that’s already mathematically working.\n\nThe final variable I underestimated was accountability. I noticed I always performed better when other people were watching, when reputation was on the line. So instead of relying on motivation, I engineered pressure. Public goals. Daily execution. External expectations. Systems that make it uncomfortable to stall.\n\nThe conclusion I keep coming back to is this: success in startups isn’t about being smarter or more original. It’s about running the equation enough times without lying to yourself. Fast execution. Real sales attempts. Honest feedback. Kill what doesn’t work. Double down on what does. Statistically, if you do this long enough, something breaks through.\n\nMost people fail not because they lack ideas, but because they don’t run the equation enough times to let probability do its job.\n\nCurious how many people here see startups the same way—or are still stuck optimizing variables the market already solved.",

Pricing, features, even positioning can be replicated, but the harder part to copy is the pressure that forced the original business to converge. Real selling, real rejection, and the discomfort of finding out fast that the market doesn’t care.\n\nI’ve seen people “run the equation” many times, but quietly protect themselves from disconfirming feedback. They sell, but only in friendly environments. They ship, but only to audiences that won’t say no clearly. From the outside it looks like iteration, but underneath it’s still avoidance.\n\nYour point about accountability is underrated. Once reputation, time, or money is visibly on the line, the signal becomes much cleaner and decisions get easier. At that point, the market stops being abstract and starts answering very directly.\n\nCurious if there was a specific moment where the feedback became impossible to ignore and forced you to either double down or kill something without debate.",

In those cases, you do not need wild innovation, but you do need a wedge that makes adoption easier, cheaper, faster, or safer.\n\nI also think “sell aggressively and kill fast” only works if you are clear what you are testing. A lot of founders think they tested the product when they really tested the wrong audience, the wrong promise, or a channel that was never going to work for them. The honest loop is: pick one ICP, one use case, one offer, one channel, run enough reps to get signal, then decide. Otherwise “kill it” can become another way to avoid learning.\n\nThe core equation I agree with is simpler: stop guessing, run tight experiments, and force decisions based on evidence. The best founders are not romantic. They are disciplined about what they are trying to learn next and they keep the loop short enough that self deception cannot survive.",

I'm not sure if it's worth trying to continue solo, pivot to something else, or just walk away entirely.\n\nFor those who've been through something similar - what did you do?

The game has changed for non-technical founders holding a codebase they do not fully understand.\n\n  \nWhat I would do with that USB stick:\n\n  \n1. Immediately put it in a git repo. Even if messy, you need version control before making any changes.\n\n  \n2. Use an AI coding agent to walk through the codebase with you. Ask it questions like: what does this app do, what are the main components, how do I run it locally, what is the deployment setup. You can have a conversation about your own code without needing to read every file.\n\n  \n3. Get it running locally before thinking about continuing or pivoting. Understanding the current state is step one.\n\n  \nThe fact that you have revenue and users means you already proved there is something there. 300 users and 4k in revenue is not nothing. Most products die before they ever get a paying customer.\n\n  \nOn the relationship side: sometimes the best thing that happens is removing friction from a partnership that was not working. You learned what you do not want in a cofounder next time.\n\n  \nIf you decide to continue, consider finding a technical advisor or fractional CTO before jumping into a new full cofounder relationship.

Mostly cold outreach and personal contacts to onboard creators. Demand side was mostly fans who found us through those creators. No real organic flywheel yet.\n\n**Paying users month over month?** Lumpy, not a clean curve. Dependent on which creators were active, not consistent marketplace growth.\n\n**Free to paid migration?** No tiers to test this - we were commission-based (% of each transaction). I wanted to test subscriptions but we split before I could implement it.\n\n**What was I doing?** GTM strategy, scraping leads, building outreach systems, pitching growth ideas. Some got implemented, a lot got shot down by my co-founder as \"not end-to-end\" before we could test them. That friction slowed things down.\n\n**Honest assessment:** You're right that these aren't strong viability signals. Revenue existed but concentrated, growth was manual, pricing model was undertested. Partial validation at best. Probably needed a sharper willingness-to-pay test or earlier pivot.",

If your co-founder and the dev shop before him used well-known tools and followed standard practices it may be possible for someone to continue development even without a proper handover, if it's something obscure with unusual or questionable code structure it can be more difficult.  \nAs a first step, you can give it to an AI of your choice for a quick assessment.

We keep adding features and refactoring, but there's no traction. My co-founder handles sales/fundraising but hasn't closed any deals.\n\nMy dilemma: I've poured everything into this, but with no users, I'm questioning if we're headed anywhere.\n\nShould I ask for a salary increase, have a hard conversation about viability, or just cut my losses?\n\nAny honest advice would be appreciated. I want to be fair to my co-founder and our vision, but I also need to think about my own future",

So many things can be wrong, but firstly I don't think you're getting a fair split, secondly 17 months with zero users is a terrible sign. Not sure if they're PE backed, or if it's bootstrapped but that's a pretty poor sign in the co-founders that either they don't recognize the problem isn't worth solving, or they never put this in front of people. I would seriously consider parting ways, or making something yourself. If they wanna keep investing in the pipe dream here, maybe negotiate higher equity or way better pay, and let them pretend until they run out of money.

That’s no small feat!\n\nFrom what you’re describing, it seems like you might be experiencing the classic challenges of scaling a startup. One thing I’ve seen work well in similar situations is focusing on getting user feedback early and often, even after the MVP launch. It can help you identify what features are truly essential and what users are craving. Sometimes, gathering feedback through surveys or direct interviews can reveal insights that you might not have considered.\n\nAlso, consider setting up a clear roadmap for your product development. Prioritize features based on user needs and potential impact. It might help to involve your junior developers in this process - it could lighten your load and empower them to take ownership of smaller projects.\n\nI’ve been in a similar boat and ended up building something to help founders like us streamline the whole MVP process.

You’re carrying founder risk and doing all the execution, so either the salary increases meaningfully or you reduce scope/hours and treat it like a side bet until traction exists.\n\n\n\nCutting your losses is reasonable if your cofounder won’t do the uncomfortable work (talk to customers, narrow the market, kill features) or can’t show real pipeline.

      "text": "I’m looking for some outside perspective because I’m not sure if this is normal startup behavior or if I’m right to push back.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I joined a startup very early (6 months before we even knew what the company was going to be). Before that I had been freelancing for roughly 10 years. I dropped almost all my freelance clients to focus on building this company.\n\nThe agreement back then:\n\n\\-minimum 4 days a week\n\n\\-reduced day rate compared to my normal freelance rate\n\n\\-1.6% equity, 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff\n\n\\-part of the core team\n\nThat setup made sense to me because it combined stability with long-term upside.\n\nRecently the company raised funding. Not long after that, I was told they want to change the setup.\n\nWhat they’re proposing now:\n\n\\-hire a senior developer\n\n\\-change my role and move me to project-based freelance\n\n\\-stop future vesting\n\n\\-reassign my remaining unvested 0.8% equity to the new hire\n\n\\-I keep the 0.8% that already vested\n\nThe reasoning is that as the company grows and responsibilities shift, equity should be aligned with the roles that carry the next phase of responsibility. The idea is that equity distribution needs to evolve with the business.\n\nMy issue is that this was never stated in the original agreement. There’s nothing in the contracts or emails saying equity is tied to holding a specific role or that it could be reduced if the company later hires someone more senior.\n\nI didn’t initiate the role change. I’m still contributing value and I’m open to continuing. But the proposal effectively moves me from a stable, equity-based position back to freelance, with no guarantees, while giving up half of the future equity that was part of why I committed in the first place. \n\nThey are still very happy with me and I basically self learned all the new emerging tech and build it for the company in the past 2 years. That they still use daily for all their core productions and this tech also reeled in a very good amount of big enterprise clients often commenting about the good quality of the output. but it was all self learned not perfect workflows but it got us there. Now they’ve got the cash to hire someone that has way more experience in this and bring my tech to the next level. \n\nThey’ve suggested a “clean” outcome where I keep what’s vested, maybe get a few extra months of vesting, and then continue on a project basis. I understand the business logic behind wanting flexibility and senior expertise, but from my side this feels like a big shift compared to what I signed up for. \n\nWould appreciate honest opinions.\n\nThanks.",

Spent like 6 months trying different approaches because this \"second card syndrome\" was killing our economics.\nFirst we tried the obvious stuff: push notifications reminding people to update merchants, in app prompts after card activation, even gamification with reward points for each merchant they switched. Conversion was maybe 12%. Too much friction.\nWhat actually worked was integrating a card switching API. We tested a couple. There's some legacy players in the card on file space, but they're clunky and expensive. Ended up going with Knot because their API was clean, merchant coverage was solid (hit like 80% of our users' top merchants), and the security model made sense. Everything's encrypted, PCI compliant, we never touch raw card data.\nRolled it out as an optional onboarding step. \"Update your card everywhere in 30 seconds\" kind of pitch. Adoption was around 65% and we saw spend per card jump almost 3x within the first quarter for users who completed the switch. Turns out when your card is actually saved everywhere, people use it.\nThe integration took maybe 3 or 4 weeks with their SDK. Biggest pain point was honestly just the webhook handling and convincing my team this would work well. But compared to the alternatives it was a no brainer.\nHappy to share more details if you want to DM. This problem is solvable, just need the right tooling.",

          "text": "You might be over-indexing on “better product” when what you’re really up against is inertia plus category-level trust. Chase/Amex aren’t winning because their apps are prettier, they’re winning because they’re the card people already have on file everywhere, they have perceived reliability for big/important purchases, and they’ve trained users that “something will go wrong eventually, and I want the issuer with the most leverage when it does.” Competitive rewards and fast support are table stakes, but they don’t create a forcing function to change defaults.\n\n\n\nIf you want wallet share, you need a reason to rewire habits, not just a nicer place to spend. A few pragmatic levers: (1) Pick one or two specific “daily driver” categories and be meaningfully better there (not 1 percent, more like “I’m leaving money on the table if I don’t use this”), then message that relentlessly. (2) Make switching feel like a one-time project with a clear payoff: an in-app “move my bills” checklist, pre-filled instructions, reminders, and a time-boxed accelerator (for example, “set us as default for 5 merchants and spend $X in 30 days to unlock Y”). (3) Reduce the fear of missing a payment: alerts for declined recurring charges, a grace period where you reimburse late fees caused by switching, and proactive “your Netflix charge is coming up, want to update?” nudges. People don’t avoid updating cards because it’s hard, they avoid it because it’s annoying and high-stakes.\n\n\n\nAlso worth asking whether “becoming the daily driver everywhere” is the right hill to die on. Some successful fintechs win by owning a narrow, frequent use case (one category, one behavior) and expanding from there, instead of trying to displace the incumbent’s entire spend graph at once. If you can identify the moment users feel your card is uniquely necessary (travel, subscriptions, groceries, budgeting, credit building, whatever your wedge is), you can build default behavior around that and let the rest follow.",

I’m currently at $170k with 1% equity.\n\nThe company is in a bit of a tight spot. We have $500k ARR but are cash-flow negative with 6-8 months of runway left. We’re currently trying to raise a Seed round (pre-seed is done), but some VCs are being picky about our numbers so not the best look but just started. Also recently another engineer quit, and I’ve taken on a massive chunk of their workload. Between the extra stress and the market rate, I started feeling undervalued and took a few interviews.\n\nI just received a verbal offer for $200k. I value peace and comfort, and I genuinely believe in my current company. I don’t want to leave, but I also don't want to leave $30k on the table; especially when I’m doing the work of two people and the company’s future is uncertain.\n\n1. How do I approach the founder? Since we haven’t closed the Seed round yet, a $30k salary bump may be a big ask for our runway.\n2. Is a lump sum better? I’m considering asking for a $20k retention bonus instead of a permanent salary hike to help the company's burn rate. And later ask for an increase.\n3. Equity vs. Cash: Should I use the offer to negotiate for more than my 1%? I feel though its not smart given the rockiness.\n4. What’s the \"fair\" play? I don't want to hold them over a barrel while they’re raising, but I also need to look out for myself if we don't clear the next 8 months.\n\nAny advice from people who have negotiated during a fundraise or stuck it out through a rocky Seed round?\n\n  \n",

In neither scenario are you starving, maybe there’s something more or less compared to market for your role but I dunno. Doesn’t matter. \n\nHere’s the facts. Theres no comfy startup like that. While you’re working and focussing, the founders are sweating every night as the bank account dives toward zero and they don’t have the next financing lined up. It’s not comfy. That company must raise a round definitely within 6 months, which means they need a term sheet in 3 months. And honestly, nobody likes to fund companies about to cash out. They get picked apart on terms. But whatever, you do what you gotta do to live. Long story short - it’s risky and there’s just no guarantee at all that it doesn’t go down. \n\nHowever. If you leave, that could compound the issues and make the company even worse. It’s really a question of whether the risk is that risky to you? How secure are in your industry. Are you confident that you could find a new job if/when this one ends? Can you finance a job search for a month or 3 months? Is that a big deal to you or just a small inconvenience. Do you like the company and vision and would you derive satisfaction from seeing it succeed and being a part of that?\n\nIt’s a matter of taste. You can take the stable 200k, or give 170k a run for a few more months and really give it your best and see if it works out. \n\nWhat you can’t do at this stage is- you can’t ask for a raise. It will only make things worse, that 30k is not going to make your job easier, and it will make it tougher for the company. You can try to ask for more equity but with 1% already and going out to market, it will weaken the funding narrative giving out grants like that. \n\nIt’s just a question for you. Do you wanna give it a shot and try to get to a win understanding that it’s risky. Or do you wanna take that stable job.",

If you believe in the product and the founder, sticking around could be worth it, especially if you think they can turn things around in the next few months. However, the financial stability of the company is a huge factor. If the other offer is solid and provides more security, it might be worth considering, especially if you have responsibilities or financial goals to meet. In situations like this, it’s often about weighing your passion against financial security. I've seen founders navigate similar choices, and sometimes keeping an eye on the potential for growth in your current role can pay off big time if the company succeeds. I’ve worked on projects that help startups get through tough times, so I get the struggle. Whatever you choose, make sure it aligns with your personal goals too!",

          "text": "Congrats on getting your first pitch through! For first timers, it's a huge step and sitting on the other side of the table, I'll give you a few things we like to see from companies that pitch to us to get funding that should help you feel a bit better and raise your chances of success.\n\nWhen you pitch your project, explain it in one sentence and then build on it. For example, if your project is about dropshipping, it might sound like this: \"My dropshipping business finds products faster and cheaper by searching multiple suppliers.\" A super rudimentary pitch, though hopefully it gives you a better idea of how it should sound in a one-sentence method. This should also be a bit of a guideline for you on how to tackle each section of your extended pitch. If you're talking about competition and showing slides, the one sentence version could be: \"Our competitors are X, Y, Z, and we stand out by having a previously successful team, improved infrastructure, and higher quality products in our company.\" Again, one sentence, then expand on those points. Using the one-sentence method also forces you to slow down and be clear and concise.\n\nSomething we tell companies is that once you do your pitch, stop pitching. It can be annoying when a company finishes its pitch and keeps going. In other words, they can't stop selling their product. If you've pitched and then have to add more information afterward, it means you didn't pitch well enough to start. Here's how we hear it:\n\nClient: We have a coffee mug company with a unique handle that changes how liquids are kept warm.\n\nUs: Sounds great, we'll be in touch after we look at your deck\n\nClient: Oh, and it also has a new feature, X, that we're working on to gain more market share.\n\nUs: Sure, we'll message you when we've looked into the project a bit further.\n\nClient: Yes, and I wanted to tell you about the cup's innovative material that we're developing...  \n  \nYou can see how being on the other side of the table can get annoying, and eventually the funding source might tune you out. As great as your project is, you need to show how awesome you would be to work with. Not being annoying, being organized, clear and timely communication can sometimes be more important than the pitch itself. Think of how many other dropshipping companies are out there, but if you're the one they want to keep talking to and don't feel like it's painful to pick up the phone to say hello, it can go a long way.\n\nTake some time and consider what things would look like if the positions were reversed. Imagine you were the company hearing the pitch and deciding whether to invest in it. What would you want to hear? What would you like to see from the client? What are the key items that would make you go \"Yes, this is something I want to put money in!\"? Most founders fall into the trap of seeing it from their own perspective and fail to consider the other side.\n\nGood luck with the next pitch!",

And unless you're at the top spots on an infinite long list of choices you won't be allocated any of those resources, you won't get the minutes, and even less so the hours, of their time that you need to build a solid quality audience.\n\nTake a look at the guest lists of people like [Guy Kawasaki](https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/) and [Mark Maron](https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast) as an absolutely overwhelming example.\n\nSo what's your unique selling point to earn and keep some of those extremely finite resources of a quality audience?\n\nAnd, no, versions of \"we're better and genuine because we're not famous and professional\" doesn't fly when the foundation of it is being clueless amateurs.\n\nAbsolutely nothing wrong with using that approach, but it still needs a professional foundation. It still needs that USP. It still needs that network and structure and plan for how to reach, engage, and keep, the audience enough for them to redirect their attention towards your project.\n\nSo how are you going to create that foundation with these 5 first guests that are randoms from r/Startups rather than at least somewhat established names that can make people pay attention to what you're trying to build?",

Businesspeople reduce risk to that point any hesitation is manageable. Wantrepreneurs multiply their risk until the venture is more like an economic suicide attempt. They rejoice in chucking the books, starting without funding, no research and no plan. \n\nOkay. Why the post. Launch. Crap out something market-blind. \n\nJust don't bother asking where to find your first customers and why nothing you do works. Enjoy what you worked so hard to accomplish: Failure. Keep practicing that failure until it becomes a habit. \n\nDo not recruit people to encourage you in ignoring business completely ...then starting one.",

They don't need to be paying customers, just some kind of traction, even if it's just three guys who come back to use your product daily.\n\nIf it's a fintech, you want it after building the MVP but before integrating with regulated third parties like the London Stock Exchange, and before paying for licensing from organisations like the SEC.

If you have pull already, funding is fuel to scale what is working. If you do not have pull yet, you are asking investors to fund discovery, which is a tougher raise unless you have unusual credibility or a strong tailwind.\n\nOn the “40% since 2023” claim, it can be true in specific regions or segments even if broader numbers are different. The market did tighten after the 2021 peak, and recent data shows a rebound in 2025 with a lot of capital concentrated into fewer, larger rounds, especially in AI.",

Loans - if you ever plan to take funding you cannot take out a loan. These loans have to be disclosed as part of Due Diligence and no one is going to invest in a company with large outstanding loans. This is called “throwing money in a debt hole”. If fundraising is your plan, do that from the start of needing money. You can take out loans when profitable for specific projects, but not before profitability. \n\n2. Taking too much money - every industry has their story of a company that took hundreds of millions and was out of business two years later. Take what you need to get to the next round and no more. Reason 1 is that you need to remain hungry. Get to relaxed and fat and you lose steam and the company doesn’t compete. Reason 2 is you need to go up on valuation each round. If you have a lower valuation in a round it is called a “down round” and that will pretty much kill your fundraising chances in the future.\n\nAvoid those. But otherwise enjoy! It is crazy and chaotic and stressful and fun.",

      "text": "This is a half business half career advice question, and I hope it's okay for me to post here.\n\nI’m a CS grad/musician, and for the past few months, I've been building a web DAW with integrated video chat. There are other web DAW + video chat apps out there, but mine has a slightly different approach.\n\nI am treating the app as a startup. I've been working on it for mostly 14+ hours a day for months. I want to host the product on its own website, make premium features, etc. I'd absolutely love for this startup to be my job, but I need money, and creative tools are hard to monetize. So I'm looking for my first software job right now, with this project being a passion project that I'd work on the side if I got a job.\n\nThe issue is that it's a brutal market, and I have no internships. So I need to show employers and potential employers evidence that I know how to write clean, maintainable code. This app is my best work.\n\nSo what exactly are the risks of open sourcing my project? I was thinking an AGPLv3 license; I dont care if people run it locally, I could live with small companies or users used it in their open source products, but I could make larger closed-sourced apps pay to license my app (which is a theoretical possibility - my app is a small recorder that could be plopped into another app). I can still run it as my own service.\n\nI see two risks: 1) someone just outright takes my service as their own, which I have heard that in practice doesn't really happen? and 2) security risks, which since I'm a noob with no professional experience, is very possible that I'd make a mistake, especially since I was also planning on using cloud services + webrtc, and I really can't afford a high bill.\n\nI also don't really know how much value I'd be getting career-wise by open sourcing.",

          "text": "Speaking from experience building open source side projects:\n\n  \nAGPLv3 is solid for what you want. The copyleft nature means anyone using it in a hosted service needs to share their changes too, which protects you while still being open.\n\n  \nOn your two concerns:\n\n  \n1. Someone stealing your service - in practice this almost never happens. Running a service takes effort, marketing, customer support. The people who would clone your project are rarely the same people who would build a real business around it. Your edge is that you are the creator, you know the vision, you can ship faster.\n\n  \n2. Security risks - this is actually a benefit of open source. More eyes on code means bugs get found faster. Just dont hardcode secrets and use environment variables for all sensitive config. Standard stuff.\n\n  \nThe career value is real. Being able to point to a production codebase you built shows employers you can ship. Open source contributions get noticed. Some of my best opportunities came from people finding my GitHub.\n\n  \nOne thing to consider: you can start with a private repo and open source later once you feel more confident about the code quality. No rush.\n\n  \nGood luck with the web DAW. Music tools are a great space to build in.",

My gut says that isn't really a problem since many things change over time.\n\nOne potential advantage of having others use it is that you could potentially build relationships with them and learn what features their end users value and want, driving future dev pipeline.\n\nI'm not a developer, although I work with them all the time, so I can't speak to the security question, but definitely make sure you are not liable for breaches.\n\nBest of luck in your job search!",
