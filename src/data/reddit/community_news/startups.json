Short videos or simple demos that show what it actually does usually work better than anything vague.\n\nI’ve also found it helps to have a bit of organic groundwork first. Some content on social, a small follower base, and a bit of history on the page makes ads feel less like they’re coming from a brand that just appeared overnight.\n\nFrom there, A/B testing ads makes a lot of sense. Try a few angles, see what people actually respond to, then build from what works.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m probably the target audience for this stuff. I constantly get IG ads for apps promising better life organization or productivity, and I’m always a sucker for clicking through to see how my life might magically improve. When the message is clear, it works.\n\nAds aren’t a magic fix, but they’re a solid accelerator once the basics are in place.",

If you can't convince 10 people through direct conversation, ads and marketing won't magically fix that.\n\nA few things that actually work: find where your target users already congregate (forums, Slack groups, subreddits, Discord servers) and contribute genuinely for weeks before even mentioning you're building something. When you do mention it, frame it as \"I'm building X, would love feedback\" not \"check out my product.\" People are way more willing to help a fellow human than to be marketed to.\n\nAlso - referrals from those first users are gold.

Start by identifying where your potential users are already spending time online whether that’s niche subreddits, specialized forums, or social media groups, and engage in those spaces by offering value before directly promoting your app. you might also consider beta testing or offering the app for free to a small group of users to get real feedback. this can help identify if the UX is confusing, if the idea resonates, and if people would be willing to pay for it. lastly, user feedback is crucial, so try reaching out directly to people who fit your target audience and ask for honest opinions. this early stage is tough, but persistence and focusing on one-on-one feedback rather than broad promotional efforts might help you gather the insights you need to iterate and improve.",

But that doesn't happen. It's more like what is something that people love that is something that these stores and even the search engine will also prioritize in terms of going higher on the ranking.\n\n\n\nAs for what you've mentioned, Product Hunt launching requires a particular strategy if you have to get a lot of upvotes and land into top product of the day or the categories. Posting on many forums. It takes time. It is not that you just post about it or tell people about your product, you have to figure out what problem are you solving for them, and get it to them according to that problem. In terms of cold DMs, first DM - well, you might not get a response, and to very limited people. Also, you need to reach out to as many people as possible, and then keep following up. Following up is the key! Out of maybe 500 people, 5 might respond, but once they respond, they would be genuinely interested. Probably, and win after that, if two people try it out and keep on regularly using it, then you have two winners.",

A few installs that were either me, testers, or bots. Zero real feedback. That silence messes with your head more than people realize.\n\nOne thing I learned: no users doesn’t automatically mean the app is bad. Most of the time it just means nobody understands it yet, or nobody trusts it enough to try it. Especially if you’re unknown.\n\nProduct Hunt didn’t work for me either. Same with forums and cold DMs. All noise, no signal.\n\nWhat helped a bit was stopping “launch mode” and just trying to get one real person to react. Even paid a little for traffic just to see where people dropped off. It wasn’t growth, but at least it told me something.\n\nAlso, two weeks feels long when you’re staring at dashboards, but in reality it’s nothing. Most products die before they ever get a fair shot because the founder burns out in this phase.\n\nIf you want, I’m happy to take a look at your landing page or flow and give honest feedback. Sometimes you’re way closer than it feels.\n\nYou’re not alone in this stage. It just sucks while you’re in it.",

Just be useful.\n\n\n\nThe trick: track patterns. When do people mention your pain point? What language do they use? That's your feedback.\n\n\n\nAlso, manual outreach works if you're specific.

      "text": "I used to work in a very large bureaucratic organization where I was involved in data cleaning- NOT data analytics, NOT AI engineering, but literally cleaning messy data to be sent to statisticians for analysis. I was miserable. On top of that, I realized I hated having no impact on a company and being told what to do every second of the day with little upside for my career/life.\n\nI had been sitting on an idea for a business in the hotel industry for a while, though, because I love hospitality and saw I gap in the market I believed others did not see. I was doing a lot of thinking/ research about the product, market, as well as how the business would be executed and truly thought it could work. However, I was really stuck on making such a drastic leap of faith because I was so focused on the downside instead of the upside.\n\nBut one day I woke up more miserable than normal, and heard a podcast about someone who I went to school with that was running a 7-figure events business. One of the things he kept harping on was that fortune favors the bold, and that it's fine to feel afraid or skeptical, but you need to have the guts to put your feelings to the side and just go for it.  \n  \nComing from someone I perceived as a normal guy I went to class with, this hit me really hard. Because if he was able to take the risk, why couldn't I?\n\nNeedless to say, I drafted up a resignation letter and sent it to my former boss the same day\n\nThe next 18 months were more grueling than I ever imagined:\n\n* I dealt with more rejection & embarrassment in that time span than the rest of my life combined\n* My family was not encouraging on my leap of faith & let me know about it constantly\n* I had burned a significant amount of savings building a prototype\n* I had many sleepless nights as well as missed workouts/meals, leading to occasional bouts of sickness\n* Good friends & I completely drifted apart due to the time I had to take to work on my business\n\nOn top of all that, for a variety of reasons, I unfortunately had to shut down the business.\n\nHowever, I couldn't help but feel pride in this difficult situation I found myself in. Not only did I understand how to conduct proper customer discovery, manage financials, reach out to & close potential clients, & be a good leader (at least this was my goal), but I became a better version of myself. My confidence is at its peak, my mental acuity has never been sharper, and my network is pretty dang good. Lastly, I've learned to acknowledge and overcome fear to pursue what matters to me- the most valuable skill you can have imo.\n\nNow, because of my previous experience & connections, I secured a paid position with solid equity at a new startup. It's a great placeholder for now and I think it will lead to venture #2 down the road. I guess it all works out in a way and I would not have changed it for anything.\n\nWondering if anyone has a similar experience with their first venture?\n\n\n\nP.S.  \nIf you were in a similar position to me and want to start something, really think about your burn and what would happen if the company didn't work out after x months. I was in a position where I had enough savings/resources that I was able to spend the first few months with $0 in revenue. I am a big advocate for taking a risk to pursue a startup opportunity, but even I was somewhat calculated about it.",

From the outside, failure looks binary, but the skill accumulation is very real if you actually did customer discovery, shipping, and hard trade-offs. The tricky part is that not all startups force that kind of learning, some just recreate chaos without clarity. It sounds like you at least got a signal on what kind of environment you want next.

So that is what I started doing towards the latter half of my first company- surrounded myself with others who had entrepreneurial ventures through relevant events, groups, and established networks like the one I mentioned. When it was time for me to make a change, it was a lot easier because not only did I know people similar to me, but I also knew what they were working on as well as where I could add value- knowing how to add value is key as well.\n\nIn short, go to where the people you want to be like are and understand how you can provide real value to what they're doing.",

We threw tournaments,  managed to scale nicely over 5 years (including Covid when we went virtual), and had built enough credibility with gamers (who are notoriously distrustful and skeptical of outsiders), to put ourselves on the precipice of becoming a major (+2,000 participants) event in the community.\n\n2. Root Causes: a) personality conflicts. I ignored my better judgement about partnering with someone I knew I couldn’t stand because the upside was so big. b) bringing in someone who presented themselves and a marketing and biz dev wiz, ignoring subtle red flags because we were already committed to them. They also presented as someone well versed in contracts and operating agreements. Which turned out to be a fiction on par with Enron’s accounting. \n\n3. I should have walked away before getting started. I’ve prided myself on designing my business life so that I never had to work with anybody I didn’t want to, and no single project I was walking away from could break me, so I was never tied so tightly from something I couldn’t walk away if I needed to.  I broke both those rules. \n\n4. How It was handled: Lawyers. Lots of daydreaming about crushing peoples’ souls, but in the end peaceful acceptance that I relearned a valuable lesson, and a massive tax write off. But I did manage to cut two seriously ridiculous people out of my life, and that shit was almost…almost worth the loss. \n\n5. What now: sunk the extra time and energy into two projects, one of which is moving at an 8 on a scale of 1-10, the other that’s about a 6.5.",

It took me a year to find a good match for my tech cofounder who was able to quickly deliver on his promises. Here are my points:\n- past experience and education do not matter. I had people from MiT, Amazon, Apple, And other top business and education brands who talked as good game, fail and not deliver a single feature because they got stuck on what’s right vs shipping \n- what matters if you and them are hungry. My current tech cofounder has some experience and is from a mid tier school. We built an mvp in 2 months and are now iterating. \n- ego. Every time somebody wants to own an unequal share as a cofounder, they are usually stuck on the idea that they are a visionary. I had to go through that with myself and a few others and learn that *visionary* [insert title here] = delusional or rigid or egocentric. I’m no exception. \n- make sure you can argue with your cofounder. I don’t mean being nice during … have a meltdown with each other? Can you solve your issues after and come back together?\n- can the two of you ship something within 4 months?\n- can you communicate and trust each other’s words and promises?\n- can you get to mvp? To get seed?\n- do you need more than one cofounder? Don’t be greedy, but don’t be dumb.\n\nAll of the above are very hard things to get through and is what the 2 years of runway is for + one of you is likely to need a place to live so be ready to have a couch buddy when shit goes sideways for one of you. \n\nNow pardon me as I have a pitch deck to complete so we can fund ourselves for the next year… before we run out of our runway + so my technical cofounder can move out from my couch and have a place of her own again.",

Do not build without validating with your users, even if you have a very strong understanding of your user. Build small, test it out in beta with the loyal users.\n3. Be very active in supporting or providing technical support to your users, if it's a product which is online or any other product. Support is what builds loyal users.

                  "text": "I actually started this as a side project for my own community because we were handed [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) to run and build our developer community. This proved to be something which was initially very amazing to look at! \"Hey, I could list my events, every part of the community events over here.\" But soon it became a redundant task in terms of managing everything outside the platform other than listing the events because of the visibility. So the first thing that I did was to code a tool which had a number of forms available and members list, so all the members of my community would always find all their registrations, would always find all my events, all my community activity at one place. This was entirely coded while I was plying from and to office in the Metro. Soon this picked up, so I open sourced it. But you know, open source also comes with several costs, so probably people didn't deploy it much, or maybe the code wasn't that easily understandable. Moving ahead, I took a domain, deployed it live and scaled to around 23 communities within three months, and around 10,000 users in about a year. This was the journey. Initially, once I had the clarity, after being given a chance to attend Google IO twice, out of which once I also gave a talk, I had a lot of interaction in their developer relations space. This in turn gave me clarity on two things:\n\n1. This developer relations space is a place where companies are running blindsided, losing a lot of data, and probably getting reports on only numbers of people who are just a part of the community.\n2. In the long run, this can be a global ecosystem which can enable a lot more developers to learn from each other, build great things together, and most importantly, can be something which I'd want to work for a longer time.",

But by then, you've built a business that requires you to be someone you're not.\n\nSo before you dive into tactics and validation and funding, get clear on:\n- What kind of life do you want to live?\n- What actually matters to you?\n- Are you running toward something or away from something?\n\nThose answers will guide every decision better than any framework.\n\nStart from that clarity, then build.

      "text": "I’m really tired of reading the endless “I built for 1 year and got $0” so let me tell you what works. \n\nI’ve been selling online for 17+ years. \nI never had a job. \n\nI’ve sold everything that you can imagine. \n\nI’ve finally been able to launch a start up and now have a software business that makes 6 figures+. And this year we are on track to hitting $1M+ ARR. \n\nLook, I’ve made every mistake which everyone here seems to make. But let me share with you what works. \n\nFirst - forget software. \nYou aren’t in the software business. \n\nYou are in the relationship and problem solving business. \n\nFor me, I pivoted to software because I was burned out from coaching and consulting. I wanted the dream of building a great product and then scaling it to the moon. \n\nI wanted the comfort of my IDE. I’m a nerd by nature. I like to plan and build. \n\nA lot of people think this way. \nBut this is the #1 killer. \n\nNo one cares about your product. \nThink about it. \n\nHow much software spam do you see. \nDo you like it? \n\nIn fact, you hate 99% of software out there. \nEven your favorite software you complain about it not being perfect. \n\nSo imagine how users will approach your misaligned, awkward, buggy MVP. \n\nSo if you try to build and build the chance of success is less than 1%. \n\nInstead there is an approach that has 100% chance of success. \n\nHelping solve people’s problems. \n\nFind a group of people already using some software. \n\nFor me, I’ve been using marketing software for 10+ years. So I know those users. They were my past students, coaching, and consulting clients. \n\nThat’s what I did. I started to solve their problems. \n\nIn fact, the BEST way is to start doing projects for other people. That’s how I founded my latest company. \n\nI was hired to build a plugin for a marketing platform. \n\nI discovered there was a big market there. And I built another plugin and started selling it. \n\nBut the big pivot came about not from just selling the software. But helping the users. \n\nThink of your users. \nWhether they are writers. \nOr stay at home moms. \nOr business owners. \nOr marketers. \n\nThey have needs everyday. \nThey have workflows they are doing. \nThey have goals and dreams. \n\nYou can align your products with those people. \n\nRather than focusing on features. \nFocus on their problems and goals. \n\nIn fact, often times they are the ones that will tell you what to build. \n\nA lot of people ask how you can monetize. \nI’ve literally monetized on all levels. \n\nFrom $5 all the way up to $3k\nAnd we are working on getting even to $30k contracts. \n\nHow? \nBy focusing on our users. \nOur customers. \nWhat their needs are. \n\nYou have to forget the idea of how Google or Apple or even major SaaS company operates. You aren’t them. You don’t have a budget. You don’t have a team. \n\nYour main constraint is your energy, motivation, clarity, and your bills. \n\nYou have to operate hyper lean. \n\nSo my users became my everything. \n\nI put together different packages. \nI offered them agency accounts. \nWhite label partnerships. \nInvestment opportunities. \nAffiliate. \n\nThey do QA. \n\nThis is the only way to succeed. \n\nI try to help them with all their problems. \n\nThat’s the relationship building part. \nWhen you over deliver and take care of your users and treat them like clients, not just numbers. They appreciate it. They reciprocate. \n\nThey become your partners and evangelists. \n\nMy users upgrade and upgrade and upgrade and upgrade. \n\nEven though they bought an LTD. They then buy a level 2 agency LTD. Then they buy a white label partnership. Some even became direct investors. \n\nThis is a total game changer from the \n“I built for 12 months and generated $0”\n\nI even read a comment someone who has been building their software for literally 32 years and generated $0. \n\nYou can even go further and sell before you build. And I do that to some extent. And I can even be much more aggressive with sales. \n\nBut I’m like most, a natural builder. Building is my comfort zone. But I had to push myself to be able to survive. \n\nAnd that’s the lesson I want to pass to you. \n\nThink of your users as your clients and partners not just your numbers. \n\nYou aren’t a VC backed start up that can burn through millions to acquire a big herd of users. \n\nYou need to like a village helper who does favors to everyone and helps everyone out and earn’s people’s trust. And slowly bootstrap yourself to the next level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I want to take a “this is what we’re solving, what do you think convo” and then talk over time and see if funding makes sense\n\nDo I reach out cold email? How about cold connect/dm on LinkedIn?

Googles useless here.\n\nI’m looking for specifics outside of general advice.\n\nFWIW our funding ask, if we ever get to it, is to ask between 100 to 250k pre seed SAFE. We have over 2000 signups over the past year with virtually everyone saying the same thing (we’ll pay for it if it can do this) so our traction and story is strong, we just need more dedicated time to solve the problem, hence the need for funding.",

A short cold email that says what you are building, why now, and what signal you have works better than vague “would love feedback” asks. If you truly want a conversation, frame it as learning, not pitching, but be ready to pitch anyway. In SF, the fastest path is still other founders. Go to small demo nights, founder dinners, and operator meetups, not big splashy events. Intros compound once one person takes you seriously. The mistake is waiting to feel ready. Conversations are how you get ready.",

VCs are always judging even they say they are not, so the \"validating\" an idea is best to be reserved to VCs who you have a relationship with. Otherwise unless you are an absolute savage with an amazing track record, they will see you as a nice little man trying to play entrepreneur. \n\nVCs rarely change their mind so if they say no, it will likely stay that way. If they see you at your weakest, it will be hard for them to change their view about you. Seek advice from people who have done it before (raised) or people plugged into the VC ecosystem.

If you try to simply out-code lets say a Google engineer type of founder, you will lose. The market doesn't ask for your credentials, it asks if you can solve a specific pain better than anyone else.

They hire when a concrete pain exists, and they trust someone to own it. Cold outreach works better when it is framed around a very specific contribution tied to what the company is already shipping, not a generic willingness to help. Offering part time work can help in some cases, but only if it reduces risk for the team rather than creating more coordination overhead. I would also be careful assuming accelerators or job boards reflect how most small teams actually hire, a lot of decisions happen opportunistically and off cycle. From the founder's side, commitment matters less than clarity about what you would build and how it fits the roadmap. If you can demonstrate that level of understanding, even a short engagement starts to look more like a trial than an internship.",

Claude Code also handles 50k+ LOC projects reasonably well. But both still need you to review diffs before merging.\n\nThe honest math: vibe coding works for MVPs and internal tools.

I'm not sure if they will move forward with me. For context, we've pivoted once after he left his OpenAI job in October. We've never had a fight. We are both pretty calm people.   \n  \nThe reason he told me on his leaving is that he's becoming more passionate about a research project and he just met the person who published the research paper and felt they can build the future together. The researcher have a research background than me ofc. \n\nIs there anything I realistically could have done differently as a founder or leader, communication, support during rejections, expectation-setting, or is this just a misalignment that happens sometimes?\n\nI have meetings coming up soon. How do I explain this honestly without spooking investors or making it seem like the company is unstable?\n\nI've been feeling tremendous pressure because now there is only me working on this idea\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how you handled it and what you learned.",

What matters is not what happened, it is how you handle it. People’s priorities change and sometimes misalignment only becomes visible when a new opportunity appears. That does not automatically mean you led poorly, it just means reality shifted.\n\nI lost a cofounder not over funding, but over motivation and priorities, and that hurts in a different way. It reminds you that we truly do not control much in this journey. You can do everything right and still watch someone’s inner compass shift. That is not a leadership failure, it is a human reality. Startups are built on people, and people evolve.\n\nNow you have to decide. If you truly need a cofounder to move forward, pause and resolve that gap intentionally. Do not rush. Find the right person with time in mind. If you can move forward alone for now, do it.\n\nBuild, show momentum, and let progress attract the next partner. Investors will not judge the instability as much as they will judge whether you can absorb a hit and keep moving. What you control is what comes next. This moment is about resilience, clarity, and proving you can keep going even when the ground moves.",

Since you're on good terms, I'd say ask your former co-founder, he's the only one who fully understands his motives.\n\nYou said in another comment that you're technical yourself. Are you going to take over the CTO role or will you be looking for someone else? Whatever the choice, make sure you can confidently explain the new company structure to your investors. If I was your investor, I'd care more about the path forward than about what happened in the past.\n\nHow many co-founders are there now? Investors want to feel confident that each major business function is covered by someone with expertise in that field. Usually that's business development, domain expertise, and product/tech. Some of these hats can be worn by the same person of course.",

Sometimes the misalignment is about where someone wants to spend their risk, not how you treated them. Research driven curiosity and company building diverge fast, and that gap only widens under fundraising pressure.\n\nWith investors, don’t over explain or defend. Be factual and calm. Say your cofounder decided to pursue a research path that didn’t align with building a product company, and that the split was amicable. Then pivot the conversation to what you learned from working together and how you’re de risking the next phase. What spooks investors isn’t a founder leaving, it’s uncertainty and lack of ownership.\n\nThe bigger question is whether you want to be solo right now or quickly find a technical partner. If you can carry the product and roadmap yourself for a bit, that actually demonstrates resilience. Early stage teams are more about people than process, and right now the person they’re evaluating is you.",

One low-risk option is to test intent without full productization, for example, a paid pilot with clear constraints and no promises. That can tell you whether demand persists once expectations around polish and support are explicit.

Internal tools often work because they encode a set of norms, incentives, and habits that are invisible to outsiders. When customers ask to buy it, they are usually reacting to the outcome they see, not the discipline and context required to get there. A constrained pilot is a good way to surface that gap without committing to your roadmap. I would also be explicit with pilot users that this is not a standalone product yet, but an opinionated workflow that demands buy-in. If it only works when teams fully adopt the philosophy, that is not a flaw, but it does shape whether it can coexist with your main product without becoming a distraction.",

There was also a 11 years age gap so not even sure if that might have been a factor.\n\nI know this is a hectic journey with so many unknowns but I also don't want to spend the next few years only on work and then try to find a partner when I am settled.\n\nAnyone have any advice on how to approach this?

Not in an apologetic way, but just matter of fact - \"I'm building a company right now, some weeks are chaos, I won't always be able to text back quickly, and if I cancel plans it's not because I'm not interested.\" Most people will filter themselves out, and that's fine. The ones who stick around tend to be either founders themselves or just genuinely independent people who have their own thing going on.\n\nThe 11-year age gap thing is probably more significant than you think btw. Someone who's exited twice is at a completely different life stage - they've already done the thing you're still grinding through. Easy to misjudge what \"understanding the unpredictability\" means when they're viewing it from the other side.\n\nMy honest take: keep dating if you want to, but adjust expectations. You're not looking for someone who needs consistent attention right now. You're looking for someone comfortable with sporadic intensity. Those people exist, they're just not the majority.",
