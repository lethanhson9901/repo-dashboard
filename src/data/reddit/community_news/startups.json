      "text": "i am 34 years old asian man, and I’ve been trying to build businesses for the past 10 years.\n\nAlong the way, I spent some time freelancing and also worked a regular job for about two years. By the time I turned 29, I had lost everything I had no savings, only debt.\n\nMy web development skill was only thing improved.\n\nThe business I’m running now is essentially my last attempt, and it has finally started to work.\n\nI run a dating related app. (I have been working as a freelancer at dating app startup. So I can build it well). When choosing what to build, I deliberately picked something that I believed could remain relatively resilient and adaptable in the age of rapidly advancing AI.\n\nI’ve been working on this product continuously for the past 2 years and 3 months. Growth was slow at first, but steady. Today, the business generates around $186k / month.\n\nFor the first 6 months, I made less than $1k per month.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I averaged around $4k per month.\n\nAfter that first year, growth started to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe hardest part of this journey wasn’t just the business itself. it was managing my life in a balanced way.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and neither of them is financially prepared for retirement. Compared to my peers, I had saved very little. I’m still unmarried. After years of failed ventures, nothing in my life felt stable or solid.\n\nIn that environment, my fear of failure became overwhelming. I didn’t have anyone I could truly lean on emotionally.\n\nEven now, I don’t really have hobbies outside of work. I’m not particularly outgoing either. As I write this, it’s 11:49 PM on the last day of 2025, and I’m sitting alone in my office, writing this post on Reddit.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to write this post is to share one thing I regret the most.\n\nA few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, the person who stayed by my side through some of the hardest years of my life. At the time, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and resentful of everything. I saw even my relationship as a mental burden.\n\nBut in reality, she was the only person who truly supported me, the only one I could deeply rely on emotionally.\n\nAfter we broke up, I focused exclusively on my business. The business eventually worked not because of the breakup, but despite everything. And now, when I look back, she’s the only thing I think about.\n\nShe’s now preparing for marriage with someone else.\n\nAnd I’m dealing with loneliness, questioning whether I can continue growing this business, and worrying about the future.\n\nI know I’ll keep going. I know I’ll make it work.\n\nBut as I get older, the loneliness and isolation feel heavier, and I can feel myself becoming more emotionally unstable.\n\nSometimes I wonder:\n\nIf I had someone by my side right now, wouldn’t I be imagining the future of my business with a much stronger and brighter mindset?\n\nSo this is what I want to say to anyone reading this:\n\nIf you have nothing right now no money, no success, no certainty but someone you love is staying by your side\\*\\*,\\*\\* If you can, hold on to them and build a life together.\n\nNo matter what happens to my business from here on out, this will probably remain my greatest regret.",

Once you do and realize the business didn’t collapse once you let go, you’ll be able to breathe a bit easier and repeat the process.",

A lot women want resources from men. Its nasty. Ive seen it first hand. My Dad had a 6 fig income, retired, married... divorced just recent and maaaaan.... Its painful to see him in the finacial state. Wiped out by woman. He thought prayers and not taking action to protect himself would save him. Nope. So protect yourself at all times. Its a concrete jungle out there. Dont let nooooooo body, especially women that want to soften you up and, \"you cant be that way\", dude. Theyre their to open you up, never there when theyre wrong. You hold the cards. Hold them close. Use your best judgement. Keep your wits. Vet first, love later. A mans greatest folly, is his heart and his 2nd head. Good job. Proud of you. Now get to buying some hard assets, a trust, a finacial team etc. Still ways to go. congrats on cracking the 100k barrier.\nLadies , its not a shot at women. Its a warning to men , that I wasnt taught young, to guard your hearts. Mothers always warn girls about boys. Rarely do boys get warned about girls. Its no shade, just a grounding.",

In retrospect I think entrepreneurship is one of the worst life paths for people and probably not something you should aspire towards explicitly. I think you can NOW start to live again and prioritise life fulfilling things outside of work but since you hadnt achieved it previously you really couldnt afford to do so mentally. \n\nHonestly, I would just be grateful you finally succeeded because imagine if you had failed and were in the same position.

It helps keep me accountable to ALL my goals, not just my business ones. Making friends as an adult is harder, but you’ll get out of it what you put into it.\n\nSo many strangers helped me, never hesitate to DM if you want to hop on a Zoom call or something.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": "(I will not promote)\n\nI've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

What I meant was, one should still consider their startup and even their own momentum in terms of the list as you have built it. \n\nIt's important that one also acknowledge that there are certain... caveats because you can't always show immediate adoption numbers, so you have to come up with other ways. \n\nYour list is a map, and a map is an approximation of the territory, so adjust accordingly. :)\n\nFor example, with my surgical robot I was able to present a list of over 200 surgeons in the field that had used the robot in a simulation setting and validated the potential clinical value of the technology. They weren't a direct adopter (yes), but they were experts who provided their insight of the future value of the device. \n\nRegardless of that outlier, I say your list is spot on.",

And that point about founders trying to “convince” instead of tell a clear story really resonates. The best conversations we’ve had were when we stopped over-explaining and just focused on what we understood deeply and why it mattered.  Feels like confidence comes from clarity, not from fancy words.",

I’m a 40-year-old father trying to understand how this new world works.\n\nTo talk to you, I spent hours researching your terminology like \"Technical Debt.\" I am sorry if my usage is awkward, but I found a deep connection to my world of finance.\n\nIn banking, we think about \"Amortization\" (how long an asset lasts). \nIf you build a \"Pop-up store\" (a prototype), move fast. Use AI and libraries. That's good business. \nBut if you are building a \"Shrine\" (a core system) to last 20 years, the cheapest way is actually \"**The Forging**\" (鍛錬) way. In Japan, the best katanas are forged by folding the steel thousands of times. Software is the same. You must fold the logic again and again by building from scratch until it becomes part of you.\n\nI see many startups drowning in \"Technical Interest.\" They take \"loans\" by using easy AI code without understanding the core. In banking, a loan without a repayment plan is just a disaster.\n\nIn Japan, we have a concept: \"Chiko-Goitsu\" (知行合一). Knowledge and action are one. \nReading about code isn't enough if your hands move slower than your brain. The friction of struggling without AI—**The Forging**—is where the real skill is born.\n\nIs the \"move fast\" culture making us forget the value of **The Forging**? I am just a banker, but I wanted to hear your professional thoughts.\n\n\n**Edit: 7 Lessons Learned from this discussion**\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone who joined this thread. As a rural banker from Japan, your insights have been an incredible \"Ethical OS\" for me. Here is what I’ve learned from your collective wisdom:\n\n**1. Technical Debt as a \"Strategic Loan\"**: Speed is an essential investment in the early stages (MVP). It's okay to \"borrow\" speed, as long as you have a plan to repay it. (Thanks Ray and others!)\n\n**2. The \"Shrine\" vs. \"Cathedral\"**: Don't over-design before you understand the soul of the product. Building a small \"shrine\" first and listening to users is the key to avoiding toxic debt. (Thanks Ok-Kaleidoscope5627!)\n\n**3. Forging is about \"Understanding\"**: Writing code is easy (AI can do it), but \"Forging\" is the process of truly understanding the logic. Re-writing is not a waste; it's how you master the foundation. (Thanks Capt-Kowalski!)\n\n**4. Leadership is Debt Management**: A good leader values the time spent \"repaying\" technical debt. Blindly chasing \"one-hit reversals\" while ignoring the foundation is a gamble that leads to bankruptcy.\n\n**5. Avoid the \"Museum Piece\" Trap**: No matter how much soul you forge into a blade, it loses its life as a tool the moment it stops being a \"weapon for battle.\" True \"Forging\" must be aligned with the battlefield of reality (PMF).\n\n**6. Strategic Survival vs. Capitalist Pivot**: Giants can afford to \"Pivot\" as if they are totaling a supercar and just ordering the next one. But for small founders, a single project is often their whole life; there is no second chance. Therefore, an **\"Exit Strategy\"** is essential. Ideally, we shouldn't just \"discard\" a debt-heavy module. If we can find a buyer or redefine its value for a future \"Buyout,\" high interest turns into a massive \"investment.\" (In reality, this is more often a lucky result than a planned strategy, but it’s the ultimate goal!)\n\n**7. Debt is like Alcohol**: It gives you a temporary high and power, but the \"hangover\" (interest/debt) is inevitable. Success depends on the \"care\" you take before, during, and after drinking. (Thanks Kaidomaru!)\n\nI will take these lessons back to my small bank in Gunma to refine my philosophy. I am truly honored to have met such \"legendary\" mentors here. \n\nArigato (Thank you) from Japan!\n\n",

For example, I consult for startups, and many of them must create their idea as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to demonstrate their potential so that they can get funding from investors. This is what Facebook did; they created a poorly crafted product then actually rebuilt the whole thing once they had the money.\n\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, there are serious drawbacks to accumulating technical debt. A business owner will have to fix their product sooner or later. AI code has made the issue much worse. AI makes the kinds of mistakes that even a bad programmer wouldn't make, creating issues that are very difficult to solve. Furthermore, as you pointed out, in many cases no one actually understands what the code is doing.\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, startups create more technical debt than they need to because they try to do too much too soon. The more features something has, the more expensive it is to make. It's better to create a product that does one thing well than five things badly.",

But startups are trying to discover what the market actually needs before investing in optimizing and forging because premature optimization will be useless if it's not a product that is needed. It's also a reason why big companies in tech struggle to innovate - they focus on scalabilty and quality to reduce tech debt before getting their product out and getting customer feedback which makes them slower to change and respond.\n\nA knife is a well understood product on the need and use case and design parameters which then makes sense on why it should justify upfront forging and great quality. But there was probably a prototyping stage hundreds of years before where blacksmiths tried different shapes and techniques (while taking shortcuts on quality) to find the best for different needs.\n\nUsually new software has multiple personas working with it and multiple potential solutions where it's not clear what to focus on first. Some people like to collect and document extensive requirements upfront to try to be more methodical, but often that fails too because what is documented isn't what is actually needed and you only see that when you build something quick and get it in front of users.",

You have woven an elegant tapestry of wisdom, but there is a loose thread I cannot help but pull: **we often do not know how long a piece of software will live when we write it**\n\nStartups often pivot and big companies can invest a lot towards initiatives that make sense at the time but ultimately don’t pan out, like Meta’s “metaverse” or the dozens of projects created and killed by Google. \n\nIn that case technical debt is less like taking on a burdensome loan, and more like putting clothes on a high interest credit card and hoping you decide whether or not to keep it before the return period is over. In that case what is kept is expected to be roughly within the clothing budget, including expected cost of care through its useful lifetime. \n\nAs long as the new features are not too coupled with the rest of the system to be easily removed or swapped out, there is less risk in knowingly incorporating modules with high technical debt, which has been a fundamental lesson of software engineering long before AI and will always continue to guide development practices.",

          "text": "I think an important thing to understand about software is that we don't know what we're building. Sometimes we know the high level idea but the details are not known when we start.\n\nSo if you think about a shrine, as software developers we are told to make a place for people to pray. When we start, we don't know if it is a shinto, or a Buddhist shrine, or even a Christian church. We don't know how many people will use it. Which people will use it. Where it needs to be built. What materials we will have to build with etc.\n\nSoftware projects are generally developed under two approaches - waterfall, or agile:\n\nWith waterfall we try to find out all the details and plan everything in advance and then build to that design. The problem is that because software is often trying to solve problems that we don't fully understand - we end up building a Catholic cathedral to handle thousands of worshippers when we wanted a small neighbourhood shrine. You are left with a well designed system but in a sense the entire system is tech debt that we then try to modify to do what the actual goal was.\n\nWith Agile we accept that we don't know all the answers and we start by building something simple, checking with the users to see if it works, and then iterating until we get it right. This means we start with a small personal shrine in their home, talk to the users, they tell us that they actually wanted it dedicated to Inari and they want it built on a nearby mountain. Okay, so now rebuild it or move it and add some fox statues. Then we learn that it's really popular and we need to accommodate thousands of visitors, so now we start building it to handle all those visitors. We still have tech debt because of all the previous versions that didn't really solve the problem, and because all of our solutions were designed by reacting to the requirements rather than planning for them. It's a different type of debt though.\n\nWe use waterfall when we write software for spaceships or things that can be dangerous if they don't work the first time. This approach can be expensive and takes a lot of time and results in large hard to work with software. We use agile when we write software for requirements that we expect will be changing and where it's okay to fail because we can try again. Most software is written with an agile approach as a result.\n\nWe get tech debt either way but different types and for different reasons. The only reliable way that we've found to prevent tech debt is by hiring highly experienced and skilled engineers who thanks to their experience can make decisions that avoid the tech debt before it occurs. Good leadership also plans for it and gives their engineers time to learn from their successes and failures, and fix the tech debt. Bad leadership sees something that is \"working\" and doesn't understand the value in paying down the debt, they just accumulate more and more debt until everything has to be torn down and started from scratch.",

If you are building a foundation for your software, you need to understand it in and out to be able to bend it to your will into something that is both performant and easy to understand. This writing and rewriting the code logic a 1000 times is exactly the (and the only) way to achieve that.\n\nThe goal of forging is not to write the code (AI could do it) but to understand what you are writing. Without that you won’t be able to change the code, it will be a security liability and likely a lot slower than it should have been.",

No one has a crystal ball and it would be arrogant to assume we know where our startup is in two years. Building all the foundation to last is often futile, and is a sign of inexperienced teams. The answer isn’t at single-use throwaway code either, really the only thing experienced teams do differently is recognise when you can be relatively sure where things go so you build enough foundation to support and enable future development without rework, but only when applicable.\n\nThe hardest part about this is that it’s not just a technical question, it requires superb customer and productisation understanding that is often with completely different people than the technical know how. Getting those people to talk, not to mention to agree, is very difficult. Which yet again brings us to the benefit of being fast in a smart way because the faster you get things exposed to the market, the faster you can learn and align.\n\nIt’s never 100% this or 100% that. It’s more 80/20 one way or the other depending on maturity, team, circumstance, market, etc.",

You'll want to find out what drew them to the app, what convinced them that there was enough value to justify the subscription, are there things that they feel are missing or are there any things that annoy them, etc\n\nYou don't want to take the feedback of a handful of users as gospel, but if there are patterns across the feedback you get, that should help give you some insight and help perhaps prioritize what to work on next. There might also be some low-hanging fruit annoyances that you could quickly fix and keep your users happy.",

A small early push (newsletter, Slack groups, Twitter/X, hunters) creates a snowball effect. Once a product hits the top spot early in the day, it gets more visibility on the homepage, email digests and notifications, which brings in more organic upvotes. That is how #1 can run away to 300+ while #2 stalls at 230. It is momentum and visibility compounding, not a linear race.\n\nSo yeah, its less about “best product wins” and more about who shows up with distribution ready on day one.

My business partner worked hard that day, had people lined up to engage throughout the day for engagement over time. Had them click on specific links, install the app etc.\n\nWe were number 1 for most of the day. But we are on GMT as we are in the UK, and when we stopped our campaign the US campaigns kept going and we were pipped at the post for the vanity metric of being number 1.\n\nSo it can be done and I don't think it's rigged, it just has to be gamed and ran like a full time job of a campaign for a day if you want the top slot",

      "text": "Over the last few years, I’ve had the privilege of working on zero-to-one products, scaling systems, shipping fast, and experiencing the real chaos of startup life.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I realised the problems I felt most compelled to solve were the same ones I kept running into myself.\n\nAlongside a 9–5, I spent nights and weekends building small products with a few tech friends. We made some money, and one of those products was even acquired for a few dollars. Still, despite those early wins, we never had the confidence to quit everything and go all in.\n\nThose experiences taught me something important: working full-time on something you truly believe in creates far more momentum than treating it as a side project.\n\nDropping out early and starting up on day one often sounds glamorous, until you’re responsible for putting food on the table. Reality has a way of grounding ambition.\n\nComing from a humble, lower middle-class background, my first five years of employment were essential. They helped me build financial stability and ensured my family didn’t carry the risk of my ambition. I strongly believe that starting up should never come at the cost of your family’s well-being.\n\nIn hindsight, choosing the right startups for my 9–5 was an education in itself. You get to experiment, learn, and fail on someone else’s capital while building real conviction about what works and what doesn’t. I’m deeply grateful to the founders who trusted me and allowed me to witness their zero-to-one journeys up close. Many great founders began their paths the same way.\n\nAll of this combined gave me the confidence, skills, and clarity to finally take the leap.\n\nI’ll share more updates as this journey unfolds.  \nIf you’re a founder, builder, or hustler working in tech, I’d love to connect and learn from your experiences too.",

Many startup content pieces skip over that part and turn risk into a personality trait. In reality, timing and responsibility matter a lot, especially when other people depend on you.\n\nI also really agree with the idea that choosing the *right* 9–5s can be an education. Working inside early-stage companies teaches you things you simply don’t learn building alone at night: tradeoffs, prioritization, customer reality, and how messy zero-to-one actually is. Doing that on someone else’s capital isn’t laziness, it’s leverage.\n\nThe side-project phase is underrated, too. Shipping small things, seeing what breaks, and making a bit of money (even if it’s not life-changing) builds pattern recognition and confidence that no amount of theory can replace. It’s not glamorous, but it compounds.\n\nTo me, this doesn’t read like “I finally escaped the 9–5.”  \nIt reads like “I earned the right to focus.”\n\nWishing you clarity, rather than speed, in this next phase. Looking forward to seeing what you learn when all the momentum points in one direction.",

(I know vibe coding sucks and expect it this to be discarded.)\n\nTo be clear, I am happy doing 100% of the work OTHER than coding, and would support my CTO in whatever way they need. (If we need a smaller marketing team to have the budget for their SWE/game dev team, then so be it, etc.)\n\nI expect equity to be AT LEAST 45/55 and whatever salary I make (post funding) they would make.\n\nIn short, I would show them basic human decency.\n\nI do not anticipate funding being hard\\* as I already have a few interested investors, but all they want is a qualified CTO for the field I am in (game design meets EdTech…  either, really). \n\nSo… my wonderful tech/eng humans… **where and how can I convince you all to give me a shot?**\n\n\\*all funding is hard, and I am fine carrying the funding rounds, but due to my previous connections, it may be less hard than cold emailing.\n\n(EDIT: THANK YOU to all the folks giving critical feedback, I genuinely appreciate it.)",

It’s hard to make a game people want to play. Very hard.\n\n2) You need to integrate test prep in a way that players will actually learn and enjoy. I assume this is the more magical part. \n\n3) This needs to be as effective or more so than current prep methods like reading the books, practice exams, buying a course. This is another very hard problem. \n\nIt also sounds like there isn’t much technical challenge which makes it less interesting for a CTO and less defensible. ",

After that, an initial product means initial sales which means revenue to hire an actual team (even if part time at first) and a stronger business case for a first round of investors. If you cannot scrape enough FFF money together to do that, then what are you actually bringing to the table? Great programmers are constantly coming up with ideas they are weighing in their mind – what is the business potential / market size relative to risk and relative to how difficult and time consuming the product is to program and support. If you bring an idea and not sales/contacts/money then it's a bad deal for any programmer.",

However as a potential technical founder I would rather work on my own things solo then team up for this idea. \n\nYou're going to have all of the problems of an indie game studio and a startup combined if you start from scratch. \n\nYou need to secure funding to acquire an existing game that didn't sell to it's potential and re-release it, or find someone who is pretty far along the process of building a game and is willing to partner with you, add educational content for you finding funding for the rest of the game. \n\nHere were my initial questions/thoughts though that led me to the above conclusion. \n\n1. How did you validate it? Validating a game is hard, but you're also an educational tool, so you need to validate both sides. \n\n2. I don't think this is a startup, there's no way to scale this since games make 80% of their sales within the first few months and if you do a subscription model, you'll have constant churn since people only need to pass these tests once.\n\n3. What's your moat? Someone could vibe code a LSAT study mod into Skyrim in a weekend, Stardew Valley already has an ANKI study mod. I've never played Roblox, but I would be surprised if no one has done an educational game there already.\n\nI do think educational games will be a big thing in the future. It's just going to be hard to pull off and there's lots of competition. \n\nIf you're able to make the next Roblox/Minecraft/Stardew and show positive educational outcomes you'll be huge. There's also lots of ways to pivot/specialize along the way to keep going.",

If you don’t have any technical friends or folks from your network that’ll join in, then you need money. Money solves this problem and it’ll enable you to give away an order of magnitude less of your company. If I was you, I would focus on fundraising. Lots of smart, non-technical people raise on an idea or brittle MVP.\n\nEvery VC at every stage is going to tell you to derisk. At your stage, that’s proving you can hire a critical engineer. When they don’t follow up with an offer, that’s a signal.\n\nWhat this signal means is that the investors don’t believe in you yet; they know they’ll have to pay more if you get farther along and have a team. If they believe in you they’ll invest. So reading the books the VCs read, getting letters of intent from potential customers, refining your pitch, and practice-pitching to friendly VCs in your network - those are the types of things I would focus on.\n\nA couple other tips when talking to technical co-founders:\n\n1. Like investors, technical cofounders need to believe you. Saying things like “I’ve done most of the non-tech work” is definitely not true and makes it seem like you don’t know what you’re getting into. The non-technical work of running a business is never finished. \n2. Being generous or valuing the company inexpensively is not attractive to great engineers. Great engineers would rather have a smaller piece of something great than half of nothing. If you have something valuable, your offers to a technical co-founder - and frankly, everyone who wants a piece of your company - should reflect that confidence. Cheaper isn’t better. \n\n\nGood luck!",

I had thought that it might, and I was worried that it would, but it wasn't for the reasons I had thought it would just be people filling the available time, but I found: \n\n- It had a 'quiet car' effect -- people were less likely to want to interrupt someone to help them with a blocker because they didn't want to disturb\n\n- People had less opportunity to see what other people were working on when, so handoffs were way slower\n\nEither way, we did *most* of our meetings on \"meeting day\" but otherwise I found that adding back morning standups made people happier (in a way I never expected) and also made everyone more productive. Also it pierced the veil on not disturbing others, so we'd kind of see a little spike of cross-communication just ahead of and just after standup in which people would get their dependencies situated before it settled back down\n\nWe did alternate in-person (video) standups with digital (text-only) standups day to day, which people liked (and in weird ways was also more productive because text is a more efficient means of delivery) but people liked the connection\n\nAgain, YMMV",

There is nothing preventing people from doing a sync call outside the one day - I want everyone to feel empowered to do what they think is best for the business\n\n2) Quiet car effect - culturally I want people to do what they think is best for the business and if that means interrupting someone or doing a sync meeting on other days so be it\n\n3) We are striving hard to make everything 100% transparent.  It will still require individuals to post information that is concise and important for others to read as well as require individuals to take the time to read and comment\n\n4) I generally dislike traditional scrum standups for various reasons but perhaps a less formal optional daily sync meeting would make sense.

The ones that mandated RTO because vibes felt off generally just pissed off their best people who had other options.\n\nThe deeper issue is that remote exposes management weakness that offices hide. Bad managers can't tell who's performing without watching them type. Unclear priorities become obvious when there's no hallway conversation to course correct. Companies with strong async communication and clear ownership metrics don't suddenly need everyone in a room.\n\nThe cynical read is that some of these mandates are quiet layoffs. Announce RTO, let the people who moved away or structured their lives around remote self-select out, reduce headcount without severance.",

But if you mean startups in the traditional sense then it generally boils down to a few factors:\n\n* They've still got an office lease they want to do something with\n* They think having \"butts in seats\" looks more attractive to prospects/customers/investors.\n* They have a lot of useless middle managers\n* They lean old school or micro-managery.\n* They want to RIF a bunch of people without having to do a real layoff.\n\nALMOST no one I've spoken with says \"Man, I'm SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE in the office. Thank god I go in on a regular basis or else I'd never get anything done\" (heavy sarcasm). Most people agree that the office is a distracting environment and they get less done.\n\nHowever there are a few exceptions....\n\n* It is nice on occasion to get together in person just to be able to chat/hangout/meeting in person. It's different in person that on Zoom and the change of pace is nice. It \\*can\\* be more productive - when it's well planned and executed.\n* You live in an environment where your home life is more chaotic and/or disruptive than an office. I once had a subordinate who went to the office every day, even in the height of covid, because home was small, several young kids, and he had no quiet/private work space.\n* You are the sort of person that \"thrives\" on the energy of a buzzing office. This is more for the sales types.\n\nBoth \"all remote all the time\" and \"all office all the time\" are imperfect. It strongly depends on who you are, what you do, your personality and a whole host of other factors. Myself? I \\*love\\* WFH. My work is more quiet and individual, I hate people interrupting my flow and fortunately my wife (who also WFH) is the same - we barely speak to each other during the work day. But I'd love for my company or at least larger group to get together once a month to have a day (or two) of big thought leading meetings. Not boring presentations, keep that on zoom, but brainstorming-lets-really-just-hash-it-out meetings. Unfortunately we're distributed across the entire USA so that's a little too expensive.",

Real momentum, bigger clients, team growing, work coming in fast.\n\n\n\nWhat went wrong (the mistake that changed me):\n\nI scaled trust faster than I scaled structure.\n\n\n\nWhen the agency started taking off, I brought partners in to cover gaps like retention, CRO, and ops. The intention was right. Move faster. Cover blind spots. Build something bigger than me.\n\n\n\nBut I made a few mistakes that compounded:\n\n\n\nI built the company on verbal alignment.\nWe had a lot of “we’re good” conversations. Not enough written agreements that spelled out roles, ownership, decision-making, financial controls, expectations, and what happens when things get hard.\nI handed over leverage without guardrails.\nI stayed locked into what I do best: strategy, creative direction, production, client trust. I let other people control operational levers without the protections in place. Approvals. Access. Reporting. SOPs. Clear boundaries on who owns what.\nI ignored early friction because growth was loud.\nWhen you’re winning, shipping, and clients are happy, it’s easy to downplay misalignment. I treated red flags like stress. I told myself it was temporary. It wasn’t.\nI didn’t treat partnership like something that needs maintenance.\nNo scorecards. No measurable accountability. No documented decisions. No consistent cadence of “this is what done looks like.” So when pressure hit, reality turned into three different stories depending on who you asked.\n\n\n\n\nThe business grew, but the foundation didn’t. And when tension showed up, the lack of structure turned into confusion, conflict, and real financial and emotional damage.\n\n\n\nWhat I learned afterward:\n\nGrowth doesn’t fix instability. It exposes it.\n\n\n\nMy rules now:\n\n\n\nPartnerships need contracts, not vibes.\nIf it’s serious enough to build your life around, it’s serious enough to document. Roles, ownership, pay, access, decision rights, exit terms. Everything.\nControl isn’t ego. It’s responsibility.\nIf I can’t see the numbers, the approvals, the pipeline, and the output clearly, I’m not leading. I’m hoping.\nIf alignment isn’t written, it isn’t real.\nI document decisions when things are calm, so it’s clear when things aren’t.\nProtect the core before you scale the shell.\nSOPs, financial controls, client agreements, org chart clarity, and delivery systems come before bigger retainers and bigger teams.\n\n\n\n\nThat season hurt. Bad. But it forced me to level up into a real operator, not just a creative builder. I still believe in trust and collaboration. Now it’s built on structure that protects everyone",

So while we had some early engineers who never communicated the limitations of our MVP, our FTE engineers could not clearly articulate the extent of the problem - even though they knew. That made it hard for me to assess the depth of the slop (which seemed Grand Canyon deep). I asked a lot of questions because refactoring was taking a long time, and I was finally able to define it. But that took far too long and it was lost time not knowing what I could sell & how to adapt.

NO PROGRESS TRACKING. \n\nFounder would randomly pull ideas out of thin air, the rest of the team would simply agree because there's no choice and there was zero space to question it because there were no co-founders / technical leadership...\n\nI'd build some whole fucking end-end feature and the very next day the idea would be scrapped for a completely different one... RINSE AND REPEAT FOR WHOLE FUCKING 2 YEARS.  \n  \nWhen I finally put in my notice, I was forced to work six days a week to \"Wrap things up\". \n\nThat just pushed me deeper into burnout.\n\nMONEY WISE???\n\n35k/pm... 25k (ESOPS) But no proper documentation, nothing on paper. I was handling the entire platform and cloud infrastructure (migrated 3-4 times too because of low credits) and then in a meeting founder casually said my pay was \"more than someone from --native-- place\"\n\nTHAT FUCKING SHIT PISSED ME OFF BEYOND WORDS...\n\nAnd what founder does is during the work time watch some fucking random YT Shorts most of the time....\n\nHere's the part I really want founders to hear: \n\nIf you're broke, say you're broke.  \nIf the company is struggling, say it clearly.  \nIf long hours and burnout are part of the deal, be fucking honest about it.\n\nEarly engineers aren't stupid, we can handle hard truths. What we can't handle is fake optimism, moving goalposts and pretending everything is fine while squeezing people dry.\n\nI worked wholeheartedly on the product, sacrificed time, energy, mental health and in return... Burnout was the only fucking award I got...\n\nSorry if I made any wrong statements...",

In those cases, a lot of time, money, and energy are burned with very little to show for it.\n\nChaos can actually be useful early on. Ideas and teams transform quickly, and that often only happens in a chaotic environment. But the key is that chaos has to be controlled. Very often, the push for structure comes from the bottom, with people asking for basic processes to normalize the work. Leadership doesn't always see immediate value in that and stays in chaos longer than it should.\n\nI agree with you that it's still a valuable experience. The most important part is recognizing it for what it was and taking the lessons forward.",

Top AI experts get salaries of $500k+ and getting them to work for you can be worth 5M+ per employee. So just a good team of 20 experts, who will now all work for Nvidia, can be worth $100M.\n\n\n * They might be good at selling. Enterprise sales is hard, mastering it is a skill and building an effective sales team is valuable. Your product needs to be only half as good if you are a great at selling.\n\n\n * Maybe they had lots of revenue already. For sure they still had a high multiple but if they had $XXM of revenue already with a steep growth curve then obviously the company is worth a lot.\n\n\n * They could have had an internal champion that pushed the acquisition inside Nvidia. Additionally that person might have benefitted from the sale - an easy $50M is life-changing for everyone. I am not saying it happened here but these things happen.\n\n\n * There could have been an external champion, maybe the CEO of Nvidia is on good terms with one of the investors of 12AI and the investor spoke highly of them.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of non-technical reasons for a high valuation, many of which are probably hard to replicate for the average wantrepreneur on this sub. It's about a lot more than just \"build the features\".\n\n\nAlso tech companies follow the power law so just achieving 10% of what they built doesn't net you 10% of their financial outcome but probably something close to $0.",

This means the company has proprietary model architectures and research that complement NVIDIA’s compute platforms.\n  - Highly Specialized Talent Pool. AI21 employs roughly 200 researchers and engineers, many with advanced degrees and specialized expertise in AI research and development. This kind of Senior AI researchers with deep expertise are scarce and difficult to recruit organically.\n- By acquiring AI21 Labs, NVIDIA accelerates its research and development capacities and gains strategic advantages against direct competitors on the software and services side.\n  - They are buying the ability to more tightly couple hardware, software, and model development.\n  - Their GPUs already power many of the AI models, but owning the software stack and model expertise enables broader control of the AI industry.\n- NVIDIA’s acquisition strategy is focused on locking-in talent and innovation sources to dominate the future of AI.\n\n> People continue to rave about amazing AI coding tools are, why aren't people building tools like these to make big bucks in this space?\n\n- Because they lack the highly specialized skills and tools needed for AI scientific and technological research and development. \n- You don’t substitute 200 top scientists in the field with comercial LLMs and hope to generate highly valuable innovations that drive AI even further. So no, those highly hyped AI tools are not capable of substituting human talent yet.\n- You need access to great amounts of compute hardware to innovate in this field and it is expensive.\n\n> Tell me why is it fundamentally a bad idea to spend time and energy to replicate software that a12labs made called maestro using claude code.\n- As told already, NVIDIA bought a valuable company, their intellectual property, expertise and human talent, not just “a software” but all they have done and all they will do in the future.\n- You and Claude code won’t be able to replicate AI21 Labs and I don’t think there are many companies of NVIDIA size and interests to buy it.\n\n\n> with hopes of making 20% what they make. This is more than enough for me to retire and build generational wealth\n- This is beyond laughable. For most of the people alive in the world even 100x less that that: 0.2% (6M) would be considered enough for retirement and generational wealth. I’m glad that you only want 20% (600M).

A smaller context with the right information rather than a large context with the right information present amongst wrong information yields higher accuracy.\n\nHaving a library of prebuilt architecture of workflows would improve accuracy. E.g. here a good template to follow for this task, adjust as appropriate. A more densely populated library of templates means less thinking is done by the AI.\n\nI am not in this space, but these are just ideas I have around improving accuracy. There will be a whole myriad of approaches where the more help you implement the more accurate the results will be. It’s a lot of work to make all these and then benchmark them and tune them so the right tools and approaches are used at the right time.\n\nEssentially it takes not much work to make an llm/AI/agent tool work at the demo level. To make it work at an accurate level gets incrementally harder and harder.\n\nEdit: Here is a nice blog post about the backend system they wrote to achieve higher accuracy then standard RAG: https://www.ai21.com/blog/structured-rag-enterprise-accuracy/\n\nEssentially deriving a scheme for the information (not sure if this done on the fly or via a long list of templates) then storing in the an SQL database to then be able to more traditional queries on it. Building such a system is complex and I suspect they have many such systems in place.\n\nIt also has a nice bog in how they use parallel flows for the same problem and then assess which is working.",

I did weekly dev logs on Twitter showing real metrics and actual problems I was solving, not just polished product pitches. Demo videos of workflow improvements got way more traction than marketing content. I even open-sourced some non-core parts of my stack which got attention from devs who became early advocates.\n\n\n\nPartnership channels are super underrated. Other SaaS tools in your ecosystem (integrations, not competitors), agencies who recommend tools to clients, and implementation partners who need specific workflows. For Shopify apps specifically, the partner community and Editions releases were goldmines.\n\n\n\nThe ratio that worked: 80% genuinely helping people, 20% casually mentioning \"oh I built something for this.\"\n\n\n\nYou're right about cold email not scaling for big audiences.

People searching for solutions find those answers years later. With our clients doing early user acquisition the founders who spent an hour daily being genuinely helpful in communities where their ICP hangs out consistently outperformed those running small ad budgets.\n\nNewsletter sponsorships in hyper-niche publications are cheaper than you'd expect and convert surprisingly well. A newsletter with 5k subscribers in your exact vertical beats 50k generic eyeballs. Find the newsletters your target users actually read and reach out directly to the writer rather than going through ad platforms.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that most early users come from doing things that don't scale. Direct outreach to people you've genuinely helped, asking early users for introductions, being present in the three or four places your ICP actually pays attention. The \"underrated channel\" most people skip is just being relentlessly consistent in one place rather than spreading thin across everything.",

With a high risk of failure.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just saying that you will do better if you take a step back, focus on finding out what's local to you, and get that one person that you can work with as a first client. Then you build on that. You expand your network through that. You establish the business. You bring in clients to that business.

When I launched my first app it was a nightmare trying to get any traction especially since I'm more of a builder than a promoter.\n\n  \nReddit can actually be a goldmine for connecting with founders specially if you know where to look. Lots of startup founders and CTOs hang out in the smaller more niche subreddits related to DevOps or specific technologies. Its less about blasting your services and more about genuinely participating in the discussions offering advice where you can and building relationships. Those connections can turn into leads down the line.\n\n  \nWhat I wished I had back then is a tool that would find those relevant conversations for me it took me hours to search through every sub related to my app to find places I can chime in. Which is kinda what led me to build my project it finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn.\n\n  \nIf you think finding those conversations would help you out let me know I'd be happy to let you try it.",

And never forget your existing network. Ask everyone for warm intros, and at some point, if your service is good, people will start recommending.",

After 5 months live, here are our stats: $30K MRR, 10% CAC, $1044 LTV, 5% true churn (seasonally and product cycle adjusted), 350+ customers, 10-year $100M ARR ceiling, 1 large corporate partnership, government interest. We have a strong roadmap to $100K MRR within the next 6 months.  We are 3 founders, all with strong resumes. 1 founder has worked for Tim Cook, led the Auth0 exit to Okta and was a data lead for the Artemis II lunar project. Another has led two successful exits and has extensive front-end experience. I am leading the sales & marketing and have built a network of 4M target niche leads.  We have just hired our first employee.\n\n***Here is the meat and potatos of it all***. Recruiters from various organizations (SXSW Pitch, a16z, YC, NEXT AI, Vector, ISED, TechStars, etc) have reached out to us requesting that we apply for their event / accelerator / incubator. We fill out the requested applications, build strong custom pitch decks, tell a compelling story and ship our good numbers to them in our application. Heck, we have even had some big players sponsor us to apply.\n\nAnd every single time - rejected. In fact, one rejected yesterday. \"Thank you for your application. We are thoroughly impressed with your company's growth and trajectory, but unfortunately ...\".  (This was SXSW and we received our sponsorship to apply from Paddle/ProfitWell).  I am fine with it, if anything it strengthens our resolve. I can handle the rejection well. The primary issue is that I have no idea what I am doing wrong? I don't know how to course correct because I don't know where we are dropping the ball. I am sure that I am not presenting well, or perhaps the timing is wrong ... I don't know. But at what point do we just label this as a fruitless paperwork exercise and strictly focus on revenues and customer growth?\n\nIf I get in my own head, I think maybe we are too old (35yo, 35yo, 46yo)?  Maybe our story isn't compelling enough?\n\nFor those of you who got into YC or any other accelerator - did you get feedback on what clinched your entry?",

That could be a bummer to investors if u are in the red but your growth is not \"high\" enough.   \nAlso it could be just the current investor's expectations regarding the AI tech. Some are expecting delusional multipliers regarding growth, ARR, you name it. So it could be that you are just not \"good enough\" according to their view, which it could totally be a wrong point of view.\n  \n\nIf I were you I would try not to obsess with it and would  focus in keep growing. With those numbers (in case you're a bit profitable) you could just keep going.  Don't let them discourage you!\n  \nAt the end of the day the market rules and if you have good paying customers with low churn you will grow.",

If you can't run the business out of a messy spreadsheet for the first month, you're probably over-engineering. It saves a ton of money on wasted dev time. Regarding your international question, I'd look for one specific niche in a smaller market liek the Nordics or Benelux rather than trying to \"go global\" on day one. \n\nAre you currently spending more time on the product features or actually talking to potential users?",

No marketing, no PR, no bss, just talk to prospective users and see what they would pay for \n- do not hire a seasoned strategy consultant since the only thing they know how to do well is bullshitting and they are going to do so even when you call them off for doing it.

Not that companies were not working on AI before...but ChatGPT really break every rule there is. Before that, I was only concentrated on working and earning and slaving myself. I decide to change all that one night.   \nLesson no. 1 - Be ready to sacrifice everything for your startup. If you cannot do that don't think of a startup.Go all in.\n\nThere is a lack of platforms where startups are encouraged. You cannot fucking advertise yourself on any platform like Reddit for instance. Let's say you made something, I don't care if it is AI #slopware or who build that but lack of self promotion is a very big void in the space. And no one gives a damn to a running ad between two posts. No one clicks that. \n\nEven the damn investor or banks or anyone you go for money all say the same thing - they won't invest in a pre-revenue business. To wit my only answer is if I could make some money, I would not be here begging from you. \n\nLesson no. 2 - You will face a lack of support. Denials, a lot of denials and rejection. \n\nand lesson no. 3 - Always, always spend the money you have wisely. You would be required to take exceptional amount of risks. Because you won't have a lot of it unless you are born with a golden spoon or have generational wealth. \n\nWhat would I do differently? - I think I was not careful with money. So lesson no. 3 I will re read that chapter this year. lol.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

Design experiments to test things by making prospects put skin in the game. “Enter your email to be notified of our launch” is VERY different than pay $1 to be the first to access our product. Validate messaging, does a different CTA cause more or less button clicks? Validate with calendly, make people put skin in the game by spending time. \n\nI feel like I’m rambling at this point. Long story short, there are literally hundreds of micro experiments you can run to validate your business. Some give much more signal than others.

If you're building a simple software app, it's probably a lot easier in many cases to validate your solution. If it's something like a surgical robot, you can't pre-sell it or you will go to jail. So you need to find other methods of validating the market and getting enough signals to know if you've got something that will eventually sell when you're ready. Even for consumer devices, this can be tricky. The Magic Link, which in many ways inspired the iPhone over a decade before its release, seemed to check all of the boxes for the kinds of things people were wanting to do with the internet. And yet, it just couldn't take off. On the other hand, the iPhone had so many detractors, it surprising anybody would have taken a product to market that was being openly ridiculed almost a year before it came out. And yet, 13 million units were sold in the first quarter, giving rise to a brand new product category and trillions of dollars in new market revenue that the so-called experts said had absolutely no demand.",

      "text": "I keep running into a weird paradox and I’m curious how technical founders think about it.\n\nEveryone says ship fast. Get an MVP out. Talk to users. Iterate.\n\nI agree with that. I’m building a consumer product right now and I’m trying to move fast on features and experiments.\n\nBut I come from a marketing and product design background. And I’ve seen, over and over, how brutally sensitive conversion and activation is to “small” stuff (especially in consumer). One headline change. One extra sentence that makes the user feel safe (or even better, one sentence less). Slightly different layout. Less cognitive load. Suddenly signup rate doubles, activation moves, retention looks different. Same product, different packaging.\n\nSo here’s my question.\n\nWhen you ship an MVP fast with rough copy and rough UX, and it converts poorly, what are you actually learning?\n\nAre you learning that the idea is weak, or that you presented it like a confused person at a loud party.\n\nMy suspicion is that a non trivial number of potentially great products died early because the first version looked and felt bad, and the data said “users don’t want this” when the real answer was “users didn’t understand it or trust it enough to try.”\n\nAs a non technical founder, I can obsess over copy and landing pages because that’s my world. But if you’re technical and shipping quickly, how do you avoid that trap without slowing down to a crawl?\n\nSome concrete questions I’d love honest answers to, from technical founders:\n\n* How do you decide what level of UX and copy quality is “good enough” to test the idea fairly?\n* Do you bake in a basic design system and reusable components from day one so everything looks credible, even when the product is incomplete?\n* Do you treat early conversion numbers as mostly noise and focus on qualitative feedback first?\n* Do you have a process where you fix obvious UX issues before you draw conclusions from metrics?\n* How do you separate “bad funnel” from “bad product” when you’re moving fast?\n\nI’m not talking about polishing for months. I’m talking about that minimum viable level of clarity and trust where a user can understand the value, feel safe, and take the next step.\n\nWould love to hear how you handle this in practice. Especially from people who’ve done a lot of rapid prototyping and actually killed or saved products based on early data.",

You get polished by involving potential customers, sitting with them and asking for their feedback. Feedback on messaging and positioning, feedback on UI and UX. I like to think of it more of a draft for iteration and refinement. Once refined, then launch.\n\nEssentially, get close with potential customers to understand them and their unmet need, develop a proposed solution and present it to them. This presentation in early iterations might be simple drawings, or mockups, then maybe you develop what you think is your MVP based on the learnings and feedback. Then get feedback and iterate on the MVP. Finally, with that refinement in hand, launch the MVP to start gathering metrics such as conversion rate and some scale.",

Someone ships something that looks like it was designed by a developer who hates users, gets no signups, and concludes the market doesn't want it. Maybe the market just didn't trust the landing page enough to try.\n\nThe \"good enough\" bar for me is whether the core value prop is clear within 5 seconds of landing on the page. Not polished, not beautiful, just clear. If a stranger can't immediately understand what this does and why they should care, you're testing your copy skills not your product idea.\n\nWith our clients doing rapid validation the approach that works is ugly but clear beats pretty but confusing. A basic landing page with one headline, one sentence of explanation, and one CTA will tell you more than a beautifully designed page where the value prop is buried. Template design systems like Tailwind UI exist specifically so technical founders can ship something credible-looking without spending weeks on design.\n\nThe qualitative versus quantitative split matters here. If your first 50 visitors all bounce without understanding what the product does, that's presentation. If they understand it clearly and still bounce, that's the idea.",

I kept thinking the core technical problem was really hard, so I spent months building a custom system around it. I hired some engineers, failed miserably to find the right engineers, it’s a niche technical skill in AI, wasted time on wrong hires and honestly just ended up me tightening mg sleeves and building it all by myself. (And poorly, lot of bugs)\n\nA few weeks ago I decided I am done fixing these bugs, it’s never ending. (The problem is my product requires very low latency to even verify my MVP. I could not have launched it unless it was functional). I didn’t even reach the phase of fail fast because I really thought I was just a few weeks away, and it’s been months now. I finally tried a different open-source framework that I repurposed… and it basically solves the core problem way better than what I built. It removes a huge chunk of complexity 70% of my codebase and makes everything cleaner and more scalable.\n\nObjectively, this feels RIGHT - as I can finally launch, and do the actual hard part, which is adding value in this world and gaining users. \n\nBut emotionally I feel awful. A big part of the last 5 months of work is basically throwaway, and I keep thinking “how did I not see this sooner?”. Yes hindsight is 20/20, but the cost of getting to December has been high emotionally, and financially. It feels like I lost a lot of time because of my lack of experience in this space. \n\nI know this is on me - some of you will say it’s part of the journey, but to me - it’s been an incredibly painful lesson and I can’t shake the feeling where I have to question my judgement skills or skills of a high efficient CEO if I want to build a 100M startup. And honestly it’s gut wrenching. \n\nTLDR;\n\nSpent 5-6 months building my MVP, living in delusion on the engineering scale. Now realize my entire work is throw away work because of an easier route to launch. Incredibly sad and embarrassed at my utter lack of good decision making skills. ",

I feel you have nothing to regret, now you’ve learned practical lessons on how not to hire, and how to adapt quickly to changing situations without ego things you can’t really learn anywhere else. You’re a great leader and creator. Wishing you all the success 👍👍",
