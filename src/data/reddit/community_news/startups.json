      "text": "Cousin’s fiancée (A) inherited her dad’s insurance book after he passed. One of her clients needed software to replace their Google Sheets operations. She told me about it, which is what kicked off the project. I’m a software dev working full-time, and I’ve since invested hundreds of hours building the entire product solo. 51 database models, optimization algorithms, full backend architecture. Nobody else has written a line of code or put in a dollar. Product isn’t finished yet. I’m splitting time between learning their operations and building on the side.\n\nShe introduced me to the client. Demo went well. My mistake: we never defined terms beforehand.\n\nThen she demanded 50/50 ownership of the entire company. Said she “brought me on” and this was “her company.” I countered with: 50/50 revenue on the client she introduced (lifetime), 20% commission on future clients she brings, and a path to earn 10% equity after closing 5 clients in 12 months with vesting. She rejected it, said it made her feel like a “sales employee,” got emotional on a call, brought up her deceased father, hung up on me, and later said she’d be “spiteful at family events.”\n\nMy cousin then started negotiating on her behalf because he felt “embarrassed” for suggesting she come to me. He pushed equity from 20% down to 10%, framing it as “just voting power.” I proposed a completely different structure: two separate companies, mine owns the software, hers acts as a referral business, commercial agreement between them, no equity. He ignored that and sent me a formal agreement. Keep in mind the original terms changed, this agreement would now be between myself and him as she is too busy with her job and insurance. He’s now stating that he’ll execute her part.\n\nThe agreement includes:\n\n\t∙\t10% equity earn-in over 4 years\n\n\t∙\tAnti-dilution: his 10% can never drop below 10% without his consent. All future dilution (investors etc) comes from MY shares only\n\n\t∙\tTermination: he can only be removed for material breach uncured for 120 DAYS or felony conviction\n\n\t∙\tChange of control: any buyer must honor all his revenue rights forever\n\n\t∙\t50/50 revenue on all clients he sources with no sunset and no defined responsibilities\n\n\t∙\tZero performance obligations anywhere in the document\n\n\t∙\tThe agreement is between me and my cousin, not me and A\n\nHe’s pressuring me to sign saying “there’s no way you don’t agree with this.”\n\nWhat I think is fair: Two separate companies. 50/50 revenue on clients she sources for 24 months per client then it sunsets. Defined responsibilities she must perform to keep the 50% rate (client check-ins, training, support triage, QBRs). Drops to 15% if she stops doing the work. Either party can terminate with 60-90 days notice. No equity at all.\n\nKeep in mind, this client is somehow related to A. She’s essentially gatekeeping this client for leverage. It would be a very meaningful first client. However, my family also has longstanding ties to this client as well, however I don’t plan to go around her whether this deal works out or not.\n\nWhy I’m comfortable walking away: I have 25+ other distribution channels mapped out, a warm intro to another potential client, and a full GTM strategy that doesn’t depend on her. She is the reason I started building, and I respect that. But “they need software” and hundreds of hours of building the solution are very different contributions.\n\nKeep in mind, I’m also pressured to agree because at the end of the day, this is my cousin. They would hold this over me forever. To make matters worse, our weddings are at the end of this year (1 week apart), in the same city.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Would you sign this? ",

Ask them what portion of the $100k should be yours (since you, um, did the actual work). Let’s say you split it 50/50.\n\n* Offer them an opportunity to invest their portion (eg $50k) into your company.  What equity % should they get? This is a classic classic “early stage valuation” problem. The industry has a very standard way of doing this: a SAFE. It defers the valuation question until a later priced round, after the company has made some progress.\n\n* If they bicker, ask them what their expectation of the value of the company at this point is. They’ll be torn: if they make up a tiny number, then clearly their sales intro didn’t add that much value. If they say a huge number, then use that to compute the equity you offer them (again, based on the cash value of their proceeds from the deal they intro’d).\n\n* Inform them of some business basics:\n* sales commissions at the top end are like 10%. Maybe for a “got me off the ground” thing you could flex to 20%. But like, if you (or someone) hadn’t done the work, they could make a million intros and they’d still make $0. They should contemplate intro’ing the opportunity to a brick or a tree, and take 99% of the proceeds lol.\n* finders fees are typically in the 1% range\n* SAFEs are incredibly common for early stage. In fact, not doing a SAFE is weird, and generally only happens when there’s a mature team and mature investors and clear line of sight to multiple years of revenue and well-understood business model etc etc.\n\n\nSource: founder of multi-billion dollar software company",

          "text": "Oof, I'm sorry to hear this. There are some serious problems here, and none of them have anything to do with the arrangement you're trying to make. What I'm about to say may come as a shock, but I'm offering this as constructive criticism, and I hope you see this is a great opportunity for growth.\n\nFirst, based on your description, your cousin's fiancee is a narcissist. She ostensibly did you a favor and then, without any prior agreement, tried to leverage that favor as \"debt\" to be paid back with completely unrealistic payment demands. You, rightly, refused, and in response she tried to manipulate you with pity and then threatened punishment. Classic cluster-B personality disorder behavior, totally unacceptable.\n\nSecond, it's likely your cousin is a narcissist as well. Narcissists tend to attract each other, and he's arguing \"there's no way you don't agree with this\" for an updated offer (demand, really) that is only mildly more agreeable than the first, and still completely unrealistic. You're now living in fear of retribution if you don't go along. Threatening retribution for not agreeing to a business deal you don't want to partake in? That's how the mafia works. It's the complete opposite of loving, caring, and supportive family behavior.\n\nWhich brings me to the third item, you. You said it was your mistake not to arrange terms prior to the introduction. No, from a business perspective you did nothing wrong at all. If she wanted compensation for the introduction, it was *her* responsibility to ask for that in advance. The reason it feels like a mistake has nothing to do with business, and has everything do with family dynamics. You're now in fear of your family because you accepted what reasonably looked like a gracious favor. Your words: \"They would hold this over me forever.\"\n\nIt sounds like narcissism runs in your family, and it also sounds like you're a well-grounded person who's escaped it. (Good for you!) Growing up around narcissism sucks, man, and it's scarring for life. One thing it does is distort your perception of fairness, because you've been taught since childhood (through gaslighting) that it's your fault that other people behave irrationally. As a result you have a completely understandable and natural tendency to over-accommodate, and you've been manipulated to believe that's what's fair. It's good that you're questioning this.\n\nIf I'm right (or even close to right) I'd kindly suggest some self-work and therapy, because it appears you are vulnerable and unaware of your vulnerabilities. Left untreated, situations like this will keep coming up in your life. As someone who didn't figure this out until late in life, I can say it is *really* helpful to learn how to nip this in the bud at a young age.\n\nTurning back to your question, \"Am I being unreasonable?\" The answer is unfortunately yes, but not in the way you think. It's completely unreasonable for you to consider this business arrangement, and to consider going into business with these people. The fact that you are wavering demonstrates that you have diminished boundary setting abilities, no doubt due to a lifetime of exposure to emotionally abusive role models. \n\nI have the utmost compassion for you, the situation you're in, and how difficult it appears to navigate. You have the full support of this Internet stranger (and many others like me, it appears) in telling these people to go pound sand. You've been more than fair, *too* fair.\n\nI wish all the fortitude necessary to withstand the retribution you're being threatened with. Good luck!",

You own the software, full stop. She creates a distribution and sales company. She owns the client relationships. You negotiate rates between the two companies. She sells it for whatever she can get. Think of it as - you’re her Microsoft, she’s your reseller. No equity exchanged, no ownership drama.\n\nThat said, the real problem here isn’t her. It’s your cousin inserting himself as a negotiator and the agreement now being between you and him instead of her. That’s where this gets messy.

This isn’t a normal startup deal—it’s a permanent control/economics grab for a single introduction with zero obligations, and the “family pressure” plus threats about being spiteful is a giant red flag. Equity is for IP, capital, or ongoing execution under vesting and clear duties; a referral gets a referral structure. The terms they sent are objectively toxic: anti-dilution that forces all dilution onto you, near-irreversible termination, change-of-control obligations that follow any buyer forever, 50/50 revenue with no sunset and no defined responsibilities, and it’s not even with the right party (it’s between you and your cousin). That combination will poison fundraising, hiring, and any exit, and it turns your company into a hostage situation.\n\nThe clean move is: don’t sign, and don’t “tweak” this document—reset to a referral/reseller agreement or walk. Your proposed structure is standard: separate companies, generous revenue share on sourced clients with a 24-month sunset per client, defined responsibilities to keep the top rate (and a step-down if they stop doing the work), and either party can terminate with 60–90 days notice—no equity, no anti-dilution, no change-of-control baggage. Send one final take-it-or-leave-it offer in that form; if they refuse, let the client go and execute your other channels. Short-term family discomfort beats long-term business handcuffs, and signing under pressure just guarantees future resentment and conflict anyway.",

They basically see you have a mini gold mine on your hands for growth potential and want to piggy back off your hard work.  20% lifetime residual is more than fair. I recently finalized an agreement with a new start up that developed a lead platform for commercial trucking insurance agencies. The offer is 30% on all clients until\nI hit 10k MRR then drops to 20%.  And it’s for lifetime residuals regardless if I stay long term or quit or released.  All I’m doing is onboarding agencies to sign on. I have 15+ years exp in the trucking space so I have all the contacts.  They’re doing all the updates and customer service.  This to me was more than fair as I know once signed up- very little hand holding afterwards. I just invoice what’s owed to me. Sounds to me this is the similar role she was trying to put herself in.  But being a lot more aggressive and having unreal demands.  Like others suggested- walk away entirely from her.  No matter what you agree too even if favorable to you; it will not end well. There will be resentment on her part and who knows what that can boil up to.  She just wants her ego fed.  She wants the title of “company owner” or “cofounder”.  If the product is that good just promote yourself or hire an experienced salesperson to pitch it.",

You’re talking about paying this person forever and having to listen to what they think/say/want. You don’t agree now, that won’t change. Do NOT get into an enduring business relationship with them.  If you must, send them a generous commission check and a 1099 to document the expense off of the initial contract. The rest and any ongoing relationship with the client is yours. And, for sure, any “revenue split” (still a bad idea) should occur after you’ve recouped your expenses and time and should not be based on the gross revenue.\n\nMaybe demand a revenue split and minor equity in A’s insurance business for you to sign up with them as your insurance agent and for any clients you may send her way. See if she would agree to a similar arrangement.\n\n\nFor an early business startup a lot of your clients will come in via personal connections and referrals.

If there’s someone who knows how to build out a sales pipeline, then you let them help you build\nIt out. (My comment has nothing against anything that you’ve said - I’m simply giving you a blunt perspective to reflect upon from my own experience.)\n\nIf this is your first business, it may be worth while to give up a bit more to gain experience. Programming and product design are only one of many skill sets required to run a business. (Again, I’ve learned the hard way.)\n\nNow I’d rather bring in people who can add value in areas that I struggle with. It means less for me but I build out a team, a team of people who I can leverage to build future businesses, products or services with.\n\nPut aside the inexperience of yourself and your cousins, try and collaborate and think together about what’s needed to make this business grow. People can get petty when they are inexperienced in business and fail to see the bigger picture. First businesses tend to be learning experiences - the chance of hitting it big on your first go is rare, and more often people fail and go back to work or fail multiple times and give up. Each failure brings experience (or it should at least…) giving you an education which is difficult to obtain by going to school. (School can help no doubt, MBA’s exist for a reason.)\n\nI do agree that it seems there’s immaturity in your cousins and it may be best long term to not continue ventures with them but I’ll play devils advocate.\n\nBest of luck.",

SMB insurance has a big enough TAM and you’ve somewhat begun to validate your solution.\n3) she copies your solution by paying someone else to build it for her and you compete against her.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality: software is getting commoditized fast. With AI tooling, rebuilding what you described isn’t a multi-year moat anymore (of course I don’t know what you actually built). In vertical SMB markets, distribution and trusted relationships can be more defensible than the code itself.\n\nIf you believe you can own GTM and build that distribution independently, cut bait and don’t mix business with family.

      "text": "About me: I currently work as a technical lead, with 10+ years experience in the industry. I consider my salary decent / at the market rate for the area (100k+). I've been offered an opportunity to leave this all behind, and work as a \"founder engineer\" at a seeded startup.\n\nAbout the role: The company has a VC-backed seed, valuing it at an impressive \\~3M. The company only has 2 founding employees at present and has been running for about 2 years now. It's just about profitable, given the founders are taking a low salary, but they ambitiously project high revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nCompensation is very much up for negotiation at present, but essentially the founders want to offer me \"approximately my current salary, with as much as I'm comfortable with taking as stock options\". So as an example, it could be about 60k + 1.5% equity, vesting over 4 years.\n\nI'm curious to hear thoughts on whether this is something to consider, whether I should counter-offer, and whether there are any key considerations I should take into account.\n\nMy main concern with the offer is: Would I be burdening a disproportionate/unreasonable risk (especially compared to the founders)? Such an opportunity is always going to be high-risk, high-reward, but what might be an acceptable level of risk/reward for someone in my position?",

So expect working many evenings, weekend, little holidays. And big chances it’s for nothing. Make this very clear to the founders, they will not realise it. \n\nYou’re in essence investing 40k/year + a lot of free time in that company, are you getting that out of it?

They’ e got 2 years in, for which they have taken salaries and equity. The salaries were presumably funded by the equity investment. The rest of their comp is in equity. Presumably they would expect as much effort and productivity from you moving forward as from them. I’d push for (26.4% total) 8.8% per year for 3 years as that is what they have already valued their work per year at.  This should vest with the first 4.4% immediately. And 2.2% per quarter for the following 3years. If they terminate you, you keep the equity earned. If you leave, you give up 2/3 of the equity earned. No deadline on when you exercise any options. You have right to maintain percent by buying options at levels equivalent to any valuation during any future money raise even if terminated. Any dilution from equity issue should be subject to same dilution/mitigation as the two founders.",

Every SaaS runs on AWS or GCP. Every payment startup runs on Stripe. Nobody calls Shopify a Stripe wrapper.\n\n  \nThe reason most wrapper startups died is they were literally just reskinned API access. The model was the product. When OpenAI made ChatGPT better, the wrapper became pointless. That is a real pattern and it will repeat.\n\n  \nBut agent platforms are doing something slightly different. The value proposition is not access to the model, it is the orchestration layer. Managing context across files, handling errors, running multi-step workflows, keeping state between sessions. That stuff is genuinely hard and the model providers have zero incentive to solve it for every niche use case.\n\n  \nThe ones that will die are the ones where the whole pitch is we put Claude in a browser tab. The ones that might survive are the ones building real workflow tools where the model is an ingredient, not the product.\n\n  \nSame pattern as mobile apps in 2010. Thousands of flashlight apps died. The ones that solved real workflow problems on top of the phone hardware became actual businesses.\n\n  \nSo yeah, some of these are wrappers 2.0. But not all of them.

If the answer is no, you are a wrapper with extra steps.\n\nThat said, there ARE legit agent companies building real infrastructure. Retrieval, memory, tool use, multi-step reasoning with guardrails. The problem is the noise-to-signal ratio is terrible right now, so investors and customers cannot tell the difference.\n\nBiggest tell: if their \"agent\" needs you to write a detailed prompt every time, it is not an agent. It is a chatbot with a fancy landing page.",

We have been able to reach out to our customers through cold calling/emailing, through linkedin etc but we noticed that with the founders have semi-active or active social media, it serves as a good social proof in general.\n\nRecently, one of the founders shared all the insights about the products we have been building and also created a small achievement post, it impacted positively in general for the product, we could see more views and clicks. We did not have immediate conversion but now few more people know about us and next time we are on their feed, they will see the name being familiar.\n\nEven when posting as a founder, know that you don't always have to talk about wins of certain product. People connect for fun posts, for posts where you share what you have learnt as an individual, they connect when you talk issues you had to face (they might be facing similar). \n\nSo while you might not see immediate conversion, it certainly would help create a trust layer and good network!\n\n",

But you can still grow a business by cold outreaches or running paid ads.\n\nYou don't need to be present in social media, but it has undeniable advantages as long as you don't do something stupid that leads to a shitstorm against you.\n\nEdit:\nI wanna add something to this, Alex Hormozi held an Interview once where he got asked about this topic. Among other things, he made an example to ask the room how many of him knew him for 1 year, 2 years and 5 years before they bought something from him. 99% raised their hands at 5 years.\n\nA social presents allows you to convert leads into customers slowly over several years. There is a certain level of trust, that is needed for many people to buy bigger things, authenticity over a long time horizon is pretty much the only thing that can build this level of trust.\n\nI bought from Alex Hormozi something for 5500€, at that time that was roughly 1/3 of my net worth and I never felt bad about spending that money. But you don't get those kind of sales if the person only knows you since 12 months, the trust is not there yet.",

Some founders batch content once or twice a week and spend the rest of the time engaging only in relevant conversations.\n\nThe key question is less “should founders be on social media” and more “is this the most direct path to reaching our first 50 to 100 real users?” If the answer is no, the time is often better spent elsewhere.

(ex. people are scrolling though your app but not clicking. you can try to improve icon/screenshots/title/subtitle. people don't even see your app: keywords and text may help you on that)\n\n\\- for a reason to create another app is more if you have some opportunity to chase AND if you can leverage and improve upon your previous app, not just about developing fast. if you first app didn't sell anything but you have an idea on how to do it. try a second. if the second didn't reach the 100 sales but you learned something and know how to improve. you go for the next app.\n\n\\- one last thing. you already have 8 apps. from my point of view you have a lot of space to work on. for me feels easy to try to create one screenshot for one, add one content into another then to create an entire app and go through all these apps from 0 again.",

I've shipped maybe a dozen AI tools over the past year and a half -- some worked, some flopped. The ones that flopped weren't because I lacked theory. They flopped because I skipped the few hours of structured thinking that would've told me I was building something nobody actually needed.\n\nAnonJian's point is underrated here. \"Learning by doing\" has become this romanticized thing in startup culture where people skip reading, skip talking to users, skip thinking and just build. Then they call the inevitable failure \"a learning experience.\" It is one, but it's an expensive one you could've avoided.\n\nWhat I've found works: theory is useful in small doses, at the right moment. You don't need a course on product strategy before you start. But you do need time of structured questions before you write your first line of code: Who is this for, specifically? What's the one problem? What's the smallest version I can test?\n\nThat tiny bit of structure before doing is what separates \"I learned something\" from \"I wasted 3 months learning I should've talked to people first.\"\n\nSo I'd say: learn by doing, absolutely.

Tracks leads, follow-ups, tasks, all the essentials without the learning curve of a proper CRM.\n\nSalesforce is def a tank lol.

      "text": "I’ve learned there are two very different games people call starting a company, and mixing them up gets expensive.\n\nI think the real question is: what kind of founder are you. Are you a builder, the person who needs to ship, test, iterate, and let the market punch the idea into shape. Or are you a persuader, the person who can pull people in, sell the vision, recruit talent, and convince investors, partners, even early customers to take a bet.\n\nNeither is better. Both can win. But they win with different strategies, and FOMO makes a lot of founders copy a playbook that doesn’t match them.\n\nA venture style startup is built for speed. Fundraising is not building a business, it’s financing acceleration. It only works when you already have something that can actually scale. If you’re mainly a persuader, fundraising can feel like progress because it rewards storytelling and confidence. If you’re mainly a builder, fundraising can feel like a distraction because it pulls you into a parallel job that doesn’t automatically make the product valuable.\n\nIn my first startup we raised successfully from SkyDeck Berkeley, Techstars, and Sequoia. From the outside it looked like we were “winning.” Inside, we had a brutal problem: there wasn’t enough real pull from the market. Not enough paying customers, not a sustainable model. Money didn’t fix that. It just increased the noise, the pressure, and the burn while we were still searching for the truth.\n\nThat experience taught me something simple and uncomfortable: investor money isn’t your money. It’s borrowed time and borrowed trust. Treating it like personal cash is one of the most common founder mistakes I’ve seen, and it’s easy to fall into because the world celebrates rounds like trophies. They’re not trophies. They’re promises.\n\nWe eventually decided to return the funds, because we realized we had raised to scale before we had something worth scaling. My view is now: raise only when you have clear evidence of a sustainable engine and your real constraint is time, not uncertainty. Capital is great for doing more of what already works, faster. It’s terrible for finding what works in the first place.\n\nThat’s why I still think bootstrapping is the healthiest default for most founders, especially builders. It forces you to create value first, listen to the market, and earn revenue because customers actually want what you built. If you can grow on cash flow, you’ve proven the hardest part. Then, if you hit a point where the only thing holding you back is speed, not fundamentals, outside investment can make sense.\n\nNeither path is morally superior, but each has classic traps. With fundraising, founders start confusing activity and spending with progress, and they start believing the hype around their own story. With bootstrapping, founders sometimes hide behind building and avoid distribution, pricing, and the uncomfortable reality of selling.\n\nSo I’m curious. How do you personally decide when it’s time to raise versus staying scrappy until the model is undeniable, and do you think your choice matches who you are as a founder, builder or persuader, or is it just FOMO talking.",

They'll ship for 12+ months on savings, accumulate free users, and tell themselves traction equals validation. It doesn't. Usage without willingness to pay is just self-funded burn with extra steps. You end up in the same spot as a premature raise, except the money you burned was yours.\n\nThe fix is unglamorous. Charge something before the product feels ready. Five paying customers at $50/mo tells you more than 500 free signups. Bootstrapping only works as a forcing function if you let revenue be the signal... otherwise you're just avoiding the market test while calling it discipline.",

But even then, the best founders raise *after* they have proof-of-work: LOIs, pilots converting, a metric moving from week to week.\n\nCurious: what kind of company are you building (B2B/B2C) and what is your current distribution plan (one channel you think could work)?",

Once you nail that, it will become obvious where they are and where they need to be. \n\nLet's go one by one of the channels you mentioned: \n\n1. Facebook. \n\nPaid Ads - these can be very expensive depending on the niche you're in. Generally this is one of the best ways to acquire customers, but huge downsides are that you need a hefty upfront investment. Meta Ads usually take a while before they start working since the algorithm needs to find the right customers for you. It generally takes the system from two to four months to learn who wants to buy from you, but that's just ballpark, it depends on a plethora of factors. \n\nFacebook Groups - answer questions, build relationships, promote after all that. This takes a lot of time, but it's the best if you don't want to spend money on ads. \n\n2. IG \n\nGreat for viral growth, but your content creation skills need to be exceptional. This takes time to master. Most accounts you see on your feed have been creating for years before you had found them. \n\nUGC is also amazing for certain niches. If you're posting on Instagram, you might want to post on TikTok as well. \n\n3. Reddit \n\nSame as Facebook Groups. One of the best ways to grow your brand by recruiting people one by one. This is good not only because it doesn't cost anything, but also because you talk to your customers one on one. It's easy to get feedback that way and improve your product. \n\n  \nFeel free to share more about your business, so we can offer some specific advice. ",

          "text": "Congrats on launching, that is honestly the hardest part.\n\nIf your goal is quick feedback from real users, platforms behave very differently.\n\nLinkedIn is good for visibility but not great for testing unless your network matches your target users. Instagram and Facebook mostly work for visual consumer apps. X can work for tech audiences but it is tough without an existing following.\n\nReddit can actually be one of the best places for early adopters, but only if you do not treat it like promotion. Launch posts alone rarely convert well. Most installs usually come from participating in discussions where people already have the problem your app solves. It also helps with long term consistent organic growth, and SEO rankings.\n\nFrom what I have seen working with a few apps and SaaS tools, the best results come from:\n\n• Answering “how do I solve this” type questions  \n• People complaining about current tools  \n• Advice seeking threads  \n• Smaller niche communities instead of huge subs\n\nOne product I worked with moved from Top 10 to Top 3 in Reddit search results in their niche, and their mentions even started showing up in Reddit’s AI answers. I have also seen posts cross 10k plus views in a few hours when the targeting is right, but views alone do not guarantee users, engagement and real trust building based discussion does.\n\nPaid ads can work, but early on they often bring low quality feedback unless targeting is extremely tight. Organic communities usually give much better insights because people actually care.\n\nIf you are comfortable sharing what your app does, I can suggest places that tend to bring early adopters quickly.",

A durable moat usually doesn’t exist yet, what investors are really evaluating is whether the conditions to build one later are present.\n\nEarly investors often proxy “moat” through founder quality, execution speed, and insight into a problem space. The assumption is that the initial idea will change anyway, so a static competitive defense matters less than whether the team can iterate into an advantage before competitors catch up.\n\nIn practice, the disagreement you heard is mostly semantic. Some investors want to see an explicit defensibility story early, while others believe a moat emerges from distribution, data, or execution over time. The real question is whether the company is moving toward something defensible, not whether it already has one.",

That almost never works early on because you’re paying for reach you can’t convert yet. What works better on a tight budget is getting smaller creators who actually use your product to post about it consistently. 10-20 creators talking about you regularly will outperform one big influencer post every single time and the effect compounds over time.\n\nThe timing question is less about stage and more about whether people actually like what you’re building. You said decent feedback and steady growth, that’s enough. You don’t need everything perfectly locked in to start. The real risk isn’t starting too early, it’s overpaying for the wrong creator and then writing off the whole channel based on one bad experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

In my case that meant finding bookkeepers who were drowning in month-end work that week, not bookkeepers who theoretically agreed that month-end was annoying.\n\nThe other thing worth checking - are you selling to the person who has the problem, or the person who approves the budget? They're often different people and you can get stuck in \"this is cool\" loops with the wrong one. The person who feels the pain will fight internally to get your thing approved. The person who just thinks it's neat won't bother.",

I think focusing on the right kind of outreach can make a huge difference For my first app (educational audiobooks) I found Reddit to be a goldmine. Ads never really worked for me but showing up organically in relevant subreddits answering questions and mentioning my app when it fit the conversation did. People on Reddit especially in niche communities can be really passionate and become loyal users. The problem was finding those relevant conversations. I was using F5 bot and it was a massive time sink going through endless notifications. It became obvious that my app could only grow as much as I scaled community engagement something that wasnt scalable So I ended up building an internal tool to solve that problem now its my main project. It automatically finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn. Its designed to surface the posts where your product is actually relevant not just based on keywords. This means you can jump into discussions where you can genuinely help people and maybe even find some paying customers in the process. Its what led me to your post actually! If you think something like that could help you cut through the noise and focus on the right conversations let me know. It may make community engagment less tiresome",

You're solving the right problem but for the wrong buyer.** Sometimes the person who says \"cool\" isn't the one feeling the pain daily. The decision-maker and the pain-feeler are often different people. Worth mapping out: who actually suffers from this problem vs. who you've been reaching out to.\n\n**3. Your positioning is too broad.** \"Simple enough for seniors\" is a UX achievement, but it might also signal that you haven't narrowed down who this is specifically for. When a product is for \"everyone,\" it's urgent for no one. Try describing your user in one sentence with a specific role, a specific context, and a specific frustration. If you can't, that's the thing to fix first.\n\nFor the next 30 days, I'd pick one: either validate your positioning (are you describing the right problem?), your targeting (are you reaching the right people?), or your timing (are you catching them when they actually feel the pain?). Trying to fix all three at once is what keeps founders stuck in the loop you described.\n\nWhat does your current outreach message look like?

Instead of tweaking messaging, go back to customer interviews and ask people what they're currently doing to solve this problem and how much time/money it costs them - if they're not already spending significant resources on workarounds, your solution might be solving a \"nice to have\" instead of a \"must have.\" We use Brew for our email outreach and the biggest lesson has been that timing matters more than perfect messaging - catching people right when they're actively frustrated with their current solution.",

So I built something that connects to their Google Business Profile, pulls in reviews, and uses AI to generate on-brand replies they can approve and publish in one click. Automation rules, analytics, Stripe billing, GDPR compliance for the EU market, the whole thing. It took longer than I expected but the codebase is solid and everything works.\n\nExcept for the part that makes it actually useful. To connect to Google Business Profile you need quota approval from Google for their Management API, and they rejected my request. Turns out you need to own a verified Google Business Profile for 60+ days before they'll even consider granting quota, which is one of those requirements that feels completely reasonable in hindsight but that I only discovered after building the whole product.\n\nSo now I have a production-ready SaaS that can't connect to the one platform it was built for. All the code exists and works, the domain is live, the accounts are all set up, it just needs someone who already has a verified GBP to pick it up and actually launch it. For a local SEO agency or anyone who manages Google Business Profiles for clients, the blocker doesn't even exist.\n\nMy question is really about how to position and sell something in this state. It's pre-revenue, there are no customers, and there's this one real blocker that I'm being upfront about. I've been looking at Acquire and Flippa but I'm not sure if those are the right places for something like this or if there's a better way to find buyers who would actually see the value in it. Has anyone sold a project in a similar state? Curious how you approached pricing it and where you found buyers.",

      "text": "This journey gave me a lot\n\nWe don’t usually fail because we lack intelligence. We fail because We drift away from reality. The more capable we think we are, the easier it becomes to live inside ideas instead of outcomes.  start operating in models, abstractions, long term frameworks. It feels powerful and visionary. But reality is much simpler and much harsher than that. Reality only responds to traction.\n\nStaying in reality means constantly asking: \n\nwho is paying right now, and why? \n\nNot who “will” pay when the system is complete. \n\nNot who “should” care once they understand the vision.\n\nNot who intellectually agrees. \n\nWho is transferring money, changing behavior, or committing time today? \n\nIf that number is low, your job is not to expand the vision. Your job is to narrow the problem.\n\nReality is brutally specific. It doesn’t reward layered architectures before demand. It doesn’t reward perfect positioning statements. It doesn’t reward conceptual elegance. It rewards solutions that remove pain immediately. \n\nThe founder who stays grounded obsesses over one friction point and makes it disappear. The founder who drifts builds systems around hypothetical scale.\n\nStaying in reality also means separating ego from product. Intelligence can become a trap. You begin to love being right more than being effective. You defend complexity because it reflects depth. But customers don’t pay for depth. They pay for relief. \n\nIf a simpler version works better in the market, reality demands you choose simple even if it bruises your identity.\n\nAnother uncomfortable truth: \n\nbeing busy is not evidence of progress. You can spend months refining infrastructure, strategy decks, security layers, or multi layer expansion plans. It feels productive because it’s hard work. But reality measures progress in retention, revenue, growth, and usage. If those numbers are flat, no amount of sophistication compensates.\n\nStaying in reality requires emotional discipline. Markets move slower than ambition. Adoption is messier than models. Feedback is often underwhelming. \n\nThe temptation is to escape upward into bigger ideas, new verticals, broader systems. But expansion is often avoidance.\n\n The harder move is to stay with the uncomfortable question:-\n\nwhy isn’t this single use case dominating yet?\n\nA grounded founder repeats a simple cycle: \n\nbuild something small, test it in the market, get rejected, adjust, repeat. No grand narrative protects you from this loop. \n\nNo intelligence shortcut bypasses it. You either confront it or you decorate around it.\n\nReality is not anti vision. It’s anti delusion. Vision gives direction. Reality gives correction. \n\nIf you only live in vision, you drift. If you only live in reaction, you shrink. The discipline is holding both dreaming big while measuring brutally.\n\nThe founders who win long term are not necessarily the smartest in the room. They are the ones who refuse to lie to themselves. They don’t inflate traction. They don’t hide behind complexity. They don’t expand before they dominate something small. They face the numbers. They face the silence from customers. They face the hard feedback.\n\nStaying in reality is uncomfortable because it removes fantasy. But it creates power. Because once you see clearly, you can act precisely.\n\n ",

In fact, it’s very similar to **dating**.\n\nPeople often focus on skills, background, religion, money, or resumes—but those things come *later*. The most important thing at the beginning is **alignment**: mindset, values, energy, and work style.\n\nBefore you even look for a co-founder, you need to **understand and present yourself clearly**.\n\nRight now, many posts say *“Looking for a co-founder”* but don’t say **who the person is**. That’s a mistake. You’re asking someone to commit years of their life—possibly for uncertain money—so you need to *sell yourself first*.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n* Who are you?\n* What do you enjoy?\n* How do you work?\n* What kind of lifestyle do you want?\n\nFor example:\n\n* Are you disciplined or spontaneous?\n* Do you work late nights or early mornings?\n* Do you drink/smoke or prefer a clean lifestyle?\n* Are you ambitious and aggressive, or calm and steady?\n* What kind of music, movies, food, or culture do you enjoy?\n\nThese things may sound trivial, but they matter a lot when you’re building something under pressure.\n\nIf two people don’t **vibe**, even the best idea and skill set will eventually break.\n\nAlso, be careful: some people are more interested in **equity** than in **you or the vision**. If you don’t express who you are and what you stand for, you may attract the wrong kind of co-founder.\n\nSo instead of just saying *“I need a co-founder”*, write a post that clearly explains:\n\n* Who you are\n* What you’re building\n* How you think\n* What kind of person you want to work with\n\nIf something resonates, people will naturally reach out. That’s how real co-founder relationships start—not through cold matching, but through **alignment**.\n\nThink of it like dating:  \nFirst, introduce yourself honestly.  \nThen, see who connects.",

Sometimes just being super clear about your vision and what you're looking for in a partner upfront can help filter things.

              "text": "A practical way to “find the niche + ideal buyers” without guessing:\n\n1) Start from a painful workflow (JTBD), not an industry. Write 10 concrete moments like “end of month reporting is due and I’m stuck in spreadsheets”.\n2) For each moment, list 3-5 roles who feel it + where they already hang out (subreddits, Slack/Discord, LinkedIn groups, conferences, newsletters).\n3) Build a lead list of 50 people who match the role AND are already spending time/money on the problem (tools, agencies, contractors, internal headcount).\n4) Run 15-20 short problem interviews. Only ask about the last time it happened: what triggered it, what they tried, what it cost (time, stress, dollars), what they’d pay to make it go away.\n5) Score the niche on: frequency, urgency, reachability, willingness to pay, and “clear buyer” (who has budget).\n6) Pick a wedge: one role + one trigger + one artifact you produce (report, template, checklist, dashboard) and ship that first.\n\nIf you tell me what you’re building + 2-3 candidate user types, I can help you score them quickly.",

One framework that helped us:\n- Marketing = message.\n- Distribution = repeatable path to people with active pain.\n\nWe only started growing when we set a weekly distribution quota (e.g. 30 targeted conversations/posts in channels where ICP already hangs out) and tracked conversion by channel.\n\nIf a channel brought signups but no week-2 retention, we cut it. If it brought fewer signups but high activation, we doubled down.\n\nThat single discipline removed a lot of “busy” marketing work.",
