      "text": "I started my company when I was VERY young and hungry. Now I have 7 people depending on me for their livelihoods, and I've never felt more trapped. Every morning feels like pushing a boulder uphill. There's no one I can turn to and say \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" or \"I'm exhausted\" without it affecting morale or their sense of job security. I have everyone analyzing my personality to see if I'm cut out for it, and I don't care to have all this pressure (I know pressure is a privilege, but I've stopped feeling the passion).\n\nI catch myself being jealous of the stability of those who have a salary (I've never had one). It feels like each month I have no clue what the next month will entail. I resent the company now and the clients. I dream about sending a resignation email TO MYSELF. But if someone took my place I would rather die. My business is like my child and I've put multiple six figures into it.\n\nI KNOW I'm not built for a corporate job. And there ARE parts of what I do that I enjoy - I just can't seem to hold onto them under along with everything else. I know theoretically I have the power to shape this into something I love. I built it, so I should be able to rebuild it, right? But I have no clue how to get from where I am to where I want to be since I've gone so far.\n\nAnyone else been here? Did you figure out how to fall back in love with what you built, or am I just spinning my wheels?",

Idk if your financials support this but if you truly want to get to the next level you need to hire the right guy, which in of itself is very tough to do.

This would not affect morale of your company and employees because you’re saying to everyone “we want to grow this thing!”. Trust me you’re at a fork in the road and I’ve been there, beat down but trust me make this decision to delegate and you open up a whole new world and you’ll also be able to take time to yourself and recharge.

          "text": "Yes 100% been there and felt the exact same way. I think my breaking point was getting to 7 or 8 employees but even 4 was rough too. The answer for me was figuring out how to do some of the work myself and also downsizing so I needed less help. I didn’t want to deal with firing my trusty employees that was the biggest issue but luckily a few of them ended up wanting to move on to different jobs anyway. The final step was I moved to a different state and closed my original office so that took care of another employee or two. Kinda just blamed it on the move and downsizing and they totally understood. \n\nAnyway, it was a long difficult transition but now I just have 2 employees - 1 of them is a salesperson who works remote and basically pays for herself and it’s very part time so no pressure, and the other is my spouse and we share our money so the salary thing doesn’t matter as much. I recognize this is a unique situation and might not be realistic for many businesses but it’s worked out beautifully. \n\nRegardless I think the sentiment of downsizing and doing more of the busy work yourself if possible is relatable. My dad was an entrepreneur and had the same issue but on a much larger scale but he said the same thing about there being a sweet spot when the business was smaller and then it all got messed up when he hired more people and expanded and everyone depending on him etc. \n\nidk your situation and if this is possible but hopefully it helps. \n\nAlso don’t sweat the employees depending on you and maybe needed to let some of them go, it’s just business not personal and in my experience the best thing you can do is give them a huge amount of time to figure out a different job if you do decide to downsize. I gave a couple employees like 3 months notice and they had new jobs secured before I actually wanted them to quit lol",

          "text": "Yes almost everyone feels this at somepoint. You've also said several yellow/red flags of common mistakes. \n\n\nI would highly recommend therapy and or a CEO coach, but first you need a week long vacation minimum where you don't answer any emails or check any work. No your company won't implode in 5 business days, but you will catch weaknesses in your processes.\n\n\nLet me address your yellow flags:\n\"Can't turn to anyone for help\". You absolutely can and should say \"I don't know\" followed by \"but I can help you find the answer\". Leadership is about learning and helping those around, not always already having the right answer.  Also you can find business owners, that are in similar spaces or promote/identify people on the team. I bounce ideas off other business owners, chances are the same problem you haven has happened millions of times before. \n\n\nYou absolutely can say \"I'm exhausted\". Literally you say \"hey guys I'm not feeling hot today so I may be a little slow in my response today\". We are whole human beings. In our weekly status meeting we would start with green yellow red for personal mood you could elaborate, but you didn't have to. \n\n\nyou're not responsible for the emotional state of everyone around you and your not solving for happiness. You shouldn't inflict panic or confusion but you absolutely can say \"Hey team that big job fell through so we are only going to have 10k in the bank at the end of this month, let's try to slow down non essentials\" if you give people more accurate information they can make more accurate decisions. \n\n\nI resented my company at one point. It usually means you're doing to much. I don't know your cost structure but go hire a chief of staff, coo, president etc. Let them run all the average business day to day and only focus where you add unique value. \n\n\n\"If someone took my place I would rather die\" HUGE red flag. You just said \"I don't want to grow and my ego is tied into this\". First at the end of the day this is about a lifestyle and money. There's nothing wrong about being at any size, but if you \"can't\" give up control you are acknowledging you will never scale past your personal bandwidth to make every important decision. I run two companies at the same time I absolutely give up as much work as possible to others. I'm there to inspire and pick strategy. I've already sold companies and lost them I'm at peace with any business.\n\n\n\"My business is like a child and I put six figures into it\" I'm confused is this a net positive venture? have you put in more than you've got out? Is this a viable business or a really expensive hobby? If you got your money out, hour much you put in makes no difference. If it's not cash for positive evaluate why. \n\n\nYes to answer your question I fell back in love my giving up everything I hated doing and dragging my feet on and only do the stuff I love and can add value. Best feeling was coming in when I wanted and leaving when I wanted because I was confident the team had it covered. I also have up control knowing people would do things differently, but it was my job to course correct not gate keep. \n\n\nPractical advise new company policy that every manager has to take off at least 4 days in a row once per quarter. Starting with your self. You need to step away and look at things objectively, and it prevents burnout.",

These things can sometimes overshadow who we really are and what we really should be doing.  I can feel tension in your words and how you dislike the pressure.  What makes matters worse is that you're continuing to work out of obligation.  What I would do is breathe first, remove the obstacles, what if there weren't people depending on me, what if money wasn't an issue, what if I could wake up and do whatever I wanted, what if I started from zero again?  how do you feel? if you don't want to be the CEO without these constraints, then it isn't those things, it's the actual job.  You can also reframe your job, your position, your company, what parts about my job do I still love?  Can I move these things forward and delegate the things I don't love?  If you just absolutely can't find anything that you love, not like, about your job, company, or parts of it, then I would say it might be time to move on.",

          "text": "Reading this, I hear someone whose nervous system has been under sustained responsibility for a long time. Being the person others depend on financially and emotionally activates something very primal. Over time, the work stops being experienced as creative or meaningful and starts being carried as a weight that never really comes off. The trapped feeling you describe often shows up when identity, responsibility, and safety become too tightly bound together. I see this all the time with the people I work with. When the business holds all of that at once, the system rarely gets to rest.  Resentment towards the company and the clients tends to appear when there has been no safe place to express uncertainty or exhaustion. If you’re always required to be the steady one, the honest parts of you get pushed into the background. Over time, that disconnect makes it harder to feel close to the work, even when parts of it are still meaningful.\nMany founders reach this stage because the business has grown beyond the internal structure that originally built it. What worked in the early years can become unsustainable when the stakes are higher and the responsibility wider. That shift often brings confusion rather than clarity, especially when there’s a sense that you should be able to handle it better by now.\n\nChange  is possible, but it usually unfolds once there is more internal safety and less pressure to hold everything together alone. Insight and motivation tend to return after the system feels supported, not before. You’re noticing something very common and real here , and you’re not the only one who reaches this point. Speaking it out loud is often the beginning of a necessary reorganisation, even if the next steps aren’t obvious yet",

It sounds like becoming the \"emotional shock absorber\", risk carrier and decision dumpster for everyone else. And dude, that role drains the joy out of anything, no matter how much you once loved it. Been there...\n\nA big trap a bunch of founders fall into is confusing being CEO with being a \"martyr\". I tell my friends that your team doesn’t actually need you to be invincible. They just need you to be predictable, clear, and definitely have systems in place. Feeling like you can’t say \"I’m tired\" isn’t a personal flaw... it's just a sign that the business depends too much on you.\n\nAnd you know, resenting clients usually is not about passion disappearing either. Most times i'ts a systems problem. When every issue, fire, or request hits your nervous system directly, something is broken either in boundaries, your pricing, your scope, or even delegation. Just try to fix those things once in a while and you'll see it'll bring you instant relief.\n\nMost founders who fantasize about resigning don’t really want out. Deep down they actually can't! They just want relief. And boy, the solution is never  stepping away from the company and much more often stepping away from being the center of everything. If you just try and yourself from day-to-day operations you'll see it'll change the weight of the role massively.\n\nAnd envying salary stability is more normal than people admit. Heck, how many times I wanted to throw everything out of the window?! But you see, employees envy freedom and us founders envy predictability. Both sides are only seeing the upside of the other. The grass is greener...\n\nI don't think that falling back in love with what you built is about motivation or mindset. For me it's more about redesigning the role. Get real honest about the small part of the job you still like to do and then delegate, systemize, or eliminate the rest. If the business can’t survive that, it wasn’t actually sustainable yet.\n\nAnd man, feeling trapped doesn’t mean you failed, even though failing isn't bad at all, it's just another lesson. It just means that your company outgrew the version of you that built it. The next move isn’t quitting. It’s evolving. I'm going through that right now, actually!\n\nKeep it up, man, you’re at the point where hustle stops working and design has to start. PM me if you need to chat!",

This will kill your drive, confidence, and interest in your business. It will make your problems feel insurmountable and the pressure is so great you’d rather stay in bed than figure it out. \n\nWhen your levels are optimized, you actually enjoy the challenge. Struggle and pressure feel good again like it did when you were young and just starting your business. \n\nI’ll tell you something you could do in your business if you feel lost. Just start cleaning it up. Look for messes, chaos, ambiguity, waste, excess, and just starting tidying up. Don’t worry about growth or what’s next. Look at what you have right now and figure out what needs attention. Small stuff from organizing your desktop/inbox, to organizing and painting a mop closet, going over your finances and making sure you’re paying for what you need and nothing more. Look at roles and the org chart to see if it’s still optimal. \n\nIf you spend your time doing Maintence and upkeep on the business, it will run better and be more enjoyable. It will set you up to grab new opportunities when they arrive. \n\nSo that’s my answer. First Work on your health by getting your bloodwork done (use an online men’s clinic btw, primary care won’t help you). Then the follow up is, clean up shop in every way you can.",

While you should not say \"I don't know what I'm doing\", you can bring issues and problems to them so they can help solve them. \n   * They know more than you give them credit for. They know the issues of the businesses and know you are exhausted or burnt out, so stop treating them like they don't.\n   * Meet in an \"all hands\" meeting at least monthly and ask what they see as the top issues and then include them to help solve them. Trying to do it all yourself is not how effective leaders operate.\n* Find and develop a #2. All businesses need a #2 in case you are hit by the proverbial bus. This person will help you which will reduce the pressure on just you as they can share it. Make sure they have skin in the game by offering profit sharing, or some kind of small equity ownership position. \n   * Make sure this is NOT a \"yes person\". Deliberately select someone who has different views or approaches from you. Someone who will stand up and challenge you in private, then come to an agreement and be solidly together in front of the staff.\n   * Over time work to transition authority and key functions to your #2 so you can focus on the business.\n* A saying I learned was that process and planning can set you free. If you're so stressed out then this means you do not have solid planning or robust processes meaning your business is not in your control. \n   * Why is it some businesses run like clockwork, make good profits, and are virtually stress free, while others are chaos and struggle every day?\n   * Process and planning will smooth out your business to take a lot of stress off of you and everyone. \n   * In addition to running smoother, the business will be more efficient, lower expenses, have much better employee morale and customer satisfaction, which all leads to more loyalty and profits.\n* Culture: This maybe should be the top item, but takes the most time and leadership commitment. There is a saying that \"culture beats strategy\" every time. Strategy is great, but in a low performance culture even the best strategy can fail. In a high performance culture even a poor strategy can often succeed.\n   * Develop a high performance culture in your company. This encompasses a lot of the above as it will entail partnering with your employees, trusting them to help identify and provide, then deploy, solutions to the issues facing the business.\n   * Instead of seeing them as someone you have to provide livelihoods for, see them as partners and you are all in this together to win or lose as a team!\n   * There are some great books out there on highly successful companies who thrived because they had a high performance culture, read them and start making this change today.\n\nI could go on, but hopefully this helps!",

It sounds like the old you is standing on the way of the new more powerful you and doesn't let him out. \n\nThe old you has taken too much responsibility for other people's emotions and pain at your own expense. He agreed to things that aren't in your best interests, justifying it with responsibility, but secretly dreading their judgement or disapproval. \n\nAll of this happened because the old you, the younger version of you was conditioned to tolerate certain things you didn't really want to accept, but had to because the alternative was loneliness and disapproval from your parents, teachers, other kids, society and social norms in general.\n\nAnd while the old you felt passionate about the business because it allowed it to run away from the pain, the new you doesn't want to run. He wants to face all the shit you thought was ok but are not really ok. \n\n\n\nHaving no idea what you're doing? Sounds like accepting stories and narratives that you didn't really want to accept but still justified them somehow. Hence the resentment to clients. \n\nFeeling trapped because you feel responsibility for other people's livelihood? But your resentment screams \"it's not your responsibility to carry them if they don't make your business stronger!\"\n\nAnd having no clue how to get to where you want? A clear signal that you know what you have to do, but your mind protects you from all the pain and discomfort the old version of you has gotten into due to his conditioning.\n\n  \nIt sounds like me a few years back, a lot of people I know. You realize the old habits, beliefs, and values keep you chained to serving others in a way that's not beneficial to you or them. \n\nBut you're too scared that others will judge you if you change. That you will be alone (not realizing you already are). That they will hate you and attack you for not doing what they want you to do.\n\n  \nIf I were to give an advice, I'd say just pick one thing that gives you the most disdain and resentment, do nothing and just sit with the feeling. Your mind will tell you what to do. Don't resist it. \n\nYour business is not the end goal, it's your journey to becoming a more powerful version of you. Cut the crap that you know doesn't serve you, feel the pain, don't run away from it, and listen to your mind. It will tell you exactly what you need.",

Not a task you don’t want to do. A real problem. \n\nTake it to your team and say: “I don’t have the answer to this. I need your help figuring it out.”\n\nThis isn’t delegating.

It’s **role overload**. You didn’t just build a business, you slowly became the container for everyone else’s certainty, income, and emotional stability. That’s an impossible position to live in long-term without resentment showing up somewhere.\n\nA few things stand out to me:\n\n* The exhaustion isn’t just from work. It’s from **having nowhere to put doubt**. When you’re the emotional ceiling, even your humanity feels risky to reveal.\n* The jealousy of salaried stability doesn’t mean you want their lives. It usually means your nervous system is tired of unpredictability.\n* Resenting the business and clients is often a sign that **your identity fused with the company too early**. When that happens, every problem feels personal, and every month feels like a referendum on *you*.\n\nThe line about wanting to resign from yourself, and yet not wanting anyone else to take your place, is incredibly telling. That’s not ambivalence; that’s grief. Grief for the version of you who built this with hunger and possibility instead of responsibility and weight.\n\nYou’re right about one thing: you *can* reshape what you built. But most founders get stuck because they try to do that **from inside the same role that’s burning them out**. You can’t redesign the system while you’re still carrying all of it in your body.\n\nFalling back in love with the business usually isn’t about passion first. It’s about:\n\n* narrowing your role to what actually needs *you*,\n* rebuilding internal safety (predictability, boundaries, buffers),\n* and separating your worth from the company’s monthly performance.\n\nThat doesn’t mean abandoning it. It means **outgrowing the version of leadership that got you here**.\n\nSo no, you’re not spinning your wheels. You’re at a very real threshold that a lot of founders hit but few name out loud. The next chapter usually isn’t “quit” or “push harder.” It’s learning how to lead *without disappearing inside what you built*.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. And nothing you wrote sounds like someone who’s done, it sounds like someone who’s been carrying too much, for too long, without a place to put it.",

As the CEO you’re responsible to people - create a safe environment for them to perform, ensuring they have what they need to succeed etc. But you aren’t responsible FOR them- their livelihood, their families, their children etc. Notice where you’re putting pressure on yourself or going into “over responsibility.” Responsibility is one thing, but over responsibility is something else. \n\n\nStart to right size your job and outline the parts that you are great at and parts or people that drain you - because these are real things. Look into hiring a CoS, or more support.\n\nLastly, leading and building a company is a very lonely, demanding and emotionally draining job. It’s important you have an outlet and someone to talk to about your problems and challenges vs internalizing your feelings. The best leaders have people outside and not connected to the business that can offer impartial support focused solely on them. \n\nAnd as a person who has done ayahuasca and all those things, they don’t actually  replace you doing the “inner work” about how you think, feel and relate to your business and to yourself. \n\nHope that helps",

It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

I've found the sweet spot is 5-50 employees - big enough that processes are actually breaking down and someone's job is to worry about it, small enough that the owner still feels the pain directly and can make fast decisions.\n\nCurious what your discovery process looks like now.

I've seen the same thing with customer communication channels.\n\n\n\nBusinesses will say \"We have omnichannel support\" or \"We use AI chatbots\" - and customers tune out immediately. But when you say \"Text us anytime, we respond in under 2 minutes\" - suddenly people lean in.\n\n\n\nThe pattern you've identified isn't just about avoiding buzzwords. It's about starting the conversation where your customer's pain lives, not where your solution lives.\n\n\n\nYour \"before\" pitch answered \"What do you do?\" Your \"after\" pitch answered \"What problem do I have that you fix?\"\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add: the specificity matters too. \"15+ hours/week\" and \"cut that to 2\" are concrete numbers that make it real. Vague promises like \"save time\" or \"increase efficiency\" don't land the same way because people can't visualize them.\n\n\n\nSMBs especially respond to this because they're drowning in vendor pitches all day.

I see this all the time with SMBs - they don't care about the tech stack, they care about getting their weekends back.\n\n\n\nOne thing to add: the communication channel matters as much as the message. A lot of SMB owners are drowning in email but will respond to a text within minutes. If you're doing cold outreach, consider testing SMS vs email with the same value-focused pitch.\n\n\n\nI've seen response rates jump 3-4x just by meeting them where they already are (phone) vs where we want them to be (email/forms).\n\n\n\nYour point about \"show the math\" is crucial. When you can say \"you're spending $2k/month on admin time for X task, I can do it for $500\" - that's a conversation starter, not a sales pitch. The decision basically makes itself.\n\n\n\nFor anyone reading this struggling with the same thing: ask yourself \"what specific task is eating their time?\" not \"what can my tool do?\" The minute you can name the exact pain point, your pitch writes itself.",

I'd heard him ask the same question on a podcast. \n* Had my answer ready. He pushed back on market size. I'd already rehearsed that objection multiple times. \n* He wanted to know \"why you?\" - I knew from his content he values founder-market fit over credentials, so I leaned into that.\n\nHe committed on the call. $50K wired last week.\n\nSame pitch deck. Same me. The only difference was how prepared I was.\n\nWalking into a pitch already knowing how someone thinks, what they care about, and how they communicate changes everything.\n\nAnyone else do this level of research before investor calls?

I oversimplified it especially because I haven't gotten to the second season yet, though I have immensely enjoyed the first.\n\nSynecdoche, New York is my favourite movie of all time, and is a surrealist movie focused on many themes, some of which (in my opinion) are those of existential anxiety, neurotic obsessions with perfection, internal fragmentation, and the importance of every small person as crucial element of the whole of society. In this movie, >!at a certain point, the main character begins writing and rehearsing a play in a gigantic warehouse to be his magnum opus. As time progresses, the play is never finished, but evolves in constantly self-referential ways, with actors hired to play the part of people in the main character's life, and then actors to play the actors themselves, inside a second warehouse within the first. Eventually, the main character even casts someone to play himself in the play and actually gets replaced by another actor (in what many claim to be an allusion to transgenderism). This muddles the line between reality and fiction ever more in a movie which barely has any footing in reality anyway. !< The Rehearsal is sometimes compared to Synecdoche, New York due to this \"actors playing actors\" fact.\n\nI personally find that Synecdoche New York is the closest I've ever seen to Fernando Pessoa's body of work. Fragmentation laid bare. Every feeling that was ever felt and will ever be felt is, in a way, in this movie, because everyone is in this movie, and no one is.",

Got great at it. Raised money. Then realized I had no idea how to sell the actual product to actual customers because I had never studied them with the same intensity.\n\nThe investor pitch is a one-time performance. Customer conversations happen every single day and they compound. Every customer call you walk into unprepared is revenue you left on the table.\n\nWhat I do now before every important customer call: I pull their LinkedIn, their company blog, their recent job postings (tells you what they are investing in), their Glassdoor reviews (tells you what is broken internally), and any podcast appearances. Feed it to Claude and ask it to roleplay as this person pushing back on my product.\n\nThe job postings thing is the real cheat code nobody talks about. If a company is hiring for a role related to what you sell, they have already decided to invest in solving that problem. You are not convincing them they have a problem. You are convincing them your solution is better than hiring someone.\n\nOne customer call where I did this prep resulted in a 6-figure annual contract. They literally said \"it feels like you understand our business better than most people who work here.\" I did. Because I spent 2 hours studying them like they were a final exam.\n\nThe meta lesson: preparation is the most underrated competitive advantage in business. Most people wing it. The ones who don't, win disproportionately.",

          "text": "Great if it worked for you, I would put me off however.\n\nSome background: I'm part of a local investment group, an initiative from a private bank. Think we are around 60 ppl atm. There are days when there are 20-30 pitches scheduled, and we know beforehand what kind of business it is and when they pitch, so we don't have to be there all the time (though of course the bank always makes sure there are at least 5 people for a pitch, and sometimes if you see something interesting you recommend it to the others and they get to pitch a 2nd time). If you want in it's up to you to decide your size: e.g. once I invested 3k while someone else invested 80k in the same business (total was € 125k). Obviously there are different tiers of investors: I'm small potatoes compared to some captains of industry. Which is what makes this actually work: as a small potato I am often quite involved, which sort of reassures the big potatoes. I think it's an awesome concept and the bank does a great job with their recommendations.\n\nAnyway, it's very obvious when someone has tailor made their pitch to score a particular big potato. And I'd say 90% of the time it has the opposite effect. However what is true in my experience, is that investors like to ask the same questions. So being prepared for those is definitely a positive (mine for example is how they see themselves collaborate with other companies).\n\nSee it like going on a date: being too cheesy is a turn off.",

For example a quite old fashioned business wanted to go digital to scale, so I was kept in the loop and could review all design/business decisions, attended ~10 meetings over the course of 1,5 year. Meanwhile big potato will ask me in an informal way/setting how it's going with the project from time to time.\n\nThe upside for me is threefold:  \na/ I can get in these potentially lucrative projects really early without having (to risk too) much capital, i.e. much less than those who these projects are typically presented to first. \n\nb/ I can have a direct impact on the success (think the difference between having access to the significant experience/expertise of 5 small potatoes for free and not having that access).\n\nc/ I have direct access to really big potatoes, with some on a personal level, which opens up all kind of other opportunities.\n\nNow there have been instances where a business of one of the investors (including mine) gets chosen as an external partner/supplier if it makes sense.

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

Second what background have the businesses you’ve bought been in and how did your past or background change or help your experience with these businesses and what exactly is that background?

Are you hunting small marketplaces or just networking in indie communities. Also how do you avoid the garbage like fake MRR screenshots, inflated Stripe revenue, or founders hiding churn.

For me it would be one channel dependence, high refund rate, and support heavy product. Also would love to know what your playbook is post acquisition.

I’ve seen small SaaS deals where the founder is basically the product and once they leave, it collapses. Also how do you handle payment processing and legal structure early on.

Do you focus on customer interviews, product stability, or marketing growth. Also where do you host your ops and legal.

If I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now. Any day off I take is a day I don't get paid. You get the issue.\n\nLast November I started building my first SaaS. Content tool for text-based platforms. Launched it, got some early users, learned a ton. My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\n\nLooking back at the last 4 months? I'm nowhere close.\n\nI'm heavy in tech, 15+ years. I've launched ecom stores before, so I'm not new to building things. But SaaS growth is a different game. It's slow. And I'm impatient.\n\nRight now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground. Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here? Am I being naive thinking I can replace $20k/month in year one? When should I kill my SaaS and move on to something else?\n\nAny advice here is appreciated",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

Raising your rates is such an underused tactic, because all those want-to-bes repeat the \"passive income\" bs because they don't know better.\n\nThere are two paths in your situation and they are not exclusive.\n\n1) Change the terms with your current clients\n\n2) Find better clients\n\n1) I would try to educate them on the benefits of paying a set monthly investment (don't call it retainer) to future-proof your relationship. Tell them you're raising prices 30% for your other clients, but if they agreed to a 12-month contract with a monthly fee, you'd be happy to forego that price increase for them, and only them, because they are such great clients. Blame the change in pricing on your business partner or board or whatever, even if you don't have one.\n\nIf they don't want to commit, raise your rates.\n\n2) Could your clients refer other clients to you? You'd even bump them up into your 'VIP program' for 2 months for free as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOtherwise, go through your list of LinkedIn connections who may be in the market for your service and write to them. You're launching a new service (even if you don't) and thought they may be interested or potentially know someone, and you'd be happy to give a referral fee.\n\nYou could also start posting on LinkedIn, even though it's a slog with the latest changes and takes a long time to get traction.\n\nCold outreach also works. Just learn how to find your ICP with [apollo.io](http://apollo.io) or clay and then use LinkedIn DM, email or call.\n\n\\------------\n\nI've been down a similar road where I bought multiple e-commerce businesses to replace my consulting business, but I should've done it more slowly and not drained the cash cow too fast, and instead raised my rates sooner.",

And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible. But it's exceptionally rare. Don't base your livelihood on an the stars aligning.",

No it's not obvious and you have to do a lot of work to do that. But you're missing the part where if you stop looking at the path of others there is a great path to scaling for a services companies that isn't explored much. Actually, that's my focus right now.\n\nBut in your shoes, you should first try to get fixed price contracts. It will help you get exact clarity on the value you're providing and what you want to do. From there you'll also own any value from any improvements to your processes and IP that you implement. From there focus on creating IP to make yourself faster. Even consider hirin someone to help you. Technically you're still needed but in the process you are productizing your consulting work. Your knowledge and skill is getting documented in your IP. It alo means you can get a lot more value from a junior implementor.\n\nIP that helps you work faster is just as much valid IP as IP that you sell directly to customers. Hell, AWS is more valuable than the store Amazon even though it's start was IP that was just an internal tool.

          "text": "I’m on the same journey, similar circumstances. In my 7th year. Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

          "text": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

SaaS: Theoretically unlimited but currently zero traction.\n\n\n\nHere's the converter question: Which one has a CLEAR path to $100k/month in 12 months?\n\n\n\nConsulting at $21k/mo: Maybe $42k if you double rates or hours. That's it. The ceiling is visible.\n\n\n\nSaaS: If it reaches product-market fit, theoretically $100k+. But you're months/years from knowing IF that's possible.\n\n\n\nTwo choices:\n\n1. Optimize the thing that works: Raise consulting rates to $35k/mo, work less, bank $25k/mo for 24 months. Then burn on SaaS with runway.\n\n2. Bet on SaaS now: Accept $12k/mo for 2 years while building. If it fails, you restart at consulting.\n\n\n\nChoice #1 is mathematically safer for someone with mortgage obligations. You build real runway instead of hoping SaaS catches. Choice #2 is emotionally harder but potentially more valuable.\n\n\n\nYou can't do both. The attempt to do both is what's destroying you.",

The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have < $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook.

      "text": "I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

Kudos for pivoting your approach! 👏",

What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered. Wanting to work and contribute already says everything about you.",

The ghosting pattern you describe is unfortunately common in freelance services, especially when competing globally.\n\nA few things that helped us break through similar walls:\n\n1. Niche down hard. Not \"digital marketing\" but \"LinkedIn content for B2B SaaS founders\". Specificity signals expertise.\n\n2. Show the work upfront. Create case studies, loom videos, or free audits that prove competence before the call. Trust is built before the meeting, not during.\n\n3. Target companies that already hire remote/international talent. Look for \"async-first\" or \"distributed team\" in their job posts.\n\n4. LinkedIn outreach with warmth. We built a tool (ReactIn) specifically because cold outreach was painful. The key is engaging with their content first, then reaching out. Not the other way around.\n\nThe market is hard, but 300/month is achievable with the right positioning. Dont give up. The first yes will change everything.",

It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

          "text": "Hey guys, freelance UK marketer and solo agency owner here, really sorry to hear how hard it's been, the economy has been beyond brutal.  Wishing you the best and hope things get better for you soon.\n\nI've utilised marketing contractors and agencies from all over the world during my 10 years or so doing this, both solo and on behalf of clients. Here are some things that I think would help you:\n\n- Website, make one. Seriously. I won't hire any freelancers without a portfolio or website. Even an Upwork profile with some portfolio pieces and feedback, or a simple Wix with some links will do. If I can't see evidence of some work somewhere, I don't trust you - this rule applies to anyone I screen regardless of location.\n\n- I sell a lot of services, but I pitch one thing as an opener. For example, first website I made started as a graphic design and content creation project, first PR retainer started with a website copy overhaul, first strategy consultation as copywriting etc. \n\n- As such, don't pitch for retainers, do one project really well, then open up subtly about other services. I learnt this selling for marketing agencies before I went solo. You need to prove trust as a small company with some wins before the client invests. Pick the 3 things you're best at and proven in as your opener.\n\n- Niche down in industry. I offer a lot of services through my own skills and subcontractors, but I'm in a tech niche that I have a network and 10+ years experience in. If you don't have one, find something underserved with less competition. No one wants general services anymore, you either specialise in a few or run lots in specific verticals like luxury, D2C, local businesses, AI, games, telecoms, SaaS etc\n\n- You're understandably scared and I can read it in your text, no offense. Potential clients smell fear a mile away. It's a confidence game. Find something, even part-time or low paid, to keep you afloat. Building a business is very hard with no safety net - been there many times in my career and it sucks. Truly. \n\nBusiness always improved, ironically, when I felt good in of myself and sometimes when I was doing a low-paid job and felt some financial relief. Get some rest, make some time for hobbies, animals and friends, you're both working hard and deserve it 💜",

But I want to share something that might help reframe what's happening.\n\nI went through a period where I couldn't land a single client for 4 months. Not because I was bad at what I did, but because I was selling the wrong thing to the wrong people in the wrong way. I kept pitching \"digital marketing services\" which is what every freelancer on the planet offers. There was nothing for a prospect to grab onto.\n\nWhat changed everything was getting brutally specific. Instead of \"we do digital marketing,\" I started saying \"I'll set up your abandoned cart email sequence and you'll recover 5-15% of lost sales within 2 weeks.\" Same skills. Same me. Completely different response rate.\n\nThe painful truth about service businesses is that \"a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\" sounds like everything and nothing at the same time. When a client reads that, they think \"this person does a bit of everything\" which translates to \"this person isn't the expert I need for my specific problem.\"\n\nPick the ONE thing you're best at. Not the 5 things you can do. The ONE thing. Then find the specific type of business that desperately needs that one thing and can't do it themselves.\n\nAlso - and I say this with zero judgment because I've been there - when you're desperate, prospects can feel it. It changes the energy of every interaction. The meetings where I finally closed were the ones where I genuinely stopped caring whether they said yes because I'd accepted that I'd survive either way. That mental shift is almost impossible to fake but it's the difference between \"please hire us\" energy and \"here's what I can do for you, take it or leave it\" energy.\n\nYou're not failing because you're from Africa or because you lack skills. You're failing because the positioning is too broad and the desperation is leaking through. Both of those are fixable.",

You would be better off finding local jobs or increase your skill levels.

He was excited and ready to pull the trigger. THEN we started talking about his bathroom and eventually he decided he wanted to do a bathroom first. I didn't take his money even though he tried to pay me multiple times. \n\nIts because of the mindset and culture I developed. \n\nYou never want to step over dollars trying to pick up pennies.\n\n I had a new salesperson with me and I was trying to teach her the ropes. She didn't understand why I didn't take the guys money. \n\nWe got in the truck and drafted 3 different proposals to the customer. The kitchen, the kitchen AND bathroom, and the kitchen and 2 bathrooms. \n\nIt wasnt an easy decision to turn him down, but the culture is luxury and we dont want to chase the small jobs. It puts you in a downward spiral. You reminded me of that when you said you wanted customers to pay you 200 or 300. That signals you are cheap and no one worth it is cheap. \n\nAnother thing. Probably the MOST important.\nHave you tried praying about it? If you seek for financial gain, you'll most likely not receive it. If your higher power can't trust you with a little, hes not going to bless you with a lot",

I do own a small cosmetics manufacturing business that pays for the bills, but doesn't seem to grow beyond where it's at now, so I was supplementing things with doing a little IT consulting here and there.\n\nI decided to stop pursuing to grow the cosmetics manufacturing and focus on the IT work back in November so I put an ad in the local newspaper closest to me. That's the one that's yielding me a much busier flow of customers. \n\nThis week, I asked to be put on two more remote towns that are about 30 minutes and 1 hour away from me. I know each of those ads will yield me another 1-5 calls a week each, but what I decided to do there was to charge a 2 hour minimum per visit. I'm sure some customers will turn me away because they'll find the rate to be too ghih, but if I can get 1-2 at 2 hours minimum, then it's worth the drive. I have an EV which costs me next to nothing to charge.\n\nIf I'm busy that week, then I quote a higher rate. \n\nI'm hoping that, with time, I can eventually hire someone who I can send to the further off places while I service the locals. \n\nI used to do this many years ago and had 5 techs working for me at one point, but started to pursue several startup ideas and spun my wheels. One of the startups is on automode now and gets me a couple of grand a year, but definitely not the millions I was hoping for haha.\n\n\nThe ad reads:\n\nThe top is\nLocal techs\nAt your service\n\nThen a list of the services I offer and to the right of it, there's a picture I generated of a \"nerd\" using AI.\n\nBelow that, it says:\n\nIf we can't fix it\nYOU DON'T PAY\n\nThen my number.\n\nVery basic. You can do this with anything, house cleaning business, etc. \n\nThe above only works in small country towns. Not in cities.",

Inventory tracking, employee onboarding, vendor management, compliance checklists. The people doing this work hate it and the company would pay real money to make it go away.\n\nThe reason this is the \"boring business\" of tech:\n\n1. Nobody tweets about building inventory management software for auto parts distributors. Its not sexy. It will never go viral. And thats exactly why competition is low.\n\n2. The customers are easy to find. They are literally posting job ads for roles that exist only to manage these manual processes. If a company is hiring a \"data entry specialist\" or \"operations coordinator\" you know they have a process that could be automated.\n\n3. Switching costs are insane. Once a company builds their workflow around your tool they will not switch for years. Thats recurring revenue with almost zero churn.\n\n4. You dont need venture capital. These businesses can be profitable from month one because you are replacing a salary not competing for attention.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that the best tech businesses solve problems that are too boring for most developers to care about. While everyone is chasing AI wrappers and social apps, the founder building scheduling software for dental offices is quietly making 50k a month.",

Before that I spent a decade working at other peoples companies, convinced I was \"learning\" when really I was just comfortable.\n\nThe kids building things at 16 have one advantage: they dont know what failure looks like so they arent afraid of it. Thats it. Everything else favors you. You have context for real problems. You have savings (or at least a credit history). You have professional relationships. You know how businesses actually operate from the inside.\n\nMy first company flopped. Built it in stealth for 8 months because I was paranoid someone would steal the idea. Nobody cared. Not because it was bad, but because nobody knew it existed. I was 33 and felt like a complete idiot.\n\nStarted again at 34. This time I talked to 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code. Within 6 weeks I had my first paying user. The difference wasnt talent or timing. It was that I finally had the maturity to do the uncomfortable thing first instead of hiding behind the fun stuff.\n\nThe honest truth about starting at 35: your biggest enemy isnt age. Its the voice in your head that says you should have figured this out by now. That voice is lying. Most successful founders I know started their winning company after 30. The ones who started younger just failed more times before they found the thing that worked.\n\nYou have maybe 30+ working years ahead of you. That is an absurd amount of time.

That would be so bomb for me. Seriously.  \n  \nA little context on me: I'm 30, internet/tech/ecom/marketing/AI are my bag of skills. For me, pursuing my own business - win or fail - is my #1 goal. Has been for 6 years. And I am absolutely paralyzed into inaction from 100% mental nonsense.\n\nI'm the doer of the year behind closed doors. I happily spend buku hours buried in my laptop developing ideas, having new ones, building, learning, going crazy on projects, and so much AI. I can \"do\" very seriously in this sense. From that, I have more than a few business routes I could take right now.\n\nI just simply can't pull myself to make it known to the world. If it's a service, I can't bring myself to try and sell it to a business. If I want to meet others working toward goals like mine, I can't post the social media.\n\nI could use some collaboration, pretty tough, even just a chat or email. I know I can get out of this twisted perception with some outside perspectives- and just let myself try, at this point. \n\nThanks regardless,  \nEric",

I’m not sure where to begin.\n\nHave you seen those videos where the speaker goes, \"You are not doing what you want to do because you are scared of failure\"? Back then, listening to such words, I always thought I would not be that guy. Today, I am pushed into a corner where I am afraid to do anything or try out something new, and I can feel the walls closing in.\n\nI am doing deliveries and other blue-collar gigs because it makes me happy, and it’s the only time I don't think about my failure. Looking back, I think I had a big ego when I had success. I loved being generous and taking care of people, but being in a position where I'm not able to do so, I don’t want to face anyone.\n\nMy brain is not able to think big right now or come up with ideas; it is in a stagnant state, I feel. And I think I went out of business at the worst time possible, because even the job market in IT is fed up.\n\nWhat I’ve learned during this time upon reflecting:\n\n* I truly understand the essence of networking.\n* Grit doesn’t always mean things will go well; you need a pragmatic thinker on your team who talks to you openly.\n\nAnyways, I have decided, in this Arab?Arabi?c restaurant, that I am going to start again. I have nothing to lose. I am starting at 0 today; 0 capital and 0 funding.\n\nJust my laptop, a roof over my head, and my bike. My trusty bike, the only thing putting food on my table right now. I love my bike; a stupid machine on two wheels, haha.\n\nI don’t have the \"big idea\" yet. I am going to take a different approach to building this time, something that gets me from 0 to 1. I will actively work on getting there rather than waiting for a light bulb moment.",

And if you learnt something, then you take it into your next business. You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain, because you've already paid for all the experience so you might as well cash it in.  Most successful businesses only come after multiple failures, according to research.  \n\n\nWorst case scenario it's you and your bike at a job again... that other people do daily.

For booking, Calendly or Cal.com (free) embed directly on your site and handle everything. For local SEO the biggest thing is setting up Google Business Profile, thats free and gets you showing up in map searches for \"nutritionist near me\". On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff. Testimonials section is easy on any platform. WordPress with a starter theme would probably give you the most flexibility for under $100/year total including hosting.",

      "text": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

Can you support yourself? Do you enjoy your work? Not having employees or \"building\" a company doesn't mean you're not building anything. You're building your skill-set, you're building your _name_, you're building yourself.\n\nMaybe you are the product currently, and without you there's no business, but that is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nThe easiest way for you to become an entrepreneur would be to hire an employee, and to teach them your way of working, now you've got two products generating income for your company. When you start scaling up to 5+ people it starts to make sense to take stock of what work there is in your company, and who should do this work, but for now it's all stuff you've done, which means you should be able to teach someone how to do it.",

              "text": ">easiest\n\n>hire an employee, and teach them\n\nIMO you've just actually described one of the most *difficult* things to pull off in a service business. You essentially need to productise the service, experience good and bad recruitment, adjust KPIs to align with margin requirements, monitor and implement quality controls, codify all knowledge into processes. These things take YEARS to get right.\n\nI'm all for encouraging OP, I think it's great they're aware of what they want and what their gap is. But I think it's a hard journey to go on that I see many founders struggle with. In fact, it's more common for me to meet founders that are still delivering the sales/service, than those that have largely freed themselves.\n\nI believe setting expectations is important so that OP can prepare themselves for what's next and ask themselves if it's worth the struggle (like you said - nothing to be ashamed of being a freelancer).",

I have trained smaller companies and individuals before but this is a whole beast in itself. From logistics, to fulfillment, to continued support after the 5 day training is over.\n\nI don't know how many of you are in the same position as I am but if you are in a spot where your back is against the wall, take it as a sign that you are exactly where you need to be. I have never felt pressure like this in such a long time because I was used to training employee sizes of < 50. Now I 20x it. \n\nInsane.\n\nI remember telling myself the key to make more money in business is to solve bigger problems. This is me solving a bigger problem. My back being against the wall is just what comes with it. It is situations like this that causes you to expand your knowledge base, your understanding as a business owner, and your willingness to adapt.\n\nI would love any feedback from anyone who has done huge training sessions for businesses before (does not have to be ai focused training). How did you fulfill? How long did you work with the enterprise for?\n\nI'm excited to deliver for this huge enterprise client but I'd be lying if I said I was not scared haha. Let's do this!",

Start everyone from the basics and give them a very streamlined 80/20 path to proceed. \n3. Backup your back up plan with another back up plan - something will always break\n4. Get help. More people makes a difference. Especially at your scale. \n5. Make it memorable. Emotions massively improve memory. Having jokes, active gestures, asking questions, and bringing energy is a requirement if you want them to be successful in the long term. \n6. Make it as active as you can for your students.

Like marketing teams need different prompts/agents than finance or ops.

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this. Just don't forget to breathe during the first session 😅",

On the other, it feels like discovery is shifting very fast and people are now getting most answers directly from AI instead of clicking blue links.\n\nHere’s what I’m trying to understand now:\n\n* Does traditional SEO still meaningfully increase business visibility (online presence in browser search results etc), or is it just table stakes now?\n* Should the focus be shifting toward blog-style content that helps increase AI visibility when tools like ChatGPT or Copilot recommend vendors and services?\n* Are there clear AI visibility trends yet, or is market mostly guessing?\n* (Follows from the previous question) - What are actual increase AI visibility best practices if any? And overall, is it ethical type of self-promotion?\n* At what point does it still make sense to invest in seo instead of reallocating effort elsewhere? Or only AI overviews matter now?\n\nCurious how other founders are approaching this challenge. Are you changing strategy, or just sticking with fundamentals and riding it out?

Blogs every month, indexed, keywords sprinkled everywhere. Traffic was flat and barely any leads. When I looked closer, the issue wasn’t effort. It was clarity.\n\nOnce we simplified things, clearer homepage, clearer service pages, clearer explanations of what they actually do and who it’s for, a few things happened:\n\n* Google traffic became more relevant, even if it wasn’t huge\n* AI tools started referencing them for very specific use cases\n* Leads understood the offer before the call\n\nI’ve also seen the opposite. Clients with strong authority or lots of content, but vague messaging, rarely show up in AI answers. The systems don’t know *when* to recommend them.\n\nSo to your questions:\n\n* Traditional SEO still helps with visibility, but it’s mostly the foundation now\n* Blog content works when it explains real problems and use cases, not when it’s just “content”\n* AI visibility isn’t random. The pattern I keep seeing is clear explanations + consistent language across the site + getting your brand mentioned in various places\n\nhope this helps",

It’s basically a 'ReadMe' for LLMs so they can ingest the site's context without the HTML noise.\n\n   2. Batch PDF Generation: Mass generation of multi-page PDF blueprint manuals from our existing pages. It creates an additional SEO source that LLMs seem to like citing as an authoritative source.\n\n   3. Programmatic Video: Recently started using Remotion in CLI to automate video creation based on the same data.\n\n  Just making sure the data is available in every format an AI agent might want to consume.

          "text": "Great find - this thread nails the exact shift happening right now.\n\nTraditional SEO is getting tougher for startups because people increasingly ask AI (Perplexity, Claude, Grok, etc.) instead of typing queries into Google. The answer often comes from the model's interpretation/synthesis, not direct site ranking. If your startup gets distorted, omitted, or lumped with wrong competitors in those responses, even solid on-page SEO won't help much - decisions happen before anyone hits your site.\n\nI've been digging into this a lot lately. One thing that's surprisingly effective (and underrated) is actively auditing + optimizing how LLMs perceive your company: what labels/associations/strengths/weaknesses they assign, where the perception gaps are vs. your real positioning, and targeted fixes (content tweaks, new angles) to make the model \"get\" you better. It's like GEO but focused on closing the reality vs. AI-narrative gap, which directly impacts early-stage discovery and trust.\n\nFor bootstrapped founders especially, this can be a high-leverage move cheaper/faster than scaling paid ads when the narrative is off.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with AI-perception tools or seeing real lifts from it in 2026? Curious what approaches are working beyond classic SEO. If anyone's curious, I can share more on how we've approached it for our own stuff (no pitch, just real talk). 😄",

This was long overdue as my net income has surpassed my salary months ago. I wanted to dive into my business and finally grow it instead of just keeping it afloat. \n\nAlthough I have many ideas that I can’t wait to start doing, one thing I struggle with is discipline and keeping a consistent schedule. Previous I would work 80+hrs per week on my job during the day and business at night. Now without my job, I’m having trouble waking up in the morning because I don’t have a mandatory standup meeting to go to. \n\nI’m curious, for those who transitioned from working a 9-to-5 to working for themselves - what’s your schedule like? How do you keep yourself accountable and disciplined when you’re your own boss? Where do you draw the line between work life balance? \n\nThanks! ",

The change of scenery helps break that \"I can do this anytime\" mentality that kills momentum. Now I do mornings for creative work, afternoons for admin stuff, and try to shut down by 6pm unless there's something urgent.\n\n  \nThe freedom is amazing but you definitely have to be intentional about creating your own structure, otherwise you'll just drift and wonder where the day went.",

Notice and try to schedule work in those times. \n\nAccountability could be starting the week with one day just brain-dumping all the ideas and to-do’s and then letting yourself recharge a bit to them get to them in the following days when your energy is higher. Obvious things like incorporating expertise can be helpful too for growing discipline and routines. Read Atomic Habits and Tiny Habits for strategies for sequencing tasks/goals. \n\n ",

Im lucky that my business was still slowly growing through word of mouth, but I know I can make it bigger. I’m finally at a point where I realized that I might be losing money by just staying put instead of growing. That’s why I made the decision to quit. And yes, the WLB is terrible, my most productive time of the day were given to my full time job, my business was getting my leftover energy.\n\nI love the brain dumping idea! Will try that out!",

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date & time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

Then I just said screw it and built something I personally needed - a way to process memories out loud instead of journaling (which never worked for me).\n\nShipped it 11 days ago. Zero sales so far haha. But the learning curve is insane - TikTok algorithms, Reddit karma rules, cold outreach to coaches, LinkedIn groups. None of that shows up in \"how to start a startup\" guides.\n\nMy advice: Don't wait to identify the perfect problem. Just pick something YOU struggle with, build an MVP in 3 weeks, and launch it. You'll learn more in 2 weeks of live product feedback than 6 months of market research.\n\nThe tech skill is the easy part. The hard part is talking to humans who might actually pay you $5 for something you built. That's where the real entrepreneurship starts (in my humble opinion ;)).\n\nWhat problems do YOU personally deal with that your current tech company doesn't solve?",

I think most people naturally gravitate to one of these categories. You just need to determine which one you best fit, then depending on what that is, find other people who fill the gap. Good luck.

Here's what I read from your question \"I'll bet that I can figure out something that will be so valuable I don't need to work for anyone else ever again but I don't have a clue what it is it where to find it. \" You should ask yourself how committed are you to bring your own boss, for people like myself I had an idea so profound I couldn't just let it escape me and it's been nearly 2 years and from barely being able to send an email to learning as much as I have is remarkable but even still it's no where near \" skill\" or 'ability\" but that doesn't matter cause I have the concept and the idea. I will reach my goal, hopefully before someone else figured it out. If you have a job, be happy and find joy in it. Find projects you enjoy and let your problem find you. Do not search for an issue to solve cause like they say...you might just find it. Think about it bro",
