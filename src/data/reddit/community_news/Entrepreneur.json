We might lose him\" was a subconscious thought when you started mentioning how you wouldn't be a good fit. \n\n\nPlus, when you downplay it some people just love to prove others wrong and be right. In this scenario - he wanted to prove you wrong about being a bad fit. \n\n\nThen again, he could've just been a friendly guy, he liked that you were friendly too and y'all got along. That's 99% of the battle. His stack can be learned but hiring someone new you basically have a crap shoot of their personality. And being on the train with you, he got to test that side out and he liked what he saw. A lot of hires happen like this from networking",

They need education first, not a challenge.\n\n  \nThe balance question is the right one to ask. What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

When you tell someone they might not be a good fit, you're positioning yourself as someone with standards rather than someone chasing revenue. Buyers respond to that because it signals confidence in your product.\n\nWe run a dev agency and started doing this naturally after getting burned by bad-fit clients. Now on discovery calls we actively disqualify. \"Honestly, if your timeline is under 3 weeks, we're probably not the right team for you.\" The ones who stay become significantly better clients. Shorter sales cycles, fewer scope disputes, higher retention.\n\nThe key distinction: this only works when you actually mean it. If you're disqualifying prospects you'd happily take, people sense the manipulation. The magic is having genuine criteria for who you work best with and being transparent about it.\n\nWhen not to use it: early-stage when you need every dollar to survive. You need some financial stability to walk away from bad fits. But once you have that cushion, being selective is one of the highest-leverage things you can do for both revenue and sanity.",

The anti-selling approach works because people are so burned out on aggressive sales tactics that genuine helpfulness stands out like a lighthouse in a storm.\n\nI have been doing something similar in the B2B space - instead of pitching our service directly, we write detailed guides about how to solve the problem ourselves (DIY). Sounds counterintuitive but it does two things:\n\n1. Builds massive trust because you are clearly not desperate\n2. People who read the DIY guide and realize it is too complex for them come back and pay you to do it\n\nThe confused part makes sense though. It feels wrong because every business book tells you to \"always be closing\". But closing is what you do at the end. Most people try to close before they have earned the right to ask for money.\n\nWhat is your conversion rate looking like vs your old approach?",

In that moment they gave you better product insight than any survey or feedback form ever would. They told you their exact pain, in their words, with real urgency. That's gold.\n\n  \nThink about what happened: instead of you saying \"here's what our product does,\" the customer said \"here's why I need this.\" The information flow reversed. And the information going the other direction - customer to you - is always more valuable than your pitch going the other way.\n\n  \nThe question of when to use it comes down to whether you're selling to people who already know they have the problem. If they reached out to you, they know. Anti-selling just makes them articulate it clearly. If you're cold outreach, they might not know they have the problem yet, and anti-selling gives them an easy exit.",

      "text": "Cold calling isn't dead. Bad cold calling is dead. I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

And I hope and pray that one day I wake up with drive like I read in your and others posts. The “staying clean” bit, while also staying consistent and dealing with daily rejection, is incredibly impressive, and I praise the hell out of you for being able to do that. I don’t know if I’ll ever get there, but I sure hope I do. I have a shit ton to offer. I just have no idea exactly what it is or how to utilize it at this point.\n\nI wish you continued success.

Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

You’ve conquered the hardest part: the Internal Validation.\n\nHowever, coming from my book 'Startup Inferno,' I must give you a word of caution as you scale. You are currently in the stage of 'The Hero’s Grit.' You generated $127k through pure willpower. But as you look to grow, you need to move from being the 'Motor' to being the 'Architect.'\n\nUsing the Curling analogy: right now, you are throwing the stone and sweeping the ice with everything you have. To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath. You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.' The world needs more founders who have real scars.\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the 'hustle,' what is the first system you are building to ensure this business remains a source of freedom rather than a new type of cage?",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

I learned the hard way that 'crunch mode' isn't a badge of honor; it’s just debt that you eventually pay back with interest (usually burnout or health issues).\n\nTo your list, I would add: 'divorce your ego' from the metrics. Especially in the early days, it is so easy to feel like you are a failure just because a launch failed or growth is slow (feeling this now!). I have to constantly remind myself; especially now that I'm back in university and building a startup simultaneously, that the business is an experiment, not a judgment on my character. :)\n\nIf I tie my self-worth to the MRR graph, I’m on an emotional roller coaster I can’t survive (I feel). Learning to be 'okay' even when the business is broken is the only superpower that keeps me in the game! 🦸‍♂️",

But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself.

      "text": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice & clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

Had Notion databases with color-coded priorities, tags, deadlines for everything. Spent more time maintaining the system than doing actual work.\n\n  \nWhat finally clicked for me was realizing that long task lists are just anxiety lists. They make you feel busy without making progress on anything that matters. When you only have 3 things, you cant hide behind \"oh ill do the hard one after these quick wins\" because there are no quick wins to hide behind.\n\n  \nThe physical aspect is key too. Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign. It means the system is visible enough to actually hold you accountable. Thats the whole point. The flip mechanism sounds like a clean solution to that.\n\n  \nCurious how many prototypes you went through before landing on the magnetic fixation. Hardware iteration cycles are brutal compared to software where you can ship a fix in minutes.",

Max 5 applications per day but make them count. Customize each one.\n\n2. Use tools that remove the busywork. I use Sprout which autofills applications and tailors resumes with AI but lets me review everything before submitting. Saves like 30 min per app.\n\n3. Track what gets responses, not what you send. If a role type never replies, stop applying there.\n\n4. Keep it simple. I used a basic spreadsheet with just company, role, status. No fancy automations.\n\nOrganizing = productivity is a trap. Actually doing the work beats organizing it every time.\n\nFull transparency - I'm on the customer support team at Sprout. Happy to share what I've seen work for job seekers if anyone wants to DM.",

Chefs doing catering use dependency planning. PMs with a college degree and no knowledge of what they are managing use gant charts. They are nonsense.

You're categorizing, prioritizing, color-coding, and at the end of the day you've produced nothing but a prettier task list.\n\nI run a dev company and we had the same problem at the team level. Sprint planning sessions that took half a day, Jira boards with 200 tickets, elaborate story point systems. We stripped it back to a simple rule: every morning, each person writes down the one thing that moves the project forward today. Not three things. One. If they finish early, great, pick another. But the first thing on the list is the thing that actually matters.\n\nOutput went up noticeably within the first two weeks. Turns out when you remove the illusion of choice, people stop debating what to work on and just start working.\n\nYour whiteboard approach is the physical version of the same principle.

You set a deletion timer for a thought/task and have to refresh it each day if it stays important to your goals. For me it'd be about 7 days. I'd dump my ideas into the journal, rank them by importance, then recall them using auto fill (app would keep record of 7 days of blurbs). If I didn't think about it again for 7 days, it would be deleted and gone forever. Naturally, important tasks and ideas would rise to the top and enter working memory, and I wouldn't have the latent anxiety that I was forgetting something important. ",

The comparison trap is real.\n\n  \nSomething that helped me: most of those 10k MRR posts leave out the 2 years of nothing before that. Or the fact that they had savings, a co-founder, prior audience, whatever. You are seeing highlight reels and comparing them to your behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n  \nA few things that helped me stay sane early on:\n\n  \n1. I stopped tracking what other people were doing and started tracking only my own weekly progress. Even small stuff like talked to 3 potential users or shipped that one feature counts. When you look back after a month you realize you actually moved a lot.\n\n  \n2. The loneliness part is real. Find even one other person building something. Not a mastermind group or a paid community, just one person you can text this sucks today or I just got my first user. That changes everything.\n\n  \n3. The am I cut out for this feeling never fully goes away. It just gets quieter as you get more reps in. The people posting confidently online feel it too, they just do not post about it.\n\n  \nYou are a few months in and still going. That already puts you ahead of most people who just talk about starting something. Keep building.",

Nobody posts \"day 47, still zero paying users, ate cereal for dinner.\"\n\nSomething that helped me reframe it: those people posting 10k MRR didn't get there by scrolling Reddit and comparing themselves to other people posting 10k MRR. They got there by closing the app and doing one uncomfortable thing per day. One cold email, one user interview, one feature shipped.\n\nAlso worth remembering that \"first few paying users\" is genuinely the hardest milestone in any business. Going from 0 to 1 is harder than going from 100 to 1000.

How can you define yourself outside of the frame and how you build and support your own context.\n\nAnother crucial point about your solution: pivoting if you discover that your business model is not viable. I am always surprised by how painful letting go an idea is.\n\nI am in my second mastermind group and it taught me a lot.  Discovering that we are all going through the same processes. The only difference is how you deal with them.\n\nAfter a couple of projects that I tried to turn into businesses these 25 years, I am now used with all these thinking but a new project is a new baby with the same fears, expectations and hopes.\n\nThe main learning of these two last years is the importance of the validation phase. All the methods that are used to do it asap, test the willingness to pay of potential clients (very important) and involving them in the very early steps of your project (waiting list, beta testing,...).\n\nAll the best !",

We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

I'd guess that it's minimal, and frankly, most of what's out there is more product-oriented anyway. It's hard to build momentum in your space, I did it for a decade.\n\nI'd focus on referrals for now.

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "text": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

That kind of trust transfer takes years to build, not months.\n\nThe commission-only or hybrid model is the right direction, but the pool of people who can sell $100K+ technical services AND are willing to work on commission is extremely small. The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

Let them go after 3 months and $15k in lost salary payments and had a serious think about why it didn’t work. Here’s my thoughts.\n\n1. I was expecting a sales person to build out sales infrastructure when they were expecting just to close deals. We didn’t have a big enough pipeline to have a sales person so the bulk of their work would have been just building that and that wasn’t their skill.\n\n2. I didn’t have a clear enough offer / product. Well this one is a bit challenging because I do, and we are bringing in close to 1M each year in business so it’s obviously working. But we don’t run ads / have a fixed price list / etc etc so it was difficult for the sales person to articulate.\n\n3. They didn’t know very much about the service that we offered and so couldn’t really understand the need for it. That made them fail when it came to explaining basic concepts.\n\nEven at 1M a year we’re not big enough for that. I’m closing business now and doing a good job. We’re working on building out the pipeline infrastructure and are not looking for sales at the moment at all.",

Customers like \"experts\" far better than a vaporwave person.  How to do this easily?  Take one of your staffers along with you on a sales call.  Let them see how it works.  Then have them answer some of the customer's questions, and let the staff member \"snow\" the customer with technical jargon, as that is GOOD thing.  The staff member just PROVED to the customer they are technical, not good at talking with normal people, and literally will have a valuable opinion of the do-ability of the task, and even define the stages and algorithms needed to solve the task. \n\nThus,  the customer now knows your firm has experts who are well qualified to COMPLETE the job, instead of getting just half way, taking half the budget, before telling the customer, the job can not be done.\n\nHope this helps.",

We burned money on sales and marketing employees. We burned money on agencies. We burned money on paid ads. Tried everything to make that type of business scale.\n\nHere's the truth:\nYou are trying to solve an equation that has no solution. Look at all the answers here. Everybody is desperately trying to get a steady stream of customers running. \n\nFrom what I have seen and learned in the past 10 years, I would say it's not possible to come up with any sales or marketing strategy or tactics that generate new customers. \nSure, having a good partner company can work. But it will make you dependant and often, you will be the sub contractor in the back.\n\nHere's what does work. It worked for us and I know plenty of companies where it worked too:\n\nYou need to fix your OFFER. \nYou can't just offer sw development as a service. Nobody cares, really. It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business? I figured this out the hard way and I could write books about it. If people are interested, I can write some more information about it in another post.",

Not because the interviews give you a perfect roadmap, but because they reveal assumptions you didn't even know you were making.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: pay attention to what people are currently doing to solve the problem, not just whether they say they'd use your product. If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

          "text": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

          "text": "Been through this exact transition. Few thoughts from the other side.\n\n  \nOn the co-founder question: at $321k ARR you honestly dont need a co-founder, you need a strong first hire. A co-founder at this stage means giving up equity for something you could solve with a good ops person or senior engineer. The mental load sharing you want is real but a trusted #2 employee can provide that without the complications of a late-stage co-founder relationship.\n\n  \nOn YC: great network and signal, but going through a program primarily to find a partner is an expensive way to network. You already have a working product with real revenue. YC is designed more for pre-product or early-traction companies. If networking is the goal, founder communities like OnDeck or even just being active in niche Slack groups for your vertical would get you there faster.\n\n  \nOn the burnout itself: the biggest unlock for me was realizing that not everything needs to be done well. Some things just need to be done. I was spending energy trying to be excellent at support, sales AND engineering simultaneously. The moment I hired someone for support (even part-time contract) and let them handle it at 80% of my quality level, I got 40% of my mental bandwidth back. That 80% was more than good enough for customers.\n\n  \nPractical next step I would suggest: before you look for a co-founder or apply to YC, try hiring a part-time contractor for your biggest time sink (probably support or sales). Run it for 60 days. You will either realize that was all you needed, or you will have a much clearer picture of what kind of partner you actually want.",

Not because sales was the hardest part, but because it was the only one that could be systematized without needing someone as smart as the founder.\n\nHere's what worked:\n\nDocument every single call for two weeks. Every objection, every demo flow, every discovery question. Then hire someone decent, not exceptional, and have them shadow for 30 days. They take over setters first, then closers. Founder still jumps in when deals are over a certain threshold, but suddenly there's 20 hours back per week.\n\nThe mistake is trying to hire someone to \"do sales.\" That person will suck because they don't have your context. Build the system first, then hire someone to run it.\n\nSupport next. A VA using a knowledge base you build over two weekends can handle tier 1 stuff. Anything they can't solve gets escalated.

A co-founder would want equity but you've already de-risked the business - they'd be joining something that works, not building from zero. That's an employee not a co-founder.\n\nWhat you actually need is to hire your first 2-3 people and delegate the stuff that drains you most. Figure out which of support/dev/sales exhausts you the most and hire for that first. Most solo founders try to hire for everything at once and end up with mediocre generalists. Hire one specialist who can own an entire function.\n\nThe YC thing is backwards. You don't need a co-founder to share the mental load, you need to stop being precious about who touches your product. YC wants companies that can scale and you can't scale if you're the bottleneck. They'd probably tell you to hire anyway.\n\nFor burnout - the only thing that worked for me was accepting that slower growth while building a team is better than fast growth that kills you. Your revenue will flatline for 6 months while you train people and that's fine. You're playing a long game not a sprint.\n\nOne practical thing - before you hire anyone, document every process you do repeatedly. Takes 2 weeks of painful work but then you can hand someone a manual instead of training them from scratch every time.",

Entrepreneurship risk is very manageable because even if the business fails, they can go get a job again.\n\n  \nThe dangerous myth on both sides is treating it as binary.

You don't control the market. You don't control your customers' decisions. You don't control the economy, the timing, or whether someone with more resources builds the same thing faster. You traded one type of uncertainty for another and called it freedom.\n\nThe real question isn't which path is riskier. It's which kind of risk you're equipped to handle, and whether you've thought honestly about why you're choosing it. \"I want control\" sounds empowering until you realize most new businesses don't fail because the founder lacked control. They fail because the founder didn't know what to build, who to build it for, or why it mattered beyond revenue.\n\nAnd the conspiracy angle at the end weakens an otherwise interesting conversation. \"Media wants us to stay employees\" isn't critical thinking. It's just suspicion wearing the costume of insight. The real reason most people stay in corporate jobs isn't brainwashing. It's that entrepreneurship demands a kind of self-knowledge that most people haven't done the work to develop. That's not a media problem. That's a human one.\n\nBoth paths are hard. Both paths are uncertain. The difference isn't control. It's whether you've been honest with yourself about what you actually want and what you're willing to lose to get it.",

If you're unable to work as a solo or small company entrepreneur, even in you have disability insurance, the company itself is going to run out of money without you and be unable to pay the premiums.  More likely you just never signed up for this kind of insurance because it was way too expensive, particularly STD.\n\nThe reality is that owning your own business is a great deal more risky than being an employee, even taking layoffs into account.

      "text": "I've been a developer for 22 years. Started when you had to actually understand what you were building. Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era? How are you thinking about it?",

Even I was proficient with Blender, Substance painter and many more complex software people had budget like 20$ but what they expected was like $5000 work. \n\nSince I'm really early in crypto also 2012 as I'm jumping every earn online bandwagon since I'm 13 I found out about crypto too I tried to focus on that.

ChatGPT is moving everyday further into the useless zone. \n\n\nI can't believe how fast I've been able to get things done with AI: research the product, draw up product roadmap, get high quality designs, plan the architecture, get it to teach me (resilient) flutter from scratch and debug annoying configuration elements and bugs that would have really caused me to procrastinate in the past. \n\n\nPlus the speed at which it auto-generates better-than-boilerplate code is insane. Obviously you have to be careful with your prompts and ensure it doesn't introduce code smells and knock out hacky solutions. \n\n\nWould love to make a true business of this and go solo - wish me luck! 🙏🙏🙂🙂",

      "text": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

She will fuck up a big client eventually.

I uncovered a year of theft because my partner hadn't stayed on top of inventory for a year, even though he said he did.

You don't need to mention anything about how she disappears or her work quality drops after their fights. You can bring up specific times when she went dark and you had to scramble to finish your deliverables, and ask if she needs support to make sure things don't fall off her radar. Alternatively, next time she drops the ball let her husband figure it out. As the finance and new biz guy you should not be responsible for communicating about BAU tasks with existing clients or covering for her. \n\nIf none of the above works, I'd think about exiting and looking for new cofounders that you can work with.",

Not a template from the internet. You need clauses that address minimum performance standards, what happens during extended absences, and buyout triggers. If you already have one, check if it covers any of this.\n\n  \n2. Frame the conversation around protecting the business, not blaming her. Something like \"we are growing, we have a waitlist, and we need a plan for when any one of us is unavailable for any reason.\" Make it about all three of you, not just her.\n\n  \n3. Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now.

I'll take a day off and spend half of it thinking about work instead of actually recharging which defeats the purpose.\n\nI don't think the guilt ever fully goes away honestly.

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely.

          "text": "The guilt is real and it's one of the hardest parts of running your own business. Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

The business didn't just survive while I was gone, it actually thrived.\n\nIf your business can’t handle you taking a day off to play football or read, you haven’t built a company, you’ve just built a really high-pressure job for yourself. taking a break is basically a \"stress test\" for your business. If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder.

You are past the point where you can keep it all in your head but probably not big enough to justify a full time ops person. That middle zone is brutal.\n\n  \nTwo things that helped me get out of this exact loop:\n\n  \nFirst, I stopped being the single point of contact for scheduling changes. Picked one reliable person at each location and made them the shift swap coordinator. They handle the day to day shuffles and only escalate to me if there is a conflict nobody can resolve. That alone cut my scheduling time by probably 60 percent. People still get their swaps handled, they just go through someone who is already on the floor and knows the context better than I do.\n\n  \nSecond, I set hard boundaries on when time off requests get processed. Instead of handling them as they came in throughout the day, I batch them. Every Monday morning I review anything that came in the previous week, approve or flag conflicts, done. The constant interruptions were what made it feel like a full time job, not the actual decision making which usually takes five minutes per request.\n\n  \nAt 22 people you are not doing something wrong. This is just the stage where you either build a system or slowly become an unpaid office manager. The good news is once you push some of that responsibility down, it actually runs smoother because the people closest to the work make better scheduling calls than you do sitting in a different room.",

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled. I was able to devote time to improving my sales pitch, improving our demand gen tools and just accelerating deals closed. Hope this if helpful in any way.",

Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

Go to Upwork, cold DM small businesses on Twitter/LinkedIn, offer to do one project at a steep discount to get a testimonial.\n\n  \nMonth 1-2: Stack 3-5 testimonials. Raise your rate. Start noticing what clients keep asking for that you could productize. This is where the real ideas come from, not from brainstorming in a vacuum but from actual client conversations.\n\n  \nMonth 3+: Take the most repeated request and turn it into a small productized service or simple tool. Now you have income, proof of demand, and your first few customers already lined up.\n\n  \nThe AI angle here is real but overblown. The advantage isn't \"build an AI startup.\" The advantage is that AI lets one person do the work of three. A freelance copywriter using AI well can take on 3x the volume. A developer can ship MVPs in days instead of weeks. That's the actual leverage, using AI to amplify a service business, not trying to compete in the AI product space with zero runway.\n\n  \nBiggest mistake I see people make is skipping straight to \"build a SaaS\" when they have no income, no network, and no understanding of what people actually pay for.

But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks.

Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

After **35 years in business and 15 years mentoring of founders**, I’ve seen that 'faking it until you make it' has mutated into 'faking it to sell how to fake it.'\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this the **Circle of Lust for Round Zero**. It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that the only 'clean' content is a bank statement that matches the tax returns.\n\n**Quick question:** Beyond the technical glitches, what do you think is the biggest 'red flag' in the way these gurus talk about the actual operations of the business?",

Whether that problem is fulfilling a need for landscaping in your area, or designing a new SaaS software for a niche industry, it needs to solve a problem.\n\nIf you’re just wanting to start a business doing something, start small and do what others have done. Start a landscaping or pressure washing business, you can do all the work yourself and the tools can be found cheap on Facebook marketplace. Knock on doors and get a few customers. One thing leads to another and you learn a lot along the way.\n\nOther ideas are usually found by just observation. I have a friend who started a software company to help solve a problem in recycling that he saw on an internship he had in college. He turned that into the multi-million dollar business that he runs today. He was already studying software engineering, so he was able to build it all himself with a couple friends. Same concept as the landscaping, just a larger scale. Sometimes you just need to be exposed to things in order to find the hole you need to fill in a market.",

There will be fees and taxes you can't always plan for. \n   * Understand what the bottom line profit is as it can often be less than estimated to begin with.\n   * Recognize cash flow is critical and many profitable businesses fail when they run out of cash.\n   * Bookkeeping and accounting is hard to learn and time consuming, but is required to know where your business is at to make good decesions.\n   * Taxes are both required and can ruin a business if not paid. Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

Ask the AI for a feasibility study, and an overview of the size of the market. \n\nIf it sounds financially feasible to build a prototype (probably several thousand), draw a crappy sketch on a piece of paper, and when you’re happy with it, find a 3D modeling person on UpWork on the cheaper side. \n\nSend the completed model out to whatever local vendors Grok can find given whatever the materials are, and pull the trigger if they agree to provide a prototype only. Do not send it to China. Make sure that you understand the cost for a batch from that vendor if the prototype sells. Plug that number back into the projection to determine the price you should charge for the item. \n\nThe prototype is what you take pictures of and put on a Shopify website to gauge demand. Worst case, you have a cool thing you wanted. Best case, many other people on earth also want that thing.\n\nI also strongly agree with the other post about creating an audience around the type of things you might build. A following is a massive benefit for showcasing a product. If you don’t want to create your own online content, you can always send your thing to influencers in that space for free for a review. They need content for their channels.",

The first step usually isn’t “come up with a business”, it’s learning how to notice problems and how people already solve them day to day.\n\nMost businesses start from one of three places: something you keep seeing go wrong, something people complain about a lot, or something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Paying attention to those things is more useful early on than trying to force an idea.\n\nDay to day, business is a lot less glamorous than it sounds. It’s mostly understanding a problem clearly, trying a simple way to help, seeing what doesn’t work, and adjusting. The journey usually starts with observation, not inspiration.",

Spend the next 30 days paying attention to every time you hear someone complain about something, struggle with a process, or waste time on something annoying. Write it down. After a month you will have a list of real problems people actually have.\n\n  \nThen pick one that genuinely interests you and just try to solve it for one person. Not a business. Not an app. Not a brand. Just solve the problem manually for one actual human being. If they would pay you for it, you have something. If not, try the next one.\n\n  \nThe other thing nobody tells you is that the day to day of business is mostly just talking to people. Selling, negotiating, following up, handling complaints. If you are not comfortable with that yet, get a sales job or do freelance work for a bit. That skill alone will carry you further than any business course.\n\n  \nAlso skip the LLC, the logo, the website, and the business plan until you have paying customers. I have seen way too many people spend months on that stuff and never actually sell anything. The legal and branding stuff takes a week to set up once you actually need it.",

Getting close to how money actually moves**  \nWork somewhere small. Startup, local business, freelance gigs, student org that sells something.

When you’re useful AND quick, people pull you into opportunities.\n\n**3. Talk to people who are building stuff**  \nAsk what’s hard, what breaks, what wastes time.\n\nEvery business is just a solution to a recurring annoyance.

Learn sales, basic digital marketing, or how to build something (code, design, or a physical trade). You can't lead a team if you don't understand the work.\n2. **The Friction List:** for one week, write down every time you (or people around you) say 'I wish this was easier' or 'Why does this take so long?'. Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it. That is the only real 'Step One'.\n\nWhat is one skill you already have that someone might pay $20 for right now?",

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up. The people who stay in the conversation after hearing \"paid discovery\" are almost always the ones who actually close.",

If they won’t commit time, money, or even a clear scope on their side, it usually means they’re still in “shopping for ideas” mode, not “buying a solution” mode.\n\nA few things I learned the hard way:\n\nIf they already have an in-house team but don’t mention it early, assume they’re benchmarking you against internal options. That doesn’t mean walk away immediately, but it does mean no free builds. At most, high-level walkthroughs or concept sketches.\n\nPay attention to how concrete the conversation is. Buyers talk about timelines, budgets, and consequences if something doesn’t get done. Idea collectors talk about possibilities, features, and “what ifs”.\n\nOne simple filter that saves a lot of pain is flipping the ask. Instead of “I’ll build a demo”, say “let’s do a paid discovery or pilot”. Even a small paid engagement changes the dynamic completely. The people who disappear were never serious. The ones who stay usually are.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this only comes with getting burned once or twice. It’s not stupidity, it’s tuition.\n\nThe fact you caught it and are asking how to spot it earlier means you’ll handle the next one much better.",
