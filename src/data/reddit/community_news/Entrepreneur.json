      "text": "I sell workflow optimization services to small businesses. For months, my cold emails got ignored.\n\nThe problem wasn't the service. It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

          "text": "This principle applies to so many business conversations beyond just sales pitches. I've seen the same thing with customer communication channels.\n\n\n\nBusinesses will say \"We have omnichannel support\" or \"We use AI chatbots\" - and customers tune out immediately. But when you say \"Text us anytime, we respond in under 2 minutes\" - suddenly people lean in.\n\n\n\nThe pattern you've identified isn't just about avoiding buzzwords. It's about starting the conversation where your customer's pain lives, not where your solution lives.\n\n\n\nYour \"before\" pitch answered \"What do you do?\" Your \"after\" pitch answered \"What problem do I have that you fix?\"\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add: the specificity matters too. \"15+ hours/week\" and \"cut that to 2\" are concrete numbers that make it real. Vague promises like \"save time\" or \"increase efficiency\" don't land the same way because people can't visualize them.\n\n\n\nSMBs especially respond to this because they're drowning in vendor pitches all day. The moment you demonstrate you understand their actual daily reality (not just industry pain points), you're in a different category.",

I see this all the time with SMBs - they don't care about the tech stack, they care about getting their weekends back.\n\n\n\nOne thing to add: the communication channel matters as much as the message. A lot of SMB owners are drowning in email but will respond to a text within minutes. If you're doing cold outreach, consider testing SMS vs email with the same value-focused pitch.\n\n\n\nI've seen response rates jump 3-4x just by meeting them where they already are (phone) vs where we want them to be (email/forms).\n\n\n\nYour point about \"show the math\" is crucial. When you can say \"you're spending $2k/month on admin time for X task, I can do it for $500\" - that's a conversation starter, not a sales pitch. The decision basically makes itself.\n\n\n\nFor anyone reading this struggling with the same thing: ask yourself \"what specific task is eating their time?\" not \"what can my tool do?\" The minute you can name the exact pain point, your pitch writes itself.",

I'd heard him ask the same question on a podcast. \n* Had my answer ready. He pushed back on market size. I'd already rehearsed that objection multiple times. \n* He wanted to know \"why you?\" - I knew from his content he values founder-market fit over credentials, so I leaned into that.\n\nHe committed on the call. $50K wired last week.\n\nSame pitch deck. Same me. The only difference was how prepared I was.\n\nWalking into a pitch already knowing how someone thinks, what they care about, and how they communicate changes everything.\n\nAnyone else do this level of research before investor calls?

I oversimplified it especially because I haven't gotten to the second season yet, though I have immensely enjoyed the first.\n\nSynecdoche, New York is my favourite movie of all time, and is a surrealist movie focused on many themes, some of which (in my opinion) are those of existential anxiety, neurotic obsessions with perfection, internal fragmentation, and the importance of every small person as crucial element of the whole of society. In this movie, >!at a certain point, the main character begins writing and rehearsing a play in a gigantic warehouse to be his magnum opus. As time progresses, the play is never finished, but evolves in constantly self-referential ways, with actors hired to play the part of people in the main character's life, and then actors to play the actors themselves, inside a second warehouse within the first. Eventually, the main character even casts someone to play himself in the play and actually gets replaced by another actor (in what many claim to be an allusion to transgenderism). This muddles the line between reality and fiction ever more in a movie which barely has any footing in reality anyway. !< The Rehearsal is sometimes compared to Synecdoche, New York due to this \"actors playing actors\" fact.\n\nI personally find that Synecdoche New York is the closest I've ever seen to Fernando Pessoa's body of work. Fragmentation laid bare. Every feeling that was ever felt and will ever be felt is, in a way, in this movie, because everyone is in this movie, and no one is.",

          "text": "This is smart but the real unlock nobody in this thread is talking about: do this for customer calls, not just investor pitches.\n\nI spent months optimizing my investor pitch. Got great at it. Raised money. Then realized I had no idea how to sell the actual product to actual customers because I had never studied them with the same intensity.\n\nThe investor pitch is a one-time performance. Customer conversations happen every single day and they compound. Every customer call you walk into unprepared is revenue you left on the table.\n\nWhat I do now before every important customer call: I pull their LinkedIn, their company blog, their recent job postings (tells you what they are investing in), their Glassdoor reviews (tells you what is broken internally), and any podcast appearances. Feed it to Claude and ask it to roleplay as this person pushing back on my product.\n\nThe job postings thing is the real cheat code nobody talks about. If a company is hiring for a role related to what you sell, they have already decided to invest in solving that problem. You are not convincing them they have a problem. You are convincing them your solution is better than hiring someone.\n\nOne customer call where I did this prep resulted in a 6-figure annual contract. They literally said \"it feels like you understand our business better than most people who work here.\" I did. Because I spent 2 hours studying them like they were a final exam.\n\nThe meta lesson: preparation is the most underrated competitive advantage in business. Most people wing it. The ones who don't, win disproportionately.",

          "text": "Great if it worked for you, I would put me off however.\n\nSome background: I'm part of a local investment group, an initiative from a private bank. Think we are around 60 ppl atm. There are days when there are 20-30 pitches scheduled, and we know beforehand what kind of business it is and when they pitch, so we don't have to be there all the time (though of course the bank always makes sure there are at least 5 people for a pitch, and sometimes if you see something interesting you recommend it to the others and they get to pitch a 2nd time). If you want in it's up to you to decide your size: e.g. once I invested 3k while someone else invested 80k in the same business (total was € 125k). Obviously there are different tiers of investors: I'm small potatoes compared to some captains of industry. Which is what makes this actually work: as a small potato I am often quite involved, which sort of reassures the big potatoes. I think it's an awesome concept and the bank does a great job with their recommendations.\n\nAnyway, it's very obvious when someone has tailor made their pitch to score a particular big potato. And I'd say 90% of the time it has the opposite effect. However what is true in my experience, is that investors like to ask the same questions. So being prepared for those is definitely a positive (mine for example is how they see themselves collaborate with other companies).\n\nSee it like going on a date: being too cheesy is a turn off.",

For example a quite old fashioned business wanted to go digital to scale, so I was kept in the loop and could review all design/business decisions, attended ~10 meetings over the course of 1,5 year. Meanwhile big potato will ask me in an informal way/setting how it's going with the project from time to time.\n\nThe upside for me is threefold:  \na/ I can get in these potentially lucrative projects really early without having (to risk too) much capital, i.e. much less than those who these projects are typically presented to first. \n\nb/ I can have a direct impact on the success (think the difference between having access to the significant experience/expertise of 5 small potatoes for free and not having that access).\n\nc/ I have direct access to really big potatoes, with some on a personal level, which opens up all kind of other opportunities.\n\nNow there have been instances where a business of one of the investors (including mine) gets chosen as an external partner/supplier if it makes sense.

So we went dark for 8 months and built.\n\nNo blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.\n\nWe launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like \"now what.\"\n\nThe product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.\n\nHeres what I do completely differently now:\n\nI dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.\n\nI build in public now. Not in the cringey \"day 47 of my startup journey\" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.\n\nI stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.\n\nThe stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.\n\nIf you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",

Before that I spent a decade working at other peoples companies, convinced I was \"learning\" when really I was just comfortable.\n\nThe kids building things at 16 have one advantage: they dont know what failure looks like so they arent afraid of it. Thats it. Everything else favors you. You have context for real problems. You have savings (or at least a credit history). You have professional relationships. You know how businesses actually operate from the inside.\n\nMy first company flopped. Built it in stealth for 8 months because I was paranoid someone would steal the idea. Nobody cared. Not because it was bad, but because nobody knew it existed. I was 33 and felt like a complete idiot.\n\nStarted again at 34. This time I talked to 50 potential customers before writing a single line of code. Within 6 weeks I had my first paying user. The difference wasnt talent or timing. It was that I finally had the maturity to do the uncomfortable thing first instead of hiding behind the fun stuff.\n\nThe honest truth about starting at 35: your biggest enemy isnt age. Its the voice in your head that says you should have figured this out by now. That voice is lying. Most successful founders I know started their winning company after 30. The ones who started younger just failed more times before they found the thing that worked.\n\nYou have maybe 30+ working years ahead of you. That is an absurd amount of time. Start now and stop comparing your beginning to someone elses middle.",

That would be so bomb for me. Seriously.  \n  \nA little context on me: I'm 30, internet/tech/ecom/marketing/AI are my bag of skills. For me, pursuing my own business - win or fail - is my #1 goal. Has been for 6 years. And I am absolutely paralyzed into inaction from 100% mental nonsense.\n\nI'm the doer of the year behind closed doors. I happily spend buku hours buried in my laptop developing ideas, having new ones, building, learning, going crazy on projects, and so much AI. I can \"do\" very seriously in this sense. From that, I have more than a few business routes I could take right now.\n\nI just simply can't pull myself to make it known to the world. If it's a service, I can't bring myself to try and sell it to a business. If I want to meet others working toward goals like mine, I can't post the social media.\n\nI could use some collaboration, pretty tough, even just a chat or email. I know I can get out of this twisted perception with some outside perspectives- and just let myself try, at this point. \n\nThanks regardless,  \nEric",

          "text": "Okay as someone that runs a business, and i've built many. I'm also also a father of ten children from 7-33 years old.\n\nBreathe.\n\nThe key is you have to find your path. It really is a journey, not a destination. There's no biological clock ticking here.\n\nYou have to understand with business.You must bring value to the marketplace.Because it doesn't give a shit about your wants or needs.It will only reward value if you survive.\n\nThere's a reason most successful business owners are in their forties.\n\nYou're a baby on the timeline.\n\nDisregard the do what you're passionate about bullshit.\nDon't look for shortcuts.Because the secret is buried in the work that everyone's trying to avoid always take the hard path. It pays the best in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need.\n\nSkills \nKnowledge \nExperience \nCharacter \nTime\n\nThe good news is, you can get all of those things from just about any job in the world. Even multiple jobs if you bounce around. Any job that can make payroll consistently is further ahead than most small businesses. They've already survived the cut.\n\nI recommend sales. Even if and even if you're an introvert like me.And if you suck at it, because you suck at everything you start at. Anyone can do it. There's also no limit on how much you can make or learn or grow.\n\nWhatever job you get, whatever industry you work in.Because you have to pay your bills. You're gonna spend more time there than you will with those that you love or the things that you love.That's life it's unfair and nobody's coming to save you.\n\nSo be the best at your job, even if it means you're not getting paid for it be better than that. I treated every job like I owned the company. Then, when you're not at work, work harder on yourself than you do your job.\n\nYou have to understand to run a business in the early years.You're doing everything by yourself.With no capital and very little time. You need to be able to do the sales, the order fulfillment, the purchasing, the marketing, the managing, the finances and quickbooks, and the hiring and firing.\n\nLearn every one of those roles at whatever company you're at, by just being curious, which is a skill set.And helpful. The people that are employed that say, well, that's not my job.Or I don't get paid enough to do that.Those are the unhelpful fucking people and they don't learn shit.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nSpend ten years building you while paying your bills. Listen to biographies on founder's podcast, all of them over and over again. You will learn so much more at different times of your life.From biographies than you will from any other business book that i've read.And i've got a fucking library like literally a library, and we're building a library in the town we live in so two fucking libraries. Personal and public because when you make a shitload of money, you should build libraries.\n\nBuild your skills.\nQuickbooks is definitely top of the list on financial tools. When you get a couple paychecks, buy an old desktop version and create a fake company with fake vendors. Fake customers fake invoices, fake bank accounts fake credit cards, fake purchasing fake, receiving and play business in that sandbox until you master quickbooks. When you get hung up on something, go online and look at youtube. OR work on your networking and social engineering skills and make friends with the people that are in the accounting department, payroll department accounts, receivable, payable department at your job and ask them, hey, my wife and I are hung up on this with our quick books.How would you get through this?\n\nPeople love to help when it's something they're good at.\n\nVolunteer some hours late at night, or on the weekend to help the warehouse.Get orders out when they're busier to do inventory at the job that you work. Help I t set up new computers and monitors for the new salespeople or whatever when you get a chance. Don't count the cost.\n\nStudy, whatever industry you're in, find out who the top five players are.And see what they do to come to market differently from the company.That you're in currently. Why do they do it? How did the company work for start? Who is the first person that got hired?And why? Learn everything about the supply chains and the distribution chains and the channels to market and the customers themselves.\n\nAll of these things will paint a picture for you.And you will understand where you're at better than anyone around you.That's just punching a clock doing their job.Because you're not paid to do all that extra shit.\n\nOver the years, you're gonna build up undeniable skill, sets experiences and knowledge.And your character's gonna develop, because character's not just being honest.I'm a good guy.I've got good character, no, it's resilience.It's fortitude, it's perseverance.It's living outside your comfort zone to where you can't even see the fucking boundary.Because it's so far away and you're so uncomfortable.But that's where you grow.That's the gift!\n\nOver time years for me, it was decades. You'll start to see things and question em and dig and research further.And then bring them to the owners of the company and say, what if we did this differently like this. Don't bring it to him until you have a plan.As if you were gonna bring it to market that day. They're gonna tell you someone older, smarter.Wiser, more educated, more experienced would have done it.If it was possible or even the arrogant owner themselves will tell you they would have done it. But if you've proven yourself as undeniably valuable at your job, they're gonna say, if you want to mess with that, go ahead, mess with it.In your free time.\n\nHere's where you get to build more experience. You get to bring something to market and you won't get credit for it.And you won't get paid for it.In most cases, you'll make a company a lot of money.And you'll just get screwed.\n\nBut they can't take the skills or the knowledge or the experience or the character that you get to build in that process away from you.\n\nYour character is a soft component.It's your personal value.\n\nYou can't find something if you don't already have it. You must find something of value and bring it to the marketplace.But first you have to become valuable.\n\nThis is what i've done.And it's worked every time. It's not the short path. It's not the easiest path. But anyone can do it. When you get further down the path, you can reply to me and I'll help you with the how too's.\n\nIt's worth it.",

I spend countless hours researching seemingly mundane industries. I try to find the corners that need to be thought around. A lot of people assume that these big billion dollar corporations have everything tied up tightly.\n\nWhat I seem to find is that there are tons of crumbs. These opportunities that I find look like severe risk. Usually, there is a lot of risk. Just in the fact that the companies that you're competing against can crush you by giving the parts away for free, if they really wanted to. Especially in the first few years, getting traction.\n\nThat's why my channel to market is direct.Calling the customers and bypassing distribution channels traditionally established. I don't do online advertising or online sales or any marketing.Because that shines a light on me.And I don't want the biggest players to see what i'm doing until it's too late. Once I control the market share, I can do anything I want.But by then, marketing doesn't really help me gain customers.Because I already control the market.\n\nIt's a long slow process. It's full of dead ends. To me, it's the ultimate game, though better than any video game better than my passions for rock, climbing or sailing or surfing. To me it's the last life or death game.That man has that we can play with.\n\nThe goal is to find the value to bring to the market place. That might be by rewriting the traditional distribution chain in an industry. Combined with revamping the channels to market. Or it might be bringing the first import version, always of higher quality. At half the price. It might be taking a part that's been used one way for decades and finding a new life for it.\n\nThere's so many ways to build wealth out there through opportunities. But everyone's looking for the shortcut. When it's hidden in the work that they're trying to avoid. There's never a guarantee in any of the research of the searches. It's just like playing with puzzle pieces.\n\nThat's what i'm passionate about. I would sell dirty diapers if it was moral, legal and ethical. And it fit my principles, and I could find a way to bring more value to the marketplace.\n\nMy next ten year goal is a billion dollars in revenue. We fire surpass the need for money ourselves. But we have a lot of charitable giving that we feed, and that'll be never ending. So my wife and I have decided that we will never stop.And we will work until the day we die.",

Services look unsexy but they teach you sales, communication, and problem solving fast, and those skills transfer to almost any business later. You do not need to love the idea, you just need to tolerate it enough to learn from it.\n\nThe trap you want to avoid is waiting for clarity before starting. Clarity usually shows up after you have tried a few things and failed a bit. Pick something small, cheap, and reversible, give it a few months, and see what you learn. Even if it does not work, it will make the next idea much clearer.\n\nNot knowing what you want to build yet does not mean you are behind.

Should I do job? Should I do my own business? And then after that, when I decided I will do my own job, then what kind of job, what kind of business, what kind of products? I mean, I was always confused because the main reason was what I noticed in like seven to eight years when I was struggling with these kind of things, I was struggling with my own thoughts. I noticed I was comparing with myself with others' people and thinking that I am a slow person. I'm thinking that I do not have the capability to do something. Okay, instead I have to do, I have to work on my skill.\n\nI was just noticing others' people's stories, just like you are doing right now. So that pattern, I also had that time. So it is called a validation, you can say. Taking validation from external. And this happens when, when you don't know your own voice, when you don't know what is your belief. Because your beliefs are not your beliefs, okay, right now. Your beliefs are from The world that shaped  you from the people around you that you. So what pattern I have noticed in myself and I think you should also notice in yourself, maybe you can relate with me. So I'm just honestly sharing my journey a little bit.\n\nSo maybe it will help you out. First of all, taking validation, yeah. What do i mean by taking validation? If I am comparing with other people. Even though I know the whole thing that, okay, social media is fake, still, still my belief are not trusting that thoughts. They believe that, yes, I am slow or not doing anything because of reality because your are not doing anything that's why you think alot.. okay. \n\nSo I was always talking negative about myself because I was comparing, I was taking validation. I was not sure what to do i had no comfidnce, I wanted to do something, but not for me that time. I wanted to do something for the world, for other people to show, show up, you can say. So I was not even honest with myself. Right now, what ever I'm sharing, I faced my honesty, truth. I set with my ugly thoughts after seven to eight years, I got to realize that these are the patterns and the root cause was different.\n\nThe root cause was just one thing. And that was... I just have to believe myself. I just do not have to show everyone. I just do not have to prove anyone. I don't have to prove anyone in this world. I just have to be with myself and just try to figure out the root cause of what's I'm dealing with it. Because it's not about the business or anything. It's about what's going on in your world. What's the thing that affected that you are believing like this? \n\nWhat do you adapt in your circumstance that you are talking negative about yourself? I mean, there are lots of things that I wanted to share with you, but that's the pattern I noticed. The main thing is, I would say that stop taking validation it will be hard at first and I would just suggest you recommend one thing. Just sit in silence with yourself  I mean, no phone, no nothing. I would also  suggest you go for lak . Just go for a walk in the park and just notice around, what people are doing. And just do walk at least 10 to 15 minutes. And whatever the thoughts coming in your mind, maybe related to your business or anything, you will get the answer. Just do it for at least 7 days and you will maybe get the idea that you are looking right now.",

Most real businesses start as “this kinda sucks, I’ll try to make it slightly better.” Boring > brilliant. Don’t pre-optimize problems you don’t have. Tons of legit businesses start from a bedroom with zero paperwork at the beginning. Product vs service: services are usually easier when you’re broke and inexperienced. Product businesses are harder, slower, and riskier early on. You don’t need to be an expert yet. Pick something you’re slightly better at than average or willing to learn fast.\n\nAlso: SaaS being “trendy” doesn’t mean it’s the path. I didn’t code when I started either. Most people learn after committing, not before.\n\nThe biggest trap is waiting until you feel “ready” or confident. That day never comes. Start tiny, embarrassingly tiny. A $100/month win beats a perfect idea that never launches.\n\nIf you take one thing from this: clarity comes from action, not thinking.",

Most successful businesses start messy, small, and boring.\n\nStop waiting for inspiration. Start with observation. What frustrates you daily? What do your friends complain about? What takes too long, costs too much, or just sucks? That's your idea, wrapped in a real problem people will actually pay to fix.\n\n**SFW ideas:** Freelance what you already know, writing, design, social media management for local businesses. They're desperate for help and have budgets. Or flip products: buy wholesale, sell on marketplaces. Low risk, immediate feedback.\n\n**NSFW ideas:** The adult industry is exploding with opportunity and most of it requires zero tech skills. Content creators need managers, marketers, editors, virtual assistants. Or go B2B, adult brands need the same services as any other business: marketing, customer service, logistics.\n\nHere's what separates winners from wannabes: execution speed.

You've already answered that elsewhere (Actually, before even asking the PvS question) by telling us about your lack of resources. If you lack resources, then service is THE way to go, at least initially. Nothing you do is ever set in stone, so you can pivot into production later, when you have the resources to do so. \n\nYou mentioned business consulting or PR. Those are tough to sell at your age without a proven track record. Look for \"doing\" services instead of \"advising\" services. Can you manage social media? Can you write copy? Can you edit short-form video? Can you handle basic administrative tasks for a local business?\n\nHere's what I'd do to start (Remember, this is just advice, not THE way to go) Pick one boring service, find one person who needs it, and try to make $100 or equivelant. Once you do that, the \"cloud\" of ideas usually starts to clear because you're actually in the game instead of watching from the sidelines. Have you ever heard that it's easier to find a job when you already have one? The same applies here, once you're actually IN THERE doing SOMETHING, no matter how small, you'll find more oppurtunities.\n\nThe very best advice I can give... NEVER be afraid to fail.",

We could probably have found someone online who would have told us they could \"do that too\" for way less, but we need the proven experience in this very field to know that we get the quality we need.\n\nI'm afraid that you're in a realm where people might now rather ask AI for services as you're not able to position yourself above it.\n\nAt some point you mentioned even USD200 would make a big difference. That might be true for you, but for most reputable companies, that's so cheap it appears utterly ridiculous to be professional for anything.",

What you’re describing isn’t laziness or failure it’s what happens when multiple things collapse at once: layoffs, a brutal job market, bias, and rising costs. That combination breaks even very capable people.\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how bad things are right now. Many jobs are posted without real intent to hire, freelance work is oversaturated, and ghosting has become normal. On top of that, bias against people from certain regions is real, even if no one says it out loud. None of that reflects your skills or work ethic.\n\nYou’re also not “begging” for work you’re trying to survive. There’s no shame in that. The problem isn’t that you’re asking; it’s that desperation in a broken market often goes unanswered, no matter how qualified someone is.\n\nOne thing that might help is narrowing your offer drastically. Instead of “we do digital marketing, social media, automation,” try one very specific outcome for one specific type of client. Broad services feel risky to clients right now; narrow, concrete help feels safer.\n\nIf you need to take temporary, underpaid, or unpleasant work just to keep the lights on, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed it means you’re buying time. Survival comes before pride. This season does not define you.\n\nLastly, please don’t internalize the judgment from others. People who haven’t been here often believe hardship only happens to those who “did something wrong.” That belief protects them emotionally, but it isn’t true.\n\nYou’re not broken. You’re exhausted, under pressure, and navigating a system that’s failing a lot of people quietly. Keep going one step at a time, and if possible, accept help without shame when it’s offered. Wanting to work and contribute already says everything about you.",

Create case studies, loom videos, or free audits that prove competence before the call. Trust is built before the meeting, not during.\n\n3. Target companies that already hire remote/international talent. Look for \"async-first\" or \"distributed team\" in their job posts.\n\n4. LinkedIn outreach with warmth. We built a tool (ReactIn) specifically because cold outreach was painful. The key is engaging with their content first, then reaching out.

          "text": "I’m really sorry you’re going through this. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like laziness or lack of effort. It sounds like bad timing mixed with a tough market and a lot of pressure all at once.\n\nOne honest thing that might be hurting you right now is offering too many services at once. When people are scared to spend, “digital marketing + social + automation” feels vague to buyers, even if the skills are real. They usually trust one very specific outcome more than a general offer.\n\n  \nA few practical resets that might help, not quick fixes but clearer steps:\n\n\\- Try selling one small, very specific result instead of services. Something boring but concrete.\n\n\\- Avoid monthly retainers for now. They are hard to close when trust is low. One-time, fixed work is easier.\n\n\\- Show your thinking publicly before asking for money. Short Loom audits, breakdowns, examples of how you’d approach a problem.\n\n\\- Taking underpaid or survival work right now is not a failure. It’s just getting through a hard phase.  \n\n\nAbout “begging for work”, asking for work is not begging. It only feels like begging when the offer isn’t clear, both to you and to the buyer.\n\nYou don’t sound incapable or dishonest. You sound stuck in a market that is brutal to generalists right now. Narrowing what you sell and who you sell it to usually brings back some control.\n\nI really hope things stabilize for you soon. What you’re dealing with is harder than most people online admit.",

          "text": "Hey guys, freelance UK marketer and solo agency owner here, really sorry to hear how hard it's been, the economy has been beyond brutal.  Wishing you the best and hope things get better for you soon.\n\nI've utilised marketing contractors and agencies from all over the world during my 10 years or so doing this, both solo and on behalf of clients. Here are some things that I think would help you:\n\n- Website, make one. Seriously. I won't hire any freelancers without a portfolio or website. Even an Upwork profile with some portfolio pieces and feedback, or a simple Wix with some links will do. If I can't see evidence of some work somewhere, I don't trust you - this rule applies to anyone I screen regardless of location.\n\n- I sell a lot of services, but I pitch one thing as an opener. For example, first website I made started as a graphic design and content creation project, first PR retainer started with a website copy overhaul, first strategy consultation as copywriting etc. \n\n- As such, don't pitch for retainers, do one project really well, then open up subtly about other services. I learnt this selling for marketing agencies before I went solo. You need to prove trust as a small company with some wins before the client invests. Pick the 3 things you're best at and proven in as your opener.\n\n- Niche down in industry. I offer a lot of services through my own skills and subcontractors, but I'm in a tech niche that I have a network and 10+ years experience in. If you don't have one, find something underserved with less competition. No one wants general services anymore, you either specialise in a few or run lots in specific verticals like luxury, D2C, local businesses, AI, games, telecoms, SaaS etc\n\n- You're understandably scared and I can read it in your text, no offense. Potential clients smell fear a mile away. It's a confidence game. Find something, even part-time or low paid, to keep you afloat. Building a business is very hard with no safety net - been there many times in my career and it sucks. Truly. \n\nBusiness always improved, ironically, when I felt good in of myself and sometimes when I was doing a low-paid job and felt some financial relief. Get some rest, make some time for hobbies, animals and friends, you're both working hard and deserve it 💜",

But I want to share something that might help reframe what's happening.\n\nI went through a period where I couldn't land a single client for 4 months. Not because I was bad at what I did, but because I was selling the wrong thing to the wrong people in the wrong way. I kept pitching \"digital marketing services\" which is what every freelancer on the planet offers. There was nothing for a prospect to grab onto.\n\nWhat changed everything was getting brutally specific. Instead of \"we do digital marketing,\" I started saying \"I'll set up your abandoned cart email sequence and you'll recover 5-15% of lost sales within 2 weeks.\" Same skills. Same me. Completely different response rate.\n\nThe painful truth about service businesses is that \"a range of services from digital marketing social media to automation\" sounds like everything and nothing at the same time. When a client reads that, they think \"this person does a bit of everything\" which translates to \"this person isn't the expert I need for my specific problem.\"\n\nPick the ONE thing you're best at. Not the 5 things you can do. The ONE thing. Then find the specific type of business that desperately needs that one thing and can't do it themselves.\n\nAlso - and I say this with zero judgment because I've been there - when you're desperate, prospects can feel it. It changes the energy of every interaction. The meetings where I finally closed were the ones where I genuinely stopped caring whether they said yes because I'd accepted that I'd survive either way. That mental shift is almost impossible to fake but it's the difference between \"please hire us\" energy and \"here's what I can do for you, take it or leave it\" energy.\n\nYou're not failing because you're from Africa or because you lack skills. You're failing because the positioning is too broad and the desperation is leaking through. Both of those are fixable.",

Freelancers who benefited from the good times are now struggling. Things change constantly. This is business and so many are struggling.

You would be better off finding local jobs or increase your skill levels.

          "text": "First, I just want to say: I recognize this place you’re in. It’s not laziness, and it’s not a lack of effort. It’s that strange modern kind of suffering where you’re doing *everything right* on paper and still watching doors stay closed. I’ve been there myself. I’ve had stretches where I went from feeling capable and employed to invisible almost overnight. You start questioning reality, your worth, even the rules of the game. What hurts most isn’t the money, it’s the feeling that no one is actually giving you a fair chance to show what you can do.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way is that the internet job market is broken right now. A lot of posts aren’t real, a lot of people are window-shopping, and fear of scams has made everyone cold. Ghosting isn’t personal anymore, it’s structural. And when you’re already stressed, every silence feels like rejection. I also learned that “don’t beg” advice is usually said by people who haven’t been truly desperate. Survival changes the rules. There’s no shame in asking, pivoting, downsizing, or even taking imperfect work while you rebuild momentum. Pride doesn’t pay rent, progress does.\n\nSomething that helped me mentally was separating *my value* from the market’s behavior. The market is chaotic, biased, and often unfair. Especially when people hear “Africa,” they silently make assumptions even if they won’t admit it. That’s not on you. What *is* in your control is tightening your positioning: showing one very specific service instead of many, showing proof fast, offering tiny starter projects, and making it easy for someone to say yes without risk. Not because you’re weak, but because people are scared buyers right now.\n\nMost importantly: you’re not broken for feeling exhausted and confused. This era is weird. People are poorer, more suspicious, more overwhelmed. You’re still doing the right thing by trying to work instead of giving up. Keep protecting your sense of dignity while also being practical about survival. Sometimes the next chapter doesn’t start with a big win, it starts with one small foothold. I really hope one shows up for you soon. You’re not alone in this, even when it feels like the world is pretending you are.",

It is prolonged financial stress mixed with constant rejection, and that can break even the strongest people. The fact that you are still showing up, still trying to work, still asking for help instead of giving up says a lot about you both.\n\nOne hard truth that might help is that offering too many services at once often makes people trust you less, not more. When everything is on the table, clients struggle to understand what problem you actually solve, especially online where trust is already fragile. Add global bias and scam fatigue on top of that, and people default to ghosting rather than saying no. It is brutal, but it is not personal, and it does not mean your skills have no value.\n\nRight now survival matters more than pride or perfect positioning. If possible, narrow to one very specific outcome you can deliver fast, even temporarily, and package it in a way that feels low risk for the client and manageable for you. At the same time, please do not isolate yourselves emotionally. This kind of pressure is too much to carry alone. You are not failing because you did not work hard enough. You are stuck in a system that is unforgiving, and that distinction matters.",

I didn't take his money even though he tried to pay me multiple times. \n\nIts because of the mindset and culture I developed. \n\nYou never want to step over dollars trying to pick up pennies.\n\n I had a new salesperson with me and I was trying to teach her the ropes. She didn't understand why I didn't take the guys money. \n\nWe got in the truck and drafted 3 different proposals to the customer. The kitchen, the kitchen AND bathroom, and the kitchen and 2 bathrooms. \n\nIt wasnt an easy decision to turn him down, but the culture is luxury and we dont want to chase the small jobs. It puts you in a downward spiral. You reminded me of that when you said you wanted customers to pay you 200 or 300. That signals you are cheap and no one worth it is cheap. \n\nAnother thing. Probably the MOST important.\nHave you tried praying about it? If you seek for financial gain, you'll most likely not receive it.

I do own a small cosmetics manufacturing business that pays for the bills, but doesn't seem to grow beyond where it's at now, so I was supplementing things with doing a little IT consulting here and there.\n\nI decided to stop pursuing to grow the cosmetics manufacturing and focus on the IT work back in November so I put an ad in the local newspaper closest to me. That's the one that's yielding me a much busier flow of customers. \n\nThis week, I asked to be put on two more remote towns that are about 30 minutes and 1 hour away from me. I know each of those ads will yield me another 1-5 calls a week each, but what I decided to do there was to charge a 2 hour minimum per visit. I'm sure some customers will turn me away because they'll find the rate to be too ghih, but if I can get 1-2 at 2 hours minimum, then it's worth the drive. I have an EV which costs me next to nothing to charge.\n\nIf I'm busy that week, then I quote a higher rate. \n\nI'm hoping that, with time, I can eventually hire someone who I can send to the further off places while I service the locals. \n\nI used to do this many years ago and had 5 techs working for me at one point, but started to pursue several startup ideas and spun my wheels. One of the startups is on automode now and gets me a couple of grand a year, but definitely not the millions I was hoping for haha.\n\n\nThe ad reads:\n\nThe top is\nLocal techs\nAt your service\n\nThen a list of the services I offer and to the right of it, there's a picture I generated of a \"nerd\" using AI.\n\nBelow that, it says:\n\nIf we can't fix it\nYOU DON'T PAY\n\nThen my number.\n\nVery basic. You can do this with anything, house cleaning business, etc. \n\nThe above only works in small country towns. Not in cities.",

Nobody tweets about building inventory management software for auto parts distributors. Its not sexy. It will never go viral. And thats exactly why competition is low.\n\n2. The customers are easy to find. They are literally posting job ads for roles that exist only to manage these manual processes. If a company is hiring a \"data entry specialist\" or \"operations coordinator\" you know they have a process that could be automated.\n\n3. Switching costs are insane. Once a company builds their workflow around your tool they will not switch for years. Thats recurring revenue with almost zero churn.\n\n4. You dont need venture capital. These businesses can be profitable from month one because you are replacing a salary not competing for attention.\n\nThe unsexy truth is that the best tech businesses solve problems that are too boring for most developers to care about.

I have trained smaller companies and individuals before but this is a whole beast in itself. From logistics, to fulfillment, to continued support after the 5 day training is over.\n\nI don't know how many of you are in the same position as I am but if you are in a spot where your back is against the wall, take it as a sign that you are exactly where you need to be. I have never felt pressure like this in such a long time because I was used to training employee sizes of < 50. Now I 20x it. \n\nInsane.\n\nI remember telling myself the key to make more money in business is to solve bigger problems. This is me solving a bigger problem. My back being against the wall is just what comes with it. It is situations like this that causes you to expand your knowledge base, your understanding as a business owner, and your willingness to adapt.\n\nI would love any feedback from anyone who has done huge training sessions for businesses before (does not have to be ai focused training). How did you fulfill? How long did you work with the enterprise for?\n\nI'm excited to deliver for this huge enterprise client but I'd be lying if I said I was not scared haha. Let's do this!",

Start everyone from the basics and give them a very streamlined 80/20 path to proceed. \n3. Backup your back up plan with another back up plan - something will always break\n4. Get help. More people makes a difference. Especially at your scale. \n5. Make it memorable. Emotions massively improve memory. Having jokes, active gestures, asking questions, and bringing energy is a requirement if you want them to be successful in the long term. \n6. Make it as active as you can for your students.

I've been messing around with custom AI workflows for businesses and honestly the ROI is insane when people actually know how to use the tools properly instead of just treating them like fancy Google.\n\nOne thing I've noticed though - group training is great for basics but the real value comes from setting up specific workflows for different departments. Like marketing teams need different prompts/agents than finance or ops. If you're not already doing department-specific use cases, that's where the magic happens.\n\nAlso curious - are you setting up any custom GPTs or API integrations for their specific workflows? That's where I've seen companies get the most sticky adoption vs just teaching people to use the chat interface.",

Batch it - maybe 50-100 per session with different skill levels. The \"beginner trying to learn Claude\" and \"power user wanting advanced prompting\" should NOT be in the same room.\n\nFulfillment trick: Record everything. Seriously. Your 5-day training becomes 50+ hours of reference material they can revisit. Also helps with the people who miss sessions.\n\nPost-training support: Set expectations upfront. Maybe 30 days of Slack/email support, then transition to monthly check-ins. Don't let it become \"lifetime tech support\" - learned that the hard way.\n\nThe fear is normal - I remember my first 200+ person training feeling like I was going to throw up. But here's the thing: they hired YOU because you know this stuff better than they do. You're not imposing on them, you're solving their problem.\n\nAlso: charge for the scale complexity, not just the headcount. 1,000 people isn't 20x harder than 50 - it's 50x harder.\n\nYou got this. Just don't forget to breathe during the first session 😅",

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily!\n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically!\n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog on our website every day! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier\n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point. \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

I feed it 5-10 posts from a prospect and ask \"what are their top 3 challenges?\"\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Data enrichment\\*\\*: [Apollo.io](http://Apollo.io) (free tier) or Clay to pull contact info + company data\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Personalization at scale\\*\\*: This is key - I use ChatGPT API to write first lines that reference something specific about each company.

Great for strategy work.\n\n📋 Outreach & follow-up agents : they draft personalized outreach, reminders, and sequences based on brief inputs rather than manual writing.\n\n🧠 Knowledge assistants : manage internal docs, product specs, meeting notes, and make them searchable via natural language.\n\n🪄 Content co-creation agents: help turn an idea into a structure, then into actionable drafts (not just fluff). The best ones give you *framework + context*, not just words.\n\n🤖 Workflow orchestrators:  agents that can chain tasks (e.g., scan email → summarize → propose actions → send replies) are still emerging, but super powerful when configured right.\n\nFor many teams, the ROI isn’t a single tool:  it’s how you *embed* an agent into a real workflow (e.g., weekly competitor summary + task suggestions, or automated status updates).\n\nCurious: what’s the biggest bott your team wants to remove first :  research, writing, communication, or execution?\n\n",

They're completely different things. Building a company is a marathon. Nobody trains for a marathon by running every single day until their knees give out. You train smart, you rest on purpose, and you show up fresh when it counts. The guilt comes from thinking rest is the opposite of work, but it's actually part of the work.\n\nHere's what actually shifted things for me: I stopped treating rest as \"not working\" and started treating it as a responsibility. Your business needs you thinking clearly, not running on fumes making bad calls. I've made some of my worst decisions (wrong product decisions, misread documents) during stretches where I was \"grinding\" on 5 hours of sleep and zero downtime. Those mistakes cost way more than a Tuesday off ever would.\n\nThe guilt probably won't disappear entirely. But you can get to a point where you feel it and take the day anyway, because you know the version of you that comes back rested is worth more than the version that pushed through.",

Here's what finally helped me reframe it:\n\nYour business needs you to make good decisions more than it needs you to be constantly busy. And good decision-making requires a brain that isn't fried. When you're burned out, you're not actually being productive - you're just present. There's a huge difference.\n\nI started treating rest days like business investments. Would I skip maintaining equipment because I'm too busy using it? No, because it would break. Your brain is your primary business tool.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n1. Schedule days off in advance, not when you're already exhausted. Put them on the calendar like client meetings. It's easier to take a day off when it's planned than when you wake up and decide that day.\n\n2. Define what a good rest day looks like FOR YOU. For me, it's not lying on the couch feeling guilty. It's doing something active that's not work - hiking, reading, building something with my hands. The physical activity actually helps more than passive rest.\n\n3. Track your output before and after rest days. I noticed my best work weeks almost always came after I took a real day off. The quality of thinking was just better.\n\n4. Remember that your competitors burning themselves out isn't an advantage for them - it's a vulnerability. The business that can sustain its pace wins, not the one that sprints until it collapses.\n\nThe restless feeling during time off? That fades once you prove to yourself that taking breaks doesn't derail everything. The first few times are the hardest.",

If it breaks while you’re gone, you just found a bug you need to fix.\n\nStop viewing rest as laziness and start viewing it as necessary maintenance for the Founder.

Survived every framework war, every paradigm shift, every \"X is dead\" prediction.\n\nBut this one feels different.\n\nI spent my entire career getting good at something that's being commoditized in real time. The thing that used to take me weeks - someone with zero experience and an AI tool can ship a version of it in a weekend. Not a great version, but good enough to get users. Good enough to compete.\n\nAnd here's the timing irony: after two decades of building other people's products, I finally decided to go out on my own. Build something for myself. Be the founder, not the contractor.\n\nExcept now I'm launching into a market where the barrier to entry basically disappeared overnight. Every niche I research already has 15 AI-generated competitors. Every idea I validate has someone who shipped it last week using cursor and a vibe. The moat I spent 22 years building - deep technical expertise - is getting shallower by the month.\n\nThe fear is real. Not \"oh no AI will take my job\" fear. More like \"I waited too long and the game changed while I was warming up\" fear.\n\nWhat I'm learning (slowly) is that the 22 years aren't worthless - they're just worth something different now. Knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than being able to build anything. Understanding why systems fail matters more when everyone can make them work on demo day. And the experience of shipping real products to real users with real money on the line... that doesn't come from a weekend hackathon.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said the doubt doesn't hit at 2am.\n\nAnyone else making the jump from senior dev to founder in this weird era?

Start a landscaping or pressure washing business, you can do all the work yourself and the tools can be found cheap on Facebook marketplace. Knock on doors and get a few customers. One thing leads to another and you learn a lot along the way.\n\nOther ideas are usually found by just observation. I have a friend who started a software company to help solve a problem in recycling that he saw on an internship he had in college. He turned that into the multi-million dollar business that he runs today. He was already studying software engineering, so he was able to build it all himself with a couple friends.

There can be a lot more to business than just coming up with a product or service people want and will pay for and which you can make a profit from. While this is important, there are other factors \n\nHere are some of the topics I had to learn the \"hard way\" and wish I had learned prior to opening my first business:\n\n* Financial management: Understand your costs, but be prepared for many more costs than you expect! There will be fees and taxes you can't always plan for. \n   * Understand what the bottom line profit is as it can often be less than estimated to begin with.\n   * Recognize cash flow is critical and many profitable businesses fail when they run out of cash.\n   * Bookkeeping and accounting is hard to learn and time consuming, but is required to know where your business is at to make good decesions.\n   * Taxes are both required and can ruin a business if not paid. Always plan for and pay the required taxes.\n* Operations and Systems: This is how the daily work gets done and good processes and operations can be the difference between unpredictable problems and out of your control.\n   * SOPs are the documented steps to do any business.\n   * Supply chain is the raw materials or tools needed.\n   * Quality control is critical as poor products or services will mean unhappy customers, bad reviews, and the business failing.\n* Marketing and Sales: How the business will become known and gain customers.\n   * Marketing is building awareness of the business.\n   * Sales is the process of converting someone interested into a paying customer.\n   * Customer retention is the methods by which you keep customers for repeat business.\n* Legal and Compliance: Boring but essential as this ensures you and the business are protected and following the law.\n   * Structure might be an LLC or Corp or other which depends on how you are taxed and the level of personal liability you have.\n   * Licenses and permits required to operate the business in good standing.\n   * Contracts and warranties that are clear written agreements with customer, partners, employees and vendors. \n\nUnderstand each of these as you build a business plan around them to be prepared to start whatever business you decide on.\n\nNote that these are scalable as they all apply to the smallest of businesses through the largest.",

Do not send it to China. Make sure that you understand the cost for a batch from that vendor if the prototype sells. Plug that number back into the projection to determine the price you should charge for the item. \n\nThe prototype is what you take pictures of and put on a Shopify website to gauge demand.

Spend the next 30 days paying attention to every time you hear someone complain about something, struggle with a process, or waste time on something annoying. Write it down. After a month you will have a list of real problems people actually have.\n\n  \nThen pick one that genuinely interests you and just try to solve it for one person. Not a business. Not an app. Not a brand. Just solve the problem manually for one actual human being. If they would pay you for it, you have something. If not, try the next one.\n\n  \nThe other thing nobody tells you is that the day to day of business is mostly just talking to people. Selling, negotiating, following up, handling complaints. If you are not comfortable with that yet, get a sales job or do freelance work for a bit. That skill alone will carry you further than any business course.\n\n  \nAlso skip the LLC, the logo, the website, and the business plan until you have paying customers. I have seen way too many people spend months on that stuff and never actually sell anything. The legal and branding stuff takes a week to set up once you actually need it.",

In reality it starts with being around problems long enough that ideas basically annoy you into existence lol.\n\nAt 20 your biggest advantage is that you can run low-stakes experiments and no one expects you to be perfect yet.\n\nIf I were starting from zero, I’d focus on:\n\n**1. Getting close to how money actually moves**  \nWork somewhere small. Startup, local business, freelance gigs, student org that sells something. Basically, anything where you can see how customers show up and how messy operations are. Business isn’t abstract. It’s literally: people have a problem → someone fixes it → money happens.\n\n**2. Pick one REAL skill that makes you useful**  \nSales, marketing, editing, design, social media, writing, basic tech stuff. Things that helps someone earn or save money. When you’re useful AND quick, people pull you into opportunities.\n\n**3. Talk to people who are building stuff**  \nAsk what’s hard, what breaks, what wastes time.\n\nEvery business is just a solution to a recurring annoyance. The more conversations you have, the more patterns you start noticing. That’s where most ideas come from.\n\nMost beginners are stuck because they’re waiting for clarity before taking action. Clarity comes *after* reps, not before. You just need to put yourself in rooms where problems are visible and the “idea” phase becomes obvious.",

In my **35 years in business** and **15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen that the best businesses don't start with a 'lightbulb moment', but with a 'this is annoying' moment.\n\nIf you have no background and no idea, here is exactly where you start:\n\n1. **Skill Acquisition:** before you 'do business', you need a craft. Learn sales, basic digital marketing, or how to build something (code, design, or a physical trade). You can't lead a team if you don't understand the work.\n2. **The Friction List:** for one week, write down every time you (or people around you) say 'I wish this was easier' or 'Why does this take so long?'. Those aren't just complaints; they are market gaps.\n3. **The 'Day-to-Day' Reality:** business isn't about vision boards. It’s about 80% admin, customer service, and solving small problems, and 20% growth. Start a 'micro-business' this weekend, sell a service on a freelance platform or flip an item. The goal isn't profit; it's learning how a transaction actually works.\n\nDon't wait for a grand vision. Find a small problem, solve it for one person, and charge for it. That is the only real 'Step One'.\n\nWhat is one skill you already have that someone might pay $20 for right now?",

I'm still new to being self-employed and discussing billing + payment, but all of my clients I've had so far have been trustworthy and prompt about paying me. Now that I've been doing this for a while I've started to encounter people who become offended when I discuss payment. \n\nThis week a potential new client inquired with me and was perfectly pleasant during our consultation, but when I told her payment is due immediately at the end of each weekly cleaning she said \"due after EACH cleaning?\" and said \"sure\", but suddenly seemed annoyed. Later on she texts me to confirm a date and time for the first cleaning, and because I still felt uneasy about her willingness to pay I decide to text her \"Perfect, I've scheduled you for \\[date & time\\]. What payment method would work best for you?\" I stated it this way to implicitly remind her that I expect payment same-day, without appearing rude or demanding. \n\nShe immediately cancelled without explanation 😑 She also said she would be in touch with me \"another time\", but if she does would I be justified in politely informing her I no longer want to clean for her? I don't want to perform work for a client who is obviously reluctant to follow my payment policy. I really don't think it's outrageous for a professional cleaner to expect payment for their services at the end of each weekly or biweekly cleaning session. What do you think? What have your experiences with clients who disagree with your payment policies been like? ",

      "text": "Three of us started this company 18 months ago. Me, my buddy from college, and his wife. We run a social media content agency for DTC brands. Split equity equally because we all brought different skills. She handles creative direction and client communication. He does strategy and ops. I manage finances and new business.\n\nHit $18K/month last quarter. We have six retainer clients. The work is good and the timing feels right. Brands are desperate for consistent content and we deliver.\n\nExcept when we don't.\n\nAbout two months ago I started noticing something. When they have small arguments work just slows down. She'll be short in client calls or take longer to turn around revisions. Annoying but manageable.\n\nBut when they have a real fight she vanishes. No Slack response. Misses client meetings. Phone goes straight to voicemail. First time it happened I thought maybe she was sick. Covered a client presentation myself. She came back three days later like nothing happened.\n\nIt's happened four times now. Last one was six days. We had a major deliverable due for our biggest client and she just went dark. I ended up hiring a freelancer off Upwork at the last minute and staying up until 4am to art direct because I don't have her eye for this stuff. Client never knew but we barely made it.\n\nHe won't talk about it. Last time I brought it up he said she just needs to process things her own way and then changed the subject. I've tried asking if we should bring on someone to help with her workload and he gets defensive. Says I'm overreacting.\n\nI'm not overreacting. I'm watching my income depend on whether two people are getting along that week.\n\nWe're profitable and actually have a waitlist. The market is good right now. I don't want to walk away from something that's working.\n\nBut I can't keep doing this either. I've tried building backup systems. Looked at content generation tools like Midjourney, APOB, bunch of others. Doesn't work because clients hire us for a specific aesthetic. I've tried keeping freelancers on standby but that gets expensive and they don't know our clients like she does.\n\nEvery time my phone is quiet for more than a few hours I get this knot in my stomach. Is she just busy or is this another one? Should I cancel my plans this weekend just in case?\n\nTwo weeks ago I was sitting in my car after a client call and drafted a message about buyout options. Sat there staring at it for like twenty minutes. Deleted it. What if I'm bailing right before they figure it out? What if I'm the guy who gave up on something good because of a few rough months?\n\nBut also what if it gets worse and she disappears during something we actually can't recover from?\n\nSome days I think the revenue is worth it. Other days I just want out. And I have zero say in which version of them shows up to work.\n\nHas anyone stayed in a partnership that was making money but felt completely unstable?",

It's a business risk you need to contain.\n\nYou have a profitable company with a single point of failure that disappears unpredictably.

The fact that it's personal is exactly why you don't have one yet.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\nThe 33/33/33 equity split was a mistake but it's done. What you can still fix is the operating agreement. If there isn't one that defines what happens when a partner stops performing, that's the first conversation. Not about her specifically. About all three of you. What are the expectations, what happens when someone can't deliver, what's the exit mechanism.\n\nThe freelancer-at-4am thing you did? That's not dedication. That's a company running on adrenaline instead of structure. If her role is that critical then the business needs redundancy for that role regardless of who fills it. Document her processes, build a style guide detailed enough that a freelancer can match 80% of her output without you art directing at 4am.\n\nAnd the hardest part: you need to have the conversation with your buddy. Not about his marriage. About the business. \"When any partner is unavailable for 6 days with no communication, we need a protocol for that.\" Make it about the company, not about her.\n\n$18k/month with a waitlist is a real business.

A married couple holds 66% of your company. Even if your buddy is reasonable now, if things escalate between them (separation, divorce), you could get dragged into a legal mess with zero control. Courts can treat business equity as marital property depending on your state.\n\n  \nWhat I would do:\n\n  \n1. Get an operating agreement reviewed or created by a business attorney. Not a template from the internet. You need clauses that address minimum performance standards, what happens during extended absences, and buyout triggers. If you already have one, check if it covers any of this.\n\n  \n2. Frame the conversation around protecting the business, not blaming her. Something like \"we are growing, we have a waitlist, and we need a plan for when any one of us is unavailable for any reason.\" Make it about all three of you, not just her.\n\n  \n3. Propose a backup creative person on retainer now, while things are calm. Position it as scaling up to handle the waitlist, not as replacing her. If she pushes back on that, that tells you something important.\n\n  \n4. Stop deleting those buyout messages. Save them as drafts. Talk to a lawyer about what a structured buyout or equity restructure would look like so you have real numbers instead of anxiety spirals in your car.\n\n  \nThe fact that you are profitable with a waitlist means you have leverage right now. That leverage disappears if a client finally notices or if she vanishes during something you cannot recover from. You said it yourself.\n\n  \nDo not wait for the crisis to plan for it.",

Then I just said screw it and built something I personally needed - a way to process memories out loud instead of journaling (which never worked for me).\n\nShipped it 11 days ago. Zero sales so far haha. But the learning curve is insane - TikTok algorithms, Reddit karma rules, cold outreach to coaches, LinkedIn groups. None of that shows up in \"how to start a startup\" guides.\n\nMy advice: Don't wait to identify the perfect problem. Just pick something YOU struggle with, build an MVP in 3 weeks, and launch it. You'll learn more in 2 weeks of live product feedback than 6 months of market research.\n\nThe tech skill is the easy part. The hard part is talking to humans who might actually pay you $5 for something you built. That's where the real entrepreneurship starts (in my humble opinion ;)).\n\nWhat problems do YOU personally deal with that your current tech company doesn't solve?",

The problem identification paralysis is real and I think it comes from us being trained to solve well-defined problems at work. Entrepreneurship flips that on its head because the hard part IS finding the right problem.\n\n  \nWhat worked for me was keeping a frustration journal for 2 weeks. Every time something annoyed me, whether at work, doing personal admin, or using some clunky tool, I wrote it down. After 2 weeks I had maybe 40 items. Most were garbage but 3-4 were actually interesting because multiple people I talked to had the same frustration.\n\n  \nThe other thing nobody told me is that your first idea will almost certainly not be your final product. The goal of idea #1 is not to build a unicorn, its to get you into the habit of shipping something, talking to users, and iterating. That feedback loop teaches you more than any amount of planning.\n\n  \nAlso the chiropractor comment above is spot on. Your tech skills are a massive advantage but only if you apply them to problems where the existing competition is a spreadsheet or a whiteboard. Those are the markets where even a basic tool feels like magic to the users.",

Your first product probably won’t be great, and that’s fine. The point is that you’re learning by doing.\n\nIf you can even get a few people to pay or subscribe while you’re learning, that’s a huge win. You’re earning and learning at the same time.\n\nIf you’re stuck on “finding a problem,” look at a problem in your own life, even something small or boring.

With the exception of, maybe, Yeezy. \n\nThe explosion of online marketing has us looking at the ROI on everything. But when I started out in 2014, I was one of the only people at networking events I'd go to who was talking about direct response marketing and tracking ROI. \n\nIt's long been a symptom of big Madison Avenue ad agencies that they just get ridiculous budgets to do \"branding\" where they splatter a company's name everywhere and that's it. The thought process is just creating a gut-level recognition through familiarity. Like Coca Cola has done. To become a household name. \n\nBut nobody has ever been able to outright *prove* it brings a higher ROI. There are correlation studies but causation has to be inferred.  \n\nI used to rail against \"branding campaigns\" when I had a newsletter for small businesses back in the day. Because there was a lot of misconception at the time. And still is. Small businesses are smarter now for the most part in that they know just \"branding\" is throwing money in the toilet. Passively branding to existing customers is a better approach for most businesses. \n\nThat's true until you have over a billion-dollar budget. And even then, it's often worth it to look into non-traditional channels. ",

They aim for an emotional impact rather than a rational one because it’s all about memorability. Emotion builds memory structures. The goal is to build greater mental availability than the competition so that your brand comes to mind instead of theirs. \n\nThere’s a priming aspect to it too. Showmanship makes your brand more likeable. Think of Pavlovian conditioning with the ringing of a bell when a dog is given food. They are then conditioned to start salivating when they hear the bell but not given the food. You’re slowly being conditioned to like the brand and perhaps even smile when you see the logo. We like to think we make rational decisions but research shows we mostly make emotional decisions. We rationalise it later.",

Because they’re not even the same experience. That’s kind of how I see the whole “content creation is cheaper now” debate.\n\nYeah, sure, it’s easier and cheaper to churn out content, but that just means *everyone’s* doing it. Thirty years ago, only a handful of companies could even get visibility. Now? Your grandma’s got a TikTok account, and every brand under the sun is flooding the internet with posts. Standing out is harder than ever.\n\nBut then you’ve got something like TV ads. Love ‘em or hate ‘em (efficient, inefficient, whatever) at least they’re still reserved for the big players who can afford them. Less competition, more visibility. And since marketing’s all about trust and familiarity, being able to pop up in places your competitors *aren’t*? That’s still a huge win.\n\nThat’s actually one of the biggest takeaways I got from studying the RIO framework: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Use multiple channels, but keep your message consistent across all of them. Hammer it home again and again, and create a journey that makes sense for your customers. That way, they actually *get* what you’re about, and you’re not just another voice in the noise.",
