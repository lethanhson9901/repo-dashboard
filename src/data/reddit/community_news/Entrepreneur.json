Make it happen through sweat and creativity.\n5.  Give yourself a stop loss.  If the business idea is not profitable with X months then unemotionally shut it down and either get a job for a while to recoup capital or move to the next idea.  But set the stop loss at the beginning or else you’re likely to move the goalposts as you approach the drop dead date.  \n6.  Don’t give up.  Your idea may not have worked but as long as you learn from the mistake you can apply the lessons to future ideas.  You can imagine how frustrated and dejected I felt after back to back to back business failures.  But by getting up one more time than I was knocked down, it changed my life.\n\nGood luck entrepreneurs!!",

      "text": "Not sure if other app devs are seeing this, but wanted to share a shift we made recently that’s honestly been bigger for our growth than ASO or traditional SEO.\n\nA few months ago, we started getting feedback emails saying things like, *\"I asked ChatGPT for a cycling app that focuses on privacy\"* or *\"Gemini recommended you guys as a good Strava alternative.\"*\n\nIt happened enough times that we actually updated our onboarding survey. We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

Like, Walmart or Target are unwilling to carry a wall charger that is likely to melt and catch fire within 3 months, but Temu and Amazon don't care.  Retailers also obtain their name brand stuff through authorized resellers or authorized distributors.  \n\nAside: Some years ago, I used to handle reseller accounts for major electronic brands.  I found out that many major brands like Netgear outright forbid their resellers from listing on Amazon because it encouraged shady price-falling practices and pitted their resellers against each other, which is actually bad for business.  So when you see certain electronics on Amazon and the seller is not listed as an \"Authorized Dealer\" by that brand, 9 times out of 10 it's stolen, bought from overstock, or being sold in breach of contract and therefore does not actually have a manufacturer's warranty.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

If an investor is impressed by color schemes, graphics, and imagery, then there is a fundamental problem.

          "text": "Great list. As a VC, there are 3 critical slides that are either missing or weak in almost every deck I see right now.\n\n1. The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -> Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution > Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" < \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

If you don't have to say anything different, just remove it and show problem validation, team's expertise, market is shifting etc... It fits naturally already.\n\nAnd about problem, you're 100% right. Problem slide shouldn't be statement. It should be validation with data. How many people face this problem?

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup. Apparently its needed for some verification stuff. Anyway, any advice on the scope creep situation would be helpful cause im getting real tired of quick favors.",

Once you do that even once, clients subconsciously assume it is normal.\n\nA few things that help without burning bridges:\n\n1. Stop doing any work before payment. Not after. Not later. Before.\n2. Respond with process, not emotion. Short and boring is best.\n3. Frame it as policy, not a personal decision.\n\nExample response that usually works:  \n“Happy to help. Since the project is complete, any additional changes are handled hourly at X. Let me know if you would like me to send an invoice.”\n\nNo apology. No justification. No guilt.\n\nGood clients respect this.

I work more in software projects and this is a common issue. In the SLA it must be explicitly stated what is going to be developed (features), add some tests that are going to be covered, and be very explicit what is out of Scope (new features for example). With this signed, you can make them understand that these requests need to be quoted.\n\nHope this helps!",

Most clients don’t like pure retainers without the confidence they will definitely will use you.\n\nThe main advantage is now there is a budget set up for them to get more work done, and because it’s already pre-approved, there is an incentive to use you instead of a competitor.",

      "text": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

And you give it a sandbox in which it can use to experiment and learn from and iterate over and over until it finds the best solution. Sometimes for days. And you need to have it work with a platform that it can use to build, try, test, and weigh outcomes against each other -  Wordpress is not generally such a platform.\n\nThis is very much how you would treat any employee working on this stuff.

There were about 4 major points it took me where I couldn't go backwards. I was extremely careful trying to corroborate what it told me. But the info often worked in older versions of Mac os  so the Internet said it worked too",

And the idea is that it would be free like say 5 tokens and after that you have to pay a monthly subscription. It would be so easy you would literally have a json prompt for LaTex code and send that to the chatgpt api, and then the response is the resume immediately reimagined for a specific job on the fly.

Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified. This shows you're professional and gives you a chance to address concerns before they become issues.",

AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

          "text": "What did help us a lot;  \n\\- Translation in a true local tone of voice got much easier. We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong. It worked well as a context to JSON query converter, but it was lacking the actual intelligence part.",

Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter.

          "text": "We used in our restaurant chain AI assistant which was specifically developed for restaurants. It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

Beaucoup de temps pour faire la moindre modification, fonctionnalités complètement inopérables, tout était à jeter.  \n\nJ'ai donc mis la main à la patte et j'ai codé avec l'IA pour les front-end. Et récemment, j'ai découvert un agent qui était capable de faire le back-end donc je vais encore plus vite. \n\nMais avant d'obtenir les résultats que je voulais, j'ai passé des semaines entières à débuguer. Sauf que si j'avais fait cela avec les dévs, j'aurais mis des mois. Alors à moins d'en trouver un vraiment très bon, et avoir les moyens de le payer sur plusieurs mois (ce qui n'est pas mon cas vu que je suis en reconversion), la solution IA est salvatrice. \n\nMAIS et c'est un gros MAIS, ma compréhension de projets interactifs m'a beaucoup aidée et surtout, j'ai énormément appris avec mes bêta-testeuses et moi-même. J'ai traversé de grosses périodes de doute et de découragement. \n\nMais à présent que j'en vois le bout, je me dis que ça valait le coup.  Il ne reste plus qu'à tester mes applis sur plusieurs semaines pour voir si ça marche !",

I can share a quick snapshot from our side as well.\n\nWe are a small team of seven, mainly focused on social media operations and content delivery.\n\nAI significantly improved our content creation efficiency. Ideation, drafting, and formatting for social platforms became much faster, which helped us keep a consistent posting rhythm without burning out the team.\n\nWe also introduced AI into customer support. It is not perfect, but it handles simple and repetitive questions well. Anything complex is still reviewed and handled by our team, which keeps quality under control.\n\nOne of the biggest wins is double checking. Most written content now goes through both human review and AI review. That extra layer catches small issues and improves clarity without replacing our judgment.\n\n**What we learned**\n\nAI works best as a collaborator, not a replacement. Efficiency gains come from pairing it with human oversight and clear workflows, not from full automation.\n\nI am also an AI enthusiast and run a small community called r/AICircle where we share practical experiences, tools, and lessons learned. Always happy to exchange ideas and learn from others here too.",

Users don't care that it's \"AI-powered,\" they just care that the experience feels tailored to them. But making sure it's not too personalized that creates overwhelm for the user (A mistake I made at launch that I quickly learned based upon feedback).\n\nThe mistake I see everywhere is \"AI for AI's sake\", adding chatbots or features just to say you use AI. If you can't explain the specific problem AI solves better than a non-AI solution, you're chasing trends, not creating value.\n\nFocus on the problem first, then ask if AI is actually the best tool to solve it.",

Some countries have better options than others. Like in Philippines, GCash or local banks might be easier. In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid.

The fastest options were almost always the most expensive, and the cheapest ones required planning ahead. Once I accepted that tradeoff and planned payouts a few days earlier, things got way smoother.\n\nIt really shouldn’t be this hard, but right now the biggest win I’ve seen is reducing variability so you’re not constantly tracking who’s paid, who’s pending, and who’s stuck in limbo.

AI may automate or expedite some tasks, but the job itself becomes more about higher level thinking, more critical creative work. Honestly probably less rote, mindless work, and more about like, almost supervising the robot and understanding the “why” behind the work it is doing.\n\nLike you mentioned, the calculator didn’t impede our ability to do math; we actually just started working on much harder problems once we stopped wasting our time on manual calculations.

The new skill is:\n1. define the problem and constraints (what matters, what doesn’t)\n2. supervise + verify outputs (because the robot is confidently wrong sometimes)\n3. turn results into decisions (trade-offs, timing, incentives)\n\nOne nuance: for a while, a lot of roles become “hybrid”. You still need enough “how” to catch failures and steer the tool.\n\nCurious: in the trainings you’ve run, what’s the #1 thing people struggle with most. Asking better questions, verifying outputs, or deciding what to do next?",

                  "text": "I can get a bit long winded. Feel free to bookmark this for later reference.\n\nTLDR: I agree with your nuance. Other experts are calling this the “human in the loop”. Many of us in the industry are pushing for updated roles that supervise the “AI intern” instead of mass automation of roles. \n\nYour question: Most people need real practice using paid AI tools (40-100 hours) and a strong belief that their employers aren’t going to outsource their job. If they really fear losing their jobs, they need to start learning to be an entrepreneur. It’s never been easier than right now.\n\nIf you haven’t already, check out Ethan Mollick’s blog at OneUsefulThing.org - he is one of the biggest experts in the field that combines practical entrepreneur/business sense with no joke scientific/academic reasoning. He’s a trusted voice, as far as I’m concerned. Everyone else is just repackaging the same garbage content.\n\n***Long Response***\n\nLike you mentioned, the real, long-term game now is strategically prioritizing which tasks add the most value and then consistently leveraging these tools to deliver quality products or services faster than the competition. The companies that empower their people to use these tools and mitigate the risk will have a compounding competitive advantage in the next couple years. All future knowledge worker jobs should have an AI supervisor component.\n\nAs for your question: it depends largely on the industry.\n\nGenerally: \n\n1. Many people don’t fully grasp the full range of what LLMs are capable of. They do surface level tasks and don’t realize they can go much deeper. Or they think AI can’t do what they can, so they don’t bother to put it through its paces. They hear the hype but haven’t seen or internalized the earth-shattering magic yet.\n\n2. There is a hands-on component that many lack, they don’t have 20, 40, 100+ of practice with PAID LLMs, so they don’t quite know how to get AI to give them what they want yet. This is easily remedied with practice and coaching. This practice also usually fixes problem 1.\n\n3. The last piece I see the most, and the one I struggle with the most is: many think of AI as an automation tool, not an enhancement tool for existing employees. People think all their jobs are going to be automated away and they are going to lose their jobs. This is a real possibility. So people resist any and all AI trainings, change efforts, etc. They resist because they fear their livelihoods depend on it. The only thing we can do for this one is share a vision of a positive AI enhanced future and actively lead people towards it.\n\nSome people will lose their jobs, but my company REALLY pushes the, “re-define your current roles, put your current employees on harder, more meaningful and valuable work, automate the bullshit busywork that no one wants to do” kind of track. I won’t work with organizations trying to do mass automation and layoffs.\n\n\n***More specific examples of problems and questions from specific industries, if you’re interested:***\n\n-Solopreneurs and small businesses just want to know how they can use these tools to scale their business.\n\n-Higher Education is a mixed bag, many still see using AI as cheating and want to try to ban it or find ways to catch students red-handed. Other academics see it as the future and want to know how to use AI to help them produce better research, faster.\n\n-Medical field: mostly how they can automate the insurance eligibility verification. Or use AI to transcribe appointment notes without violating HIPPA. Most providers want to actually focus on their patients, but have to spend most of their time documenting the whole ordeal that it feels like the Dr is on the computer the whole time. Many of the providers I’ve met know this is a problem and hate it, but they need to make sure your chart is as accurate as possible so they miss out on the actual helping the patient thing.\n\nIs there a specific industry you’re looking for?\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for coming to my TED talk!",

Anyone who has ever had this problem and how they overcame this identity addiction please give me some advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: Thanks you guys for the concern and advices. I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building. The reason I made this post is because I noticed myself being a boring person with no hobbies but Entrepreneurship.

Running my own analytics freelancing business gave me my life back and made me less of a burnt out shell.\n\nThe job I left before starting my business, they wanted me to blatantly lie about a dataset and I just could not do it. It wasn't a white lie. They literally wanted to lie about data on patients with late stage cancer in a way that would justify cutting a helpful program that was being offered to those patients. I was appalled and I tried so hard to 'be a team player' and 'be flexible.' But I'm not going to fucking lie about LATE STAGE CANCER. They said I 'lacked flexibility' because of that and were such assholes. I will bend over backwards to make data work, but I'm not going to flat out tell complete falsehoods.\n\nClients tend to love that I'm so passionate about the data. I don't use the term autism exactly with clients but we've jokingly mentioned that you want your data people to be a little weird for best results.\n\nHere's the lie if anyone wants to see if I was just being autistically literal about it.>! the client wanted to know if cancer patients have trouble traveling to get their treatments. They hired us to measure the distance people traveled to their infusion sites, and then see if there were any correlations between adverse outcomes and that distance. The company I worked for of course did not have actual patient addresses to measure distance to treatment centers, so they lied and used the prescribing doctor's address as the patient's address. Well that's completely tautological-- it meant that everyone who GOT treatment was 'zero miles' from their treatment center. So the data showed everyone was RIGHT on top of a treatment center, and nobody had any issues! They wanted me to tell the client, \"Anyone who got treatment traveled zero miles\" with a completely straight face. I refused and they wrote me up for insubordination and for not helping the business.!<",

So entrepreneurship seemed like the quickest way to spot something wrong and just go fix it myself.\n\nMy reasons for doing it changed over time. I kind of break it down into a few stages.\n\nFirst theres control like deciding what I work on and how I use my days. Back when I started that felt way more important than making money right away.\n\nThen leverage came into it building something once and watching it grow without starting over all the time every week or so.\n\nAnd meaning too working on stuff that Id still want to do even if nobody else cared or noticed.\n\nThe whole point for me isnt some huge exit or anything dramatic. Its more about having options being able to turn down things and pick projects because I want to not because I have to.\n\nTalking to other people who started businesses Ive noticed something. If the only reason is money or looking good it wears you out in that long boring stretch in the middle. But if its about being curious or having some freedom or scratching a real problem you can keep going longer without resenting it all.\n\nI wonder how others think about this.\n\nLike did your main reason shift after messing up the first time or getting a win.\n\nWhat are you aiming for in the end freedom or making a difference or something else specific.\n\nHonestly what keeps you showing up every day in this entrepreneurship thing.\n\nIt seems like we dont just pick it once most of us have to choose it again every year or so.

My friend is extremely dear to me and she's finally in a stable place where I feel comfortable working for her, it's her business, I just talked myself into a job! We've worked together before for a different company so we know each other's work-ethic. She's been wanting to grow her photography business for years but hasn't had the free time to do it, as she works full time elsewhere. Other than bi weekly meetings and her printing things (she works at a print shop) \n\nIt was pretty cool, I pitched her a few ideas with the question about doing this with her in one of our normal chats on the phone and we had a whole business model and general idea by the end of the phone call. Tonight we meet with her tax guy to ask questions! We hope to be off the ground by mid feb, ready to sell her prints and other merchandise.",

Started as \"prove to myself i can actually execute something\" and evolved into building systems that let people like me stop feeling broken. Now with ScatterMind its about showing other ADHD founders they don't need meds or burnout to build something meaningful. The money followed once i stopped chasing it and focused on solving real problems for people who think like me. Freedom came when i built guardrails instead of just hoping willpower would save me.",

      "text": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

It was brutal. The lessons I learned during that time were invaluable though. Understanding cash flow the hard way, realizing that not every business can be saved, and learning when to cut losses instead of throwing good money after bad. It stung, but those failures taught me more than any success could have.\n\n\n\nWhat kept me going was the same thing that kept you going - consistency. You showed up every day, learned what you didn't know, and adjusted when things didn't work. That's what separates people who eventually succeed from those who give up.\n\n\n\nKeep at it.

      "text": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

The trade-off sweet spot was brutal:\n \n- Option A (Simple): Full onboarding wizard = 8 min activation, but manual backend processes meant cost spiked 300% after 150 vendors.\n \n- Option B (Scalable): API-first architecture = 45 min activation (too complex), but cost stayed flat.\n\nWe chose Option C: Kept the 8-minute wizard but built a \"shadow API\" that auto-migrated vendors to scalable infrastructure after their 10th order.\nOur Vendors never noticed, but our engineering velocity dropped by 30% for 6 weeks. Worth it.\nNow our Cost per order is 0.12 at 200 vendors.",

I just wanted restaurants without checking prices and being able to say yes to friends without doing math in my head.\n\nThe real plot twist is when you stop viewing money as something to spend and start seeing it as freedom capital instead.

The successful people I know all seem to hit the same point: the money doesn't matter as much as having choices.\n\nWhat stage are you in - still figuring out what 'rich spending' even looks like, or past that?\"",

You're not chasing the status symbols, you're actually investing in things that compound - freedom with friends, stability with a forever home, better travel experiences. That's not consumption, that's *lifestyle design*.\n\nThe fact that you naturally gravitated away from boats and jets without even trying tells me you figured something out early that most people take years (or never) to learn: the real wealth is in what you *don't* have to stress about anymore.\n\nHow long did it take before you stopped second-guessing every purchase?

Perhaps God is gifting me this, idk why He would be I can’t explain it otherwise. \n- I validate / evaluate all my ideas with ChatGPT. To make them viable and actionable. To see if there’s any way to improve. To get feedback whether it will be received well with my market.\n- I post and put myself out there without self-judgement. I’ve been consistent posting 1-2x daily and only taking days off for “creative expansion” days where I recalibrate and make room for even better ideas\n- I evaluate every single piece of content / sales page / offer I make by sharing my performance stats with ChatGPT. It shows me whats effective and where people are falling off. I take this info and reiterate and repost without worrying if people notice.”\n- I am constantly feeding my brain with expert ideas strategies and ways of thinking via low ticket info products. I feed what’s relevant to me into ChatGPT to help me expand on my current ideas and way of writing and working.\n\nSo far I’ve grown my Facebook platform from 0 to 8000 daily views and engagement has increased similarly too.\n\nI’ve got two different offers in the works - low ticket books and courses for my mom audience where I help them mitigate meltdowns\n\nAnd a mid-ticket group consulting offer for high level biz owners / marketers who want to reach more of their followers on Facebook like I have.\n\nI suppose I’m a mix of excited / curious :)\n\nAnd I keep myself in check asking myself “am I striving?

      "text": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

I am sure you can find much better places now but slower and more expensive.\n\nI eventually brought all the fulfillment in house once we rented a warehouse. Huge win for us, cheaper and faster. Sometimes when we are really busy I have to go down and help ship but that's fine, I am helping people so I don't mind.\n\nOne other thing was \"riding horses\". This is a term you hear sometimes or at least I've heard which is you saddle up your company to someone else's and ride on their horse.

Some businesses I think allow you to “work smarter” a little easier. \n\nIn my experience the greatest thing I’ve done to relieve the work burden is hire great people. You hire happy (can’t train happy), hard working people. Which I know is really difficult but when you find them, keep them! \n\nMake sure they’re well trained, heard, and rewarded. Don’t micromanage them, that’s the worst thing. \n\nAnyways, that has freed up my time more than any single thing and allowed me to get out of the “entrepreneurial grind”. \n\nSecond is the 80/20 principle.

Upwork charges just for you to bid on projects, even if you don't land them. \n\nAlso scammers are so abundant now that no one trusts anyone if they come from CL, which allows the gate keepers to justify their own scamming (their scamming being the process with which they gate keep, like upwork).\n\nI'm sorry about being all negative 😔.

They rely on standards and routines that look the same day after day, whether it’s yours or someone else’s.\n\nFor the first couple of years, being a franchisee is significantly less stressful because the infrastructure is built and many questions are already answered. Starting as an independent, on the other hand, feels like going 80 with your hair on fire. Anything but boring.\n\nI personally prefer the latter because I value control. I’ve done both, and at 57 I’m better served by bringing my own answers to the bigger questions. In the end, the right choice hinges largely on experience and available cash.",

If you do it on your own, you're going to spend money in testing and trial and error, and things are more expensive because you don't have economies of scale. If you go the franchise route, you pay a bit more up front but the mistakes have already been made and the processes have been refined.\n\nThere's over 4,000 franchises in existence but less than 10% of them ever get over 25 locations. So the franchise that you partner with is extremely important and you need to make sure that it's well-established.\n\nOne of the more glaring red flags is a franchisor that hasn't learned how to be a franchisor yet. In that process you run the risk of their learning curve. By partnering with a more established franchise, there's repetition and time to improve or perfect the model. This is a much safer route in my experience.\n\nIf you're a self-starter and highly independent, you might be better off going on your own. But if you like mentorship, a coach, or a guide who can shorten your learning curve, franchises provide that. Either way you're going to pay. The biggest question is: do you want to pay for your learning curve or for someone else's? \n\nI'm a franchise consultant and I deal with established brands every day. If you want to talk it through or what to look for and how to interview a franchise company, let me know. I'm happy to help!",

      "text": "Some backstory: when I was 17, I was hit by a car and settled for $250k. After I paid my attorney and hospital bill, I had about $140k which I used to buy 2 beater homes in my neighborhood. After 5 years of fixing them up and trying to find reliable tenants, I practically just barely broke even on them after paying for materials, labor, and loss of rent from 3 separate tenants across both homes refusing to pay and waiting out the eviction process; the first \"tenant\" was a squatter, the second lost his job, and the third just had a laundry list of excuses every month, it was an absolute nightmare. I made no income since all of the rent money from one home was being reinvested into the other, and once it seemed like things were going good, my tenants would stop paying. Since selling last year, I continued working in transportation with my CDL and am almost done with my BS in finance and accounting which I am finishing online. My entire net worth of $200k is mostly liquid, I own a few ETFs, a couple individual stocks, some Bitcoin, and my car. I have no debt, I max out my Roth every year, and my student aid will cover the rest of my degree which I'm finishing this December.\n\nMy problem is that I have no idea what I'm doing really. I don't want to drive a truck forever, and if the career I want to go into doesn't work out right away (personal finance), then I'll be driving this truck for who knows how many more years. I don't want to buy my own truck or start my own transportation business, and anyone who does is probably insane. I'm not wanting to become filthy rich, I just want to have fun and make enough money to pay my bills and take care of my family when the time comes for me to start one.\n\nJust interested to hear what you guys would do if you were me. I'm not sure if I'll take a huge plunge into something different right away, but I would love to shake things up this year. I am not happy in my career, and I'm willing to take a risk to change that and be my own boss. Just looking for some inspiration.\n\nThanks!",

You’ve already learned one of the hardest lessons early (landlording isn’t passive and tenant risk is very real), you have zero debt, real capital, a finance/accounting degree about to finish, and a high-income fallback skill that pays the bills while you experiment. That combo gives you something most people don’t: time and optionality. I wouldn’t rush into another capital-heavy business or try to “force” entrepreneurship right now. Instead, I’d keep the CDL as a safety net, tighten your investments into something boring and diversified, and start testing low-risk paths aligned with where you’re already leaning: personal finance content, fee-only advising later on, or even a small solo service like bookkeeping, tax prep, or financial coaching once you’re properly licensed. Those paths let you build credibility, income, and autonomy without lighting your capital on fire. You don’t need a huge plunge to change your life this year; you need controlled experiments while preserving your downside. You’re not lost, you’re just early, and you’ve earned the right to be patient while you build something you actually enjoy.",

If your goal isn’t to get super rich then there’s really no need for risking that capital to start a business at this time. Continue to focus on long term investments in the market, especially with ETFs. That money will compound in no time. I would also look into house hacking, you can get a traditional loan on a 1-4 unit residential property, live in one unit and rent out the others. You can essentially live for free while building equity in the house. Eventually you can move out and rent the other unit and turn a profit as well. Rinse and repeat and before you know it you own multiple properties increasing your net worth as the properties get paid down and increase in value. The main goal is to buy assets, especially ones that can cash flow. Whatever they may be, holding on to a lot of cash and just letting it sit is never good because it’s losing value. Get your degree, get a good job (with growth potential) and keep being responsible with your money. If you eventually wanna roll the dice on a business idea, go for it but it has to align with your goals. But remember, no 9-5 will be harder than starting your own business. You’re in a good position right now to really set yourself up for when you are in your 30s and 40s. Best of luck.",

An entrepreneur's brain wants everything to move fast, they want things to happen now, but they are limited by people, shipping, delays etc...\n\n  \nIn my case I recently started going into the reselling business. I buy stuff on vinted and ebay and resell it. I ordered many items and some of them arrived already. I listed them on ebay, but ebay is slow. It's been days and I still have no views on my products nor any sales. My business is stalling and ebay is probably processing my new account or something before I appear in the search results, but that wait is the worst. I want things to happen now, but they ain't happening. \n\nI try to watch animes that I enjoy and make myself busy, but there's a limit. Honestly all I want and care about in life right now is just to have my first sale, and things are just moving so slowly, it is the worst. \n\nHow do you guys deal with that ?",

Your brain wants dopamine now, but markets don’t work on your timeline. eBay is slow by design, new accounts even more so. The trick is to shift what you measure. Stop waiting on sales as the only win. Track controllables: number of listings, pricing tests, photos improved, titles rewritten, comps researched, cross-posting, outreach to watchers. If you don’t manufacture progress, your mind will eat you alive. Do your damnest to NOT emotionally anchor on “first sale.” It’ll come, and then you’ll immediately want the second, then the tenth. The waiting never goes away, you just get better at filling it with useful motion. If you really can’t sit still, stack parallel bets.

I want things to happen now, but they ain't happening.\"\n\nso the problem is clear... you can buy stuff... but you can't sell them\n\nyou learn how to sell... not how to start a business\n\nyou can sell anything to be very clear... you need to learn how to sell...\n\nand let me be very honest\n\nyou're frustrated not because you are not having your first sale... it's because you don't know how to sell... that's all \n\nlearn how to sell... and you will learn how to make your first sale",

In 2026 what still works is boring, specific, and tied to a real problem that someone already wants to pay to fix.\n\nLocal and unsexy businesses still make money. Cleaning, trades, removals, clinics, pet services. Demand is constant. The opportunity is not inventing something new, it is doing marketing, systems, and customer experience better than owners who are stuck in the past.\n\nContent alone barely pays anymore, but it still works as leverage. Newsletters, YouTube, TikTok are not the business. They are the attention layer that feeds into something else like consulting, services, products, communities, or software.\n\nB2B is still strong because businesses pay faster and complain less than consumers. If you help save time or money through automation, operations, compliance, or simple systems, you do not need massive reach to make real income.\n\nNiche info products still work when they are extremely specific. One clear problem, one clear outcome, for one type of person. Distribution matters more than polish.\n\nCrypto is not dead, but the easy phase is over. The money now is around tools, services, audiences, and infrastructure, not blind buying and hoping.\n\nThe real shift is that the internet stopped rewarding copy paste ideas. It still rewards people who understand a small group of people better than anyone else.",

You do a phd to tackle those tough problems that do require deep domain expertise, generally while employed by someone else.\n\nIf you are looking to solve a problem that does not require any particularly deep domain expertise, yeah hiring a PhD would be a weird choice, in much the same way that hiring a plumber for an electrical problem would be a weird choice.",
