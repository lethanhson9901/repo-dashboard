I landed a job at large asset management firm (> $1 trillion aum) and was promoted after my first year for creating a tool that saved the funds 300-400k per year. I left after 2.5 years and now run the finance division for a billionaire who has a family office.\n\nI’ve learnt coding, financial statement analysis and modelling, but want to create something that’s mine.\n\nEveryone’s trying to make it, those that were able to do it early in their lives, why do you think that is? What was it that you did, that was different?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I shared a bathroom with 2 other tenants. Woke up in the morning with the cops running around the house because one of the tenants died in the shared bathroom. I barely had enough money to eat. Found a second job. Worked 70-80 hours a week. Luckily the local state university opened an extension school in our local HS. I could take a couple classes a semester in the evening. Still worked the 2 jobs and >70 hours. Eventually graduated. Saw the movie Wall Street. Figured, if you want to make money go to where the money is. Took my 1 week vacation to NYC. Called, dropped off and sent out resumes to anyone I could. Within the week I had a few interviews. Late ‘90s NYC was a great job market. Took a chance, called in and quit my job back home and stayed another week. Got an entry level job at a premiere wealth management company. Went back home, sold, dumped, packed up everything I had. Found a roommate from a classified in the Village Voice (newspaper). Worked as many hours as I could. Kept getting promoted. After almost 20 years of working harder than everyone else in the office I was making over $1 million a year. But Wall Street is a feast or famine business. Eventually the company I worked for made some bad decisions and went under. Now I’m in my mid 50s and unemployed. But at least I wasn’t a crazy spender and I have a few million in saving.",

I got an opportunity to purchase some land (32 acres) and just like the others was just going to hold it until the value increased, I received a call from a company saying they'd like to purchase the 32 acres and we agreed on a price where I would have profited about 200k which I was excited for but then they said they wanted to pay me in installments and I almost did I was going back n forth on my decision and that's when they told me they really only needed about 2 acres of it, if I didn't want to sell would I be willing to rent them the 2 acres after some informative digging we agreed on a price. I still own that property and as of today there is 8 companies currently that rent some portion of it. The beauty of it is they maintain their own rented space and a lot of them have built something on their rented portion which has increased the property value. I make 1.2 million a year off of those 32 acres and yes I've repeated the same thing in surrounding cities and continue to look for more and different opportunities. I owe alot to the first company who reached out(a fence company) for actually coming up with the idea for me.",

Got a free PC with a cheap internet plan my mom got back in the early 2000's and started doing entrepreneur things. Farmed gold on RuneScape and things like that and sold it and earned more than my mom. This gave me a good amount of knowledge about computers. Did some other shady things like some hacking here and there but never for profit, I didn't know hacking is a job. Didn't like school so I didn't even get a high school diploma.\n\nAt 18 moved to the UK by myself with £20 in my pocket and slept on a friend's sofa.\n\nGot a job as a junior chef, worked there for a few years. Then I found out Police is recruiting without a high school diploma so I applied and got in. Within 3 years became a detective, then joined a cybercrime unit. Got into crypto and cybersecurity pretty heavily, then around when I was 24 I got a job in Cybersecurity where I got a ton of certificates. I really got into tech BIG time at this age. I started learning how to code and probably launched like 20 failed startups.\n\nAround 28 I started doing crypto and built a project in the space that went super viral and made me $1.5m within 3 months then died out. Not going to say what it was but it was a platform where I earned fees, similar to a DEX. This made me a millionaire at 28, I went from negative balance to millionaire overnight. I was working 9-5 then 5-3am 7 days a week from ages 24-28. \n\nLife was extremely difficult, I cried when I had my lucky break but was super sad it only lasted a short time. I took the money and invested it and now living off the investment income and building another startup, in cybersecurity. I really hope this can be a long term project now that I got proper funding and have a goal to exit this business for at least $100m then hopefully retire around 40.",

          "text": "That is a very tough loaded question. It would be as hard as pushing a mountain through a pin hole but let me give it a shot. Let me see how I could help you:\n\n* Hunt for \"New money\", or combine with \"old money\" knowledge you've gathered and try to carve a path in old money from the systems usual go to path i.e. study or absorb high value knowledge and applying them. Learn the avenues of money and how to mine it. Keep at it and make it your game (like Robert Kiyosaki said his game is making money and the points or high scores are the numbers). Watch motivating things and keep grinding, grinding, grinding. Enjoy the breaks and time with members important to you 100% (the little time you have with them) as much as you go with your 100% grinding. (forgive me for the lingo I am just trying to connect). Update, analyze, envision the possibilities and prepare a backup plan if things go sour. Engage in hobbies.\n* Follow advice and find the right mentor as it would save you a lot of time (they'd guide you or simply tell you the way forward as you carve your path). Listen to wise time tested advice and you will see patterns. Do the money thing early in your age and learn it as early as possible (finances and such).\n* The other one is time and experience in the field of \"hunting for money with your skillset\". Plan well, run numbers, look ahead at the high hitting ones that you can work well into accomplishing.\n* Basically you have kind of done it in your field (you are doing pretty well yourself, you should actually be the one also giving advice). Now you just have to maintain it and move higher or sideways strategically (or if you go down then at least know you will bounce back up because you have the know how or do like the ones that call it a day and retire as their goal was simply to get up and build a nest egg and retire comfortably)\n* Figure out what works for you and do it like you love it. When you hit it big, everything else will follow.\n* Learn value and value extraction and learn conversion rates (like making a sale or something). Basically businesses are things that solve a problem (if you plan to go that route). As for work, it is how useful you are and what you offer society. It was like that show I watched a long time ago, the kid didn't know how to use ninja tricks or magic but he maxed out it physical ability he became so good they considered him a legend (a legend on top of the world considered him a walking legend). You don't have to be that good but been stable is good enough to pass the bar.\n* Wealth and Riches will simply at times multiply your behavior so keep some things in check. (there is the occasional leak out but at least keep it in check, you could look into Stoicism). Not a must but also wealth kind of has an effect on those around you so keep that in mind too and try to help where you could or mentor where you can (you can pick everyone along the way like motivational speakers if you want too).\n* Look at the power of compounding and disciplined steps.\n* Perseverance but also knowing when to rest and enjoy the view. You'll appreciate your efforts as you look for a 'save point' or nest egg so when you fall you don't have to start from ground 0 (well you can definitely bounce back from ground 0 but if you say have a family or something you wouldn't want that though if you must go through it then you must).\n\n***TL:DR;*** *\"Have a mentor, have a vision and work at it like a savage. If you failed, learn from it, get back up and bounce back\"*\n\n***Warning:***\n\nThing is this thing needs you to have a lot of life experiences that is why I hang out with older gens and also see how newer gens do things because they have very interesting questions.\n\nSchool, re-learn (deprogram and program again what works), be good but smart enough to eat the good and spit out the bad. Once you finish the schooling and intense training apply the the knowledge and skills you having been cumulating as you also built a hobby on the side with sort of a final goal as you also had fun with it.\n\n(but *do some calculations and* ***apply safety nets*** *and know when to pivot* if you should because sometimes people will doubt you even if you are right and it has happened a lot of times. Also be autocorrecting and know when you are messing up, be critical to yourself but try to understand other people when they mess up and how to better manage them to let their skill shine beside yours. As I said it is a loaded question).\n\nHope this helps. (Also it seems you did well for yourself in your field, the best game that I think best explains this is The Sims - the first game. You could see almost everything in a human lifecycle there)",

You learn early in life that happiness does not require money, though you also learn that not having money can cause incredible amounts of stress. \n\nThis provides motivation to build a better life but an understanding which allows you to take calculated risks as you know that your likely worst case outcome is that you live in a tiny flat and eat nothing but beans on toast for most meals. \n\nI built and sold a business by 35 which allowed me to retire very young and spend time at home with my young kids. However this was my third attempt at building a business and I didn’t give up or stop taking (calculated) risks until I had achieved my goal. \n\nI believe that you are unlikely to get rich if you work for someone else as no matter how well paid you are, you are always constrained by the number of hours you can work.

Instead of only working harder at a job, they build assets, equity, skills, or distribution that scale beyond their time. A lot of them get obsessive about one high-value skill early (tech, sales, finance, content, etc.), live way below their means even after earning more, and take calculated asymmetric bets where the downside is survivable but the upside is huge. Another big difference is speed, they ship faster, learn faster, and tolerate uncertainty way better than average. Also, environment matters more than people admit; being close to capital, networks, or high-growth industries compounds everything. And honestly, luck and timing play a role too, but the common thread is they put themselves in positions where luck could actually hit, instead of just playing safe for stability their whole life. ",

Stocks can help you get richer, but not make you rich in and of themselves.  The overall best return is starting a successful business.  This, over time, can be a return on investment 1000x.  But, it’s really fucking hard.  From my own sucesss and meeting and talking with other people, I have distilled success down to three traits.  It is these traits that matter, and will make or break you.\n\nPrimary is risk.  You have to be able to risk, to put something on the line for possible failure and loss.  You have to be able to sacrifice time and labor for nothing in the hopes of something.  This is fundamental.  A lot of people cannot do this and are essentially born to be employees.  Doesn’t mean they aren’t smart or competent.  They just can’t risk.\n\nSecondary trait 1 is conscientiousness.  Hard work.  Pride.  Quality first.  Working long hours without reward.  Speed is accuracy.  This is a trait that can be honed.  If someone has this and the ability to risk, they are probably at a 60% chance of success.  \n\nSecondary rest to is competence.  High IQ, creativity.  Critical thinking quickly, problem solving.  Learning fast and adapting.  This is essentially always having the right answer, the best idea.  This is more of something you are born with.  If you have this, and the ability to risk, you probably have an 80% chance at success.  \n\nIf you have all three you are a guaranteed millionaire.  But, to have all three traits probably puts you in maybe 2% of the population.  A lot of people can’t risk, and some that can’t risk either aren’t intelligent or are lazy or both.  \n\nSo the thing to do is sit down and figure out what your traits are.  Starting with risk.  If you can honestly determine that you truly cannot risk, then your time is best served finding the highest position you can to serve someone who can risk.  And one thing I would conjecture, and it isn’t a judgment, but the type of person who truly has trait 3 isn’t the type that would need to ask anyone how to do x or become y.  They would intuitively figure it out on their own.  They are the type to ask a specific question maybe from a lack of knowledge, like where on a website is the contact button or something like that.  They wouldn’t ask “how do I become rich.”  And for that person, if they can risk, they just need to find a high IQ creative individual who can’t risk and hire them.",

You’ve made tools that saved real money, and you’re inside a family office. If you want to “own it,” I would start by taking one recurring pain that you see every week, making a small product out of it, and selling it to people who have been in your shoes.

Those that are coming close are talkign about real estate investment which as a Georgist is hardly entrepreneurship to me. \n\nI did not grow up poor. My family is well-off and very comfortable in Pakistan. But that does not translate to wealthy for US. I was born in the US before my parents decided to move back. The main privileges that I enjoy are:\n\n1. Education was highly prioritized in my family and I had to work very hard in educaiton because of the insanely competitive environment of Pakistan. In fact, I worked less in a top 10 engineering school where I graduated with high honors than I did in Pakistan.\n\n2. I did not feel the pressure to support my family back in Pakistan.\n\n3. I am a US citizen so I could avail financial aid to pay for my school and work without needing authorization.\n\nAgain, I know I was very privileged but I feel I enjoyed fewer privileges than most of the people whining about how hard it is to make it. Money was financial aid, scholarships, work, and student loans. The student loans themselves were tiny because I went to a state school and were very easy to pay off because I am cheap so I saved a lot and went to a state school so they were small. I did not have any network I could lean on other than the network I built for myself by performing very well in school. My biggest advantage was the priority of education in my family.\n\nWorked for 5 years after my masters. I was fortunate that I took a job with ARM and the share price went up so I got a nice buffer. But then again, I also had a divorce that cost me a large chunk of the money I had saved. \n\nStarted a consulting company. Ran it for \\~7 years. Exited it to a GSI. Was a millionaire right around an age of 35. \n\nWhat people need to realize is that whether you work at a job or start your own business, you are someone that sells your labor for money. The question is how many customers you have and how much ownership you have of the systems. You don't need to be wealthy to start a business. You can just do what you're doing at a job as a business and make more money doing so.",

Using benefits like scholarships/military to get a free or cheaper education will also help. But most importantly stay out of debt, don't max out credit cards, don't buy a home you can't afford, don't waste money on expensive rent, don't waste money on a girl that does not really love you, don't waste money on drugs, ect. Also focus on getting a job in a good career feild that has a high ladder to climb to eventually reach over 200k a year at your peak, if your comfortable with being an employee this will help you build weatlh if you put most of your paycheck into assests every year and max your retirement accounts out. Assests can include rental homes, stocks, businesses ect. Know you will most likely not ever get super rich unless you own your own busniess or invest and get luckly.

Got into finance through a scholarship program, worked my way to Goldman, then HBS, now acquiring businesses (still working full-time W-2 because I am not past the fear of losing it all and feel the need for the stability).\n\nWhat I did differently:\n\n**1. I treated early jobs as paid education, not just paychecks.** Stayed at Goldman for 2 years learning deal structure, now at a sovereign wealth fund where I'm still learning from people decades ahead of me. That knowledge compounds when I evaluate acquisitions. But I'm staying in W-2 longer than I probably should because I'm terrified of cutting the cord and owning my income 100%\n\n**2. I got comfortable being the least qualified person in the room.** Applied to jobs I thought were \"not for people like me.\" Turns out imposter syndrome is just fear with better marketing.\n\n**3. I learned the math.** Everyone in my old life told me I couldn't afford to buy a business. Turns out with SBA financing and understanding tax benefits, I put $65K into a deal that would have seemed impossible a year earlier. The barrier was knowledge, not money.\n\n**4. I asked dumb questions to smart people.** Mentors, advisors, CPAs who knew more than me. Most people will help if you're genuinely trying to learn.\n\nThe shift: stopped waiting for permission that was never coming. Nobody tells the kid from the food stamp line \"you should buy a company.\" Had to give myself that permission.\n\nYou're already doing the hard part - learning skills that create value (being reasonably technical, financial modeling). The \"something that's mine\" is closer than you think. What are you considering building?",

          "text": "I grew up very poor and we were even homeless for a short time after NAFTA wiped out all the jobs in our region but my mom was very, very hardcore about saving and managing money. She was also very against going into debt. Her flaw was she was a saver, not an investor so she was constantly living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI wanted to be an architect. I went to college but chose the most affordable accredited degree I could get instead of a more prestigious but way more expensive option. Back in the early 2000s college wasn't as crazy expensive as now. I was able to work nights and weekends to not go into debt. While every single person I knew was taking out tons of debt and spending money partying and living large in college I was penny pinching. Even though school and teachers threatened me to quit my job and focus on school I continued to work so I wouldn't need a loan. There were a few times I had to borrow money to get by but paid it back as soon as possible. I totally understand this is almost impossible nowadays unless you are talking a community college.\n\nAfter school I got an ok job with a firm paying very little and then the 2008 financial crisis hit. Job gave me a choice of halfing my pay which was already very low or leave. I halfed my pay to stay and literally made less than minimum wage with all the unpaid overtime I worked. I basically worked like a dog for years with minimal pay raises until about 2017 where I got married and finally decided to go out on my own and start my own firm with massive encouragement by my wife. Thank god for her. At this time I had a negative net worth with a home mortgage of about 150k and 20k car debt.\n\nThe first year on my own I think I only made like 20k but I made good connections and learned about business. I kept the company as lean as physically possible working from home and not hiring anyone just putting in 60+ hours a week. By 2019 I was finally making what I was at my previous firm about 80k a year. Then 2020 really blew up where I was finally making 6 figures. My wife was super encouraging and also got her degree in design and started helping me out.\n\nI aggressively paid off all debts and paid off my car and house in that year. I was finally at a positive net worth.\n\nI realized the real money wasnt in the design work but in the development. My wife and I started searching properties and I made some contacts with capital. I couldnt invest money but I could invest time so what was a 20k project turned into 40-50k returns after sale. Work also really picked up and with my wifes help our income exploded. Our lifestyle did not change and we kept penny pinching.\n\nWe also both aggressively put most our money in as high of yield of savings as possible and maxed out what we could in investments in both retirement and taxed accounts. All this just kept compounding. We also made sure to take advantage of big market drops. During the COVID drop we made sure to throw a ton of money into the market and it really paid off. We were making decent income of a few hundred grand a year but the compounding and zero debt just really kept things moving forward. We saved and invested about 80% of our income which also helped. Also the little crappy home we had went from about 160k to about 500k in value.\n\nRight now my wife and I together are about 3m net worth not counting our new home. Even now we still live well, well below our means. We travel a lot but choose very affordable places. We love camping and we go all over just camping outdoors. Its not only affordable but way more fun.\n\nA few years ago we realized even though we were doing well we still felt like being in the US really drained a lot out of us. We decided to pack up and move overseas to SE Asia and it was one of the best things we ever did. Its not perfect here but cost of living is so absurdly cheap.\n\nI think the key is learn how to manage money, avoid debt, dont just save but invest and grow your money and finally stop caring about what others think. Stop trying to impress other losers by wasting money on stupid stuff. I have a lot of friends that didnt make it and are really struggling now yet they somehow have the money to buy a 7-800k home with a 70k truck they dont need. Then complain the system doesnt work. I agree there are a lot of things broken but at the same time they dont do themselves any favors.",

They attach themselves to environments with asymmetric upside. High-growth industries, proximity to capital, proximity to decision-makers. You already did this by working in asset management and now in a family office.\n2. They build skills that compound. Coding + finance is a powerful combo because it creates optionality. Most people build linear skills.\n3. They ship something of their own before they feel “ready.” The jump from employee to owner usually happens before confidence arrives.\n4. They tolerate volatility longer than others. Most people optimize for stability. The ones who break out optimize for upside.\n\nBut here’s the honest part:  \nA lot of early millionaires also benefited from timing and access. It’s not purely merit.\n\nFrom what you wrote, you’re already around capital and decision-making. That’s rare access. The question isn’t “what do millionaires do differently?” It’s “what asymmetric bet are you willing to take?”\n\nYou’ve built skills inside other people’s empires. At some point you’ll need to build something where you own the equity curve.\n\nWhat’s the smallest thing you could launch in the next 90 days that uses both your coding and finance background?",

The fast movers reverse it: they build an audience or reputation in a specific niche first, then figure out what to sell. Your coding + financial modeling background is already a rare combination. The question isn't what to build - it's who has an acute problem you can solve with that exact stack.\n\nOne practical thing: the move from \"employee who created value\" to \"owner of that value\" is mostly a positioning shift, not a skills gap. You've already proven you can identify and build high-ROI solutions. The next step is finding that problem before someone hands it to you.",

      "text": "Was running a generic local marketing agency for about 2 years, doing SEO and Google ads for whoever would pay me. Landscapers, chiropractors, roofing companies, you name it. Revenue was okay but i was constantly context switching and burning out managing 14 completely different industries at once.\n\nThen one of my clients, a pediatric dentist in Scottsdale, referred me to her friend who also owned a pediatric dental practice. I didnt think much of it but after working with both of them for a few months I realized these businesses are basically identical in structure, same ad angles work, same seasonal trends, same parent demographics on Meta, same Google review strategy. I wasnt reinventing the wheel every time.\n\nSo I made the call to niche down completely. Updated my website, killed all other outreach, built out a proper case study from those two clients and just started cold emailing pediatric dental offices.\n\nFirst 60 days were rough ngl. Had some money saved from before I went full time that covered my personal expenses which was the only reason i didnt panic and go back to taking random clients. By month 3 I had 3 new clients purely from outreach. By month 6 referrals started coming in from within the niche itself because these dentists all know each other and talk.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about niching is that your deliverables get so much faster. I can onboard a new pediatric dental client in 2 days now because everything is templated from experience. My margins went up without raising prices just from the efficiency alone.\n\nIf your agency feels chaotic and all over the place this is genuinely worth considering. Pick the niche that already has some proof in your current client list.",

I see the same thing managing large ecom and lead gen accounts... when you run the same industry repeatedly, your first-week optimizations on a new account are already at month-3 level for a generalist because you already know which ad angles, bidding structures and landing page frameworks work. That efficiency compounds silently into your margins without ever raising prices.\n\nThe one risk nobody talks about though... niche concentration means one industry downturn hits your whole book simultaneously.

You already know which ad angles convert, which landing page structure works, what objections come up in the sales call. That compounds into:\n\n- Faster onboarding = more capacity without hiring\n- Better results = higher retention\n- Speaking their exact language = shorter sales cycle\n- Case studies that resonate = easier to close the next one\n\nThe referral network effect you mentioned is the other thing that's hard to replicate with a generalist model. Pediatric dentists go to the same conferences, are in the same Facebook groups, probably know each other by name in any given metro area. One happy client becomes a referral engine in a way that \"one happy landscaper\" just doesn't.\n\nCurious about one thing - are you seeing any ceiling in terms of market size?

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.",

I asked who they were and he said they were his friends. I then asked if he understood why investors would think that’s a problem. He looked at me like I was stupid. \n\nI know many founders who were told by people they know that they’d buy after it was built. Then when it came time to pay, crickets. Don’t get us wrong. Warm sales are a great way to start. But they’re only the beginning. \n\nGreat post.",

I bootstrapped from 0→30K users building an SaaS AI voice automation tool for my local country thailand, but learned a harsh lesson: I was targeting the wrong customers.\n\n**The mistake: I** Spent 10 months chasing viral TikTok traffic (1M+ views, $0 revenue). \n\nFree users don't convert when you're bootstrapped (The Biggest mistakes is sell too cheap instead of selling higher pricing and delivery better for a few customers).\n\n**The pivot:** Switched to organic content for micro-niche B2B audiences (create deep break-down video tutorial / explains). Also, I decided to avoid ANY physical product businesses - pure digital/service only for maximize profit.\n\nThe real shift happened when I stopped posting and started post and having a conversations with my exist audience from my social media. Booked calls, asked about pain points, then closed $300-800 deals. Hit $10K profit in 2 months.\n\n**What I learned:** Right audience > volume. 1,000 true fans / engaged B2B followers beats 1M random TikTok views.\n\nNow I'm building my second SaaS - a workflow builder that analyzes winning content formats youtube/tiktok/ig/twitter any form and helps you replicate what already works. \n\nBasically solving problems for my past self🙏: \n\n\"How do I create winning organic content that actually converts?\"\n\nThe compounding effect is real.

No one bats an eye. I feel like I must’ve met 100 different people in 2 1/2 days, I’ve never heard of any of them, they all seem to have more money than God and treated some of the most expensive things I’ve ever been around as normal every day nothing. We fly back to Naples on a private jet the following day. Never even met the boss who owned the house and yacht and jet, he was in London the entire time. \n\nI know people have money, good friends family sold their business for 120 million been on their private jets a dozen times, I’ve been around money, I’ve never before or after been around the lifestyle.

Didn't even warn the cruise, just booked himself a couple of nights in a local hotel and didn't go back to shore that evening. He told me that \"in the time it takes to deal with the paperwork for cruise cancellation and refund claims, he makes more than the entire cruise cost him\".\n\n-people asking me to make their tour longer when we reached the end. I couldn't accept, as I was just a single freelancer at the time and had to go tour another customer. They then offered to pay the longer tour hours and pay the fee of the other family's tour to cover their cancellation. Obviously, I didn't accept, but that's a wild offer. \n\n-Guest cancelling a tour, long before the final date, so eligible for a complete refund. They denied the refund, said they enjoyed the smooth communication and energy.\n\nNot gonna lie, meeting these customers has made me change my evaluation of my services and perception of value. It's made my business life considerably more pleasant.",

      "text": "Been studying ad patterns lately. Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out.\n\n  \nEdit: Subreddit doesn't allow screenshots, however i got the data metrics from shophunter and no it does not mean that these numbers are true to the core but it aims for an accurate level. Also this is not a self promotion, i just found this while studying on other digital products and thought this was crazy. ",

Not following keyword checklist or sticking to any playbook. Just writing something we found cool. \n\nOut of nowhere our referral traffic spikes. I go looking for the source expecting some spam. \n\nNope. It’s The New York Times!\n\nThey did a story on the topic, found our little blog, and tossed us a contextual do-follow link. No outreach, no PR, just pure luck and having the right content sitting there waiting to be found.\n\nI'm still so happy. I thought you had to pay huge amounts or endlessly hustle for these kinds of tier-1 links. Just a reminder that the big fish are out there looking for the exact weird, niche stuff you're writing about.\n\nIt might not be a big deal to some of you but to me it's a massive win and I am very proud of this.

I'm also an ex-entrepreneur.\n\nAt 39 years old, I'm currently in a phase of transition, maybe midlife crisis... and starting to think  if this is really the direction I want to continue in or try something different.\n\nEverywhere I look, whether it's LinkedIn, people trying to sell you playbooks, or content creators on Instagram telling you how you can build a AI or content-driven business in 5 steps. Everybody seems to be doing something with tech or AI. That it seems to be like the only way to make money now.\n\nI was listening to the Mel Robbins podcast today about how to live a meaningful life, and design the future you want. It's really fantastic. I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it.\n\nAnd then after some deep thinking, I was just wondering, is there anybody building any type of business anymore, or like starting something up now which has nothing to do with AI or tech?! 🤔\n\nIs there no going back from having to share one's 5 winning tips in a LinkedIn post, or downloadable pdf if one writes X in the comments? 🫣",

For years he averaged 6 tours a week at $35 a head, 8 to 12 people each time. That kept us afloat through tough years.\n\nTwo years ago cancer hit and he had to stop. He handed it to me with stories about groups who came back year after year because he made the city feel alive. Now I run the tours but bookings dropped to 2 a week max. summer was okay with 10 person groups but winter is brutal, down to 4 or 5 people paying $140 total some days.\n\nThe problem is visibility. he relied on word of mouth and flyers at hotels. I tried a basic website and posting on local facebook groups but it barely moves the needle. overhead is low, just permits and transit at $200 a month, but without steady groups we cant cover basics. people loved his personal touch, the way hed stop for coffee at a spot with history or adjust for kids in the group.\n\nI want to honor what he built without turning it into some generic bus thing. for anyone whos scaled small tours or personal guides: what got you past the word of mouth phase, did you find platforms that connect groups without high fees? \n\nThank you everyone.",

It’s discoverability.\n\nA few practical ideas that don’t turn it into a bus-tour machine:\n\n1. Lean into the legacy. Most tours sell “see NYC.” You can sell “30 years of hidden NYC stories passed from father to son.” That angle alone is powerful. Put that front and center on your site and listings.\n2. Get on high-intent platforms. Airbnb Experiences, Viator, GetYourGuide. Yes, they take a cut. But they solve visibility instantly. You can always upsell direct repeat bookings later.\n3. Raise your price slightly. $35 feels underpriced for NYC walking tours in 2026. Higher price can actually signal quality and attract better groups.\n4. Collect emails every single tour. Offer a “hidden NYC spots” PDF or short story recap and build a list. Repeat business compounds.\n5. Encourage Google reviews aggressively. If he ran it 30 years, there must be past customers who’d happily leave a review. 100+ strong Google reviews alone can change local discovery.\n6. Winter pivot. Offer themed tours: “NYC Crime Stories,” “Historic Speakeasies,” “Love Stories of Manhattan.” Give people a reason beyond sightseeing.\n\nYou don’t need scale. You need positioning + distribution.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact that you care about keeping it personal is already your advantage over the big operators.",

It also allowed us to push for Google reviews. \n\nDon't ignore social media, post 4 - 5 times a week. We have alot of engagement with \"behind the scenes\" type post. Lean into your legacy and if your comfortable with it tell your story of trying to continue what your dad started.\n\nWinter is brutally slow in our area.

There's a market for that because many share the same painpoint. You can use AI to cut workload to a fraction, this means highly competitive rates and more deal flow. Or teach the average joe how to make a creative agency that leverages AI. The barrier to entry has dropped to the floor. AI can be used to create MVPs, designs, music, visuals, demos, etc. Learn it. Try it. Be the living proof that it works. Then sell it at a high ticket price, provide coaching access to you. That will make $10k a month minimum with much less work.",

Most people try to sell $20 products to thousands of people, which is a marketing nightmare. In sales, you only need to close 2-4 high-value deals a month to exceed that goal.\n\nTwo critical rules I live by:\n\n1. Sell value, not fluff. Work for a company that offers a solution with genuine value.\n\n2. Believe in the product! Only sell something you actually believe in and would be willing to pay for yourself. Authenticity is your biggest asset in high-stakes deals.\n\nEven if you don’t plan on being a \"salesman\" forever, learning how to sell is the most important life skill you can acquire.

Basically I serve as the senior tech and product leader for 3 to 4 companies at the same time, each paying a monthly retainer. I also run a small AI focused investment fund. No course. No ebook. No community with a $49/month paywall.\n\n**How long did it take to get into it?** I started my first company at 18 with no degree and no money. That was over a decade ago. The fractional executive work specifically took about 8 years of building, shipping, failing, and learning before I had enough credibility that companies would trust me with their product and engineering decisions. There was no shortcut. Anyone selling you a 90 day path to this is lying.\n\n**How long to make your first decent income?** My first real company took almost 2 years before I could pay myself consistently. The product I scaled to $20M ARR took about 18 months to hit meaningful revenue. Nothing worthwhile happened fast.\n\n**Do you regret the route?** Not even slightly. But I'd be lying if I said there weren't years where I questioned everything. The path from 18 year old with no credentials to where I am now was not some clean upward curve. It was chaos with a general upward trend if you zoom out far enough.\n\n**How much free time do you have?** More than you'd expect actually. I've built AI agent workflows that handle a massive chunk of what used to eat my day. Content, research, scheduling, first drafts of almost everything. I work hard from about 8 AM to 4 PM, work out, and my evenings are mostly free. Weekends are mine. That said, this took years of deliberately designing my work to be async and systems driven. Early on I had zero free time and that's just the honest reality of building.\n\n**How long will it last?** The fractional model is only growing because startups can't afford full time C suite leaders but desperately need senior thinking. AI makes me more valuable not less because most founders need someone who actually understands how to operationalize AI, not just talk about it. I'd bet on this model for at least the next 5 to 10 years, probably longer.\n\n**How much?** Well above 10k/month. I won't give exact numbers because it varies by quarter and client load, but each retainer client is a meaningful five figure monthly engagement and I run multiple simultaneously.\n\nThe real answer to your actual question though: pick something where the value you provide compounds over time. Courses and dropshipping don't compound. Expertise does. Skills do. Reputation does. It's slower and less sexy and nobody will make a TikTok about it. But it's the thing that actually works.",

It’s not instant money, but having structured, researched ideas saves months of random trial and error. In a space full of course sellers, that’s been a refreshing change.",

Avoid chains because they’re using sisco, etc. Get together a list of a good 20+ local businesses. See if you can figure out anything they’d need regularly that you’d be able to get. I’ve not done it on that level so the only example I can think of is I had a guy locally that would deliver our buns. We didn’t go through enough where I was to do bulk orders because it’d go bad.

Feet content works extremely well when you lean into specificity, certain aesthetics, themes, angles, accessories, or lifestyle positioning. I don’t rely on viral clips; I focus on recurring memberships, custom requests, premium bundles, and high-margin private content.\n\nAnd more importantly, the real leverage came from operating on adult turnkey scripts instead of depending on third-party platforms. I own the platform, the data, the pricing, and the backend funnels. Since I’m faceless, branding revolves around consistency, lighting quality, storytelling captions, and strong CTAs. Retention is where real money is made.

You have a mortgage.\n\nBut huge companies have a massive weakness: they are deaf. They rely on automated bots, generic marketing emails, and customer support teams that take three days to reply. We realized that if we couldn't outspend them, we could out-listen them.\n\nOver the last 60 days, we’ve been stealing customers from our biggest competitors by showing up at the exact moment they fail.\n\n# Finding Places Where Your Competitors Fail\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people vent their frustrations about big name software on Reddit and X.\n\n* \"Why did \\[Giant Competitor\\] just double their prices?\"\n* \"Is it just me, or is \\[Giant Competitor\\] down again?\"\n* \"Does anyone have a better alternative for \\[Competitor\\]? Their support is non-existent.\"\n\nMost companies don't see these posts until they’ve been live for two days. By then, the user has already moved on or just given up. We decided to make our response time our primary competitive advantage.\n\n# The Workflow\n\nWe built a \"Strike Team\" workflow (which is literally just me and one assistant) to catch these signals in real time.\n\n1. **The Trigger:** We monitor specific \"vulnerability\" keywords for our top five competitors. We don't just track their brand names. We track their names plus words like \"alternative,\" \"broken,\" \"slow,\" or \"overpriced.\"\n2. **The Contextual Reply:** When a signal hits, we don't send a sales pitch. We jump into the thread and offer immediate, specific help.\n   * **Example:** \"I saw you're struggling with that API integration. We actually built our tool specifically to solve that because we had the same issue. Happy to give you a free 3 month trial to help you migrate over today.\"\n3. **The Closing:** We offer a \"Concierge Migration.\" If they are leaving a big player, they are usually terrified of the data move. We tell them we’ll do the heavy lifting for them.\n\n# Our Results\n\n|**Metric**|**Google Ads (Old Way)**|**Social Intent (The New Way)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Budget**|$2,000/mo minimum|$0 in Ad Spend|\n|**Conversion Rate**|2-3%|15-20%|\n|**Lead Quality**|Just browsing|Ready to switch NOW|\n|**Customer Vibe**|Just another ad|You guys are a lifesaver|\n\nThe giants in your industry are moving too fast to care about a single frustrated tweet or Reddit thread.

Big companies almost never do this, and users feel like they're shouting into the void with their requests. Even just saying \"feature requests are open, and here's what we're prioritizing this month\" creates a sense of buy-in you can't really fake.\n\n\n\nWe built a product in the Chrome extension space around this idea, and it’s wild how much goodwill comes from actually listening, shipping fast, and letting users steer the ship.

I've seen accounts get shadowbanned for that even when the help was genuine. mixing in pure value comments (no mention of your tool at all) in those same communities helps a lot with not looking like you're astroturfing. like a 5:1 ratio of helpful comments to actual product mentions\n\nsolid numbers for $0 ad spend tho. 8 closes from 42 outreach is wild",

It’s clarity.  \nIf people are “interested” but not paying, it usually means one of three things:\n\nThe problem isn’t painful enough\n\nThe value isn’t clear enough\n\nThe trust isn’t strong enough\n\nEarly on, I wasted time trying to convince people. Later I realized, if you have to push too hard, you’re either targeting the wrong audience or solving a weak problem.\n\nAnother lesson: revenue is truth.  \nLikes, followers, compliments - none of that matters. If someone pays you, that’s validation. If they don’t, that’s feedback.\n\nAlso, don’t romanticize starting from scratch. I used to think building from zero was the only “real” way. Over time I learned that smart entrepreneurs look for leverage partnerships, acquisitions, existing demand, distribution channels. Starting is good. Entering wisely is better.\n\nAnd lastly, confusion is normal.  \nEvery founder feels like they don’t know what they’re doing. The difference is successful ones keep moving anyway. They test, adjust, simplify, repeat.\n\nYou don’t need to know everything.\n\nYou just need to:  \nSolve a real problem.  \nCharge early.  \nListen carefully.  \nAnd stay in the game longer than most people.\n\nClarity comes from action, not overthinking.",

For what it takes, they’re really easy to make, just give yourself plenty of time because people take ages to reply to your emails, every fix up on paperwork takes like a week to amend, even if it’s small, it’s annoying. The biggest problem is getting up front money, so when you’re starting and scaling I’m take huge financial risk as I’m working on loans and a lot of hope that I can make enough money to pay off huge lump sums of money in deadlines so I don’t lose thousand and thousands in deposits, start small with a proof of concept and then go big",

Every decision goes through them. Every problem needs them. At first that feels normal, and even necessary.

You built a responsibility that never lets go of you.\n\nThe turning point is when you start putting the right people in place. People you trust. People who can handle things without needing you every five minutes. That’s when you can finally step back a little.\n\nAnd when you step back, you start seeing things differently. When you’re in the middle of it every day, you’re just reacting. Fixing problems. Answering questions. Putting out fires. You don’t have the mental space to see what actually needs to change.\n\nBut from the outside, things become more obvious. You notice inefficiencies. You notice patterns. You notice problems you didn’t even realize were there.\n\nYou also get your freedom back. You can take time off. You can breathe. And weirdly enough, the business often gets better when you stop hovering over everything.\n\nBeing involved is important, especially early on.

They just happen to be using AI as the internal mechanism to make it work. Real game is in the boring stuff... for example, we build custom agents that act as internal knowledge bases for companies.   \n  \nWe feed it every SOP, doc, & past project file. Product isn't the AI... the product is cutting new hire onboarding time by 75%.   \n  \nThat's a real, measurable outcome you can put on an invoice. Another big one is just automating the grunt work for service businesses. We build systems that handle all the initial client intake... asking the qualifying questions, sorting the tire-kickers from the real leads, & booking the good ones. The product isn't a chatbot... it's guaranteeing the sales team only spends time with people who can actually afford them.   \n  \nAnd honestly, the biggest opportunity is just being the glue. Most businesses are already running on platforms like Salesforce, Hubspot or Highlevel. We build the connective tissue that plugs advanced AI capabilities into the tools they already use. We're not selling them a new platform... we're making the one they've already paid for 10x more powerful.   \n  \nYou have to stop looking at AI in a vacuum, start with a real business P&L. Find the most expensive, manual process on that sheet... & just replace it. The money isn't in selling AI, it's in selling solved problems.",

Here are the ones that gets mentioned often inside our company\n\n* Generating Presentations: After every client meeting, Zooms AI Summary, is auto routed to Gamma. Gamma then generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n* A/B testing ads: Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n* Content Based on Google Data: Again, we used to constantly manually look at our Google search console data and publish weekly content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those on Google! Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every Monday! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n* Meeting Notes & Followups: Granola has been great for recording meetings, summarizing, generating follow-up emails, and just making sure that we don't miss any context. \n\nFollowing to see what others have it going :)",

          "text": "Start with the boring stuff. That’s where you save the most time. Here are some of the repeatable tasks u can start with (depending upon ur business and priority) \n\n\\- For lead capture to CRM and follow ups, stop adding people manually. When someone fills a form or books a call, they should go straight into your CRM, get tagged and receive a follow-up email right away. Zapier and Make are great for connecting your forms to your CRM. HubSpot or ActiveCampaign are good if you want forms, CRM, and email sequences in one place.\n\n\\- For calendar booking and reminders, reduce no shows with simple automation. When someone books a call, they should get automatic reminders and a followups after the meeting. Calendly is very easy to set up.\n\n\\- For writing and brainstorming, sometimes typing slows you down. Being able to speak your first draft helps you get ideas out quickly, then clean them up after. Voibe also works well here since it lets you dictate into writing tools and AI apps. Other options include tools like Otter for transcription, Notion AI for cleaning up rough drafts.\n\n\\- For content repurposing, create once and reuse it everywhere. Record a video or podcast, then turn it into posts, emails, and blogs. Descript helps with transcripts and editing. Opus Clip turns long videos into short clips. ChatGPT can turn transcripts into posts or blog drafts. Buffer helps you schedule everything so you’re not posting manually every day.\n\n\\- For email sorting and replies, let your inbox organize itself. Instead of reading everything one by one, use tools that sort and draft replies for you. Superhuman is fast and clean. SaneBox auto-sorts emails. Marblism can manage your inbox, draft replies, and handle follow-ups so you just review and send.\n\nKeep in mind: automate clear(tasks for which u have SOPs), repeatable tasks first. If something already works well, automate it. If it’s messy, make a process/SOP before using or trying new tools.",

Now I’m a lot more open to testing ideas that go against the grain instead of just defaulting to what everyone says you’re supposed to do.\n\nSo curious, what’s an unpopular strategy that ended up driving the biggest growth for your business?",

Hiring for marketing or sales would burn through runway, and pulling my small engineering team off the core product to build internal tools felt like a huge waste.\n\nSo I started feeding prompts to claude. I honestly thought it was a joke at first, but it's like becoming a spell-casting wizard without going to wizarding school. In the past month, I've built AI agents that manage my social media engagement, an app that writes my investor updates by pulling from slack and email, and I even rebuilt our entire marketing site in a day.\n\nThe result is my five engineers stay 100% focused on the core product, which has massively increased our velocity. And I can run all founder-led growth myself without hiring, which makes us incredibly capital efficient. It completely changed the trajectory of the business.",

The strategies don't change a whole lot:\n\n1) secure your essentials for survival: pay off a reliable car, get health insurance, rent, food/ supplies \n\n2) open a brokerage account preferably where you bank so that fund transfers take zero time. think schwab, fidelity, etc. \n\n3) create and max out your ROTH IRA up to the annual limit of 2025 (you have until April 15) and for 2026. \n\n4) buy dividend-paying, low expense ratio, large-cap index funds, ETFs, and companies that payout AND increase dividends for decades (easy DIY system that tells you literally whether a company or fund is very safe, safe, borderline, or unsafe is Simply Safe Dividends). \n\nmake sure you enable auto reinvesting so you can buy fractional shares when dividends are paid out (monthly, quarterly, or annually). \n\nProTip: balance your investment portfolio of stocks among established industries like consumer staple goods, industrial / bluechip manufacturing, etc. avoid crypto and other speculative investments. \n\nyou're gonna kill it. congrats on landing this windfall. now is your time to build a robust present and future. excited for you!",

DONT SPEND IT OR INVEST IN SOMEONE ELSE.\n\nTalk to AI or a free tax advisor about how to minimize your tax liability on it. Maybe take the money as a trust or LLC.\n\nDONT all the sudden think you are a businessman and quit your day job. Stay employed because $50k isn’t that much money these days.\n\nDONT tell anyone you won money especially people around you like friends and family.\n\nDO research on low cost/ low involvement side businesses like laundromats and the like. But tbh $50k isn’t that much and might get lost in these sorts of businesses. Be aware of your risk.\n\nDO pay off a vehicle but don’t just buy-a-bucket. Get something that is going to last and that has low maintenance costs. You could save money on auto insurance this way by carrying liability only. \n\nDONT pay off your debt. That’s horrible advice! There is good debt and bad debt. Having good credit is beneficial. Having current credit is beneficial. Debt should be kept at a percentage of income and preferably paid without penalty. Debt should be BUDGETED.\n\nDO budget your income and living expenses. Use this opportunity to get ahead but don’t think like you won the lottery (not in this economy). \n\nThe best businesses to get into are the ones you don’t have to fund yourself. If you do decide to go into business, get a LLC or Corp in Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada. (Ask ai the difference between them and which is better for your situation.) Register your business with an EIN and DUNS number. EIN and DUNS are free but you need to register your LLC (about $200). DUNS registered means you can get business credit.\n\nAs far as investing:\n\nI believe an IRA or Roth IRA might lower your taxable income also, but verify that. I think the yearly max for RothIRA is $6-7k though.\n\nYou could invest in life insurance also. MetLIFE policies is what union tradesman use. Which also might lower your taxable income. (There are different policies though that you are going to want to pay attention to and research beforehand). Whole life is better (than term-life) especially if you’re younger since its value appreciates and sometimes you can use it.\n\nAs far as ETF investing, when the sp500 is up gold goes down. Somewhat. You could invest in both when they pull back (down) to a 30 moving average. Invest slowly not all at once. But this sort of investment is what you should be doing regularly for yourself irrespective of winnings.\n\nBitcoin has proven itself also. But crypto could also be more risky. Maybe take a little cash and create your own mime coin. But don’t go all in with your winnings (into anything).",

This will help you build a credit history, which is infinitely more important than simply being out of debt. Educate yourself on the basics of insurance, credit scores, investments, small businesses, and certifications.\n\nKeep your day job, and consider figuring out what your interests truly are. Take your time to learn and explore your own creativity. Be very selective about what you'd like to invest in. Do not be quick to pay out of pocket for anything unless you are duly informed and confident in said product or service.\n\nThere's plenty of great opportunities out there, and there's even more that will gladly scam you out of your money. Take the time to protect your privacy and assets physically and digitally. Google is your best friend when avoiding scams and AI chat bots will help you brainstorm before blindly making important decisions. \n\nMost of all, have fun.

      "text": "I spent 9 years building businesses and I had no idea why I was doing any of it\n\nok so this might sound dumb but I uploaded a book into an AI and it helped me understand something about myself that 9 years of running businesses never did. and I keep thinking about it so figured I'd write it out.\n\nI'm 36. sold a company that had 60 employees. built multiple things since then. made good money lost good money. on paper everything looked fine. in reality after I sold I spent close to three years just... doing nothing that worked. launched a community, made like 10K and quit. took on a client I couldnt deliver for and had to refund them. tried helping a friend sell his course over the phone, we both gave up after few weeks. made some impulsive investments im not proud of.\n\nand the whole time I kept thinking something was wrong with me because I'd already proven I could build things. 60 employees. millions in revenue. and now I couldnt even commit to finishing a landing page without overthinking it for a week.\n\nanyway. few weeks ago I was using AI for work stuff like I always do. ads, competitor research, cold email sequences the usual. and I had this random thought like what if I actually used this thing for something personal. not business personal. like actually about me.\n\nso I took Simon Sineks Find Your Why book, the actual PDF, uploaded it into Claude and basically said ok treat me like a coaching client. go through the exercises with me. ask me the questions from the book but dont let me give you surface level bullshit answers.\n\nand man. it went places I wasnt expecting.\n\nit started asking me about specific moments. not like \"what are your values\" garbage. real stuff. tell me about a time you felt most alive what were you doing who was around you. and everytime I gave a vague answer it pushed back. like no be more specific what exactly happened what did it feel like.\n\nso im sitting there telling it about this time in Australia when I was 22 and broke, and I connected a friend who was an investor type with a DJ who needed funding for something. and I remember watching them talk and feeling this thing in my chest like THIS. this is it. not the money not the deal just the fact that I put two people in a room who would never have met without me and something was happening.\n\nand then it asked me ok what else. and I realized every single story I was telling had the same thread. connecting people. putting the right humans together. making things happen that wouldnt exist if I wasnt the bridge.\n\nafter like two hours of going back and forth it pulled everything into one sentence and I literally stared at my screen for a while.\n\n\"To transform ideas into reality by connecting the right people so that everyone can build what they envision.\"\n\nnow I know reading someone elses purpose statement feels like nothing. its just words. but arriving at it through your own stories is a completly different experience. it wasnt generated by the AI. it was extracted from stuff I actually lived. the AI just asked better questions than I would have asked myself and didnt let me dodge anything.\n\nand suddenly three years of feeling lost made sense. I have a studio in Lisbon that literally loses money every month but the network I built through it is worth more than anything ive ever invested in. I never understood why I kept it. now I do. its the thing. connecting people around ideas. thats just me.\n\nthe three years of failed solo projects? I wasnt missing a company. I was missing people to connect.\n\nlook I use AI every day for work. funnels, prospecting, creative, research. but using it to actually understand myself felt almost too simple and it was probably the most valueable two hours I've spent with it ever.\n\nim not saying go do exactly this. but if you've been building for years and your answer to \"why do you do what you do\" is still \"freedom\" or \"money\" then idk man. maybe thats worth looking at. the book is free to find and the AI part costs like 20 bucks a month.\n\nand if you actually try it id genuinely love to see your why statement in the comments. not to judge just curious what other people come up with when they actually sit with it. mine surprised the hell out of me so id bet yours would too\n\nEdit : I learned the lesson I wrote it myself for the haters that think it's AI. LOL\n\n",

              "text": "ok since a few of you asked heres what I did. gonna try to be as clear as possible so you can just do it tonight if you want\nfirst thing, the book you need is \"Find Your Why\" by Simon Sinek. NOT Start With Why. Start With Why is the concept, Find Your Why is the one with the actual exercises and questions. theres PDFs around or just grab it on kindle its like 10 bucks.\nthen you upload it into Claude. I use the pro version but pretty sure free works too. and you tell it something like:\n\"I want you to read this book and act as my personal coach to help me discover my WHY using the methodology in it. Ask me one question at a time. Wait for my answer before moving to the next. Push back when my answers are too vague or generic. Look for patterns between my stories. At the end, synthesize everything into a WHY statement using Sineks format: To ______ so that ______.\"\nthats literally the prompt. nothing fancy.\nthen you just talk to it. its going to ask you about specific moments in your life. times you felt most alive, most proud, most like yourself. and heres the important part, dont give it clean answers. dont say \"I value helping people.\" say \"I was at a bar in Sydney at 22 and I introduced my friend to this guy and watched them start working on something together and I felt this thing in my chest.\" the more specific and messy the better. thats where the real patterns show up.\nwhen I did it the first 30 minutes felt kind of whatever. almost stopped honestly. really glad I didnt because after that is when I started pulling up stories I hadnt thought about in years and the AI started connecting dots I never saw.\ncouple things that helped me:\n- talk in moments not concepts. stories not adjectives\n- if it gives you a WHY statement that feels too corporate or generic just tell it \"that doesnt feel right, try again using more of my actual words\"\n- dont try to do it in 20 minutes. give it at least an hour. I did two and thats when it really clicked\n- youll know when its right. it sounds dumb but you feel it. mine made me stare at my screen because suddenly like 10 years of random decisions all made sense at once\nanyway hope this helps. and if you actually do it drop your WHY statement in the comments im genuinely curious to see what people come up with. mine caught me off guard so im betting yours will too",

I've seen that direct revenue impact tends to be lower for B2B tools, but it's still useful as an engagement tool. 100% recommend if you have the bandwidth for it. How early in your journey you'd implement it probably depends on what category you fall into as a business.",
