I landed a job at large asset management firm (> $1 trillion aum) and was promoted after my first year for creating a tool that saved the funds 300-400k per year. I left after 2.5 years and now run the finance division for a billionaire who has a family office.\n\nI’ve learnt coding, financial statement analysis and modelling, but want to create something that’s mine.\n\nEveryone’s trying to make it, those that were able to do it early in their lives, why do you think that is? What was it that you did, that was different?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I shared a bathroom with 2 other tenants. Woke up in the morning with the cops running around the house because one of the tenants died in the shared bathroom. I barely had enough money to eat. Found a second job. Worked 70-80 hours a week. Luckily the local state university opened an extension school in our local HS. I could take a couple classes a semester in the evening. Still worked the 2 jobs and >70 hours. Eventually graduated. Saw the movie Wall Street. Figured, if you want to make money go to where the money is. Took my 1 week vacation to NYC. Called, dropped off and sent out resumes to anyone I could. Within the week I had a few interviews. Late ‘90s NYC was a great job market. Took a chance, called in and quit my job back home and stayed another week. Got an entry level job at a premiere wealth management company. Went back home, sold, dumped, packed up everything I had. Found a roommate from a classified in the Village Voice (newspaper). Worked as many hours as I could. Kept getting promoted. After almost 20 years of working harder than everyone else in the office I was making over $1 million a year. But Wall Street is a feast or famine business. Eventually the company I worked for made some bad decisions and went under. Now I’m in my mid 50s and unemployed. But at least I wasn’t a crazy spender and I have a few million in saving.",

I got an opportunity to purchase some land (32 acres) and just like the others was just going to hold it until the value increased, I received a call from a company saying they'd like to purchase the 32 acres and we agreed on a price where I would have profited about 200k which I was excited for but then they said they wanted to pay me in installments and I almost did I was going back n forth on my decision and that's when they told me they really only needed about 2 acres of it, if I didn't want to sell would I be willing to rent them the 2 acres after some informative digging we agreed on a price. I still own that property and as of today there is 8 companies currently that rent some portion of it. The beauty of it is they maintain their own rented space and a lot of them have built something on their rented portion which has increased the property value. I make 1.2 million a year off of those 32 acres and yes I've repeated the same thing in surrounding cities and continue to look for more and different opportunities. I owe alot to the first company who reached out(a fence company) for actually coming up with the idea for me.",

Got a free PC with a cheap internet plan my mom got back in the early 2000's and started doing entrepreneur things. Farmed gold on RuneScape and things like that and sold it and earned more than my mom. This gave me a good amount of knowledge about computers. Did some other shady things like some hacking here and there but never for profit, I didn't know hacking is a job. Didn't like school so I didn't even get a high school diploma.\n\nAt 18 moved to the UK by myself with £20 in my pocket and slept on a friend's sofa.\n\nGot a job as a junior chef, worked there for a few years. Then I found out Police is recruiting without a high school diploma so I applied and got in. Within 3 years became a detective, then joined a cybercrime unit. Got into crypto and cybersecurity pretty heavily, then around when I was 24 I got a job in Cybersecurity where I got a ton of certificates. I really got into tech BIG time at this age. I started learning how to code and probably launched like 20 failed startups.\n\nAround 28 I started doing crypto and built a project in the space that went super viral and made me $1.5m within 3 months then died out. Not going to say what it was but it was a platform where I earned fees, similar to a DEX. This made me a millionaire at 28, I went from negative balance to millionaire overnight. I was working 9-5 then 5-3am 7 days a week from ages 24-28. \n\nLife was extremely difficult, I cried when I had my lucky break but was super sad it only lasted a short time. I took the money and invested it and now living off the investment income and building another startup, in cybersecurity. I really hope this can be a long term project now that I got proper funding and have a goal to exit this business for at least $100m then hopefully retire around 40.",

          "text": "That is a very tough loaded question. It would be as hard as pushing a mountain through a pin hole but let me give it a shot. Let me see how I could help you:\n\n* Hunt for \"New money\", or combine with \"old money\" knowledge you've gathered and try to carve a path in old money from the systems usual go to path i.e. study or absorb high value knowledge and applying them. Learn the avenues of money and how to mine it. Keep at it and make it your game (like Robert Kiyosaki said his game is making money and the points or high scores are the numbers). Watch motivating things and keep grinding, grinding, grinding. Enjoy the breaks and time with members important to you 100% (the little time you have with them) as much as you go with your 100% grinding. (forgive me for the lingo I am just trying to connect). Update, analyze, envision the possibilities and prepare a backup plan if things go sour. Engage in hobbies.\n* Follow advice and find the right mentor as it would save you a lot of time (they'd guide you or simply tell you the way forward as you carve your path). Listen to wise time tested advice and you will see patterns. Do the money thing early in your age and learn it as early as possible (finances and such).\n* The other one is time and experience in the field of \"hunting for money with your skillset\". Plan well, run numbers, look ahead at the high hitting ones that you can work well into accomplishing.\n* Basically you have kind of done it in your field (you are doing pretty well yourself, you should actually be the one also giving advice). Now you just have to maintain it and move higher or sideways strategically (or if you go down then at least know you will bounce back up because you have the know how or do like the ones that call it a day and retire as their goal was simply to get up and build a nest egg and retire comfortably)\n* Figure out what works for you and do it like you love it. When you hit it big, everything else will follow.\n* Learn value and value extraction and learn conversion rates (like making a sale or something). Basically businesses are things that solve a problem (if you plan to go that route). As for work, it is how useful you are and what you offer society. It was like that show I watched a long time ago, the kid didn't know how to use ninja tricks or magic but he maxed out it physical ability he became so good they considered him a legend (a legend on top of the world considered him a walking legend). You don't have to be that good but been stable is good enough to pass the bar.\n* Wealth and Riches will simply at times multiply your behavior so keep some things in check. (there is the occasional leak out but at least keep it in check, you could look into Stoicism). Not a must but also wealth kind of has an effect on those around you so keep that in mind too and try to help where you could or mentor where you can (you can pick everyone along the way like motivational speakers if you want too).\n* Look at the power of compounding and disciplined steps.\n* Perseverance but also knowing when to rest and enjoy the view. You'll appreciate your efforts as you look for a 'save point' or nest egg so when you fall you don't have to start from ground 0 (well you can definitely bounce back from ground 0 but if you say have a family or something you wouldn't want that though if you must go through it then you must).\n\n***TL:DR;*** *\"Have a mentor, have a vision and work at it like a savage. If you failed, learn from it, get back up and bounce back\"*\n\n***Warning:***\n\nThing is this thing needs you to have a lot of life experiences that is why I hang out with older gens and also see how newer gens do things because they have very interesting questions.\n\nSchool, re-learn (deprogram and program again what works), be good but smart enough to eat the good and spit out the bad. Once you finish the schooling and intense training apply the the knowledge and skills you having been cumulating as you also built a hobby on the side with sort of a final goal as you also had fun with it.\n\n(but *do some calculations and* ***apply safety nets*** *and know when to pivot* if you should because sometimes people will doubt you even if you are right and it has happened a lot of times. Also be autocorrecting and know when you are messing up, be critical to yourself but try to understand other people when they mess up and how to better manage them to let their skill shine beside yours. As I said it is a loaded question).\n\nHope this helps. (Also it seems you did well for yourself in your field, the best game that I think best explains this is The Sims - the first game. You could see almost everything in a human lifecycle there)",

Instead of only working harder at a job, they build assets, equity, skills, or distribution that scale beyond their time. A lot of them get obsessive about one high-value skill early (tech, sales, finance, content, etc.), live way below their means even after earning more, and take calculated asymmetric bets where the downside is survivable but the upside is huge. Another big difference is speed, they ship faster, learn faster, and tolerate uncertainty way better than average. Also, environment matters more than people admit; being close to capital, networks, or high-growth industries compounds everything. And honestly, luck and timing play a role too, but the common thread is they put themselves in positions where luck could actually hit, instead of just playing safe for stability their whole life. ",

Stocks can help you get richer, but not make you rich in and of themselves.  The overall best return is starting a successful business.  This, over time, can be a return on investment 1000x.  But, it’s really fucking hard.  From my own sucesss and meeting and talking with other people, I have distilled success down to three traits.  It is these traits that matter, and will make or break you.\n\nPrimary is risk.  You have to be able to risk, to put something on the line for possible failure and loss.  You have to be able to sacrifice time and labor for nothing in the hopes of something.  This is fundamental.  A lot of people cannot do this and are essentially born to be employees.  Doesn’t mean they aren’t smart or competent.  They just can’t risk.\n\nSecondary trait 1 is conscientiousness.  Hard work.  Pride.  Quality first.  Working long hours without reward.  Speed is accuracy.  This is a trait that can be honed.  If someone has this and the ability to risk, they are probably at a 60% chance of success.  \n\nSecondary rest to is competence.  High IQ, creativity.  Critical thinking quickly, problem solving.  Learning fast and adapting.  This is essentially always having the right answer, the best idea.  This is more of something you are born with.  If you have this, and the ability to risk, you probably have an 80% chance at success.  \n\nIf you have all three you are a guaranteed millionaire.  But, to have all three traits probably puts you in maybe 2% of the population.  A lot of people can’t risk, and some that can’t risk either aren’t intelligent or are lazy or both.  \n\nSo the thing to do is sit down and figure out what your traits are.  Starting with risk.  If you can honestly determine that you truly cannot risk, then your time is best served finding the highest position you can to serve someone who can risk.  And one thing I would conjecture, and it isn’t a judgment, but the type of person who truly has trait 3 isn’t the type that would need to ask anyone how to do x or become y.  They would intuitively figure it out on their own.  They are the type to ask a specific question maybe from a lack of knowledge, like where on a website is the contact button or something like that.  They wouldn’t ask “how do I become rich.”  And for that person, if they can risk, they just need to find a high IQ creative individual who can’t risk and hire them.",

You learn early in life that happiness does not require money, though you also learn that not having money can cause incredible amounts of stress. \n\nThis provides motivation to build a better life but an understanding which allows you to take calculated risks as you know that your likely worst case outcome is that you live in a tiny flat and eat nothing but beans on toast for most meals. \n\nI built and sold a business by 35 which allowed me to retire very young and spend time at home with my young kids. However this was my third attempt at building a business and I didn’t give up or stop taking (calculated) risks until I had achieved my goal. \n\nI believe that you are unlikely to get rich if you work for someone else as no matter how well paid you are, you are always constrained by the number of hours you can work. When you set up a business you can hire others and can profit from the work they do which removes this constraint of your time. \n\nYou currently work with high net worth individuals which suggests you see how much those people and the companies they own are willing to spend on the right service. If I were you I would lean into this and identify the right opportunity to provide a high value, high margin service to customers that you already know have money to spend. \n\nGood luck!",

That bought me the options that most people don’t have. Options let you take risks without panic.\n* **I started businesses early, even if they were small and messy.** Most didn’t matter directly, but they taught me how money actually works: customers, margins, systems, sales, and getting punched in the face and continuing anyway.\n* **Above all, I had hustle.** If I didn’t know something, I learned it.

When I was 29 I bought myself into an existing company, those shares were worth well over a million at 35 (I bought at a discount and put in 475k euro). And I bought real estate which quickly rose in value (about 550k worth more than the outstanding mortgage at 35). \n\nThe main factor was taking calculated risks; I dropped out of school to work fulltime for my own. Hired employees to grow companies with actual value instead of staying safe as a solopreneur or freelancer. I took a loan for my buy-in so I could buy a significant amount of shares (instead of only buying what I could afford). And bought my house without having seen it all since it was a forced sell by a bank (and the reason I got it below market value in a heated market), I turned that house into 3 apartments to increase value.",

People take one highly leveraged skill, stick with it for years, then find themselves where the money is moving, and solve a specific expensive problem for those who can pay. It’s less about the hustle and more about getting close to the real pain of the business and building trust. You already have a rare piece. You’ve made tools that saved real money, and you’re inside a family office. If you want to “own it,” I would start by taking one recurring pain that you see every week, making a small product out of it, and selling it to people who have been in your shoes.

My family is well-off and very comfortable in Pakistan. But that does not translate to wealthy for US. I was born in the US before my parents decided to move back. The main privileges that I enjoy are:\n\n1. Education was highly prioritized in my family and I had to work very hard in educaiton because of the insanely competitive environment of Pakistan. In fact, I worked less in a top 10 engineering school where I graduated with high honors than I did in Pakistan.\n\n2. I did not feel the pressure to support my family back in Pakistan.\n\n3. I am a US citizen so I could avail financial aid to pay for my school and work without needing authorization.\n\nAgain, I know I was very privileged but I feel I enjoyed fewer privileges than most of the people whining about how hard it is to make it. Money was financial aid, scholarships, work, and student loans. The student loans themselves were tiny because I went to a state school and were very easy to pay off because I am cheap so I saved a lot and went to a state school so they were small. I did not have any network I could lean on other than the network I built for myself by performing very well in school. My biggest advantage was the priority of education in my family.\n\nWorked for 5 years after my masters. I was fortunate that I took a job with ARM and the share price went up so I got a nice buffer. But then again, I also had a divorce that cost me a large chunk of the money I had saved. \n\nStarted a consulting company. Ran it for \\~7 years. Exited it to a GSI. Was a millionaire right around an age of 35. \n\nWhat people need to realize is that whether you work at a job or start your own business, you are someone that sells your labor for money. The question is how many customers you have and how much ownership you have of the systems. You don't need to be wealthy to start a business. You can just do what you're doing at a job as a business and make more money doing so.",

Using benefits like scholarships/military to get a free or cheaper education will also help. But most importantly stay out of debt, don't max out credit cards, don't buy a home you can't afford, don't waste money on expensive rent, don't waste money on a girl that does not really love you, don't waste money on drugs, ect. Also focus on getting a job in a good career feild that has a high ladder to climb to eventually reach over 200k a year at your peak, if your comfortable with being an employee this will help you build weatlh if you put most of your paycheck into assests every year and max your retirement accounts out. Assests can include rental homes, stocks, businesses ect. Know you will most likely not ever get super rich unless you own your own busniess or invest and get luckly. But this is a simple path to follow to be wealthy by 35 or 40. The main trend is starting young and not making any big mistakes like getting stuck in a bad career, getting into large debt, drugs ect.",

Got into finance through a scholarship program, worked my way to Goldman, then HBS, now acquiring businesses (still working full-time W-2 because I am not past the fear of losing it all and feel the need for the stability).\n\nWhat I did differently:\n\n**1. I treated early jobs as paid education, not just paychecks.** Stayed at Goldman for 2 years learning deal structure, now at a sovereign wealth fund where I'm still learning from people decades ahead of me. That knowledge compounds when I evaluate acquisitions. But I'm staying in W-2 longer than I probably should because I'm terrified of cutting the cord and owning my income 100%\n\n**2. I got comfortable being the least qualified person in the room.** Applied to jobs I thought were \"not for people like me.\" Turns out imposter syndrome is just fear with better marketing.\n\n**3. I learned the math.** Everyone in my old life told me I couldn't afford to buy a business. Turns out with SBA financing and understanding tax benefits, I put $65K into a deal that would have seemed impossible a year earlier. The barrier was knowledge, not money.\n\n**4. I asked dumb questions to smart people.** Mentors, advisors, CPAs who knew more than me. Most people will help if you're genuinely trying to learn.\n\nThe shift: stopped waiting for permission that was never coming. Nobody tells the kid from the food stamp line \"you should buy a company.\" Had to give myself that permission.\n\nYou're already doing the hard part - learning skills that create value (being reasonably technical, financial modeling). The \"something that's mine\" is closer than you think. What are you considering building?",

          "text": "I grew up very poor and we were even homeless for a short time after NAFTA wiped out all the jobs in our region but my mom was very, very hardcore about saving and managing money. She was also very against going into debt. Her flaw was she was a saver, not an investor so she was constantly living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI wanted to be an architect. I went to college but chose the most affordable accredited degree I could get instead of a more prestigious but way more expensive option. Back in the early 2000s college wasn't as crazy expensive as now. I was able to work nights and weekends to not go into debt. While every single person I knew was taking out tons of debt and spending money partying and living large in college I was penny pinching. Even though school and teachers threatened me to quit my job and focus on school I continued to work so I wouldn't need a loan. There were a few times I had to borrow money to get by but paid it back as soon as possible. I totally understand this is almost impossible nowadays unless you are talking a community college.\n\nAfter school I got an ok job with a firm paying very little and then the 2008 financial crisis hit. Job gave me a choice of halfing my pay which was already very low or leave. I halfed my pay to stay and literally made less than minimum wage with all the unpaid overtime I worked. I basically worked like a dog for years with minimal pay raises until about 2017 where I got married and finally decided to go out on my own and start my own firm with massive encouragement by my wife. Thank god for her. At this time I had a negative net worth with a home mortgage of about 150k and 20k car debt.\n\nThe first year on my own I think I only made like 20k but I made good connections and learned about business. I kept the company as lean as physically possible working from home and not hiring anyone just putting in 60+ hours a week. By 2019 I was finally making what I was at my previous firm about 80k a year. Then 2020 really blew up where I was finally making 6 figures. My wife was super encouraging and also got her degree in design and started helping me out.\n\nI aggressively paid off all debts and paid off my car and house in that year. I was finally at a positive net worth.\n\nI realized the real money wasnt in the design work but in the development. My wife and I started searching properties and I made some contacts with capital. I couldnt invest money but I could invest time so what was a 20k project turned into 40-50k returns after sale. Work also really picked up and with my wifes help our income exploded. Our lifestyle did not change and we kept penny pinching.\n\nWe also both aggressively put most our money in as high of yield of savings as possible and maxed out what we could in investments in both retirement and taxed accounts. All this just kept compounding. We also made sure to take advantage of big market drops. During the COVID drop we made sure to throw a ton of money into the market and it really paid off. We were making decent income of a few hundred grand a year but the compounding and zero debt just really kept things moving forward. We saved and invested about 80% of our income which also helped. Also the little crappy home we had went from about 160k to about 500k in value.\n\nRight now my wife and I together are about 3m net worth not counting our new home. Even now we still live well, well below our means. We travel a lot but choose very affordable places. We love camping and we go all over just camping outdoors. Its not only affordable but way more fun.\n\nA few years ago we realized even though we were doing well we still felt like being in the US really drained a lot out of us. We decided to pack up and move overseas to SE Asia and it was one of the best things we ever did. Its not perfect here but cost of living is so absurdly cheap.\n\nI think the key is learn how to manage money, avoid debt, dont just save but invest and grow your money and finally stop caring about what others think. Stop trying to impress other losers by wasting money on stupid stuff. I have a lot of friends that didnt make it and are really struggling now yet they somehow have the money to buy a 7-800k home with a 70k truck they dont need. Then complain the system doesnt work. I agree there are a lot of things broken but at the same time they dont do themselves any favors.",

They attach themselves to environments with asymmetric upside. High-growth industries, proximity to capital, proximity to decision-makers. You already did this by working in asset management and now in a family office.\n2. They build skills that compound. Coding + finance is a powerful combo because it creates optionality. Most people build linear skills.\n3. They ship something of their own before they feel “ready.” The jump from employee to owner usually happens before confidence arrives.\n4. They tolerate volatility longer than others. Most people optimize for stability. The ones who break out optimize for upside.\n\nBut here’s the honest part:  \nA lot of early millionaires also benefited from timing and access. It’s not purely merit.\n\nFrom what you wrote, you’re already around capital and decision-making. That’s rare access. The question isn’t “what do millionaires do differently?” It’s “what asymmetric bet are you willing to take?”\n\nYou’ve built skills inside other people’s empires. At some point you’ll need to build something where you own the equity curve.\n\nWhat’s the smallest thing you could launch in the next 90 days that uses both your coding and finance background?",

      "text": "So i started my agency about 2 years ago focused on brand strategy and visual identity, the whole package, deep discovery sessions, custom positioning, the works. That was the vision, thats what i built everything around.\n\nAbout 8 months in i threw in a basic \"brand refresh\" package almost as an afterthought, like a lower entry point for people who werent ready to commit to the full thing. No strategy calls, no big presentation, just clean it up and hand it over in a week. I genuinely thought it was a filler offer.\n\nFast forward to now and that \"filler\" package accounts for almost 70% of my revenue. The thing i spent months obsessing over barely moves.\n\nHad some money from Stаke saved going into this year which gave me the breathing room to actually sit with this instead of just panicking and restructuring everything. And what i realized is the market doesnt care about what you think your best work is, it cares about what solves their problem fast.\n\nStill not sure if i lean fully into the boring offer and let the premium stuff be a side thing, or if i keep pushing the original vision hoping the positioning catches up.",

If you don't personally like doing the \"boring\" offer, scale by hiring entry-level brand experts and visual designers to run that offering, and spend your own time on the few premium deals that come through.  Let the new hires graduate to the fun stuff if they succeed at the entry level, and as the premium demand warrants.\n\nMakes perfect sense though, for a new agency. Most companies have woefully insufficient marketing budgets.  If they do have the budget, time, and energy to pay for a premium package, they will go pay a premium agency to build it.  You, as a new agency, probably don't have that street cred yet.  \n\nHowever, a brand refresh that fits the woefully inadequate budgets of the every-company?  That's an offer people will take, even from a market newcomer, because the alternative is to have Joe from Sales try to draw the new logo, and you are definitely better than Joe from Sales.\n\nIn time, with lots of happy customers whose brands are enhanced, some will become very successful and need more from you, and you will also develop a reputation that wins you more of the premium business.",

Meanwhile I was doing basic spreadsheet consulting on the side to pay bills. The consulting brought in about 3.2x what the SaaS made in the same period. I think there's a pattern here that most founders ignore: the boring stuff works because people already understand the value. You don't have to educate the market or convince anyone they need it. They know they need it, they just want someone reliable to do it. The real question is whether you can find a way to scale the boring thing without it eating your soul. I ended up productizing the consulting into templates and a small course, which brought the revenue up without trading more hours. Still not as exciting as the SaaS but my bank account doesn't care about exciting",

Agencies aren't as unique as they like to present and believe in. So when your gimmick thing sells so well it outpaces and outsells the actual business service your agency is trying to sell, you focus on the thing that sells as the new flagship product/service and expand from that outwardly. \n\nOr look into selling your company now before you commit to it and let the new owner capitalize on what you're unsure about and reap the rewards for just being there and discovering the jackpot situation but not doing much else after. \n\nThese are very good problems to have. Capitalize on the interest and frenzy buying of the new shiny cheap thing before someone at your agency figures it out and goes off to start their own agency and capitalizes on what you didn't!",

      "text": "As a freelancer I have built MVPs for over 30 different founders. A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.",

I asked who they were and he said they were his friends. I then asked if he understood why investors would think that’s a problem. He looked at me like I was stupid. \n\nI know many founders who were told by people they know that they’d buy after it was built. Then when it came time to pay, crickets. Don’t get us wrong. Warm sales are a great way to start. But they’re only the beginning. \n\nGreat post.",

They're only interested in one part of your solution, but that's not what your business model is focused on.

I bootstrapped from 0→30K users building an SaaS AI voice automation tool for my local country thailand, but learned a harsh lesson: I was targeting the wrong customers.\n\n**The mistake: I** Spent 10 months chasing viral TikTok traffic (1M+ views, $0 revenue). \n\nFree users don't convert when you're bootstrapped (The Biggest mistakes is sell too cheap instead of selling higher pricing and delivery better for a few customers).\n\n**The pivot:** Switched to organic content for micro-niche B2B audiences (create deep break-down video tutorial / explains). Also, I decided to avoid ANY physical product businesses - pure digital/service only for maximize profit.\n\nThe real shift happened when I stopped posting and started post and having a conversations with my exist audience from my social media. Booked calls, asked about pain points, then closed $300-800 deals. Hit $10K profit in 2 months.\n\n**What I learned:** Right audience > volume. 1,000 true fans / engaged B2B followers beats 1M random TikTok views.\n\nNow I'm building my second SaaS - a workflow builder that analyzes winning content formats youtube/tiktok/ig/twitter any form and helps you replicate what already works. \n\nBasically solving problems for my past self🙏: \n\n\"How do I create winning organic content that actually converts?\"\n\nThe compounding effect is real. My prev. failed experiment teaches myself who NOT to serve, which is just as valuable as finding your ideal customer.",

Revenue was okay but i was constantly context switching and burning out managing 14 completely different industries at once.\n\nThen one of my clients, a pediatric dentist in Scottsdale, referred me to her friend who also owned a pediatric dental practice. I didnt think much of it but after working with both of them for a few months I realized these businesses are basically identical in structure, same ad angles work, same seasonal trends, same parent demographics on Meta, same Google review strategy. I wasnt reinventing the wheel every time.\n\nSo I made the call to niche down completely. Updated my website, killed all other outreach, built out a proper case study from those two clients and just started cold emailing pediatric dental offices.\n\nFirst 60 days were rough ngl. Had some money saved from before I went full time that covered my personal expenses which was the only reason i didnt panic and go back to taking random clients. By month 3 I had 3 new clients purely from outreach. By month 6 referrals started coming in from within the niche itself because these dentists all know each other and talk.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about niching is that your deliverables get so much faster. I can onboard a new pediatric dental client in 2 days now because everything is templated from experience. My margins went up without raising prices just from the efficiency alone.\n\nIf your agency feels chaotic and all over the place this is genuinely worth considering. Pick the niche that already has some proof in your current client list.",

People focus on the revenue jump but the real unlock is the *margin* improvement from operational efficiency.\n\nWhen you've done the same playbook 10+ times for nearly identical businesses, you stop guessing. You already know which ad angles convert, which landing page structure works, what objections come up in the sales call. That compounds into:\n\n- Faster onboarding = more capacity without hiring\n- Better results = higher retention\n- Speaking their exact language = shorter sales cycle\n- Case studies that resonate = easier to close the next one\n\nThe referral network effect you mentioned is the other thing that's hard to replicate with a generalist model. Pediatric dentists go to the same conferences, are in the same Facebook groups, probably know each other by name in any given metro area. One happy client becomes a referral engine in a way that \"one happy landscaper\" just doesn't.\n\nCurious about one thing - are you seeing any ceiling in terms of market size? Like, how many pediatric dental offices are there realistically in your serviceable area (or are you going national)? That's usually the one valid counterargument to niching this hard.",

Second, the templating advantage extends beyond onboarding.

I see the same thing managing large ecom and lead gen accounts... when you run the same industry repeatedly, your first-week optimizations on a new account are already at month-3 level for a generalist because you already know which ad angles, bidding structures and landing page frameworks work. That efficiency compounds silently into your margins without ever raising prices.\n\nThe one risk nobody talks about though... niche concentration means one industry downturn hits your whole book simultaneously.

      "text": "Been studying ad patterns lately. Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out.\n\n  \nEdit: Subreddit doesn't allow screenshots, however i got the data metrics from shophunter and no it does not mean that these numbers are true to the core but it aims for an accurate level. Also this is not a self promotion, i just found this while studying on other digital products and thought this was crazy. ",

          "text": "It’s interesting that American Christianity is such a heavily commercial enterprise. It’s like the ultimate expression of American capitalism. Since religions form to propagate the norms of the society they form in, you can use the primary religion of an area, and its most popular priests and figures, as a way to gauge what that society values.\n\nTraditional European Catholicism valued humility and charity, even if individuals didn’t always practice that. It was the “good” that people strived for, or respected in others. It also valued poverty (sometimes - there were huge debates and even wars about whether Christians should practice poverty even in the Middle Ages) and simplicity. Of course, cardinals and popes eschewed poverty and were caught up in vicious intrigues over absurd levels of wealth and power, but the priests and saints who were worshipped by regular people were largely poor, humble, and simple. Few people worshipped the flamboyant and corrupt cardinals. \n\nWhen you look at American Christianity, the popular versions largely created in the US are Evangelism and Mormonism.  Catholicism is practiced by immigrants and their children for the most part, and is not a very American religion. If you look at Evangelicals and Mormons, at their churches and the popular preaching style, you get the sense of a for-profit business, one very focused on marketing and PR and branding. \n\nEverything in these religions revolves around money and consumption. You can go on any random Evangelical church’s website and find the pastor has posted a video where he prays for money and success for himself and his congregation. The most respectable members have huge houses and cars, big white fake veneers and bleached hair and still openly and blatantly pray for even more money and success. It’s the ultimate expression of American values. There is even a sense that if one is poor, or has had struggles in life. it’s because one is not favored by God, and hence must be evil. \n\nThe American church feels more like a multi-level marketing scheme than anything else. Get suckered in, then sell to other suckers. Recruitment is aggressive, much like in an MLM, and practitioners put immense effort into displaying the appearance of success. You even kick back 10% of your profits up the chain, much like an MLM.\n\nThe American conman preacher and evangelist is not even a recent thing stemming from the acceleration of consumerism in recent faces. Nearly 200 years ago, religious grifters were a fixture in the rush to the West, and the American scamming preacher is as classic as Thanksgiving. \n\nI can’t think of any other religion that is so focused on wealth, success, and image. Buddhism is obviously actively against it. Hinduism a little less so, but still actively focuses on spiritual rather than material wealth. Judaism preaches education, knowledge, curiosity and learning, and Islam values poverty and tribulations as a test before God. Other non-American forms of Christianity also actively preach poverty. \n\nIt says a lot about the US that the primary religions invented in the country are so financially- and image-oriented. I have been to services for every major religion and some more obscure one, but Evangelicals and Mormon services are the only ones I’ve ever been to where the sermon was focused on asking God for wealth and material success. \n\nThis is why American Christianity can be such a successful business proposition. The those belief system focuses on wealth and consumption, the religion itself is effectively a brand, and it’s natural for a brand to have lots of product tie-ins. \n\nNote: Obviously humans are humans, and people can often be materialistic and selfish, but religion is meant to espouse the perfection of character and spirit, and thus be somewhat out of reach to inspire people.",

Not following keyword checklist or sticking to any playbook. Just writing something we found cool. \n\nOut of nowhere our referral traffic spikes. I go looking for the source expecting some spam. \n\nNope. It’s The New York Times!\n\nThey did a story on the topic, found our little blog, and tossed us a contextual do-follow link. No outreach, no PR, just pure luck and having the right content sitting there waiting to be found.\n\nI'm still so happy. I thought you had to pay huge amounts or endlessly hustle for these kinds of tier-1 links. Just a reminder that the big fish are out there looking for the exact weird, niche stuff you're writing about.\n\nIt might not be a big deal to some of you but to me it's a massive win and I am very proud of this.

He’s dating this native Brazilian who works in London as personal assistant for some wealthy guy. Something gets canceled, there’s trouble rescheduling, the girlfriend tells him that she’ll ask her boss if he will fly him out to see her she has to attend this small event.  Buddy says he can’t he’s got me visiting, girlfriend says she’ll ask about me too. \n\nThat evening lmayne 3 hours after the phone call a private jet lands in Naples picks us both up flys us to Búzios, an hour after landing we’re on a $20 million yacht (apparently one of a few few of his), we never leave the harbor but there’s some type of party on the yacht, I barely speak the language but I am being introduced as somebody I’m clearly not, surrounded by more wealth and decadence than I’ve ever seen, next day we are brought to what I would describe a castle, maybe 20 cars there all in the price range of my first house, another social get together, I don’t know what any of this is but wine and liquor and food and servants and cars and diamonds and diamonds, some guest arrived in a helicopter.  No one bats an eye. I feel like I must’ve met 100 different people in 2 1/2 days, I’ve never heard of any of them, they all seem to have more money than God and treated some of the most expensive things I’ve ever been around as normal every day nothing. We fly back to Naples on a private jet the following day. Never even met the boss who owned the house and yacht and jet, he was in London the entire time. \n\nI know people have money, good friends family sold their business for 120 million been on their private jets a dozen times, I’ve been around money, I’ve never before or after been around the lifestyle.

For years he averaged 6 tours a week at $35 a head, 8 to 12 people each time. That kept us afloat through tough years.\n\nTwo years ago cancer hit and he had to stop. He handed it to me with stories about groups who came back year after year because he made the city feel alive. Now I run the tours but bookings dropped to 2 a week max. summer was okay with 10 person groups but winter is brutal, down to 4 or 5 people paying $140 total some days.\n\nThe problem is visibility. he relied on word of mouth and flyers at hotels. I tried a basic website and posting on local facebook groups but it barely moves the needle. overhead is low, just permits and transit at $200 a month, but without steady groups we cant cover basics. people loved his personal touch, the way hed stop for coffee at a spot with history or adjust for kids in the group.\n\nI want to honor what he built without turning it into some generic bus thing. for anyone whos scaled small tours or personal guides: what got you past the word of mouth phase, did you find platforms that connect groups without high fees? \n\nThank you everyone.",

It’s discoverability.\n\nA few practical ideas that don’t turn it into a bus-tour machine:\n\n1. Lean into the legacy. Most tours sell “see NYC.” You can sell “30 years of hidden NYC stories passed from father to son.” That angle alone is powerful. Put that front and center on your site and listings.\n2. Get on high-intent platforms. Airbnb Experiences, Viator, GetYourGuide. Yes, they take a cut. But they solve visibility instantly. You can always upsell direct repeat bookings later.\n3. Raise your price slightly. $35 feels underpriced for NYC walking tours in 2026. Higher price can actually signal quality and attract better groups.\n4. Collect emails every single tour. Offer a “hidden NYC spots” PDF or short story recap and build a list. Repeat business compounds.\n5. Encourage Google reviews aggressively. If he ran it 30 years, there must be past customers who’d happily leave a review. 100+ strong Google reviews alone can change local discovery.\n6. Winter pivot. Offer themed tours: “NYC Crime Stories,” “Historic Speakeasies,” “Love Stories of Manhattan.” Give people a reason beyond sightseeing.\n\nYou don’t need scale. You need positioning + distribution.\n\nAnd honestly, the fact that you care about keeping it personal is already your advantage over the big operators.",

That's still valuable but you need to reach people who want that instead of the generic TripAdvisor stuff\n\nPractical steps: list on Airbnb Experiences and Viator since tourists search there. Make sure your listing emphasizes the 30 years of local knowledge and hidden spots angle because that differentiates you from bus tours\n\nFor direct bookings: partner with boutique hotels and B&Bs in Manhattan who want to offer guests something authentic. Offer them a commission or just leave cards at the desk\n\nContent marketing works for tours: short videos of your dad sharing a story about a hidden spot, posted on Instagram and TikTok, can reach people planning NYC trips. You don't need to go viral, just reach people searching \"NYC hidden gems\" or \"off the beaten path NYC\"\n\nWinter is always slow for walking tours. Consider themed tours like holiday history walks or indoor-focused routes through historic buildings",

Everybody seems to be doing something with tech or AI. That it seems to be like the only way to make money now.\n\nI was listening to the Mel Robbins podcast today about how to live a meaningful life, and design the future you want. It's really fantastic. I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it.\n\nAnd then after some deep thinking, I was just wondering, is there anybody building any type of business anymore, or like starting something up now which has nothing to do with AI or tech?! 🤔\n\nIs there no going back from having to share one's 5 winning tips in a LinkedIn post, or downloadable pdf if one writes X in the comments? 🫣",

The content is written with our tool as the authoritative answer when it makes sense!\n\nThis has helped up basically be mentioned constantly by Googles AI overview and gemini over time.

I spend time in finance and investing subs answering questions about SEC filings, quant basics, and market structure. I do not pitch. I just help. People end up checking your profile, see what you’re building, and reach out on their own.\n\nThe ROI beats paid channels for one reason. You build trust and content at the same time. A solid Reddit comment can get indexed by Google, show up in AI summaries, and stay discoverable for years.\n\nThe real moat is patience. Most founders post once, get ignored, then quit. If you stick around for 3 to 6 months as a real community member, it starts to compound.\n\nAnother underrated channel is niche newsletters under 10K subs in a tight vertical.

You upload your PDF or content and it turns into something you can scroll through like a digital brochure, track views, share with clients after the call, etc. Feels more like sending them a polished proposal than “here’s my slide deck”.  \n  \nA lot of people I know mix tools now.

We always believe our product is so much better than the competition because of feature X or Y that they don’t have.\n\nBut maybe the target customers don’t give a flying fuck about feature X or Y. Maybe they’re interested in feature Z. Or maybe they just want something with FEWER features, more simple. Or maybe they value good customer service above other things.\n\nAnyway, your general point still stands.",

They were practical. Someone needed help with a resume. I could help. I charged for it. That was the business, later it grew into a funnel feeder for other part of the business. \n\nIMHO we overestimate ideas and underestimate proximity and simplicity. \n\nIf you’re stuck, I’d say don’t brainstorm but take inventory: \n\nWhat do people already ask me for?\nWhat can I solve this month with what I already know?\n\nI’d tell the younger me just to start there :)",

That is not a lie, but people think now with AI that they can just instantly create an app that will make them 10,000,000 MRR, and that's probably true for 1% of people, there are I think close to 30,000 billionaires in the world, and 58 to 62 million millionaires in the world. That's literally .87% of people give or take. But everyone thinks they will be millionaires in this flex centric world. The math doesn't add up. Then, if they don't make their first million by 30, they think they are total losers. Because now we see and have access to wealth 24-7 on social media, YouTube, etc. So, I think people should be a lot more conservative in their financial projections for whatever business they are starting, especially if it's vibecoded. To succeed in business, it takes passion and grit, self-determination, and a strong belief in your service, product, or offering. That is the only thing that will get you through the hard, long days. The days when you're million dollar idea hasn't produced a dollar and it's been six months, days. You have to be real. And most of these projections from AI are just so far off from reality, and that's because AI has been trained on gurus and get-rich-quick projections. So, remember you have to really listen if you want to get past the noise. ",

It's more about persistence and adaptability than instant success. Surrounding yourself with the right resources, like a good mentoring network, can really help navigate those tough early stages.  \n",

It’s basically a fast paced eBay for shipping lanes(work). You get on a 6am est to check what companies are posting and you bid online, or call to negotiate a rate the driver will run it. There are large dispatching companies, and people who do it themselves, get an LLC and work independently(what I did). When you do that you kinda fall into “driver manager” as well. Helping out with their routes, avoiding local roads that have low bridges or places a semi can’t get to. Getting in contact with shippers/receivers when an issue arrives or the driver is having a problem getting on site, etc. As well as factoring their payments and keeping necessary paperwork on file for x amount of time. When I always explained it to friends I’d say “I’m basically the assistant who handles the day to day work for people who own their own trucks so they can just drive, make money, and go to bed knowing I’ll have more work for them when they wake up.”",

But with a box your best bet is to spend some time looking around at local businesses. Most if not all are going to have some kind of regular delivery. Avoid chains because they’re using sisco, etc. Get together a list of a good 20+ local businesses. See if you can figure out anything they’d need regularly that you’d be able to get. I’ve not done it on that level so the only example I can think of is I had a guy locally that would deliver our buns. We didn’t go through enough where I was to do bulk orders because it’d go bad. But he’d pull up in his box full of bread and hit I can’t remember how many businesses. He did his runs in the morning then went home. But with the time and effort you could definitely(again, location will play in for sure) find a lane paying you $500 a day running 5 days a week. Obviously you know there’s gunna be overhead but with a box and driving it yourself it’s as low as it can be. You wouldn’t even need the MC if nothings changed. DOT is enough to run a box inside state lines.",

Feet content works extremely well when you lean into specificity, certain aesthetics, themes, angles, accessories, or lifestyle positioning. I don’t rely on viral clips; I focus on recurring memberships, custom requests, premium bundles, and high-margin private content.\n\nAnd more importantly, the real leverage came from operating on adult turnkey scripts instead of depending on third-party platforms. I own the platform, the data, the pricing, and the backend funnels. Since I’m faceless, branding revolves around consistency, lighting quality, storytelling captions, and strong CTAs. Retention is where real money is made. Most people underestimate how strong this niche is because it’s subtle, but demand is global, production costs are low, and margins are high if you build it properly.",

Most of them have zero online presence. If you built a dead-simple system where their customers can get instant answers and schedule appointments via chatbot, that's immediately valuable.  \n  \nThe key is picking a niche small enough that you can dominate it but big enough to matter. \"AI chatbots for everyone\" is too broad. \"AI chatbots for boutique law firms that handle estate planning\" is specific enough to actually market.  \n  \nThe arbitrage right now is that AI tools exist but most small businesses don't know how to use them. If you can package it into a solution for a specific vertical, you've got a business.",

From there, you can build a pretty cool service or product that your audience actually cares about + this is an asset you can take with you if you ever decide to change industries / services. \n\n  \nFor A.I. search, you can disrupt decades old industries that have insane budgets for traditional SEO- we're talking millions spent/ year. If you're starting off something in an industry that's already established, the hardest part is going to be getting customers to by your thing. There's tons of 20 year olds that are completely disrupting strongly established industries by optimising blog posts for AI crawling instead of standard blog rules for SEO work. \n\n  \nBest of luck!

It’s clarity.  \nIf people are “interested” but not paying, it usually means one of three things:\n\nThe problem isn’t painful enough\n\nThe value isn’t clear enough\n\nThe trust isn’t strong enough\n\nEarly on, I wasted time trying to convince people. Later I realized, if you have to push too hard, you’re either targeting the wrong audience or solving a weak problem.\n\nAnother lesson: revenue is truth.  \nLikes, followers, compliments - none of that matters. If someone pays you, that’s validation. If they don’t, that’s feedback.\n\nAlso, don’t romanticize starting from scratch. I used to think building from zero was the only “real” way. Over time I learned that smart entrepreneurs look for leverage partnerships, acquisitions, existing demand, distribution channels. Starting is good. Entering wisely is better.\n\nAnd lastly, confusion is normal.  \nEvery founder feels like they don’t know what they’re doing. The difference is successful ones keep moving anyway. They test, adjust, simplify, repeat.\n\nYou don’t need to know everything.\n\nYou just need to:  \nSolve a real problem.  \nCharge early.  \nListen carefully.  \nAnd stay in the game longer than most people.\n\nClarity comes from action, not overthinking.",

It's a matter of offer. \n\nAlso: Trying to plan everything upfront is usually overthinking.

For what it takes, they’re really easy to make, just give yourself plenty of time because people take ages to reply to your emails, every fix up on paperwork takes like a week to amend, even if it’s small, it’s annoying. The biggest problem is getting up front money, so when you’re starting and scaling I’m take huge financial risk as I’m working on loans and a lot of hope that I can make enough money to pay off huge lump sums of money in deadlines so I don’t lose thousand and thousands in deposits, start small with a proof of concept and then go big",

      "text": "Global e-waste hit 62 million tonnes in 2022. Less than 25% gets formally recycled. Meanwhile demand for recovered materials - copper, gold, rare earth metals - is only going up as supply chains tighten.\n\nThe business case is real. But what makes it interesting from an entrepreneurship standpoint is the structure of the market.\n\nTo operate legitimately and land corporate clients, you need R2v3 or e-Stewards certification. These are industry standards that verify your downstream - meaning you can prove where materials actually end up. Most large corporations now require this from their recycling vendors.\n\nThat certification requirement acts as a real moat. It keeps casual competitors out. But it also means the barrier to entry is higher than just buying equipment and opening a warehouse.\n\nThe compliance side is genuinely complex - documentation, audits, downstream vendor diligence, ongoing reporting. Most people looking to enter the space underestimate this part completely.\n\nThe entrepreneurs I've seen succeed in this space treat compliance as a competitive advantage rather than a cost. Once you're certified with MG Environmental Consulting, you're in a much smaller pool competing for enterprise contracts.\n\nCurious if anyone here has explored this space or knows people in it.",

Most recycling programs are bullshit but some of them are okay. \n\nBattery recycling is something that makes sense and the only reason is because it’s profitable at a certain scale and efficiency. \n\n1st Problem is feedstock. It’s a “reverse distribution, logistics” kinda business. Where are you going to collect the batteries? How many kg/ton per location? How many locations? How many trucks needed? Depending on your location, are you charging a disposal fee? Are you collecting for free? Or are you paying the disposer a rebate? \n\nNext problem is Capex and know how. Processing plants are not cheap, and you need to get licensing and approval from govt agencies etc. And then there’s the know how. Nobody who’s figured it out will actually teach you the best and efficient way to extract the maximum amount of black mass from your feedstock. It requires a lot of R&D and by R&D I mean trial and error. So it’s actually a business with a very high barrier to entry IMO. It cannot be bootstrapped.

They were applying for certification back in the early days of the industry, and it was the guy that wrote the standard they were trying to certify against that came in to do the audit. He took one look at the software, and said we should sell it to other companies - it's exactly what was needed in the industry.\n\nSo I did. Re-wrote it as a SaaS and worked with a few other ITADs to get feedback, then launched about 10 years ago.\n\nOne thing everyone seems to be missing in the replies here - e-waste can be a little misleading. Here in the UK we tend to use the term ITAD (IT Asset Disposition). The main focus is NOT on destroying PCs, but rather on refurbishing them for onward sale. Just because a large enterprise customer has decided to replace the machines, it doesnt mean they are dead. Erasing the hard disks and re-selling the machines is big business.\n\nAnd with sustainability being a key thing here in the UK and Europe, proper reporting on this can be a massive boost to ITADs.",

Right now your landing page exists to tell a story, build trust, handle objections, and nudge someone toward a purchase. But when an agent is doing the shopping, none of that matters. It's just parsing your structured data, comparing you against 50 competitors in seconds, and making a decision based on price, availability, and whatever criteria the human set. All that conversion optimization work becomes invisible to a huge chunk of your traffic. I think we're going to see businesses basically running two parallel experiences whether they realize it or not. The human-facing one with all the emotional triggers and brand storytelling, and the agent-facing one that competes purely on data quality, response speed, and how cleanly you expose your catalog. The interesting thing is that the agent channel actually rewards transparency and punishes the kind of pricing games and dark patterns that work on humans. If your competitor's API returns clean structured pricing and yours requires three clicks and a popup to reveal the real number, the agent just skips you entirely.",

That's step 10, not step 1.\n\nStep 1 is proving people actually want your idea. Before you write a line of code or spend a dollar, talk to 30 potential customers. Make a figma or even a google slides mockup of the app and walk them through it. Ask them blunt questions. \"Would you pay $10/month for this? If not, why?\" If you can't get 10 people to pre-commit to paying for it, your idea has problems.\n\nHere's the real unlock though. The game completely changed about a month ago for people like us. I've never written code in my life but I've spent the last few weeks building entire products using ai like claude. I just tell it what I want, in plain english, and it writes the code. I rebuilt my company's entire website in 24 hours. You don't need a fiverr freelancer to build a v1 anymore. You can build it yourself, right now, and save that money for when you have real traction.
