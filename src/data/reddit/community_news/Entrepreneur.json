      "text": "As an entrepreneur when I hear other people, W2 workers and other entrepreneurs, constantly say the rich did it for a tax write off. I automatically think this person is just dumb. Who in the world wants to spend a dollar to save 35 cents. It makes sense if you were going to do it because it’s a necessary thing for your business to grow but it’s just an expense, of course it’s not going to count towards your taxable basis. Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense. Any expense necessary for a business to improve of course should be deducted as an expense",

If it's bought through your business, you have to declare the benefit to you as an income inclusion. In practice, no one will care if you get a free ticket to a cheap game once in a while and don't declare it. But doing it year over year with season tickets is courting trouble. Also, if he's in the US, the IRS is very understaffed so it's possible (even likely) it never gets found out, but it doesn't make it legit or a grey zone.",

That’s not how it works, but TikTok finance and half understood advice made it feel that way.\n\nA write off just means the expense reduces your taxable profit. If you spend 1000 on something and your tax rate is 30 percent, you didn’t save 1000. You saved 300 and you’re still down 700 in real cash. You only win if that expense actually helps the business make more money later.\n\nWhere people get confused is seeing rich people do it at scale. If you’re already making a lot, then necessary expenses plus depreciation plus timing can make a big difference. But that’s optimisation after you already have profits, not some hack to buy random stuff you don’t need.\n\nSo when someone says just write it off about a laptop, a car, travel, whatever, they’re skipping the most important part. Would you still buy this if there was no tax benefit at all. If the answer is no, it’s probably a bad expense.\n\nTax write offs are boring accounting, not a cheat code.

Be creative and build things you need or want, but in the end the more money you keep should be key point.  It always takes money to make money.",

Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

We had some old windows the glass had been take out of and never really did much with them, so she cleaned them up and spray painted one side black and let it dry. Then she would find the perfect web and spray it gently with white, and before it could dry she would \"walk\" through the web with the black sheet of glass so the wet paint would firmly apply the web to the glass. She let it dry and then put the top piece of glass on and it was done except for the frame. She did one huge web on a large piece that came out almost perfect and sold it for $3,000.",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm in such a weird situation. I'm 38M. I grew up in Toronto Canada. I had founded a few small businesses before and exited all of them. It was after COVID, I had money in the bank. I went out to live my dream - I travelled/surfed full-time. Did not give a fuck about anything.\n\nIt was the dream life. Now, 5 years later, I get hit with a huuuuge tax bill ($100k+) from a previous transaction (real estate). It's gonna wipe out a lot of my net worth, so I can't survive on SP500/BTC anymore as I did before. \n\nI now live in Mauritius (world-class surf/kitesurf spot) but I can't legally work here. Also, it's a shit market to work in. The population is 1.3M and people are poor. It's paradise leisurely but a nightmare economically. BYOM (Bring your own money). \n\nI'm only legally allowed to work in Canada or online. \n\nI need to pull income again and refill my net worth. \n\nNo idea where to start....\n\nDo I become a plumber? I basically need to restart my career...\n\nI can start my own business again but honestly don't know what field. I haven't been in Canada for 5 years and now I'm visiting. I feel lost. I have no network....I'm a surfer dude who just came back into the Matrix after a 5-year hiatus. ",

A lot of people are giving advice about the taxes and hopefully some of that works out. If you are truly broke, then of course find a job that will sustain you. You started businesses and sold them so you have some skills. If nothing else anyone can work in customer service/account management and make enough money to live on. If you are trying to make a little more money, sales is a great way to go. Sales of anything, companies are always looking for sales people and your experience starting businesses, traveling the world by yourself and fun adventures is going to make you a magnet to sale anything. Plus most businesses don't care too much about experience and qualifications when it comes to sales. If you have some money set aside, you could do more independent sales like real estate, insurance, etc.\n\nHowever, if you and when you can think out of the box, you have what few people have. Experience starting a business and selling it for enough money to temporarily retire. Adventures traveling the world in wonderful exotic places. Surfing skills. You can do so much with that. I don't have the exact answer and you might not either until you just do something with it. Consult with people who want to find the best places to surf. Start travel trips for landlocked urbanites who want to go to warm places and learn to surf while they are there. Teach surfing online. Teach surfing in person. Create a product online (book, course, instagram, youtube, blog) that gives info on travel requirements (visas, passports, money exchange, etc.) best places to stay, best surfing spots, how to find quiet spots not covered with tourists, best places to get surfboards, etc. Create you own travel related company by contacting places you frequented while surfing and set up referral fees for travelers who you refer to their place of business. Write a book about your experiences from building businesses, travel, learning to surf, all the way to getting hit with tax bill. The options are endless and just doing one thing will lead to another, but there are a million guys out there working as laborers or in offices but very few who did what you did, so make the most of that.",

It serves as a monthly income generator, with payment amounts fluctuating significantly based on market conditions, proving reliable in choppy tech environments but capping upside gains. ",

              "text": "Mauritius is world-class. Top 1 in the world. I've seen YT .videos from Cabo Verde that is also good, but never been there. Check out this video - it shows One Eye on a small day (tiny day). Waves here get big, but they are relatively glassy. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VszdTnC\\_s0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VszdTnC_s0)\n\nThe wind is consistent, and the weather is warm. For waves, you don't need strong wind. I only use 1 size kite - 8M. I have different kites, but they are all 8M.\n\nIn Mauritius, the kite spot is called Le Morne. At this spot, there are 3 waves, all launching from the same beach/parking lot.\n\nFor beginners - Little Reef. This wave is basically 1.5M tall at most. There is no consequences for any crash. It's close to the beach. It's long and frequent. You don't have to time the wave. It's a closeout wave, which means it doesn't barrel or break down the line. It's more like a hack-and-slash wave. All beginners start here.\n\nFor Intermediates - Manawa. This wave is usually 2-3M tall. It's very slow and a big roller. It doesn't really break/tube. It is like a rolling hill, it won't ever crash onto you. The water is also deep, that's why it doesn't barrel. It's far away from the beach. People who ride this wave should go with a friend or carry their phone. There are rescue boats on call in case you are in trouble.\n\nFor Advanced - One Eye. As seen in the video above. It's shallow, about 0.5M deep at most. It breaks directly onto sharp reef. That's why it's the perfect wave. It breaks perfectly clean on a good day. If you drop your kite, expect to get pounded. If you don't relaunch your kite quickly enough, expect to get dragged underwater and/or have your kite sliced up. There is a rescue boat that can see you from the beach, so you don't have to call them. They'll come get you.\n\nMauritius is #1 wavekiting spot in the world. It's just fricking far and not cheap (due to government controls on Airbnb, etc.)\n\nMauritius has proper waves for kiting. You use the kite as your transportation tool to position yourself. Then you just drop in on the wave and use the power of the wave. This is a very rare situation. Most \"waves\" in the world, you have to use the kite for power because it's mushy waves. You can't surf the wave properly; you're basically hacking and slashing with a strapless board. Whereas with One Eye, you're able to drop down the face and slack the kite, giving you this crazy free surf feel.\n\n  \nIf you are a beginner, Mauritius will spoil you. Everywhere else is a joke for wavekiting. Come to Mauritius for 2 months. You will be super spoiled.",

It's totally possible.\n\n\n\nMauritius is a very attractive paradise for a whole generation who want to escape the big city lifestyle. Many go to live or visit in Southeast Asia and Mauritius is not viral yet.\n\n\n\nYou will already know every last stone there, what activities you can do, the best surfing areas, the best spots to take pictures, the best local places to rent equipment, the best local places to eat, where to sleep, etc..\n\n\n\nYou can reach agreements with local businesses and promote trips with closed packages and paid guides to see the islands and enjoy them from the local experience (what people want nowadays).\n\n\n\nYou could start creating good content generating a small audience and before summer (in April/May) you could be generating income online.\n\n\n\nI've explained it all quickly. You would have to learn about social media and so on, but I have raised communities to 30,000 followers on instagram and tiktok a few times (not promotion), so it is possible if you know how to show what the specific audience wants and they will end up buying from you because you will play the role of a trusted person at the destination. Another option is to do the same, but focused on luxury, which would totally change the type of content you should share.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople still underestimate the power of generating a community interested in something specific and you can see what content works just by watching.\n\n\n\nIt can be worth the effort by leveraging your experience and good life over the past 5 years.",

It's really just about getting back on my feet after a \"breakup\" with the beach life.\n\n***The geography part*** is a mind fuck. Mauritius is a very uphill battle when it comes to doing business. When I first arrived, it was natural for me to seek business opportunities. I tried a couple of things. I actually became a paid photographer and had repeat clients. They are happy with my work and even refer me. It's shocking at times but my customer service is excellent. I learned it from dealing with high end customers in Canada through my previous business. Plus I have a finance degree from good university in Canada. \n\nI'm not a street dude.\n\nBut now I need to scale myself up - things got extremely fucked up (excuse my language).\n\nIt's a mind fuck because I'm **not allowed** to work here from a visa perspective, despite me wanting to do real estate marketing (recording those high-end property tour videos and writing scripts for the agent) or general marketing for any business looking to grow. \n\nThe island is so small, we all know each other. Locals will rat me out to the police almost immediately. Mauritians are very protective. It is a tribal culture here. \n\nResources are extremely limited on the island since history, and Mauritius has been colonized by 3 European countries one after another. The locals are independent now and want to stay that way. That's why getting a work permit here is a bitch - they are not an immigrant-friendly country, despite having expats (ie. need specialized skill or high investment).\n\nTo be frank, I'm chill. I'm flexible. I can do a lot of things, move around, or just chill in my underwear.\n\nBut I also have a **GF in Mauritius who is planning to marry me (read: have kids)** before I got this huge tax bill (with potentially more coming). We were planning to build a little farm and all types of shit. That is no longer feasible. \n\n***That is the salt to injury.***\n\nBy myself, I'm chill. I got my motorbike and surfboard. Shoes are optional.\n\n***I told her - I want to work.*** But the country won't let me. For good reason, though. If foreigners are easily allowed into the country to work, the locals will become extinct. The skills difference is night and day. That's why the locals vote for the government to close borders. Or else it's colonization all over again - 2026.\n\n*TL:DR* \\- I have skills and already have multiple business plans for Mauritius. Government does not approve work permits easily - very difficult in fact. There's no work around. Locals will report me to immigration police the minute they see me operating under the table. Plus I have a GF waiting for me to give her a baby.",

A friend of his who was taking care of anonymously forwarding his mail told me that his strategy was to evade CRA for a certain amount of years. \n\nI was told that CRA only has a certain amount of time to serve him. \n\nI don’t know if this is true or whatever happened to this guy. He owed my brother money and I stopped talking to him after he refused to pay him. \n\nCan someone with some tax expertise shine light on this Canadian matter?",

They don't cruise the streets.\n\nThe CRA has the same authority as the police, though. Once you have committed a \"financial crime,\" aka not paying your taxes, the CRA can get a court order easily to start seizing your assets. Your bank account will be frozen and the bank willl funnel any incoming money directly to the CRA, by court order. TD, CIBC, whatever, have a court order to seize your bank account.\n\nThe guy who fled the country, yes I know people in this situation too. But that's not an option for me. My mom lives here, I come visit twice a year.\n\nI don't know how serious not paying the CRA can get, but there is no way I'm forfeiting my Canadian passport. If I do, I will not have any passport. I'm not trying to be Mel Gibson in Castaway.\n\nYour guy who fled the country, he most likely was just a permanent resident or temp worker without being Canadian.\n\nHis strategy was to max out all his debt such as credit card, line of credit, and take it back to his home country in cash. To start a **chai cart** or something?",

The idea is that you share an IP/Brand/Idea/Product like you might with creative commons, but you don't do it under a creative commons license. You just grant permissions as per your terms and conditions to let people build on it and if you need to pull it back, you do. It's like at-will franchising...part fan club and part franchise. I have two I'm offering right now but they are largely untested and I can't devote the time to them I need to and also launch the platform that supports the FanChising concept at the same time. It's rough and I might have to reevaluate my launch startegy. One is called ReCardable - in which we're trying to normalize regifting greeting cards and one is called Phutzball, in which I'm offering a design and branding for a cottage manufactured ping pong ball trick shot game. I won't explain them in detail but you can check them out at goat-pen.com. \n\nIt's a shame that all the remote job platforms are basically crap and extraction platforms. Freelancing is tough because of international competition now. I'm in the SF Bay area. I get the sense that the labor market is really cooling off and it just hasn't shown up in the data yet.

But now he’s got a bunch of crews, basically does all the admin stuff and doesn’t have to do manual labor. He still grinds working 12hr days from April-October, then goes surfing for 5 or 6 months. Pretty chill guy if you ask me. Understands what he’s working for, which is freedom and surf. I don’t think you’re too old to start something new, you already know exactly what you’re working for, just find your fire again. \n\nLong winded way of saying, are you my uncle?",

If the business idea is not profitable with X months then unemotionally shut it down and either get a job for a while to recoup capital or move to the next idea.

          "text": "Some things to keep in mind, since the topic of time has been touched on. (Years) and consider what starting actually means. I intend to touch on the corners that I didn’t see explored much on these posts. \n\nI started out learning about running a business and started my own experimentally before i considered myself an entrepreneur. \n\nI started learning skills long before i considered myself an entrepreneur. I filed for my first llc etc; long before i needed to, and did a lot of derping around as do many of us. \n\nThe things I would say I learned that would have sped up the process was, consistency, in particular if your plan requires building and nurturing an audience. Also take advantage of Ai. Sure you can be successful without it, probably. But why make it harder on yourself? Be mindful of shiny object syndrome. The strength i already had was willingness and vision to pivot.\n\nI did make some money as a consultant as I’ve built out other things. I had a client who was previously a CFO and I learned a lot through that.\n\nLearn from whoever there is to learn from. Make sure they actually have success and know what they are talking about. Be very mindful of any partnerships or collaborations you make. \n\nTo bring another important perspective I haven’t seen much of on this thread, the people in your life have a huge impact on your success. So does self awareness. There’s a higher prevalence of things like narcissist personality disorder and adhd (me lol) in entrepreneurship, so self awareness and solid boundaries and genuine confidence are super important. Yes there are people who don’t have these who are successful, but it definitely makes it easier. You will learn all of these things the hard way if you don’t learn it with intention. \n\nBe mindful of bottle necks, and learn to take calculated risks. Those that are risk averse tend to be less likely to get to this level as well. \n\nYou are in control of your own time and life. You will find how much of the time we tend to spend doing busy work that doesn’t actually move the needle. Failure is feedback. That’s it. \n\nYour self care MATTERS. I have spent countless time living off of redbull and prayer. Learning balance gives you a clear head and the opportunity to make better decisions. \n\nWhatever you struggle with today and master tomorrow is an important opportunity. Especially if you struggled because you couldn’t find the thing you needed and had to create your own solution. Simple is almost always better.",

My list usually is mostly business but some days there's family and personal items in that five.\n\nI write it down in a note book every night. Then, at the end of each day, I write win or loss. If you win enough days, you win the week. If you win enough weeks, you win the month. \n\nIt also gives me a journal of action items that I can go back and look at over the years. If I don't hit a quarterly goal or if a habit doesn't change in my personal life. I can take a look and see what I did each day in that time period.\n\nAnother aspect of building a business, they're people don't talk about is how easy it is to lie to ourselves. We try to make ourselves believe that busy is productive. Are you really moving the needle though? \n\nIt's the easiest form of discipline building i've ever implemented. Now there have been some dark nights of the soul so to speak throughout the last ten years. Where I don't wanna do anything. In those moments on those days I make myself get up and do something very uncomfortable.\n\nA couple weeks ago, we had a cold front come through Texas. Nothing major but colder than what we're used to. I live in a rural area, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres. I think it said thirty five mile an hour winds that day but our wind gauge was hitting fifty plus. It was miserable outside.\n\nI'd made myself get up at 6:30 in the morning, because I usually sleep until I wake up naturally. I got dressed quickly, and I went out to the horses barn/shed. And got his bucket and I hiked back to the shop to fill it with feed and let it soak with warm water. I made myself stand outside in the cold wind for that ten minutes. Then, I hiked back out through multiple gates that I had to unlock and lock. Disengaging and reengaging electric fences. Gave the beast his bucket. When I hiked back through the gates and went inside. All in all, it took about thirty minutes.And I was cold.\n\nI jumped in a hot shower.Got dressed again for the day. Grabbed my backpack with my business stuff in it and I headed to my office. I didn't feel better but I was moving. I started into my list which I had purposely made very easy for the day. Knocked it out within about two hours. \n\nWhen you're done with your five things, you're done for the day. Myself included everyone always says, oh I can do twelve things or thirty things. Just do the fucking five things. \n\nI finished my five things and I went to sit on the couch in my office and just scroll the internet. Then, my phone rang with a new customer. Then, another, and another, and another, and another. Turns out, one of our competitors was bought out, and the new company's prices went up another thirty percent. I have no employees.I handle everything for my company and it's quite large. When a new customer contacts us, though I have to do all the onboarding, enter their order set up the financials and the emails and then pick their order pack their order and ship their order all before three p m.\n\nI was not in the mood or the mind state.To do this shit. I was done for the day. \n\nNow i've switched into a different phase, which is called test days.... Another Andy Frisella process. This is where your discipline kicks in. I knocked out all the orders on time.And then I went back to the office to tally up the financial. $17,356 in new sales in one day. That was a record.My previous record was $13k. Each one of these customers will re order every single month forever. I had just had the best day. I'd had in business in a long time and it was one of the worst days for me mentally.\n\nIf I had not of woken up early and done the horse feeding  before forcing myself to the office to knock out my powerlist, it would have been too late in the day for me to accomplish all three things. \n\nThat leads me to another belief that I personally have, is that I have a path. I'm on my path and as long as I stay on my path, things will work out.\n\nThose test days are The Times that you look back on for brief encouragement when you need it to reinforce your discipline.\n\nKnow this though, when you become successful, even though you're still dealing with this type of shit, weekly, people are gonna tell you that you must have gotten lucky to be as successful as you are.",

Its a buffet, take the lessons youwhat you want and leave the rest.\n\nFounders Podcast does an excellent job condensing biographies of great business people. I love all the old robber barons, because you see the truth of what they accomplished.\n\n\nI always recommend The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick. Its a hacker story, but he was also the godfather of social engineering. I think it's the greatest book for sales in so many people don't understand that. I helps you think around corners.\n\nPhysical books I'm going through all the classics I miss growing up alone as a run away orphan at 12 years old sleeping in national and state parks.

But psychology and structure are what save you when motivation tanks.\n\nWhat helped me:\n\n* I stopped working in isolation. I joined a business model where there’s community, shared systems, and mentorship, not just noise or pressure, but actual direction.\n* I built a rinse and repeat plan. No more waking up wondering what to post, who to talk to, or what needle moving even looks like.\n* I started measuring progress, not just results. Some days, showing up is the win. Especially when you’re still proving the model to yourself.\n\nYou’re not lazy. You’re just carrying too much without support and structure.\n\nAnd no, you’re not wasting time, you’re building resilience most people never touch.\n\nThat matters more than it feels like right now\n\nI just want you to know: you’re not broken. This is just the part no one posts about.\n\nKeep building. Even the messy days count",

It's not supposed to.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is normal. It's the middle of the journey, where the excitement wears off and reality sets in. This is where most people quit. Not because they're not disciplined - because they're exhausted.\n\nThe \"just be disciplined\" advice is bullshit. You can't discipline your way out of building from the wrong place.\n\nHere's what helped me:\n\n**Stop asking \"am I motivated today?\"**\n\nStart asking \"why am I building this?\"\n\nIf the answer is external (prove something, hit metrics, look successful), you'll burn out. Because external goals keep moving. There's always another milestone.\n\nIf the answer is internal (this matters to me, this aligns with who I am, this serves something bigger), you'll find a different kind of fuel. Not motivation - purpose.\n\n**The mental side you mentioned?**\n\nThat doubt, that comparison, that \"am I wasting my time\" spiral - it's all coming from one place: you're building from pressure, not purpose.\n\nPressure to perform. Pressure to succeed. Pressure to prove you're not wasting your time.\n\nWhen you build from pressure, every low day feels like failure. Every slow week feels like proof you're not good enough.\n\nWhen you build from purpose, low days are just... days. Not evidence. Not identity.\n\n**Practically, what I did:**\n\n\\- Stopped checking metrics first thing (they controlled my mood)\n\n\\- Got clear on why THIS project, not just \"be successful\n\n\\- Set boundaries (work hours, offline time, non-negotiables\n\n\\- Found someone who'd been where I am, and five years ahead of me (coach, not just cheerleader)\n\nThe discipline people talk about? It's easier when you're building something that matters to you, not something you \"should\" be building.\n\nYou're not stuck because you lack motivation. You might be stuck because you haven't figured out if this is YOUR thing or someone else's idea of success. It's a lonely journey and sometimes you might lack the accountability, guidance, structure that you might have had before. That's ok to have.\n\nNot quitting is good. But also - ask yourself, am I building the right thing? Or am I just stubborn?\n\nThose are different questions.\n\nI also echo u/FatherOften on the 5 priority list items that no matter what, you action on.\n\nGood luck.

Think of it like an **LLM**: if you don’t provide clear **constraints**, the output is just high-speed hallucinations and chaos. That’s exactly what we do to our brains.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Strategy vs. Busywork:** Being submerged in tasks isn’t 'grinding'; it’s a one-way ticket to Burnout City. If your strategy doesn’t dictate a lean action plan, you’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall and wondering why the wall is messy.\n* **The 'Void' Factor:** For a first-timer, entrepreneurship is a literal leap into the void. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself actual time to **somatize** the shift. A total identity overhaul takes much longer than we’re willing to admit, and you can't rush the biological clock of adaptation.\n* **Neuroplasticity is your gym:** The 'mental side' isn't just something to 'endure.' You’re using neuroplasticity to hardwire the habits of the person you want to become. This takes time, repetition, and a lot of recalibration.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stop adding tasks and start add better constraints. Above all, be supportive to yourself, you deserve it, even if only for the massive step you took by starting this journey on the first place.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

This is where I go to drop off quick screenshots of what I have done each day to remember what I have accomplished. If it feels like I haven't made any progress, that page tells me otherwise. Taking a quick snap after you have completed a task throughout the day is a great way to have that highlight reel to remind you of what you have done when you need motivation in the future or a reminder.\n\n2) Create a \"Don't be scared/fret\" whiteboard. I have been a self-funded, bootstrapped founder for 2 years. In addition to building daily, I consume so much information that I forget that I have learned almost everything that I need to be successful in this season. For example, I have some gems related to marketing and sales on that board to remind me that I know the process of converting. This is important because I have always had a marketing team doing the work at my 9 to 5 jobs, but now I have to do it as a solo founder. When you know how to monetize, it keeps the scaries away. Certainty eliminates fear. Find people doing what you are doing and look at their blueprint. It has helped me to stay motivated when I can see the outcomes they had from us both doing the same things.\n\n3) Even if you have to take a day or two away from the work to get your motivation back, peek at the work on the days off for 5 to 10 minutes. I have found if I have gone 2 days without looking at my progress or work logs, I can forget that I have been making so much progress. Taking a peek at what you crushed that week and seeing that forward movement always helps me to keep motivation high.\n\n4) Ensure you are working on something you love. In this season, I have not experienced any friction when it came to doing the work. If you are feeling low motivation about the work, I would take a step back and consider what you are working on and check in to see if it is what you should continue to focus on first or at all. It's ok to pivot.\n\n5) Listen to your body. I haven't had any friction when it comes to the work in this season, but I have worked 80 hour weeks because I was in flow and momentum took over. Did I love what I did? Hell yeah. Was my body like what the hell did you just do to me? Yes. If you are working a lot, even if it is work you enjoy, even you can experience days when you aren't motivated to get back to work because you just worked more than 40 hours a week. Listen to your body. When I take those days to recharge, without regret and don't punish myself for taking them, I am on fire the next time I start working.",

      "text": "Not sure if other app devs are seeing this, but wanted to share a shift we made recently that’s honestly been bigger for our growth than ASO or traditional SEO.\n\nA few months ago, we started getting feedback emails saying things like, *\"I asked ChatGPT for a cycling app that focuses on privacy\"* or *\"Gemini recommended you guys as a good Strava alternative.\"*\n\nIt happened enough times that we actually updated our onboarding survey. We added an \"AI/LLM Recommendation\" option to the \"How did you find us?\" question.\n\n**Two months later, nearly 30% of our new users were selecting that option.**\n\nWe realized that while we were fighting for keywords on the App Store, our actual users were just asking Claude or ChatGPT for specific recommendations. We’ve started calling it **LMO (Language Model Optimization)** internally. It’s definitely not mainstream yet, but here is exactly what we changed to make the AIs \"like\" us:\n\n**1. We started \"feeding\" the communities** We realized LLMs are basically scraping Reddit (r/cycling, r/bicycling), bike forums, and Quora for \"truth.\" So, instead of just posting on our own dev blog, we started heavily contributing in these communities. We noticed a direct correlation: the more we were mentioned in actual human conversations about \"alternatives to X\" or \"battery friendly apps,\" the more ChatGPT started recommending us.\n\n**2. We started writing content for robots, not just humans** We stopped with the flashy \"Ride Beyond Limits\" marketing slogans. LLMs love structure and literal facts. We updated our website and press kit to be super literal:\n\n* *Exactly what sensors we support (HRM, Cadence, Power)*\n* *Exactly how our battery usage compares to the big guys*\n* *Explicit statements on our privacy policy (No data selling)*\n\nWe basically gave the AI the \"context\" it needs to understand exactly where to file us in its database.\n\n**3. We planted \"memory seeds\"** We started posting content specifically designed to be indexed by these models.\n\n* Comparison tables on our blog (Us vs. The Big Competitors) regarding feature sets.\n* Documentation that links our app name with specific long-tail keywords like \"offline GPX export\" or \"commuter tracking.\"\n* Guest posts on cycling tech blogs that we know are in the training data.\n\n**4. We answered the questions people actually ask AI** We reverse-engineered what cyclists type into ChatGPT. Instead of targeting short keywords like \"bike app,\" we put exact match questions on our site:\n\n* *\"What is the best free cycling app without a subscription?\"*\n* *\"Which bike tracker drains the least battery?\"*\n* *\"How to track rides without sharing location data?\"*\n\nWhen you provide the direct answer to a direct question, the AI seems to prioritize your info as the \"correct\" answer.\n\n**The Result:** We stopped sweating over Google updates or App Store algorithms. Now, when you ask the major LLMs specifically about *\"Best privacy-focused bike tracker\"* or *\"Simple cycling apps for commuters,\"* we show up about half the time.\n\nWe’ve even had our team test this via VPNs and incognito windows to make sure it wasn't just personalized result and it holds up.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dump this here in case it helps any other devs trying to figure out where their traffic is coming from. Happy to share the actual content calendar framework we use if people are interested in a Part 2.",

One of the best advice I’ve seen! \n\nI’d suggest some more technical LMO tips:\n\nAI agents are increasingly indexing websites using a new standard called llms.txt\n\nhttps://llmstxt.org\n\nYou provide two text files at root of your site. One listing all links and another to provide the entire content of site as a compressed text file. \n\nHere is an example:\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt\n\nhttps://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt\n\nThis ensures agents can easily index your site. \n\nAnother tip is to try asking questions about your business in chatbots and see which queries they build to run against a web search tool. Then try to win on those keywords via traditional SEO",

      "text": "I’m posting this because I keep seeing people online claiming they’re making money with AI, side hustles, tools, prompts, whatever. I tried. Properly. And it went nowhere.\n\nThis wasn’t “get rich quick”. I was aiming for a very modest amount per month. Something realistic. I’ve worked in large organisations for years, so I approached it like a real project, not hype.\n\nHere’s what actually happened.\n\nFirst I tried starting a blog (WordPress). That alone took way more time than expected. Setup, themes, plugins, decisions everywhere. No clear design. And the chatbot had absolutely NO CLUE about how to create and build a wordpress blog, even though it constantly told me how to do it, only to find that that was impossible then kept blaming Wordpress for changing its UI.  SO annoying.\n\nThen I spent several weeks building a Ghost blog site. The idea was AI would surface rumours and I’d investigate or debunk them. This fell apart completely. AI could not provide *any* reliable sources for any rumour it generated (and it generated A LOT!) Since provenance was the whole point, the project was dead. If I couldn't prove there was a rumour, how could I disprove, reject or corrorobate it?\n\nIn parallel I put up 4 Fiverr gigs. Carefully written with AI leading the way on how to correctly create a gig for maximum exposure. Low prices. Clear scope. Weeks later, zero orders. Maybe something comes eventually, but there’s no sign yet that this works at all. OK, probably not directly attributable to AI, BUT - it was AI that led me down this rabbit hole...\n\nI also explored a bunch of other AI-related service ideas. Every single one sounded OK until I asked basic questions like:  \n\\-who is actually paying?\n\n\\-why would they pay someone who is basically cold calling them?\n\n\\-what work already exists?\n\n\\-what cost is being replaced?  \nOnce you force those answers, most ideas collapse pretty fast.\n\nCosts weren’t huge but they were real:  \nChatGPT Plus \\~$50  \nGhost blog \\~$20  \nPlus six weeks of focused time\n\nReturn so far: zero.\n\nWhat bothers me is how misleading the public narrative is. From what I can see, most people “making money with AI” fall into one of four categories:\n\n1. they already had an audience\n2. they’re selling to people who want to make money with AI\n3. they’d earn the money anyway and AI gets the credit\n4. they’re exaggerating or lying\n\nAI is useful. I still use it. But as a way for an individual to create *new* income from scratch? I just don’t see it.\n\nI am posting this because negative experiences don’t get shared much, and I suspect a lot of people are quietly finding the same thing and assuming they’re the problem.\n\nI don’t think I was.\n\nPostscript - and THIS is ironic.  I got the chatbot to write up exactly why you should not use AI in the way I wanted to generate a small income. But Reddit would not accept it because it was written by an AI!!  So even *criticising* AI monetisation using AI tools can get you blocked from the places where the warning would matter most!",

And you give it a sandbox in which it can use to experiment and learn from and iterate over and over until it finds the best solution. Sometimes for days. And you need to have it work with a platform that it can use to build, try, test, and weigh outcomes against each other -  Wordpress is not generally such a platform.\n\nThis is very much how you would treat any employee working on this stuff.

Spending, debt, savings, all of it. I am making it for personal reasons, but when finished I will give it to all of my coworkers for free and then attempt to sell it on Etsy or Gumroad. If I make money, great! If not, at least it helped me and some of my coworkers with a problem. \n\nMy best advice: find a problem you have that AI can help you solve. If it works for you, try to sell it to someone else. Don't expect it to make you rich. Be realistic with your approach and hopefully you'll earn a little extra.",

Retailers also obtain their name brand stuff through authorized resellers or authorized distributors.  \n\nAside: Some years ago, I used to handle reseller accounts for major electronic brands.  I found out that many major brands like Netgear outright forbid their resellers from listing on Amazon because it encouraged shady price-falling practices and pitted their resellers against each other, which is actually bad for business.  So when you see certain electronics on Amazon and the seller is not listed as an \"Authorized Dealer\" by that brand, 9 times out of 10 it's stolen, bought from overstock, or being sold in breach of contract and therefore does not actually have a manufacturer's warranty.",

Customers would make less impulsive purchases. It slows the whole system down for the store as there is a choke point. More product returns. If you look at grocery, it's mostly large chains with few employees and instead it's the distributers stocking the shelves, and that's why you can't get someone to help you and when they do they said \"i don't work here, sorry.\"  Grocery is mostly a real estate business today. An exception is Trader Joes which is a completely different model but you still pick it yourself. Incidentally, trading stores in the US worked the way you describe in 1800s before the modern grocery store was invented. You would go to the counter and tell the man what you wanted to buy. If you are interested in this topic, there's an episode of the Acquired podcast about Trader Joes that is fascinating.",

Staying out of stores and doing the pickup option for convenience became very popular during Covid, but near the end of Covid, people were ready to get out and back into stores. This divided customer base made omnichannel shopping far more important. People appreciated the option to walk around and browse, but there were some people who wanted to strictly purchase what they wanted and needed without the hassle of going into stores and possibly buying things they didn’t intend impulsively. \n\nAll this leads me to believe that AR/VR shopping is going to be a big middle ground once the tech catches up and becomes convenient enough for consumers to wear the displays and shop either with AR rendered 3D models in their own homes or via a full VR shopping experience where the customer could effectively “pilot” a robot shopper to walk the aisles and shop. Then, to save on labor costs, items that are purchased with be picked and packed by other robotics either for pickup or delivery. Amazon has had a patent on a massive drone warehouse for a while now where the orders would be picked and shipped from this warehouse blimp via drone delivery. So I think that’s part of the puzzle as well.",

      "text": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

          "text": "Great list. As a VC, there are 3 critical slides that are either missing or weak in almost every deck I see right now.\n\n1. The \"Why Now\" (Beyond just \"AI\") Every single deck in 2025 says \"Why Now? -> Because GenAI made it possible.\" While true, it is no longer a differentiator. It’s table stakes. I see 50 decks a week claiming this. To stand out, you need a second-order \"Why Now.\" Is there a regulatory shift? A generational behavior change? A collapse of a legacy incumbent's business model? If your only catalyst is \"LLMs exist,\" you are competing with everyone.\n\n2. Distribution > Product Most founders spend 10 slides on the product and 1 generic slide saying \"We will do SEO and Ads.\" In 2026, building product is easy (thanks to AI). Distribution is the hard part. I don't care how pretty the UI is; show me you understand how to acquire a customer for $1 before you extract $3.\n\n3. \"Pain Validation\" with Real Data Don't just tell me the market is big. Prove the pain is acute. Market research reports are nice, but your own data is king. Show me the results of 50 customer interviews. Better yet show me a \"Fake Door\" test where you ran $100 of ads to a landing page describing the problem. Did they click? Did they try to sign up? \"We think people want this\" < \"We have a 3% CTR on cold traffic targeting this specific pain point.\"",

Founders should focus it. Not only for fundraising, it is important to build a business already.\n\nAbout why now, mostly, it is useless lol. If you don't have to say anything different, just remove it and show problem validation, team's expertise, market is shifting etc... It fits naturally already.\n\nAnd about problem, you're 100% right. Problem slide shouldn't be statement. It should be validation with data. How many people face this problem? Or how problem affects our world?",

A lot of founders are still building decks for how fundraising used to work, not how it works now.\n\nTwo things I would add from recent conversations:\n\nFirst, investors are pattern matching faster than ever. That makes clarity even more important. If your insight is not obvious in the first two slides, you do not get the benefit of the doubt anymore. The deck is no longer a conversation starter. It is a filter.\n\nSecond, distribution thinking is starting to leak into decks. I have seen more investors ask “how do you get your first 100 customers” instead of “how big is the market.” Founders who can explain one repeatable acquisition motion get taken more seriously than founders with beautiful TAM math.\n\nStrong callout on AI reviewing decks too. I have seen partners admit they skim AI summaries before opening the PDF. If your story is not legible to a machine, it probably is not legible to a tired human either.\n\nOverall takeaway I agree with: decks do not need to be impressive. They need to be precise.",

I have a background in business storytelling and presentations and have thought about starting a side business helping founders uncover and effectively communicate their story. A couple questions: 1) Does a storytelling approach help founders connect on an emotional level with investors and therefore lead to more success? I.e. if you lean in to problem/conflict/emotion/story, is that what pulls in the potential investor, vs going granular on product features, etc.? Or do investors mainly care about the numbers? 2) I have recommended presenters create two decks - a presentation deck (minimal text, more visual) and a leave behind deck that summarizes the presentation and can be consumed on its own. Do you consider that a best practice? Or with AI reviewing decks first, do you need to have just one deck?",

If you can build a story emotionally, it can be advantage but it can be easily cringe at the same time lol so, storyteller matters here. And, story should connect with data, too. You need a good balance here.\n\n2. I'm giving 3 versions:\n1) Trailer (3-5 slides) or one-pager: For the first cold emails only\n2) Longer email decks with more texts\n3) Meeting decks with less texts more visual\n\nI found this approach better to use same deck everywhere BUT it'll probably change because of AI.

We had a clear contract, milestones, everything seemed professional. Delivered the final version three weeks ago, client approved everything, paid the final invoice. Since then ive gotten probably 8 emails asking for quick changes or one small adjustment that would only take a few minutes. First it was changing some button colors. Then it was adding a new section to the homepage. Then it was reworking the entire navigation menu because they had a better idea. Each time I politely remind them that the project is complete and any additional work would require a new contract or hourly rate. The thing is, these small changes add up. Ive probably spent another 4-5 hours total on these requests because I feel guilty saying no, but now im realizing im just working for free and setting a bad precedent. How do you guys handle this without damaging the relationship? I want to be firm but also don't want them leaving bad reviews or telling people I'm difficult to work with. Im also dealing with some annoying admin stuff right now since im based internationally and trying to get a proper commercial address sorted for my US business setup.

Then in October I had some personal stuff come up and I literally had to set boundaries. Started blocking out actual work hours, stopped responding to non urgent stuff after 6pm, and told clients upfront that I batch my communications twice a day.\n\nI was honestly scared theyd leave. But the opposite happened? My retention jumped to like 89% over the last 3 months. Clients seem happier, they respect the boundaries, and weirdly they value my input MORE now. I think because Im not constantly available Im forced to be more strategic with my responses instead of just reactive. Im working probably 15 hours less per week and somehow I've actually got some money set aside ($2.3k from Stаke) now which never happened before. Sometimes doing less is actually the move.",

Here's one:\n\nDo not quit your job! At least not right up front. You made up your mind to quit and start a company. Fantastic. My advice is not to quit your job to pursue your company full time until the last possible moment. While you are still working (and getting paid!) spend six months or so in the evenings planning. Get a team together, do your research, build a business plan, go another level deeper and get all of the detail of product development and the company administration planned out.\n\nBuild as much of your company as possible while someone else is footing the bill for your survival. I can't tell you how many times I've had this discussion and when I say this the founder hangs their head a little. My response - you quit your job already, didn't you? Founding a successful company is hard enough without putting the (unnecessary) added pressure of having to worry about survival money on the first day. Even if you've saved, why not use a continuing salary from your current job to get going.\n\nMore in future posts. Hope this helps some.",

Instead of money at the beginning you have to focus on learning and as long as everyday your earning knowledge money comes and goes.

I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent.

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

We launched in September 2025.\n\n  \nmy original go-to-market strategy was:\n\n1. launch in UAE then expand to US and then other countries.\n\n2. burn cash on ads to get plumbers/electricians etc to sign up.\n\n3. burn cash on SEO to rank for keywords.\n\n  \nthen the weirdest thing happened. In October and November we started seeing registrations from random places, like small towns in Europe, Asia, USA, UAE, Australia, etc. i assumed it was a spam bot, but the profiles were real service providers. \n\ni dug into referral traffic. it wasn't google search. it was AI.\n\n  \npeople and other agents were asked tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, Claude, ... you name it: \"where can i list my service business for free?\" or \"alternative to Angi/Thumbtack with no fees\"  \nBecause my site was new, lightweight, and the value prop was clear (\"Free\"), the AI models picked it up and started recommending it as the primary answer. \n\n  \n**The result**\n\n* 5 years ago i would have needed a massive budget to get 1000+ worldwide verified listings.\n* Today, AI did the heavy lifting for free.\n\nI decided to pivot. i scrapped the \"US Only\" restriction. if AI wants to send me a carpenter from Berlin or a graphic designer from Tokyo, i'm taking them.\n\n  \n**The challenge now:** The \"Supply\" side (service providers) is scaling automatically thanks to AI. Now i have to solve the \"Demand\" side (customers) to make sure these pros actually get work. \n\nThings are growing slowly, but surely, and i see the progress over there. \n\nI'm curious if anyone else has stumbled into this sort of \"accidental\" traction recently? To be clear, i don't consider this \"success\" in the traditional sense yet - we aren't huge, and we still have a mountain to climb regarding revenue and daily active users. But as a first step, having AI drive our initial user base for $0 feels like a fundamental shift from the old playbooks. If you've had similar small wins or weird AI- driven growth stories in these early stages, i'd love to her them. ",

Providers hate it, users hate the markup, and it encourages people to take deals offline. \n\n  \ninstead, we use a \"local booster\" model (still not in use, will be used when we are sure we have demand). \n\nCrucially, money doesn't buy rank. Our organic ranking is 100% merit-based (quality, reviews, retention). Whether a provider pays or not , everyone is equal in the eyes of the algorithm - the best service always wins the top spots. The 'Boosters' are just for separate visibility slots; they don't corrupt the search results.

Precision (the time saver) most platforms make you search for a generic business and hope they do what you want. We have over 600+ specific categories. You can search firectly for japanese manicure or ac repair instead of just HVAC or Beauty Salon. it saves you from calling 10 places to ask if they offer that specific service.\n\n2. Legitimacy: Our manual verification isn't a magic promise of perfect quality (users decide that via reviews), but it is a promise of reality. We verify that every listing is a real person/entity with a working phone number. It filters out the bots, scams, and dead listings you find on other classified sites.\n\nSo: it's free, it's safe from bots, and it finds exactly the specific service you need.   \n\n\nAlso, the platform is completely open. We don't hide service pages or contact details behind paywalls. Unlike commission-based platforms where you have to 'trick the system' just to exchange phone numbers, we give you the direct contact info immediately. You can call or message the provider freely without jumping through hoops.",

Now when there's a hobby I want to chase I can fully dive in financially and with the ability of knowing how to \"learn\" better than the average person I'm a pro in everything I touch.

Example they may hate their boss and hate being at work every day, while I bet you like yours ;)  I hope lol.  But I work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and I can tell you almost across the board they're feeling it the same way you are.    \n  \nThe ones who are growing aren't growing as much as they had hoped. Three of my long-term clients decided to retire early and close their business because the impacts of tariffs made their business no longer feasible. Others struggling with softer sales than anticipated. So it's not just you, but I also know how you feel ... we all do.  And you're not unemployed, you are SELF-employed. Sometimes that mental shift helps.   \n  \nThe fact that your business is still going means it has NOT failed, because it's still going. And even if it did actually fail, failure isn't bad, most often it tells us how NOT to do something.  Chin up!",

None of your friends have become doctors, and hardly even nurses after two years.\n\nWhat do you mean you've always been an entrepreneur at heart? you just started your adult life.\n\nI don't want to give life advice, it's all about you and how you want to live your life.  If you really have entrepreneurial spirit this is most likely what you should explore. If you want to be a doctor as well, be an entrepreneurial doctor. Become a dentist and aim for a chain of dental clinics. Become a surgeon and instead of curing people fill up their boobs, or much easier, just spend your days injecting some tiny amounts of liquid into their lips and muscles for massive profits. You can be passionate about heart surgery yet invent a non existing procedure or device and make millions upon millions, and you can do that probably do similar in almost any medical specialty.\n\nNurses? overworked and probably underpaid. Doctors? mostly very busy, stressed, have no life, and probably therefore even if well paid are underpaid, since they have no life and are literally giving their life away to the job.\n\nYou quite simply need to decide what you want to be and how your want to live, and what kind of lifestyle you want in the future.\n\nSo what if your first business is failing or failed, or your second or third. If and when you make it, you could retire while watching your peers give their lives away for \"good pay\" and status, but literally having no life. However, you could also keep on failing forever, or at least not making it the way you want to and they took over in any way that you consider as a success, be it home ownership, an expensive car, a trophy wife, or whatever else people compare themselves with, with their peers.  None of that is a guarantee of any degree of happiness. In fact I guess most people are unhappy, frustrated or jealous in some shape or form.  Life and your choices are filled with risks, and you need to be able to live with your choices.\n\nYou are right to start thinking about this early, however, you need to always be vigilant and decide what is best for you, and what your path is, and be flexible at allowing yourself to make a change at any moment.\n\nTry to look far into the future, and think where you REALLY want to go.",

Include: invoice number, your business details, itemized breakdown of services, payment terms (Net 30 is standard for corporate), total.\n\n\n\n\\- For what you spent their money on: Create a simple expense report in Google Sheets. Columns: Date, Category (Software, Services, Marketing, etc.), Description, Amount. Attach receipts if you have them. Corporate clients love transparency.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The systems part:\\*\\*\n\nThey're not expecting enterprise-level operations from a 2-year-old service business. They're expecting:\n\n1. Clear communication about what you're doing\n\n2. Regular updates on progress \n\n3. Proper billing (see above)\n\n4. Basic contract/SOW for future work\n\n\n\nIf they're asking about \"systems,\" they probably mean: Do you track time? Do you have project management? Do you have a process? Simple answer: Yes, you use \\[insert Notion/Trello/Monday - even if you just set it up\\]. The important part is showing you're organized, not that you're using enterprise software.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* After you send them the report, follow up in 2 days and ask if they need anything clarified. This shows you're professional and gives you a chance to address concerns before they become issues.",

AI has been immensely helpful in keeping our team lean and moving faster as a small team! People are often surprised when we say we only have 2 engineers! That said, below is a list of what worked and what did not\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **Writing Code got 2x faster atleast:** Thanks to tools like Cursor, Windsurf etc, our team is shipping code atleast 2x faster! Metrics like DORA clearly show this but more important, its super obvious because our product roadmap for the whole year was done in the the 2nd quarter!\n2. **50% marketing is on autopilot:** Our primary marketing channel is Google ads and I still do everything manually but there were a lot of smaller marketing tasks like SEO and social media content we have been juggling with using freelancers years! Thanks to AI tools like Frizerly and stuff, all of this is completely automated now! I just spend 5 mins reviewing content every week now\n3. **Design:** Tools like Google Nano Banana, V0 by Vercel has completely taken over designs for us. AI is able to take existing simple images, UI etc and transform it into the exact ones we want! Since you can basically chat with these, iteration speed is insane!\n4. **Translation:** Lastly, we were hiring translators again as freelancers earlier because our specific business has a lot of translation requirements often! AI has been able to completely automate this again\n\n**What did not work for us**\n\n1. **Personalized outreach:** We tried outreach via LinkedIn and email using AI personalization tools but our customers hated it!\n2. **AI support:** We connected our support chat/ticket system with AI in the hopes of faster resolution and lower overall human support load! But for some reason, again our customers hate it. We kept seeing messages like \"I WANT HUMAN\" lol! So we quickly removed it\n\nFollowing to see  what everyone else experiences have been like :)",

We have a multilingual content publishing platform and the automated translations are almost always spot on. Its great you can add context and tone of voice prompts with every bit of translation. Quality has gotten up by a terrible lot and time to review very much down. \n\n\\- We sell products and a new product section \"what do actual clients say\" is way better now I can summarize all reviews into one good one. New customers like this new created content block a lot and the results make a lot of sense. So instead of reading 100 reviews most customers read that piece of content. \n\nIn 2026 we're going to do the same with \"what our experts say\" and just do a survey among all our experts and summarize it automatically. Its a great way to crowdsource new quality content. \n\n\\- Grading of lead quality. The context from leads (especially the written notes) is analyzed and returns a \"hotness rating\" for the lead which prioritizes our outbound calling. This works perfect, before we could only do this prioritization on hard data (page, product, etc) and now also on written text \"I'm in the market to buy xxx and saw this on your website\". Big win.\n\n\\- Saving on legal costs; LLM's write pretty good legal documents. So nowadays we pay mostly just for reviewing and not so much for writing all pieces. It did cut costs down. But my expectation is that legal firms will cut their prices at some point and generate these themselves (but still, costs down).  \n\n\nWhat didn't work out;  \n\\- Client support; the amount of hallucinations are way too much to let the current AI converse with our clients. Too many wrong answers even though everything is correct in the knowledge base. No matter how we structured data, answers were wrong.

It makes shipping and testing easier, but customer feedback still matters more than intuition.\n\nAnother takeaway is that AI doesn’t remove the need to understand your ideal customer. Generating things faster only works when the output is actually valuable to the right people.\n\nAnd even with all the automation, communities still matter. Trust, relationships, and real conversations continue to be where clarity and momentum come from. AI helps execute, but humans still decide what’s worth building.",

          "text": "We used in our restaurant chain AI assistant which was specifically developed for restaurants. It spoke around 80 hours in a month so we saved around 2400-2600$ per month, which is around 30k per year. Considering our margin of 30%ish, to net that amount of profit we would have needed to sell around 90,000$ of burgers, and it is now I consider as a \"free money\" we pocket in a year. \n\nWe felt that a lot of people are just calling to ask basic stuff, and  when our cashier wasnt able to pick up the phone, all of their complaints or questions went directly to Yelp and downgrade our reviews. We did not put a cheese in the burger and we got 1 star review on yelp. That AI we are using it asks the questions to customer and even does discounts on the next visit which goes directly to our system. It gathers basic info for catering and sets up a call with a manager. They actually provided us a mini SaaS dashboard with CRM database of our clients who actually called us several times and with complaint history.\n\nWe were very sceptic but we gave it a shot. Now I am so surprised that there are many restaurants they are not using it thinking the customers will hang up the phone, but that was not true if you choose a right one. There are a lot of crappy ones out there. Choose only who are specialized in your industry. The one we are using came with a lot of automations, so always ask if they are just providing only talking with customers function or anything else. We also \"trained\" our customers to call us and place an order through phone. During rush hour we figured that people who take a car and hit highway won't go to a website and order from there. So they call and place an order not getting distracted while they are driving.  We got monthly around 10-15k of orders placed like that\n\nMy biggest learning was not to be sceptic and always be up to date with the technology. Eventually everyone will get used to AI as we did to PC and Internet.",

Je me suis formée et je travaille sur la conception d'appli, et voici ce que j'ai appris après plusieurs mois de travail acharné  et deux app en finalisation : \n\nj'ai embauché deux devs pour des essais et ça a été une catastrophe.

Sauf que si j'avais fait cela avec les dévs, j'aurais mis des mois.

Here's the breakdown:  \nIncome Stream #1: Dividend Investing ($500/month passive)  \n  \nStarted with $200/month into dividend ETFs back in 2021  \nNow automatically contributes $600/month, reinvests dividends  \nGenuinely zero maintenance once set up  \n  \nIncome Stream #2: Microtask platforms ($200-400/month semi-passive)  \n  \nDo small online tasks during lunch breaks, while watching TV, etc.  \nTakes maybe 5-10 hours/month total  \nPerfect for dead time that would otherwise be wasted  \n  \nIncome Stream #3: Testing digital products (TBD)  \n  \nCreating info products in my niche  \nToo early for real numbers but optimistic  \n  \nThe strategy that changed everything:  \nDon't try to replace your income immediately. Start with things that fit into gaps in your schedule. The dividend income grows automatically while I can dial the active stuff up or down based on work demands.  \nFor anyone starting out:  \n  \nBegin with one truly passive income source (investments)  \nAdd flexible side hustles that don't require set hours  \nAutomate everything possible  \nBe patient - took me 2+ years to see real momentum  \n  \nWhat side hustles are you all running alongside your day jobs?

That's my bad for making it confusing. Here's the actual breakdown:\n\nDividend income: $80-100 a month (you nailed that estimate)  \nThe rest comes from a mix of capital I can access if needed and some gains I've taken\n\nI should have been clearer that the $500 a month \"passive income\" number included portfolio growth I could tap into, not purely dividend payouts. That's misleading on my part.  \nThe actual pure dividend income is way more modest like you said, around $80-100 a month from roughly $25k invested. Still nice to have but definitely not the $500 I implied.  \nThanks for keeping it real. Don't want to give anyone unrealistic expectations about what's actually possible in 4 years. Edit typos",

In India, direct bank transfer through Wise works great.\n\nSet a specific pay date (like 1st and 15th of month) and stick to it so you're not constantly managing who got paid.

Once I accepted that tradeoff and planned payouts a few days earlier, things got way smoother.\n\nIt really shouldn’t be this hard, but right now the biggest win I’ve seen is reducing variability so you’re not constantly tracking who’s paid, who’s pending, and who’s stuck in limbo.

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Google & LinkedIn Ads: as I said, \\~60% of our customers come from Google and LinkedIn ads! We spend about $7k combined every month! LinkedIn is slightly more expensive but we have basically hit the ceiling on Google alone unfortunately!\n2. Conferences:  We send someone from our team to most present at extremely specific industry conferences! I guess about 10% customers come this way\n3. Cold emails: We have setup Clay recently to automatically do cold outreach based on our ideal customer persona both via email and linkedin! The outreach is basically to book a sales call! About 10% customers come this way\n4. SEO: Since we already get customers from Google ads, it made sense to invest in SEO as well to ideally get some organic traffic without ads! We have setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly to use our Google search data to automatically publish a highly specific blog on our website on relevant keywords! About 10% of customers come this way when they search these keywords on Google!\n5. Communities & Reddit: Last but not least, we have used tools like F5B etc to setup alert on specific keywords all across reddit and few niche online communities and we usually join the conversation, provide value and subtly plug our product  in about 10% of the conversions! Again about 10% of customers this way!",

Content and real examples have done more than ads there.\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect: founder-led stuff works really well. People don’t trust brands that much, but they do trust people. Sharing honest takes, lessons learned, even mistakes in places like Reddit or smaller communities builds trust surprisingly fast.\n\nWe also stopped trying to make broad content. Generic blog posts didn’t move anything. Very narrow, very specific content for one clear ICP did.\n\nCold outbound still works too, but it’s way better when it’s not actually cold. If someone has seen your content or recognizes your name, replies go up a lot.\n\nOverall, what’s worked best is just showing up where our ICP already hangs out, talking about the problem, sharing what we’re seeing, and helping.

A couple “language” points to clarify what I think you’re saying.\n\nJobs are usually many different tasks. AI may automate or expedite some tasks, but the job itself becomes more about higher level thinking, more critical creative work. Honestly probably less rote, mindless work, and more about like, almost supervising the robot and understanding the “why” behind the work it is doing.\n\nLike you mentioned, the calculator didn’t impede our ability to do math; we actually just started working on much harder problems once we stopped wasting our time on manual calculations. We just need to know how to employ the calculator so we can tackle HARDER problems.\n\nIs that kind of where you’re thinking?",

The new skill is:\n1. define the problem and constraints (what matters, what doesn’t)\n2. supervise + verify outputs (because the robot is confidently wrong sometimes)\n3. turn results into decisions (trade-offs, timing, incentives)\n\nOne nuance: for a while, a lot of roles become “hybrid”. You still need enough “how” to catch failures and steer the tool.\n\nCurious: in the trainings you’ve run, what’s the #1 thing people struggle with most. Asking better questions, verifying outputs, or deciding what to do next?",

Many of us in the industry are pushing for updated roles that supervise the “AI intern” instead of mass automation of roles. \n\nYour question: Most people need real practice using paid AI tools (40-100 hours) and a strong belief that their employers aren’t going to outsource their job. If they really fear losing their jobs, they need to start learning to be an entrepreneur. It’s never been easier than right now.\n\nIf you haven’t already, check out Ethan Mollick’s blog at OneUsefulThing.org - he is one of the biggest experts in the field that combines practical entrepreneur/business sense with no joke scientific/academic reasoning. He’s a trusted voice, as far as I’m concerned. Everyone else is just repackaging the same garbage content.\n\n***Long Response***\n\nLike you mentioned, the real, long-term game now is strategically prioritizing which tasks add the most value and then consistently leveraging these tools to deliver quality products or services faster than the competition. The companies that empower their people to use these tools and mitigate the risk will have a compounding competitive advantage in the next couple years. All future knowledge worker jobs should have an AI supervisor component.\n\nAs for your question: it depends largely on the industry.\n\nGenerally: \n\n1. Many people don’t fully grasp the full range of what LLMs are capable of. They do surface level tasks and don’t realize they can go much deeper. Or they think AI can’t do what they can, so they don’t bother to put it through its paces. They hear the hype but haven’t seen or internalized the earth-shattering magic yet.\n\n2. There is a hands-on component that many lack, they don’t have 20, 40, 100+ of practice with PAID LLMs, so they don’t quite know how to get AI to give them what they want yet. This is easily remedied with practice and coaching. This practice also usually fixes problem 1.\n\n3. The last piece I see the most, and the one I struggle with the most is: many think of AI as an automation tool, not an enhancement tool for existing employees. People think all their jobs are going to be automated away and they are going to lose their jobs. This is a real possibility. So people resist any and all AI trainings, change efforts, etc. They resist because they fear their livelihoods depend on it. The only thing we can do for this one is share a vision of a positive AI enhanced future and actively lead people towards it.\n\nSome people will lose their jobs, but my company REALLY pushes the, “re-define your current roles, put your current employees on harder, more meaningful and valuable work, automate the bullshit busywork that no one wants to do” kind of track. I won’t work with organizations trying to do mass automation and layoffs.\n\n\n***More specific examples of problems and questions from specific industries, if you’re interested:***\n\n-Solopreneurs and small businesses just want to know how they can use these tools to scale their business.\n\n-Higher Education is a mixed bag, many still see using AI as cheating and want to try to ban it or find ways to catch students red-handed. Other academics see it as the future and want to know how to use AI to help them produce better research, faster.\n\n-Medical field: mostly how they can automate the insurance eligibility verification. Or use AI to transcribe appointment notes without violating HIPPA. Most providers want to actually focus on their patients, but have to spend most of their time documenting the whole ordeal that it feels like the Dr is on the computer the whole time. Many of the providers I’ve met know this is a problem and hate it, but they need to make sure your chart is as accurate as possible so they miss out on the actual helping the patient thing.\n\nIs there a specific industry you’re looking for?\n\nIf you read this far, thanks for coming to my TED talk!",

It just happens at the edges:\n- new combinations of old parts under new constraints\n- new problems created by new tech\n- new judgments about trade-offs when the costs are real\n\nI’m not defending slop or style-ripping. I’m saying the practical response isn’t “there’s no value”. It’s: stop competing on raw output and compete on judgment + proof + ownership.\n\nIf AI output is cheap, what’s your moat?\n- a real customer, a real loop, a real outcome, or a real craft that’s hard to verify without you.\n\nWhat would you consider a fair system here: opt-in only training, mandatory attribution, revenue share, or something else?",

Anyone who has ever had this problem and how they overcame this identity addiction please give me some advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: Thanks you guys for the concern and advices. I just want to let you guys know that I like Entrepreneurship not for the money but the joy of building. The reason I made this post is because I noticed myself being a boring person with no hobbies but Entrepreneurship. Hence, I wanted to ask advices on hobbies similar in likes of Entrepreneurship or something that I can engage as much fun in Entrepreneurship. Thanks!",

YOU'RE boring because you've trained yourself to only feel dopamine when there's a potential roi attached.\n\nthe truth is that entrepreneurship being your \"only joy\" is avoidance. what were you into before you started this? what did 15 year old you think was cool? go do that thing, even if you suck at it now.\n\nalso, and i say this with love: nobody wants to hang out with someone who can only talk about one thing. doesn't matter if that thing is startups, crypto, fishing, or the lore of dark souls. single-topic people are exhausting.\n\nthe fix isn't complicated. force yourself to do stuff with zero productivity attached. sit in a park. watch a dumb movie. get a hobby where the goal is just... doing the hobby. your brain will fight you because it's addicted to the \"building something\" high. do it anyway.\n\nyou're not a founder. you're a person who sometimes founds things. big difference.",

Wrong. That just means those people aren’t your people. Do you think Shaq and Kobe got bored of each other just because they only talked basketball?\n\nFun means something different for everyone.

I dont look to sexy , new  business trends to guide my  financial decisions.   I want long term profits can utilize to support my idea of a great lifestyle.   Keep the boring income   vehicles on ato pilot with boring ,consistent income for wealth building.    Over the last decade have the majority of time bet on a more high risk high reward  entrepreneurial   concept with the knowledge of likely hood of not winning big consistently.    Money is  the  means to control my own success or failure .   Its freedom, security , with  the luxury of calling my own plays.    Allows me to give my children opportunities and security with their real passions driving their  future.    Travel ,  being a hands on dad with the blessing to  create wealth with my own merit and skill  being  foremost.     Being that fully involved dad with  the ability to provide without worry is the obsession.       Kind of boring in regards to flash and clout  yet I decide  my   time spent being a  cool dad with  resources to make my children's dreams a reality.      No end to my dedication and hard work when the reward is my kids wanting for nothing dad on occasion  setting up some cool vacations, fun weekends and   maybe bringing out the flash cars to make my kids think I am rad and a great father to them",

Actually I admire people who can be so passionate about anything. \nI really do think that if you want to get really good at something, you have to invest a majority of your time and energy into it & of course it’s difficult to excel at something like entrepreneurship and then at the same time have several hobbies. \nI think it’s okay to have one thing that you are really good at and really care about, rather than being someone, who’s kinda good and kinda interested in many things, but in a way not extemely passionate about anything in patricular at all. \n\nIf you’re worried about being boring to other people, I think you should surround yourself with other entrepreneurially spirited people, you can connect over your passion. Same goes for dating, if you care about that: being with a person who shares your passion for whatever is the most amazing feeling. You can talk about them for hours about the specific thing you have a shared interest in. \n\nHowever, if it’s really causing you distress, that you feel like all you can think about is entrepreneurship, then to me it sounds like you’re in a bit of a burnout actually. \nMaybe you are overwhelmed and don’t actually have the mental capacity to care about anything at all. \nMaybe you could have a break where you get away from your routine for a while and try something new, like going to a pottery class, skiing, hiking - whatever it is that can take your mind off things and maybe reinvigorate you.\n\nFinding a new hobby, although this shouodn’t be the goal, will also help you achieve more in your entrepreneurial endavours because you’re able to switch your mind off and actually think more creatively again therefore be better at problem solving.\n\nPs: don’t listen to people calling you boring, you are not, rest assured!!",

I asked him what he’d actually do if he had to start again today. No audience, no brand, no clients. What surprised me wasn’t anything flashy, but how slow and manual the first phase really was.\n\n1) He focused on one free channel He tried a lot over time, but early on it was mostly consistent posting aimed at a very specific buyer. Nothing viral. Just showing up.\n\n2) He kept his online presence extremely simple One page that made it clear who it was for and what problem it solved. No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out. No automation.\n\n4) He didn’t judge results quickly He mentioned that most of the benefits only showed up after sticking with it longer than felt comfortable.\n\nI’m curious if others here have seen similar patterns, or if this breaks down at some point.",

Scale and automation only helps once you have a manual workflow that is nailed down really well.\n\nIf you are getting started, assuming you have a product that actually solved a problem, first identify your ideal customer persona! Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage. Ideally you will find one that outperforms rest! Once you have this channel you can essentially scale up till it breaks. Once it breaks, you kinda have to repeat the process all over again. But that doesn't usually happen until you cross $1M in revenue etc!\n\nHope this helps :)",

Not because the business was failing, but because I had built it in a way that worked against who I actually am.\n\nI was showing up in sales calls, client conversations, and daily work in ways that didn’t feel authentic. It felt like I had to perform a version of myself every day. Over time that creates a huge mental tax, even if things look “successful” on paper.\n\nThe hardest realization for me was understanding that you can build something profitable that still drains you if it’s misaligned. I spent years thinking the heaviness was just part of the grind. Only later did I see that the business itself was designed wrong for me.\n\nWhat I’d do differently much earlier is design the business around how I actually want to work, communicate, and think. Money matters, obviously. But being able to wake up and say “this feels like me” matters more long-term. That shift alone removed more stress than any revenue milestone ever did.",

Basically be thorough in the interview process in trying to find the right candidate and make sure they’re a culture fit and if it’s not working out, sometimes it’s best to rip the bandaid off.",

Running my own analytics freelancing business gave me my life back and made me less of a burnt out shell.\n\nThe job I left before starting my business, they wanted me to blatantly lie about a dataset and I just could not do it. It wasn't a white lie. They literally wanted to lie about data on patients with late stage cancer in a way that would justify cutting a helpful program that was being offered to those patients. I was appalled and I tried so hard to 'be a team player' and 'be flexible.' But I'm not going to fucking lie about LATE STAGE CANCER. They said I 'lacked flexibility' because of that and were such assholes. I will bend over backwards to make data work, but I'm not going to flat out tell complete falsehoods.\n\nClients tend to love that I'm so passionate about the data. I don't use the term autism exactly with clients but we've jokingly mentioned that you want your data people to be a little weird for best results.\n\nHere's the lie if anyone wants to see if I was just being autistically literal about it.>! the client wanted to know if cancer patients have trouble traveling to get their treatments. They hired us to measure the distance people traveled to their infusion sites, and then see if there were any correlations between adverse outcomes and that distance. The company I worked for of course did not have actual patient addresses to measure distance to treatment centers, so they lied and used the prescribing doctor's address as the patient's address. Well that's completely tautological-- it meant that everyone who GOT treatment was 'zero miles' from their treatment center. So the data showed everyone was RIGHT on top of a treatment center, and nobody had any issues! They wanted me to tell the client, \"Anyone who got treatment traveled zero miles\" with a completely straight face. I refused and they wrote me up for insubordination and for not helping the business.!<",

So entrepreneurship seemed like the quickest way to spot something wrong and just go fix it myself.\n\nMy reasons for doing it changed over time. I kind of break it down into a few stages.\n\nFirst theres control like deciding what I work on and how I use my days. Back when I started that felt way more important than making money right away.\n\nThen leverage came into it building something once and watching it grow without starting over all the time every week or so.\n\nAnd meaning too working on stuff that Id still want to do even if nobody else cared or noticed.\n\nThe whole point for me isnt some huge exit or anything dramatic. Its more about having options being able to turn down things and pick projects because I want to not because I have to.\n\nTalking to other people who started businesses Ive noticed something. If the only reason is money or looking good it wears you out in that long boring stretch in the middle. But if its about being curious or having some freedom or scratching a real problem you can keep going longer without resenting it all.\n\nI wonder how others think about this.\n\nLike did your main reason shift after messing up the first time or getting a win.\n\nWhat are you aiming for in the end freedom or making a difference or something else specific.\n\nHonestly what keeps you showing up every day in this entrepreneurship thing.\n\nIt seems like we dont just pick it once most of us have to choose it again every year or so. I might be oversimplifying that part though.",

The money followed once i stopped chasing it and focused on solving real problems for people who think like me. Freedom came when i built guardrails instead of just hoping willpower would save me.",

          "text": "I started a Montessori preschool. I didn't know what I was doing, had zero experience but wanted a better place for my son. I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

Having things written and financials recorded in real time made the real friction visible instead of hidden. \n\nIt wasn't about being organized for the sake of it.

Rent looked manageable, but commute and other fixed costs hurt way more when revenue was still shaky. I overestimated my network. People were supportive but lacked authority or budget. Later learned to qualify leads properly (BANT), which saved a ton of wasted time. Started with service-based pitch templates. Eventually realized clients don’t care about services, they care about their problems. Switched to question-based discovery instead.  \nGood things also happened that i got freelancers on board instead of full time employees. It helped me a lot to save on cost as well as avoid liabilities. For scaling up i outsourced to third party companies, it doesn't always helps to cut costs (sometimes margins are too narrow to make any profits) but it does helps to acquire big or multiple projects at a time or to open new channels.",

      "text": "My journey started out of necessity, not ambition. I was working at a truck repair shop when management kept making these insane decisions - one after another. Me and my coworkers eventually had enough and quit. At the time, I didn't realize I was about to become an entrepreneur.  \n  \nThe next few weeks were a blur. I was hustling just to keep the lights on - reselling stuff on eBay, fixing phone screens, building basic websites for friends. Whatever paid the bills. One night while I was down the reddit rabbit hole, I ended up on r/Entrepreneur and saw this post about someone crushing it with their cleaning company. I remember thinking 'why not? I could do that.' I’m writing this post hoping it inspires someone reading this as it did to me back then.   \n  \nStarting off was rough. I had no idea how to find cleaners, price jobs or even structure the business. The first website? Just a cookie-cutter theme that every other cleaning company was using. But it worked well enough to get us started. As we grew, I realized the website needed to be better - this wasn't just some placeholder anymore, it was an actual asset bringing in money. So I invested in a proper logo and custom site. We kept on growing but felt limited by leads we were getting as most of them were paid. The cost to acquire clients was high and we wanted to convert as many as we can - which presented its own challenges.  \n  \nThis prompted us to look at how to rank our website which took me on another trail I wasn’t ready to go down on. The first overseas team we worked with ranked us but for landing pages built on their website and for keywords no one was searching for! At that time I didn’t understand long tail keywords or much related to the art of sending signals to google. I soon moved on and tried my luck locally. We hired a local firm on a premium retainer basis and under a year-long contract to deliver us that sweet local organic traffic we hoped would result in bookings. A year later? Barely anything to show for it. Started investigating and found out the blog content I paid for was recycled from their other cleaning clients. The back-link strategy? Just a web of links between all their customers. I was beyond pissed when I figured it out.\n\n  \nAt that point, I'd been burned enough that I just started learning it myself. Optimized our Google Business Profile, rebuilt the website properly, created actual useful content and a bunch of other stuff - the agencies should've been doing way back. We started to see the organic leads increase month by month and stopped relying on paid leads eventually. It took years and cost me way more than it should have, but it was worth every headache to finally have this figured out. \n\n  \nPerhaps it's too soon to be writing this out here because it's only just the beginning but I wanted to connect with other entrepreneurs who've been on similar journeys. The road gets lonely sometimes, and hearing other people's stories - the wins, the failures, the pivot moments - that's what keeps me going.  \n  \nI’d love to read your stories about how you became or plan to become an entrepreneur. Cheers!",

It was brutal. The lessons I learned during that time were invaluable though.

      "text": "Like the title says, I am the CEO and Founder of a deeptech biotech startup that has been around for more than 7 years now. After almost a year of raising money, I succeeded in oversubscribing the round, and closed early last year. Now that I have the money and an expanded team (doubled post-round), I feel extremely burnt out. I should also mention I am married with 2 kids. \n\n  \nI exercise 3 days a week, I eat healthy, I do take a low dose SSRI to manage anxiety, and I sleep well for the most part. I take a vacation once, or sometimes twice, a year to recharge.\n\n  \nHowever, with all of this I still feel exhausted at work, and my threshold for lashing out is quite low. I don't know what else to do to manage my burn out! I truly love what I do, but I feel so low energy...my social battery is also taking a big hit. I can't spend more than a couple of hours with friends before feeling completely exhausted. \n\n  \nWhat have fellow entrepreneurs been doing out there to deal with burnout? ",

Now the money is in the bank, the threat of immediate death is gone, and your body is finally allowing itself to crash. It's biological, not just mental.\n\nAlso, doubling the team means you shifted from 'Builder' to 'Manager/Psychologist' for new hires. That context switching drains the battery 10x faster than coding or lab work.\n\nThe only fix that worked for me was removing myself from 'opinion-based' decisions. I started relying strictly on data/systems to be the 'bad guy' so I didn't have to expend emotional energy enforcing standards.\n\nGive yourself permission to be 'useless' for a few weeks.

Do not be that boss that makes the work harder, because you are overstressed and over-involved in operations. You need a team you can trust so that you can relax and focus on your unique role which values health and sanity over the extra hours. Your team will feel empowered by the enhanced responsibility and will take accountability in a way that is hard if the founder is hovering, exhausted and exhausting. The team feels strong and safe here. They are empowered by the space and trust you have given, and they feel safe knowing that you are doing your job which includes ‘firefighting’. Calm, collected and available for whatever is needed, while recognizing that delegating all possible responsibilities is necessary to remain ‘calm, collected and available’.",

As a founder CEO you have to be good at all things. Is there room for you to remove yourself from some things, so you can return to working on the things you love?

      "text": "I’m going to share a story with you about how the company I work for actually started, before it was a proper SaaS.\n\nNot the founder, not the dev. I work close to product and growth at a SaaS that turns Google Maps into usable lead lists. Seeing the \"behind the scenes\" here has been a serious reality check.\n\nBefore there was an automated platform, the founders were coming off a failed project. They were burned out from building features that looked great on paper but didn't sell. So for this new idea, they made a simple rule: Don’t code. Just sell.\n\nFor the first few months, the product was just a manual service. They found people who needed local business data, and when someone asked for a list, they ran scripts manually on a laptop. They cleaned the Excel files by hand, line by line, and sent them via email with a simple PayPal invoice.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive for a tech company, but this manual grind is exactly what saved the business. If the data was wrong, the customer complained instantly. They didn't need to analyze user behavior to know what was broken, they felt it in the inbox. It also proved that people weren't paying for a slick tool, they were paying for the result. If a customer is willing to wait 24 hours for a manual email, you know you have a real business. Plus, those early sales literally funded the first months of actual development.\n\nThe automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\n\nThe lesson from inside the machine is clear: The SaaS was built to scale a solution that already worked, not to try and find a problem with a shiny UI. If what you’re doing right now feels ugly, slow, and unscalable, you’re probably exactly where you need to be.\n\n**🛡️ Authenticity verified:** this content is based on real-world data and real-world events involving real people.

Not would they maybe use it if it were free, but will they literally give you money.\n\nWhat gets me is how the manual process wasn't just validation, it was education. Every angry email about bad data, every question about what fields they needed, every \"can you also include...\" request. That's signal you just can't get from analytics or surveys. You're learning what the product needs to be because you're doing the work yourself, feeling every problem firsthand.\n\nThe timing thing is huge too: \"The automated dashboard was only built once the manual work became physically impossible to handle.\" Most founders do the opposite. They build the whole thing before knowing if anyone wants it. By the time you're drowning in manual work, you know exactly which parts to automate first because you're living the pain.\n\nThere's also something powerful about being willing to do unscalable things. It shows early customers you're serious, that this isn't just a side project that might disappear. Someone who will manually clean a spreadsheet at 11pm to get you your data actually cares about solving your problem.\n\nOne thing though: this works great for services where the value is immediate and tangible, like data or clear results. It's trickier for products where the value is in the tool itself or needs network effects. But even then, the core idea holds. Find the simplest way to deliver the value and see if anyone actually cares.",

I can imagine that initial manual grind felt quite demoralising at times, but it turned out to be the exact path your founders needed.\n\nYou're right that sometimes the \"ugly, slow, and unscalable\" stage is actually the most valuable. When you're so close to the problem, it's easy to feel like the solution has to be sleek and automated from the start. But those early manual workflows are often where you surface the true pain points and prove there's a market.\n\nIf this feels like the current phase for your product, I'd encourage you to lean into it. What specific aspects of the manual work are the most illuminating? Where do customers seem most engaged or frustrated? Observing those raw interactions can give you invaluable insights that may get lost once things are fully automated.\n\nJust remember to pace yourself. Avoid the temptation to over-optimise before the core foundation is solid. As long as you're learning and getting paid, the \"ugliness\" is a feature, not a bug. What's one small step you could take next to make that manual process just a little bit smoother?",

That’s a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI’m talking about founders who want to leverage **talent**, **capital**, **infrastructure**, and **speed**.\n\nWe tend to underestimate the value of being born or operating in Western countries nowadays. Yes, there is a lot to criticize and improve, no system is perfect, but the legacy you inherit is invaluable.\n\nWhen a founder operates with a team, efficiency matters. You don’t have time to constantly deal with:\n\n* people not being punctual (and it being “normal”)\n* deadlines not being respected (and it being “okay”)\n* feedback not being taken seriously\n* lack of accuracy and accountability\n\nIn many Southern countries, people are raised in environments where predictability is not a priority. A predictable environment with fewer frictions and fewer surprises is something many people in Western cultures take for granted.\n\nAs a founder, you end up wasting an enormous amount of energy on things that are **not core to your business**.\n\nThe hardest part is this:\n\nSome people accept this as “part of the culture” and don’t want to improve it, because changing it feels like betraying their identity and you are the one told you’re taking things too seriously.\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, and I’m not trying to generalize or stigmatize anyone.\n\nBut as a founder, you don’t have the luxury of failing because of things that have nothing to do with your product, your market, or your execution.",

      "text": "Three months ago, I was talking to a client who runs a small food marketplace in Australia. She told me about one of her vendors - a single mom who started a home-based dumpling business during COVID. She was doing 50 orders a week, but after UberEats took their cut, she was netting less than minimum wage.\nThe worst part? She had no direct relationship with her own customers. Couldn't email them, couldn't offer loyalty discounts, nothing.\nMy team had just finished building a custom platform for another client, and we thought - what if we created a commission-free model specifically for home cooks?\n\nThe technical challenge was massive:\n・Home cooks are NOT tech-savvy. Whatever we built had to be simpler than Instagram.\n・Payment processing had to handle individual vendors under one platform.\n・We needed a way for customers to discover multiple vendors in their area.\n・Android app was non-negotiable (most vendors only had phones, not computers).\n\nWhat we ended up building:\n・A 2-tap order system for customers\n・Vendor dashboard that literally any grandma could use\n・Automated payout system every 24 hours\n・Zero commission on pickup/self-delivered orders\n\nThe result that still gets me: That same dumpling vendor is now doing 80 orders/week, keeping 100% of her profits, and has a direct SMS list of 200+ customers. She sent us a video of her new kitchen setup last week.\nWe learned that custom software isn't about fancy features - it's about removing the middleman that's eating someone's livelihood.\nThe platform now has 200+ vendors and processes 500+ orders weekly. Not huge numbers, but every one of those orders represents more money in a small business owner's pocket.\n\nWhy I'm sharing this: We have capacity for one similar marketplace project this quarter. If you're in an industry where middlemen are eating your margins (or your vendors' margins), I'd be happy to share our architecture and vendor acquisition playbook.\n\nThe tech stack is React/Node/AWS if you're curious, but honestly, the tech is the easy part. The hard part is designing for non-technical users who just want to sell their food without becoming software experts.",

But we're piloting towards a Vendor Delivery Pool like think Uber Pool but for deliveries. Vendors opt-in to share a single courier for $3/order, split among them. Platform still takes 0%.

With weight loss your clients are people who are NOT obsessed with the gym, so the biggest issue for them, will always be the effort they have to invest and the lack of motivation. For you this means, once you have worked out a great core offer and have served a few clients, collected same positive proof etc. (the foundational work for any service business) - You will be in the sales/marketing business.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, your company will help people loosing weight. But because of the high churnrate, your work as the Entrepreneur won't be around helping people to loose weight, but to aquiere more customers (sales and on larger scale marketing) each month then you naturally loose, because working out and eating clean sucks.\n\nThis is not to discourage you, just figure out the rules of the industry you are entering quickly and then never expect those problems to ever go away entirely. The high churnrate is a fixed factor for the fitness industry, but that's not a reason to not pursue what you want.\n\n\nOther examples:\nThe software industry is a product industry, as long as the software is great, it will be ez to sell and market.\nThe drink industry, is a branding industry. Energy Drinks, Cocacola, pepsi etc. all depend on a strong brand and not on having the best drink.",

Boss adviced me not to quit just yet. About a month later he fired me. Turns out that doing it that way I was able to go home immediately, but the corporation still paid me full salary for the next 2 months, and my final 2 weeks pay had my \"holiday money\", so it was tripple the normal pay. Never before been so happy for geting fired!!!\n\nWell, I already had my own shop and some tools, so I've been there, chain smoking, drinking coffee, and thinking, thinking and thinking. The 2 months just ended, and it looks like I now have a car repair shop. I was supposed to have a welding shop, but after 1 month of thinking I changed the plan because I realized that for cars I have all the tools I need, and it's easier to find customers.\n\nNow I'm a bit scared. Savings are burned, and GF is going to a surgery, and after that she's unable to work for 2 months.",

But from what I'm seeing, you're not the type to become an entrepreneur out of necessity. So you should keep an eye out for opportunities. It's likely that your choice will be in technology. Entrepreneurship is wonderful, but you have to follow a path full of strategies. And that's quite complicated, haha, because you don't always win. And when I say win, I'm not talking about competitors, because over time you realize that your competitors are actually your partners, haha. It's crazy. Because there are days when you'll only have \"water\" to survive and there are days when you'll have a \"banquet.\" The entrepreneur is always in the worst situation, because the objective is first and foremost their organization.\n\n\nNote: I am an entrepreneur in the technology sector and also a PhD in entrepreneurship. And do you know what the secret is? You must persevere. Change your product, but don't give up. However, if I were to tell you what I intend to specialize in from now on, it would be in manufacturing products and the financial market. Oh, and choose a partner who is resilient to loss. That's important. They also need to be strong enough to handle your yelling. Yes. A fragile partner won't do. Because when you don't have a psychologist, they need to have the vision of where you should go.",

You're not chasing the status symbols, you're actually investing in things that compound - freedom with friends, stability with a forever home, better travel experiences. That's not consumption, that's *lifestyle design*.\n\nThe fact that you naturally gravitated away from boats and jets without even trying tells me you figured something out early that most people take years (or never) to learn: the real wealth is in what you *don't* have to stress about anymore.\n\nHow long did it take before you stopped second-guessing every purchase?

About a month later, my car’s head gasket blew my only vehicle and shortly after that I was laid off. Since August, I’ve been applying everywhere and haven’t been able to land a job. I’m not chasing some fantasy career or big money. I just want something stable enough to breathe again.\n\nSo when I imagine money coming in, I don’t picture excitement or splurging. I picture relief. Like finally being able to exhale. Fixing my car. Paying bills without that constant background panic. Sleeping without my mind racing about what’s going to break next.\n\nI’m curious whether, when things finally turned around for you, the money actually brought peace or if it came with a different kind of stress. Right now it feels like financial stability would solve 80% of my problems, not because I want more, but because I just want my life to stop feeling like survival mode every single day.\n\nDon’t know why I felt the need to say this.

Perhaps God is gifting me this, idk why He would be I can’t explain it otherwise. \n- I validate / evaluate all my ideas with ChatGPT. To make them viable and actionable. To see if there’s any way to improve. To get feedback whether it will be received well with my market.\n- I post and put myself out there without self-judgement. I’ve been consistent posting 1-2x daily and only taking days off for “creative expansion” days where I recalibrate and make room for even better ideas\n- I evaluate every single piece of content / sales page / offer I make by sharing my performance stats with ChatGPT. It shows me whats effective and where people are falling off. I take this info and reiterate and repost without worrying if people notice.”\n- I am constantly feeding my brain with expert ideas strategies and ways of thinking via low ticket info products. I feed what’s relevant to me into ChatGPT to help me expand on my current ideas and way of writing and working.\n\nSo far I’ve grown my Facebook platform from 0 to 8000 daily views and engagement has increased similarly too.\n\nI’ve got two different offers in the works - low ticket books and courses for my mom audience where I help them mitigate meltdowns\n\nAnd a mid-ticket group consulting offer for high level biz owners / marketers who want to reach more of their followers on Facebook like I have.\n\nI suppose I’m a mix of excited / curious :)\n\nAnd I keep myself in check asking myself “am I striving?

      "text": "I started my business in April 2025, so officially less than 12 months. Started negative and used my credit card to fund the business.\n\nLittle back story about myself. I’m a carpenter by trade. Always been entrepreneurial and had an interest in business/making money. Didn’t come from money. Had a few small businesses over the years, some failed, others just weren’t viable. \n\n2025 started rough for myself. I experienced severe anxiety for the first time. Spent 2024 hustling and trading. Managed to build up an account to multiple 6 figs but got greedy and lost majority of it at the end of the year. Even lost my finances 10k that she trusted me with. I had to come clean and admit what I had done.. it was one of the hardest conversations of my life. \n\nThat leads me into the business, obviously having lost a significant amount of money, still had a job. I had to figure out ways to earn more to somehow get myself out of the hole I dug.\n\nSo I started doing a few cash jobs on the side, outside of work hours.\n\nInstalling basic shower screens, found work from apps where people posted jobs they needed done and I could quote/compete with others. \n\nAfter a few months of doing a few jobs a week. I could see there was profit to be made and the jobs had a quick turn over. 1 job in 45mins in some cases with profit of 50-60% \n\nSo I built a website with the help of AI, very basic, stock images and a few of images from\n\nI had done. Then I setup a Google ads campaign. Very basic, just let Google guide me. (I did have some previous experience with Google ads). \n\nWithin 10mins of the campaign being live. I had a form enquiry, I actually couldn’t believe it. Here I was laying in bed. I showed my fiancé and she brushed it off but I got excited, thinking if I can get a lead from $25 campaign.. imagine how many I can get if I increase my budget.\n\nWell the next day I increased to $50 a day.. and sure enough the leads increased. Here I was at work, phone ringing and emails coming through. Booking in as many jobs as I could. I could earn my weeks wage in a day - so I had to make a decision and speak to my fiance. Knowing I had a secure income, 150k a year and just lost a heap of money a few months prior. I didn’t expect her to support me, but she did.\n\nSo I took the leap. It was hard work, I was doing everything and sure enough had no idea how to run a business. Constantly learning, I had no idea what was involved and the amount of work behind the scenes. \n\nFast forward to now. I now have 2 employees. We are on track to do $1M revenue in the first year of business with 20% net profit. I still don’t have a factory, working out of the garage for as long as possible. \n\nThe goal is to expand to other states but first build the business and systems, test and ensure it’s a well oiled machine.

Saves you from losing a morning's worth of ad spend before you even realize the site's down.  \n  \nIf you've already got that set up, you're golden. If not, might be worth it given your ad spend is ramping up. Either way, sounds like you're on top of things!",

      "text": "At the start of 2025 I got into an online business model. For months I was just learning, watching videos, studying etc. I’ve always been better at talking than doing, but I really did understand the model inside and out.\n\nBy September I finally took the leap and it actually worked. Within two weeks I was earning, and in November I made over $20,000. For the first time I felt like \"oh damn im actually gonna make it\"\n\nBut then I messed up... I lost more than half of it because of a platform policy violation. Honestly, I could've avoided it but it is what it is.\n\nAround the same time, a guy I’d been talking to since February basically disappeared from my life. We had over 100k messages between us and talked every single day about this business. He started building a tool, I helped him, and we became partners. I genuinely thought we were building something together. Then he found loopholes in our contract and cut me out to work with someone else.\n\nSo within a few weeks, I lost a lot of money and someone I thought had my back.\n\nI’m 18 and still live with my parents. I pay my share of the bills and I have enough saved to get through 2026 without a job, so I’m not in danger or anything. But mentally, I’ve been stuck. I wake up around 1pm, watch YouTube, play games, tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve fixed a few small habits, but I just can’t get myself to actually work again.\n\nAt night it’s worse. I stay up until 3am because when I try to go to bed I either feel lonely or my brain won’t shut up. I do have a girlfriend, and honestly, all I want long term is to be able to provide for her one day. That’s what drives me deep down. But right now, I just feel like I lost my momentum and don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI’m not looking for hustle clichés or “just grind harder” advice. I’m just wondering how people get themselves moving again after losing money, trust, and confidence all at once.\n\n**TL;DR:** Built an online business at 18, made good money, lost most of it due to a mistake, then got cut out by a partner I trusted. Now I’m stuck, barely working, sleeping badly, and trying to figure out how to start again.",

Not because you need it or you're out of shape or anything, because it will help focus some of your energy, and I'm sure you got some angst built up. Put all that to good use and start lifting weights, do it for 90 days and see how you feel. \n\nIt won't really change anything, but I promise you will feel better. Cardio is good too, I just lift, it helps so much just a lift heavy, makes you feel really good afterwards. Do it everyday, because every day you will get a boost from it. Try to do it first thing in the morning, but just do it every single day even if it's not like a huge thing. I spend about 30 to 45 minutes in the gym everyday, it ain't life-changing, it's enough to boost me through the day. \n\nBetter than any drugs I ever tried.",

One biggest advice I would give for your situation to stop pushing yourself in doing what you can't. You have to build actually discipline from here on. I'm assuming that it's been a good amount of time since your lifestyle has gotten worse. So to fix it, you have to fix the environment first. You don't have to change everything at once or keep a separate time for \"work\". My real advice is to change the place where you live. If possible, just move to another room with a different kind of setup which is minimal. With a new environment, your brain would allow you to let go of current habits and allow you to build new good ones. If you can't change your room, just change the place of furniture. Just make a change. That could also mean minimalising your room by removing unnecessary things. Regardless, best wishes!",

My situation was slightly different as she was there but would shoot down my efforts and not support but she was physically there and I loved her so wanted her to enjoy the fruits of the labour (she actually wrote a Reddit piece about how I was delusional so it struck a nerve when she found out that we had an office). Saying all of that I do recognise and appreciate that work did take precedence during the relationship and at times often did and I can relate to you on that front \n\nI’m integrating the understanding that the people who did truly support are still here and a friend made sense to me that “if she was truly supporting you she would have been a part of what you are doing not just being there ‘waiting’” for something to happen. \n\nWith your situation, you clearly show respect and appreciation for what your ex did with you and you needed to put that time in on your craft to get to where you were. Although you may not be able to enjoy the fruits with him, you owe it to yourself for the hard work you put in and the dreams and ambitions were yours. Yes hold that gratitude in your heart for him and if there’s ways you would like to extend that gratitude then do so, but don’t feel bad for your win (I did) just appreciation, I’m sure he would \n appreciate that even",

Some things are just scars you learn to live with. You can’t make anything ‘right’ in your heart and head now. Don’t focus too hard on making ‘peace’ with it or you learn to take advantage and move forward while stepping over others now that you feel you broke the cherry on it. So no, you don’t want to just feel better right now because then you’re becoming like those people.\n\nYou’re talking about being appreciative and showing gratitude. Giving back when you’ve taken. Those are beautiful. But since those things take time, you also have to logically understand that your feelings will therefore have to wait. You’re not going to do anything for him today or tomorrow. It might be years.\n\nBut if you keep that feeling as additional motivation and use it to guide future actions - you’ll find yourself more deeply valuing future relationships in the moment. You’ll make more decisions that reflect these values. This painful lesson will help you develop a stronger character going forward. \n\nWe aren’t meant to just be happy and peaceful all the time. To not have trouble and pain means to not be living. So live more intentionally now that you’ve had these lessons. Don’t try and rush healing and growing just because it’s uncomfortable.",

Financial and mental support is a privilege to appreciate and maybe consider how your self pity would be an insult to all that support. There are many ways to repay that privilege. Most likely I’ve disappointed someone as we are all human and none of us perfect. Success comes with dedication. Thats your legacy (if you see it that way). If you need to pay him back then do it.

The only thing that you are forced to in life, is to eventually die.\n\nBut from everything you have written here so far, in your post and in the comments, I genuinely believe you should share everything. Keeping it to yourself just gives you more room for excuses.\n\nIt sounds like you are really really struggling with confronting it all, but that's what you have to do in order to learn from it.\n\nEntrepreneurship is NOT a goal, it's a game with the only limit being your lifetime. That means, the way is the goal. You only \"loose\" the game once you stop playing it.\nAgain, I am not trying to give you false hope. But I *am* trying to take away your believe, that I think is wrong, that you lost the game and that you are a failure.\n\nIn todays world, it's easy to be a successful Entrepreneur compared to most of human history. It's still hard, it's still painful, but it's doable. That means, no matter what mistakes you made, those expierences give you an edge against completely new Entrepreneurs who just started.\n\nAgain, even if you feel like you have nothihg to show for your efforts, you are in a better position then most wannabe entrepreneurs. Failure is part of the journey.\n\nIf you share your story publicly, you force yourself to exposure. It makes it much harder for you to stay ignorant, it makes it harder to delay the learning process further, and it encourages you to find clarity in what you actually gained from it and in what position you are actually in.\n\nYou can find \"success\" from any position in life, but you can't play the game if you don't even know what figures you have.",

I am guessing we could've push our numbers a little higher this year pretty easily by buying more but it's still so hard. Also, 2020 - 2022 were so stressful with inventory.

I am sure you can find much better places now but slower and more expensive.\n\nI eventually brought all the fulfillment in house once we rented a warehouse. Huge win for us, cheaper and faster. Sometimes when we are really busy I have to go down and help ship but that's fine, I am helping people so I don't mind.\n\nOne other thing was \"riding horses\". This is a term you hear sometimes or at least I've heard which is you saddle up your company to someone else's and ride on their horse. We made clothes for popular influencers and were able to grow a lot off them just doing what they normally would do and we got to come along for the ride and grow.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

And the worst pay was, nobody gets it and I feel so alone.\n\nWhat helped me a lot was I started forcing myself to pause for like five minutes at the end of the day and just scribble down a couple thoughts. Nothing fancy. Just “What actually felt meaningful today?” and “Where did I waste my energy?”\n\nSounds too simple, I know. But over time, those little pauses gave me a bit of space to breathe.

Take an example of an athlete working and training his all life for one race which he needs to win or at least complete, but all of a sudden he loses the race because of an injury, what do you think about the athlete is he gonna sit there and feel very happy about losing the race or is he gonna learn from the injury and failure, train much more hard even after striving every single day and trying to overcome the failure.

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

For example: salt is cheap. Salt collected by hand from the salt pans of a small European island by Mr. XYZ whose family has been living across the street from the sea for generations. Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply. But I don't know what I'll need to assemble a bed or fix the doorframe. Create a package. Assembly kit for product X. I'm happy to pay a small premium if you make my life easier.",

The idea usually comes from watching how work actually gets done versus how the software claims it works. When you see repeated hacks, spreadsheets, or workarounds, that’s a signal.\n\nFor solo or small teams, I am also biased toward problems where speed matters more than perfection. If you can validate in weeks instead of months, you do not need the perfect idea. You need a tight loop between shipping, feedback, and iteration. Most clarity comes after you start, not before.",

You build a great business by experiencing other people's problems and understanding the situation they are in, then adding your unique insights based on experiences that only you've had. \n\nDon't try to find an idea for a business. Try to just get out there, meet as many different people as you can, get yourself into as many different situations as you can, and eventually you'll come across a problem that needs to be solved and you'll see it with a unique insight that only you can see.\n\nAnd remember - even if other people can see the problem as you see it, very few people can actually build the business to solve it. So while you're out there experiencing the real world, simultaneously spend time to learn about business, marketing, sales, market economics etc etc so that you're prepared when the moment arises. \n\nGood luck. Be patient. Stop to find a business idea and start trying to help people anywhere and everywhere. You're muchl more likely to discover their greatest needs.",

I started with an idea that seemed solid, built it fully, and only then spoke with people who actually work in the field. Those conversations were eye-opening, they told me what they disliked about the tools they use every day.\n\nIn this case, it was Clay. Even though it’s one of the biggest GTM tools out there, there was still a major pain point: pricing for HTTP API enrichment which is a feature many teams rely on. That feedback made me pivot completely and build a cheaper alternative for teams that don’t have large budgets or don’t need the full product just to use one or two features.\n\nNow I have a few paying clients and I’m focused on marketing it.\n\nThe takeaway for me is that ideas don’t come fully formed. They evolve through use and feedback. The most important thing is to start, everything else can change along the way.",

          "text": "Partnership offers can be amazing or a slow-motion headache, so I’d treat this like a deal negotiation, not a “vibes” decision.  \n  \nA few things I’d want _in writing_ before you say yes:  \n\\- What exactly is being partnered? Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",
