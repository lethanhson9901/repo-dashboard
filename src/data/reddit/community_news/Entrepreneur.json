      "text": "Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up from Stakе so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

I asked her to start small by throwing away five pairs, thinking this was a manageable goal that could lead to momentum in cleaning up the rest of their home. \n\nWrong.  She has made every excuse under the sun for why she couldn’t spare any time to this task.  I remind her every time we speak. That was two years ago. \n\nNow consider they have a 3500 sq ft home.  Every room has its storage depleted with her stuff that she doesn’t use.  \n\nUnfortunately I believe nothing will be cleared until after she passes.",

When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n> Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

From a marketing standpoint, building trust is going to be the most important thing. People, especially elders, don't always feel comfortable letting a stranger into their home to go through their stuff.

However, some of the comments were very disturbing.  \n\nSome people appreciate the ability to help their aging parents while some look at it as a debilitating problem.  I felt a sense of joy to help my grandparents when I had any opportunity.  Especially when I realized the joy and way they invested into me.  That has quickly become a thing of the past.  Some cultures honor and really care for the aging whilst some look at it as a burdensome calculation (as I see in the feed).  I never had children so I won’t have to hear  someone tell me why I shouldn’t have what I have.  I am getting rid of a lot of things now. My things of value already with a destination in mind and it’s good to see this post to really understand the magnitude of giving and to whom.",

If you really wanted to squeeze the juice, you could set up a sister company with a similarly-minded partner that then flips whatever they part ways with that isn’t garbage. Again, a win-win since it’s good for sustainability repurposing items instead of sending them to the dump, and it’s mostly profit with your clients paying you for inventory that you then get paid again to sell. Touch up and resell big ticket items like furniture, antiques, fancy garments and knick-knacks that can have collectible value, donate everyday clothes and housewares that just need a wash to be usable.",

It took me about two weeks of trial and error. \\*\\*The result:\\*\\*\n\nThe owner was stunned. He paid me $500 USD instantly. In my country, for a 16-year-old, that's a life-changing amount of money.\n\n\\*\\*The problem (i need advice):\\*\\*\n\nThe owner now wants to pay me a monthly salary to automate other \"boring\" parts of his business.

You were paid $500 for a script, job done. Now they will ask you ad-hoc to create other scripts for them. That's it. Their business doesn't rely on you and if it does that's their problem. You are just 1 kid who can script a bit. Remember to ask for help if you need it, from the business and others.\n\nGood luck!",

So just get stuck in\n\n\nIts not about us telling you what to do; we don't know. The best software teams will walk into a new environment and not touch a thing ... they'll observe, have meetings and talk to the stakeholders and find out. This is what you need to do.\n\n\nNormally people will already know what they want and explain solutions to you, you'll just need to work out the priority and how to fix the issue.\n\n\nIf the issue is too big or overwhelming, split it into smaller deliverable milestones and communicate those stages to the boss or stakeholder.\n\n\nTo comment on a few things, is is not a bad thing to accept an advance ... you learning is not a problem, ALL devs are learning including old boys like me. The only issue about the advance is that its too small, so remember to stick to a daily rate yhat is fair and agree wages/invoices before work starts.\n\n\nWhat are the safest and low risk automations? Stay away from payroll and critical systems ... judge and highlight risk. Everything can be risky, but you just need to think about delivering it in a safe way... training staff well, running things in parallel, have periods of user acceptance testing, roll software out to small groups or individuals and the others continue to use existing methods.\n\n\nThe key is to identify the parts of the business that need to be improved, change them in order of priority and roll them out intelligently while keeping people informed of different milestones\n\n\nHope that helps!",

Just because it doesn't feel like \"so difficult it's worth 500$\" doesn't mean that's the case: it's \"easy\" because you've got a skill, one which your CEO wasn't able to fill until now. That has value.\n\nBy the way, people learn by doing first and foremost, if there was no struggle in it you wouldn't learn much from it.\n\nDon't accept an advance in my opinion - there's nothing worse than trying to retroactively meet an objective just because they already paid you and you owe it to them; start working, and if after a month or two it's too difficult foor you, just explain it and part ways. But I think you have talent and this is a great opportunity.\n\n--------\n\nTo not negatively affect mission critical business data, **it's very important you research best practices**. Always back up data before you modify it for your tests; even afterwards keep the backups in case you sneak in an error you didn't notice. Learn about proper testing methodology to detect errors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, test driven development.\n\nI could go on forever, but really learn what are the best practices in whatever you do, they are your friend and they exist for a good reason.\n\nFor workflow automation software, I used make.com in the past and it was nice, and also recently n8n has gotten lots of hype.",

If you're this nervous, what I would do is come up with a plan for the business owner to pay for Terms-of-Work:  Negotiate \"I will automate X process for Y dollars\" and then only get paid when you are done.  He sees you as a much cheaper solution than an adult, and he's right about that, you also need to set his expectations as a gifted teenager who is still in the learning process.\n\nGood luck, and pursue this!  It can lead to a great career with such a good resume piece under your belt that you helped maximize a business' efficiency!",

He probably will get you to sign a contract with those kind of clauses now that youve proven yourself but id make clear that the initial project + workflow was created  before the contract therefore its yours and the 500 was for you to deploy it to his business.\n\nI did a little python but nowhere near enough to script but its such a great language to learn so good on you. I can amend a little existing code but to tell me to code from scratch id be lost. \n\nExcel is a powerful tool itself, look into power query, learn the syntax of formulas, experiment with different functions in the formulas, play a little with macros for automation\n\nyou can record macros to start so the macro will repeat what you did every time its initiated. From there play with the existing code and see the stuff you can start getting it to do.

When disaster hits, redirect traffic there and manually fulfill orders.\n\n  \nFor subscriptions specifically: maintain customer payment tokens directly with your processor, not just through your platform. This lets you charge recurring payments even if your storefront dies.\n\n  \nTook me one platform lockout to learn this costs maybe $500 to set up but saves your entire revenue stream.",

You had a supportive partner who handled domestic labor so you could work 80 hour weeks. You had unpaid interns. You used infrastructure others built. You benefited from an education system. You operated within a legal framework someone else created.\n\nThe rugged individualism myth erases all the invisible support that enabled your \"solo\" success.\n\nNobody builds anything truly alone. But admitting you had help doesn't fit the narrative entrepreneurs want to sell.\n\nYou had family money for startup capital. You had connections from your expensive university. You had a safety net if things failed. But the story becomes \"I started with nothing\" because acknowledging privilege doesn't inspire people to buy your course.\n\nWas on my couch last night playing grizzly's quest while reading another \"self-made\" success story on my laptop. Every sentence ignored the massive support system that person had. Partner who paid bills during the lean years? Never mentioned. Parents who let them live rent-free? Erased from the story.\n\nThe myth is harmful because it makes people think they're failing when they need help. That asking for support means you're not a real entrepreneur.\n\nSuccess is collective even when one person gets the credit.",

In particular ignoring early family investment, or initial connections that lead to first sales. This is not healthy (for future entrepreneurs; for society, I don't know) to create an image of entrepreneurship that is too far from reality. It's like filters on instagram and what it does to beauty standards.\n\nBut if you are trying to say that society should take credit for the achievements of the individual, or parents should take credit.. I think that pushes it too far.\n\nWe absolutely should recognize the people in our lives that supported us on our journey, and that (depending where you live) that a stable structure around you was helpful, but support does not mean doing the work and actually taking the risk.\n\nThere have always been entrepreneurs, in every kind of society, so that can be omitted by default - it's not helpful and not actually a form of modesty.\n\nEven when absolutely NOT solo, very often it's 1 person that was the main force behind success. I had no family investment or support, am not married, and had no connections for my business. I put in my life savings. I did bring on some people to share the work over the years, but none invested their life savings, and all eventually gave up while I kept going. Now I'm doing pretty well. Did they help? Yes. But did they bear the same burden I did? Not even close. I personally wouldn't sell this as a solo founder journey though (although my next startup I will).\n\nBut I have a feeling this is not about entrepreneurs that built real businesses, but more about people selling snake-oil style courses?\n\nI imagine most will agree that it's annoying and likely a general bad for society. But it will always be here. Maybe you can invent some software that can help consumers make better decisions.",

There were no loans, no partners, no backing, every dime was my money that I spent 20 years working and doing  without to raise.  Every piece of equipment, every stick of material, every dime paid for every service along the way has my sweat on it. Every decision, every bid, every success and failure have my fingerprints on them.\n\nMost importantly, from the beginning until today, if it all falls apart the consequences are all on me. I have never risked anything that wasn't mine to gamble. I never spent a dime of my wife's money, never used our joint accounts, and never dipped in to our household budget.  Nobody besides me loses anything if my business fails.\n\nOf course I've outsourced things. Of course I have employees. Of course they are vital to my business.  But they aren't here to help me grow my business.  They are here because I treat them fairly, have an awesome benefits package, and pay almost double the local rate for this work. Their positions are a result of my business growing from the risks I took to start and grow. I did that part on my own, with no guarantees and no safety nets.",

That’s real, and it matters.\n\n\nWhere I think the “no one is self-made” argument comes in isn’t to dismiss that, it’s to separate financial independence from human independence. None of us operate in a vacuum. \n\n\nPrinciples, work ethic, skills, and even what not to do usually come from somewhere, parents, tradesmen, early bosses, community, or hard lessons learned watching others fail.\nSo when people say “no man is an island,” I hear it less as a financial claim and more as a recognition that execution happens inside systems, cultural, educational, and relational, even when the risk and responsibility are borne by one person.\n\n\nI think both things can be true at the same time without canceling each other out",

You’re entitled to that self-view, of course, but it doesn’t mean you’ve achieved moral superiority or more inherent value than someone working in a factory. Even when it’s 100% true and nobody has ever helped you - what good does it serve you to say it or identify with it? Being here in the comments, or with your friends, or even with other entrepreneurs saying, “I built all this with no help” - what is the value? \n\nReal question: is the value the motivation from the dopamine hit of pride/self-esteem? I could definitely see some value in that. To me, it seems more rooted in identity which is all a game we play, alone, in our heads. I’ve met pompous entrepreneurs and incredible, inspiring entrepreneurs - I don’t think this did-it-alone-mindset produced the successful ones, but a lot of the community here seems pretty defensive of it and attached to it. None of this is meant to be rude or condescending - genuinely curious about perspectives.",

For example, if you have an assistant, a bookkeeper, an accountant, someone baby sitting your kids, any type of help, I don’t consider that self made. Did you know that majority of new business have to close down because of health insurance? Having good health insurance as self employed is necessary. \nIf you have a partner that takes care of the household, that is help. If you can afford to outsource, that is no longer self made. \nIf you can work 100 plus hours on your business, your entrepreneurship journey, how do you have time to do anything else?\nHave you tried working on a business while still trying to maintain a part time or full time job and have to take care of a household all on your own? The problem is, everyone tells you, you just have to work all day and night, just focus on your business. \nBut they never tell you the help they had. We are not made to make every decision on our own. I have a great example of a guy I knew that, even though he had a great support system that put him to the peak of his success, everything started crashing down when he stopped using his support system. \nIf you do not have a good support system, having no support system is better than a bad one. \nI’ve learned that trying to manage everything myself, I can’t do it alone. Now I’m learning how to outsource. I wish a “self made” entrepreneur would point this out in very simple words. \nThere is no such thing as self made. You can come up with an idea on your own, but the execution might not be great on your own. And if you want to grow your business, okay you’re saving money by doing it on your own, but time is money.

An accountant, if you are not paying attention to what they are doing, they can easily ruin your business. Especially at the early stages of a business. Starting a business is not for the weak. But anybody that has assisted you that you can focus on that business without minor or even huge everyday stress, that is significant help.\nI’m not saying that every single person has to get credit, but claiming self made gives people the illusion that they have to do everything on their own.\n“Because of my great team, I was able to focus on the big picture”\n“Because of my amazing partner who took care of the household, they were able to handle our everyday stressors and I could focus on providing for my family”\n“A family member left me inheritance money and I had enough cushion to focus on solely my business for six months without having to work a full time job”\n\n Nobody talks about the support system that got them there and if they did, I think there would be less failed businesses because they would get the proper channels to be successful.\n\nIt’s like a college football player or basketball player. If they suck at academics, they can’t play if they don’t have gpa right. So they have tutors for their classwork and coaches that help them with their game. How do you know if you’re getting better if someone from the sidelines doesn’t help you fix your game?\nEveryone looks at things different but I understand OPs frustration. And I think he’s also talking about big leagues like Jeff Bazos and Elon Musk.",

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.  \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch playing on myprize, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

The money risk is finite, but the mental load is constant because every decision feels like it could compound in the wrong direction. What seems to change over time is not the doubt disappearing, but your relationship to it. You start recognizing which decisions are reversible and which ones are not, and that alone lightens the pressure. Having some kind of external cadence helps too, like regular reviews or deadlines, so your brain does not spin endlessly. Loneliness is common because responsibility removes the feeling of being validated by default. Most people who stick with it learn to trust their process more than any single choice. The uncertainty never fully goes away, but it does get quieter once you see that most “wrong” decisions are survivable.",

There’s kind of two vectors that converge with entrepreneurial experience:\n\n1. You learn the methods the madness, coping with chaos, making the calls, techniques in intuition and creativity etc. And you get better at managing it all personally. Getting timing right. You learn from failures and learn even more from successes (success is where you get patterns you know work, and can now remix those patterns to the next thing).\n2. You learn how to make the chaos transform into insight and actual information about the product and businesses you are building. You learn things like pretotyping, lean startup, Osterwalder’s 3 fits, MVP, and a wealth of other ways to reduce your risk and accelerate your learning. And maybe most of all you learn that there’s this thing called the customer. Wonderful source of insight and knowledge on what works, what they are willing to pay for and how. Much of chaos goes away when you go to the customer with decisions you would need to make, and get their input on the choices. Or just use design thinking as a strategy: really listen to the customer, empathize with their situation, and learn heavy from it. Learn to ask questions like: “I have a legally binding purchase order here for my product, it’s 75,000$ would you sign it right now?” And when they don’t sign it, asking “what would it need to have to for you to sign it right now?” And then you listen very carefully what follows.\n\nThere’s even a literal science to this. People like Steve Blank / Harvard have cracked a lot of it. Alexander Osterwaldwer / IMD as well. Anyone can learn from these leading educators on how it’s done.",

I went through this exact same thing when I started my first business back in 2018 and it completely destroyed me because I had no idea it was coming. Like you, I had the money part figured out but the constant second-guessing and mental noise made me change directions every other week, miss meetings, and basically become unreliable to everyone including myself. What helped me eventually was realizing that the uncertainty never really goes away, but you can build systems to contain it. I started doing a daily scorecard where I track just 3-4 key things each day so I have concrete proof that I'm moving forward even when my brain is telling me I'm failing. Also started planning each day the night before and putting everything on my calendar instead of keeping endless to-do lists floating around in my head creating more anxiety.\n\n\n\nThe loneliness part is real too and having someone to bounce ideas off of, even if they can't give you definitive answers, makes a huge difference in staying sane through all the uncertainty.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

Nothing flashy, just something I thought could actually turn into a real business if I stayed consistent. I have some money saved up, so I wasn’t risking rent or groceries, which made me feel like I was being “responsible” about it.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was how much mental energy it would take. Every decision feels heavier than it should. Pricing, timing, whether I should launch now or wait, whether I’m overthinking or underthinking. I’ll make a choice, feel okay about it for a few hours, then start questioning if it was the wrong move.   \nThere are nights where I’m sitting on the couch scrolling on my phone, not even working, but my brain is still stuck on the business. Wondering if I should’ve done something differently that day, or if I’m already messing it up without realizing it. It’s not burnout exactly, more like this constant low-level pressure. The funny part is, when I talk to friends, they think it’s exciting. And it is, sometimes. But a lot of it just feels lonely and uncertain in a way I didn’t really anticipate. There’s no one to tell you “yes, this is correct” or “no, that’s a bad idea.”\n\nFor those of you who’ve been doing this longer, does that part ever get quieter or do you just get better at living with the uncertainty and trusting your own decisions?",

I just want something on paper before we get into the nitty gritty so I know you won't (sell my price list, secrets, try to undercut or cut me out, whatever.\"\n\nThen send them some bullshit doc with whatever you two talked about, but no real call to action.

Sheet, what's the best email?Who needs to receive that?\n\n\n* now they're assuming that i'm their vendor*\n\nSend price sheet...\n\nMake sure you take a look at that, because we're about fifty to sixty percent less than any other supplier you've ever used for these parts.\n\nI have a great day!\n\n*** ding ding ding ding, they know, i'm a salesperson, but they have my price sheet with pictures quantities and pricing right in front of them***\n\nDid he say fifty to sixty percent?That's bollshit....\n\nOhh wait it's not ...\n\nSold.\n\nThe only time I get their name as if they say no, they don't do the repairs.And then I get a referral from them.\n\nRemember they think i'm a truck driver looking for a repair. \n\nDo you know any shops in whooville or surrounding areas that do this repair??\n\n** they will usually ask, oh yes, sure, what direction are you coming from or where are you coming from **\n\nSome days I make myself memorize 2 cities and 2 directions. Just for practicing discipline. \n\nBob shop on fifth street is the best.That's who we send everyone to.\n\n\n*** great, thank you so much for your help.What was your name??***\n\n\nNow I call bob and I say, hey, bob sally over at huville truck repair said that you are the best at doing these repairs.Is that true?\nYes\nAwesome. I'm calling because I just showed them 50-60% saving on the parts you use, and sally said, I'd need to call you. Can I email this over?So when you get a chance, you can look at it later?\n\nYes....\n\nSold.\n\nI don't really give a shit what their name is or what their business name is or what city they're in or where they're located or any of that stuff. My job is to bring value to the marketplace period. It doesn't reward your wants, or needs it only rewards value.\n\nI care about.Do they use the widget that I sell?\n\nI know my widget is higher quality and it's half the price. It's a commodity I win. It's a shortcut to thinking not to use my product.Once you've seen that it's true.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -> mediation -> arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

If it's years with real IP I would fight.\n\nNext get a lawyer, I'm in the US so I don't understand swiss business culture or laws but that would be their job.\n\nIT sounds like either they don't understand/value technical contribution or there's more to this story and they have buyers remose for bringing in a cofounder and not hiring a developer.  Either way you have to put up a wall \"I achieved all technical tasks which is in the role of CTO if you were not satisfied with my performance in a business setting you should have asked sooner\".   Small note people tend to judge others based on their skillset \"well the CTO can't sell or network as well as me!\"  Which is probably true but that's not the CTO's role. I'm sure they can't code or architect software as well as you so it's not a fair comparison.\n\nGood luck. Take from this learning and lessons and move on.

Make use of professional legal services, a lawyer that represents your interests only. They can also have a lawyer. Don't share lawyers. This is a business matter, act as a professional.\n\n2.

Just like in 2008 I see there is this combination of loss of jobs and new startups launched, and this is expectable. In the next couple of years it will only speed up, we will see more solo founders, more people trying to launch a business, and more failure stories. What's different is the scale of making new things: it's so easy now to launch something small, not very data-savvy, and of course it needs AI in it.\n\nOversaturation is coming our way with a crazy speed, many founders price their services cheaper and cheaper, and we all know where it leads. Someone sees it works, repeats, sets the price lower.. It's like a downward spiral we are rapidly moving into.\n\nJust in the last couple of months I heard founders pith one and the same idea in different variations about 10+times, it starts looking like a \"Groundhog Day\" of ideas!\n\n  \nI am very excited about physical products and unsexy startups I'm advising, since at least they have a better chance to stay afloat. Especially devices, robotics, everything linked to meds / personal care, or even food. These have a better chance of a successful exit.\n\nJust Friday thoughts of an elderly person, would be glad to see what are your observations.",

I know this is an entrepreneurship subreddit so maybe raising capital is like \"a default path\", but, I hope that isn't the trend people are going for absolutely everything because it's a path to big money quickly... Why not just start selling it small around $1-$10 in a small website and take it from there? Well, I guess you'd have to do this as a side gig to your day job, where people raising capital may be doing nothing else besides this?\n\n\nWhen you say sell it, you mean sell it like I described or like when instagram sold to Facebook kind of selling?",

A race to the bottom for generic, easily copied offerings, and a smaller group that survives by being closer to real-world constraints, customers, or physical systems. That’s probably why unsexy and physical products feel more attractive right now. They’re harder to fake, harder to clone, and harder to undercut overnight.\n\nIt feels less like the end of entrepreneurship and more like the end of “easy” entrepreneurship.

I spent last year travelling, working from home, and I realized even with a 6-figure job as a machine learning engineer, I am not successful in my own eyes.\n\nOne thing that hit me hard is the fear of being too late. That's a heavy thing to carry, and I think a lot of people grinding quietly for their families feel it, but don't say it loud.\n\nSomething I've learned the hard way is that success doesn't show up all at once. its not a single moment where everything is okay. its usually messy and slow and mixed with doubt the whole way through. wanting to give your parents comfort already says a lot about your priorities.\n\nMy goal is to work hard this whole year, build my own apps and businesses from what I've learned working as a sales director to machine learning engineer, taking on freelancing projects, and to quit my job at the end of the year. I want to give my parents a lump sum of money at the end of the year so they can retire.\n\nGoodluck and I also hope this post will help someone out.",

We thought we were being smart.\n\nBut the result is that now the internet is just noise.\n\nI'm a solofounder. I don't have a marketing team. The logic says I should use these tools to compete with the big companies. But every time I try to scale my outreach, I just feel like I am polluting. The thing is, if you send 1000 emails and get 0 replies, you are not doing sales. You are just annoying people.\n\nI decided to stop with the extreme automation. It feels stupid to do this manually in 2026, checking forums one by one, reading comments, trying to find that specific person that has a problem today. It's slow. It feels like swimming against the current when everyone else is on a motorboat.\n\nBut when I actually find friction and I talk to the person, they answer. They answer because they realize there is a human on the other side, not a script.\n\nMaybe the \"big fish\" can afford to burn their reputation with spam. But as a small builder, trust is the only currency I have. If I lose that, I have nothing.\n\nJust a thought for those who are struggling to get their first users. Maybe the answer isn't a better tool. Maybe is just doing the work we are trying to avoid. ",

The thing is that if you could automate the proces of \"looking for\" the places, and start focusing more on \"how to join\", you'll be doing a better work. The same goes with AI.

      "text": "Everyone online keeps pushing the idea of passive income streams. But for someone like me who is doing a multi country ug programme @ tetr college and actually running a D2C brand, nothing feels passive. You’re constantly dealing with shipments, customers, suppliers, creatives, inventory, and tomorrow’s problems. Even when things look “stable,” your brain is still working in the background. There is no passive. There is only **active now** and **active later**. Most so-called passive income is just income where the hard work happened earlier. During the building phase, it’s never passive. The moment you stop paying attention, something breaks, ads drop, suppliers slip, customers churn, platforms change the rules. Honestly, the only income that comes close to being truly passive is rent from real estate, and even that isn’t fully hands-off unless you outsource everything. So I’m curious.\n\nIs there any other income that’s genuinely passive? Or are we just dressing up delayed effort with a nicer name? What do you think?",

Moreover, my mortgage is now paid +$800/mo while living in the building. I effectively have no living expenses, and all it took was 80 grand up front.

Everyone uses tools like Cursor and Windsurf and our engineering velocity has at-latest doubled if not tripped over the last 1 year without adding new members! So that's really cool!\n\nExternally, it has benefited us a lot as well since we bet on optimizing to get cited by LLMs and AI tools like ChatGPT early on and this has resulted in a lot of customers finding us via these tools! We noticed it's often easier to get cited here over traditional SEO since that landscape is super competitive and companies with the most money usually wins! We have been pretty successful at just setting up an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that finds questions are customers are already asking from our Google search console data and then automatically creating blogs that answer them on our website!\n\nCurious how it has impacted others tho :)",

It’s a small group of very human skills that compound over time.\n\nFirst is **learning how to learn**. Markets change, ideas fail, and assumptions break. Entrepreneurs who survive are the ones who can admit “I was wrong,” learn fast, and adjust without ego.\n\nSecond is **basic financial sense**. You don’t need to be an accountant, but you must understand cash flow, margins, and how long your money will last. Most businesses don’t die because of bad ideas but because of cash quietly runs out.\n\nThird is **selling and listening**. Not pitching listening. Real entrepreneurs hear what customers actually say, not what they hope to hear, and then shape the business around that.\n\nFourth is **emotional control**. Some days feel like you’re winning the world, some days like you’ve ruined your life. Being able to stay steady, make decisions without panic, and keep going matters more than motivation.\n\nAnd finally, **patience**. Overnight success is usually ten years of boring work. If you’re okay with slow progress and small wins, you’re already ahead of most people.\n\nYou can learn tools anytime. These skills take time but they’re what really carry you through.",

Your peers won’t understand your hustle . Some will Later despise you for getting ahead . the top is lonely . and even if you don’t consider yourself the top of whatever business you’re in , you can be at the top of your environment. \n-tech savy \n-most importantly, don’t let it consume you . Have a life outside of your business. Yes , you will be in a learning curve at the beginning, but don’t structure your business to where you are working at it every single day . You will burn out and start to hate what you do . The true perks of being an entrepreneur is making your own schedule , time freedom , and not having a boss to respond to . \n\nI feel like I’m rambling , lol but good luck to you !

A CRM, an email tool, a data provider, a couple automations glued together. At the time it felt fine, but as we grew it became obvious we were just stacking point solutions.\n\n\n\n  \nWe have since moved away from some of the early tools we picked and now rely more on workflows and orchestration. Tools like HubSpot stayed, some things like Apollo and Zapier got reduced or removed, and we started using Clay for research, enrichment, and tying data together. What tools did you start with, what did you outgrow, and what are you using now? Always looking to improve",

HubSpot for CRM, Scippa App for lead data, Instantly for email.

I do believe that a good roadmap of how you project the business to look in the future helps with things like this, because you're able to incorporate and use these systems (whichever system you prefer) at a level of \"I'm building this now and I know it is going to grow and I will add these in the future.  Let me make sure I get a system to handle the future vision.\"  Nothing's worse than those hour-long calls, and days wasted transitioning from system to system.",

Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary & Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs & Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Ecco tre casi d'uso 'brutali' che ogni founder dovrebbe implementare:\n\n1. **Il Grill della validazione H24:** Usa l'IA per simulare migliaia di interazioni con il tuo target e trovare i **'Fatal Flaws'** (difetti letali) del tuo modello di business prima ancora di scrivere una riga di codice.\n2. **Eliminazione della 'Lussuria dello spreco':** Esistono tool di IA che analizzano il tuo burn rate e le tue spese operative identificando istantaneamente il 'Lusso dello spreco'. Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri.

          "text": "Yeah, AI is genuinely a really useful tool for business right now. When it’s used correctly, it can bring a lot of value. Here are a few use cases I think are helpful for almost any business:\n\n1. Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

My dad is a CS major, saw lots of people coming from oversees to fill in  roles alongside himself and he ended up working on government contracts where you needed a security clearance. That is a solid option (and may need to relocate to the dc area). Accounting has a pipeline issue and it’s two fold: the job has not been attractive for young people because it’s not glamorous, lots of hours and not as well paid as other finance type and CS roles. I say do an externship to learn more about what the roles look like and what they are trending to be in the future. CS has broader applicability in my mind but accounting is a fundamental set of concepts. If there is an IT type of major offering in your program do that with accounting. My school was starting to add some data analysis and IT adjacent majors when I was in undergrad which was about 10 years ago. Good luck!!",

It’s frustrating when the basics take more effort than the high-tech stuff everyone’s hyped about, but having the right support can save you headaches, and money in the long run.",

The task is so grueling that only the most successful firms do it.\n\nThe areas of accounting, legal, compliance, and operations may not be glamorous, but they’re essential. Individuals do not purchase them like software; they buy when the software is broken or risky. This generates both urgency and payment readiness.\n\nMost founders ironically chase novelty instead of friction. It’s a fun build Vibe AI. Attracting a reply from a human accountant is a not very fun, pricey problem; which is precisely why it’s so valuable.\n\nService bottlenecks are often a precursor to good products. It is also important to note this. If professionals are overloaded and unreachable, there’s usually room for alteration.\n\n\\* Improved assessment and prioritization.\n\n\\* More specific focus.\n\n\\* Workflows with Async First approach\n\n\\* More Detail in Scope and Pricing\n\nWe don’t always have to go AI-first.\n\n At times, merely being \\*\\*reliable\\*\\* in an otherwise chaotic market is all the opportunity one may need.\n\nThe unglamorous things keep winning quietly.",
