Like a, \"Oh no - this guy sounds pretty good. We might lose him\" was a subconscious thought when you started mentioning how you wouldn't be a good fit. \n\n\nPlus, when you downplay it some people just love to prove others wrong and be right. In this scenario - he wanted to prove you wrong about being a bad fit. \n\n\nThen again, he could've just been a friendly guy, he liked that you were friendly too and y'all got along. That's 99% of the battle. His stack can be learned but hiring someone new you basically have a crap shoot of their personality. And being on the train with you, he got to test that side out and he liked what he saw. A lot of hires happen like this from networking",

The more options they have, the more powerful this is. Also great with higher-ticket deals where the buyer expects to be sold hard.\n\n  \nWhen to skip it: early stage prospects who barely know what they need yet. If someone is still figuring out the problem, telling them they might not be a fit just gives them permission to leave. They need education first, not a challenge.\n\n  \nThe balance question is the right one to ask. What worked for me was being specific about WHY they might not be a fit, not just vaguely saying \"we're not for everyone.\" Like \"honestly, if your team isn't ready to change their current workflow, this won't help you.\" That way you're filtering for real fit, not just playing a psychology trick.

Shorter sales cycles, fewer scope disputes, higher retention.\n\nThe key distinction: this only works when you actually mean it. If you're disqualifying prospects you'd happily take, people sense the manipulation. The magic is having genuine criteria for who you work best with and being transparent about it.\n\nWhen not to use it: early-stage when you need every dollar to survive. You need some financial stability to walk away from bad fits. But once you have that cushion, being selective is one of the highest-leverage things you can do for both revenue and sanity.",

The anti-selling approach works because people are so burned out on aggressive sales tactics that genuine helpfulness stands out like a lighthouse in a storm.\n\nI have been doing something similar in the B2B space - instead of pitching our service directly, we write detailed guides about how to solve the problem ourselves (DIY). Sounds counterintuitive but it does two things:\n\n1. Builds massive trust because you are clearly not desperate\n2. People who read the DIY guide and realize it is too complex for them come back and pay you to do it\n\nThe confused part makes sense though. It feels wrong because every business book tells you to \"always be closing\". But closing is what you do at the end. Most people try to close before they have earned the right to ask for money.\n\nWhat is your conversion rate looking like vs your old approach?",

In that moment they gave you better product insight than any survey or feedback form ever would. They told you their exact pain, in their words, with real urgency. That's gold.\n\n  \nThink about what happened: instead of you saying \"here's what our product does,\" the customer said \"here's why I need this.\" The information flow reversed. And the information going the other direction - customer to you - is always more valuable than your pitch going the other way.\n\n  \nThe question of when to use it comes down to whether you're selling to people who already know they have the problem. If they reached out to you, they know. Anti-selling just makes them articulate it clearly. If you're cold outreach, they might not know they have the problem yet, and anti-selling gives them an easy exit.",

I tracked every call this month and the data tells a clear story.\n\nOut of 820 dials, I got 124 connects which is about 16 percent connect rate. Of those connects, 32 turned into real conversations over 3 minutes. And 12 of those became booked meetings.\n\nThe math breaks down to roughly 72 calls per meeting. Not amazing, but profitable when your deal size is right.\n\nHere's what I learned about openers this month. I tested three different approaches across roughly equal call volumes. The pattern interrupt opener where I said something unexpected like \"Hey this is a cold call, you can hang up but give me 18 seconds first\" got 30 percent to stay on the line past 30 seconds. The permission-based opener where I asked \"Did I catch you at a bad time\" got 22 percent. The direct pitch where I immediately explained why I was calling got only 14 percent.\n\nThe pattern interrupt felt awkward at first but the data was clear. People appreciate honesty about what's happening.\n\nOn timing, I found that Tuesday through Thursday between 10 AM and 11:30 AM had the highest connect rates at 19 percent. Monday mornings were brutal at 9 percent. Friday afternoons were dead at 5 percent. I stopped calling Fridays after lunch entirely.\n\nThe biggest insight was about follow-up after missed calls. I left 310 voicemails. Got 7 callbacks. That's barely 1 percent. But when I stopped leaving voicemails and instead sent a quick LinkedIn message within 5 minutes of the missed call, I got 22 responses from 156 attempts. That's 14 percent. The multi-touch approach crushed voicemail-only.\n\nMy current approach is to call, if no answer send immediate LinkedIn connection with a note referencing the call, then follow up with email the next day. This three-channel approach within 24 hours gets way better results than any single channel alone.\n\nThe psychology behind why this works is simple. People are busy. They miss calls all the time. But when they see the same person tried to reach them through multiple channels, it signals importance. It also creates familiarity. By the time they see your email, they've already seen your name twice.\n\nThe reps on my team who adopted this approach saw their meeting rates increase by 37 percent within the first month. The ones who stuck to single-channel calling stayed flat.\n\nCold calling works but it's not about the call anymore. It's about how the call fits into a larger sequence. The phone is the start of the conversation, not the whole thing.\n\nIf you're still measuring success by calls made, you're missing the point. Measure conversations started across all channels. That's what actually predicts revenue.",

The woman got straight to the point. It came as a little shock at first but she asked me 2 or 3 simple questions and I answered. I didn’t need the product and the last question was, am I interested. I said no and she hung up with a simple goodbye. After the call, I was convinced it was a bot. I also realised it didn’t annoy me like a sales call usually does but that might have been due to the fact that it was new and surprised me. I’m sure getting 10 of these calls a day would be annoying. I need to make cold calls for my business and I avoid it like the plague. I know it’s the game but when I know how much it annoys me, I can’t do it to others. I think I might have to look more into the AI bot thing for my own business.",

But even now, cold calls arent highly effective (as tracked close rate percentages always demonstrate) and they will never not be abrasive. I think they key to using calls to generate business requires a clever and effective sales/marketing hybrid approach that qualifies leads and generates consultative, warm-calls. The more of these your firm generates, the more calls your sales team can make. More criticaly, instead of knowing nothing about them, salespeople can act as a guide (and a catalyst) towards finding solutions your firm offers that help with your prospect's challenges. \n\nThe corporate avg is typically stated that around 5% of cold calls generate revenue (or so my last couple employers used to state) Thus, old school mentality was to get your sales to call, call, call!! To me, that just meant 95% of my time (and later, my team's time) was inefficiently spent. Later, as VP of Sales, I arranged to regularly collaborate with marketing and product to ensure our solutions were getting in front of the right eyes, the product regularly evolved to meet or exceed expectations and our sales team was then getting warm leads to follow up as helpful consultants and not high-pressure closers. Getting the process to a place where it became truly effective took time (about 6mo) with much back and forth. Along the way we discovered roadblocks in all areas, marketing, sales and product which we then tweaked and refined. Ultimately we grew flat sales to +35% (Year 1) and +45% (year 2). \n\nCold calling is a blunt-force approach and DOES have its place in the very early days but, this should rather quickly be evolved around a more strategic business plan to capture new customers and revenue. \n\n",

Most of these companies are run by skilled tradespeople who are great at the work but terrible at consistent follow-up. The ones who figure out predictable lead flow scale fast because the bottleneck is almost never the service quality, it's the pipeline.\n\nCurious about your tech stack for this. Are you running SMS campaigns through something like Twilio or using a platform, and are you building the automation yourself or using off-the-shelf tools? The margin difference between those two approaches is massive at scale.\n\nAlso, one thing I've seen work well for local service lead gen: once you nail the playbook for one vertical (say pressure washing), the same system usually transfers to adjacent verticals with minimal tweaking. Landscaping, HVAC, roofing. The outreach mechanics are nearly identical, just different keywords and seasonal patterns. That's where the real compounding happens.",

Most people talk about 'hustle' as a choice; you treated it as oxygen because it was your way back to life.\n\nIn my 35 years in business and 15 years mentoring hundreds of founders, I’ve seen that the hardest pivot isn't the one you make with your product, but the one you make with your life. You’ve conquered the hardest part: the Internal Validation.\n\nHowever, coming from my book 'Startup Inferno,' I must give you a word of caution as you scale. You are currently in the stage of 'The Hero’s Grit.' You generated $127k through pure willpower. But as you look to grow, you need to move from being the 'Motor' to being the 'Architect.'\n\nUsing the Curling analogy: right now, you are throwing the stone and sweeping the ice with everything you have. To reach the next level, you need to build a Structure (systems and lead-gen flows) that works even when you take a breath. You’ve proven you can survive; now it’s time to prove you can build a legacy that doesn't depend solely on your daily adrenaline.\n\nKeep building with that same 'stubborn hope.' The world needs more founders who have real scars.\n\nNow that you’ve mastered the 'hustle,' what is the first system you are building to ensure this business remains a source of freedom rather than a new type of cage?",

You may get some quick wins, but don't be lulled into thinking that's every day. \n2. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself.  It's the smartest thing you can do. \n3. Practice self-care. Entrepreneurship requires every bit of you. Every single day. (And most nights.) Exercise. Eat well. Meditate. Rest. The basics. But you have to do them better, than most other people, just to keep moving forward. Do not underestimate this. \n\nP.S. I did spend a few years working for other companies. But they simply taught me what I did not want to do. \n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n \n\n ",

Especially in the early days, it is so easy to feel like you are a failure just because a launch failed or growth is slow (feeling this now!). I have to constantly remind myself; especially now that I'm back in university and building a startup simultaneously, that the business is an experiment, not a judgment on my character. :)\n\nIf I tie my self-worth to the MRR graph, I’m on an emotional roller coaster I can’t survive (I feel).

But the businesses that actually scaled were the ones where I stepped back and asked \"how can I make this repeatable without me?\"\n\nDocumenting processes felt like a waste of time when I was busy. But once I had systems in place, I could delegate, I could take a real vacation, and honestly the business ran better without me micromanaging every detail.\n\nThe other thing I'd add: Get comfortable with saying no. Every opportunity looks good when you're hungry. But chasing every shiny object dilutes your focus and burns your energy. Learning to say \"that's interesting but it's not aligned with where I'm going\" was a game changer.\n\nCurious what your thoughts are on delegation vs doing it yourself. I struggled with that for years because I thought no one could do it as well as me. Spoiler: I was wrong.",

The job comes with a free apartment so I don’t have to worry about rent or utilities. However, I don’t really know what to do with my income. I save almost all of it and I feel like I’m just wasting potential. I’d like to start a business, but I don’t know what or where. Plus the job is so easy that I’m able to finish my entire work in less than three hours. I have so so much time that I could be putting towards an online business. There are so many scams on the Internet about get rich quick schemes and I’m not looking for that. There was a lady on Instagram that wanted me to pay her 5K for some sales tips BS. Thank God I didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t want to be in property management/real estate the rest of my life. It’s extremely boring and there’s no passion in it. In about two months I’m going to start aesthetician school and that will take me about seven months to complete. The goal is to be able to open up my own beauty salon one day. However, I’d like to start a business in e-commerce or something that I can work from home to get more passive income. I know that I am blessed to be in the position that I am however, I am incredibly bored with what I’m doing now.\n\nI keep seeing people online open up online businesses and they’re able to quit their 9 to 5 and travel all over the world. This has been a dream of mine.\n\nIf anyone has advice or tips for me, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Better than losing your money to something you don't understand.\n\n\nHere's the easiest investment you can make:\n\n\n- Open up a Roth IRA with Fidelity or Vanguard.\n\n\n- Also open up a regular taxable brokerage account with either.\n\n\n- Add the maximum amount of money for the year to your Roth IRA ($7500 for 2026).\n\n\n- Buy a target date retirement fund for roughly the year you'd like to retire (Vanguard VTTSX-2060 or VFIFX-2050, Fidelity FFFHX-2050 or FDKLX-2060).\n\n\n- Repeat the same with your taxable brokerage account. Put in as much money as you want, buy the same fund.\n\n\n- Keep adding money to the funds as often as you want. For the Roth, you can't put in more than $7500/year, but no limits on the brokerage. Buy nothing else. You can literally just keep adding money to the exact same target date funds and never do anything else.\n\n\n- Target date funds invest everything for you. They buy and sell various stocks and bonds and they rebalance based on how close you are to retirement. When you're young, they'll have more money in stocks and move away from them as you get older. The beauty though is you do nothing, just keep adding money to them.\n\n\nThat's it. Congratulations you will outperform almost all other investors.",

Put it in a good S&P 500 index fund.\n\nEvery year, there's a set amount that you're legally able to contribute to an IRA (individual retirement account). Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, your bank, or whatever preferred platform you want to use. Roth IRAs tax the money when it goes in, not when it comes out at or after age 65. That's best, because it gets taxed before the balance grows, so you pay less. Again, put it into an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nMax out your 401(k) contribution up to the amount that your employer will match, either total or partial. Again, allocate it to an index fund.\n\nAfter that, the easiest thing to do is to put the remaining chunk that you want to invest into an index fund through Fidelity or similar.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't invest in anything other than index funds unless you're really hardcore, and even then, it probably isn't worth it lol",

But working in property management for over seven years, it’s kind of killed my spirit. People are incredibly mean and rude and I get blamed for every single thing that happens. I guess the most I could do is buy properties and hire a manager to take care of them. I don’t know, not really something I’m looking forward to.",

It will be a great chance to learn about that business and see what you might want to do. Maybe it is the salon, like you said. Or maybe the supply business is interesting, since that involves travel to lots of different places to share your product. Or maybe you want to get into solely event work, like weddings, and you make a company for that. Or perhaps it is in a different field entirely.\n\nDon't do anything except learn--especially about stuff that seems boring. Accounting. Taxes. Employee law. Business plans.

There are some weeks that it’s extremely slow and other weeks that are extremely busy and I have to work the full eight hours. A couple days out of the month I need to go out in the field and meet with vendors and inspect the properties. I have meetings too. The post was very general about my job. About 70% of the time it’s from home and the rest is out in the field. The company I work for is amazing and the owner of the company is not a greedy asshole. He is so generous with all of his employees. At our Christmas parties this dude hands out wads of cash. And he’s put many employees through school and invested in them. Almost all of the employees have been here for over 15 years. All of us know that we are extremely lucky to be a part of his business. He’s truly one of a kind.

              "text": "Aww I’m sorry 😞 \nwanna hear something crazy? About a year ago I had one of my maintenance worker quit due to health reasons and his age.. His job title was to clean three properties. He would start at 8 AM and be done by 1 PM latest. Just picking up trash and making sure the property was clean. That’s it. And 80% of the time the properties were always clean because people pick up after themselves. So the dude would get to go home early if he was finished. And since he lived on site at one of the properties, we gave him a huge discount on his rent. About $800 off. And I believe the position paid $19 an hour (not great, but not bad either for the little work you do). Well, my cousin‘s girlfriend was looking for a job and she lives with my cousin at one of the properties I manage. They currently pay about $2000 for a one bedroom one bath.\n\nI told her that he quit and that she should apply immediately with my company. At the time, she wasn’t working and was looking for a job. She could definitely benefit from the rental discount PLUS, she could be done with work at 1 PM and the rest of the day could be spent doing something else or another part-time job... Well, she never took me up on that offer. And now she’s working 12 hour shifts at T-Mobile making minimum wage. I don’t understand how someone could turn down an $800 rental discount plus the decent pay. She never even told me why she didn’t want the job. She would just say “oh okay” any time I’d mention it. I even told her that there was plenty of opportunity for her to move up in the company. And I was right. A couple months later, one of our leasing agents quit and the position was available. I would’ve been able to train her and the job would’ve been hers. Knowing the owner, he would’ve allowed me to train her.",

A few thoughts: First, don't rush into e-commerce just because it looks glamorous online - most successful online businesses take 12-18 months to become profitable. Since you're starting aesthetician school, consider digital services that complement that path - maybe skincare consulting, beauty content creation, or even a beauty subscription box. Your property management background actually gives you valuable operational skills that most beauty entrepreneurs lack. Start small with something that leverages your existing knowledge while you're in school. The key is picking ONE thing and validating demand before you invest heavily. Those Instagram 'gurus' prey on people in exactly your situation - you're smart to avoid them.",

          "text": "Hello. Im a business owner. I’m also 32. It sounds like you haven’t been making $9k/month for very long. \n\nIf I had to start over from your position this is what I would do. \n\nKeep your expenses low. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing as long as you can. Save up $150k-$250k or as close to it as you can. It’s gonna take you about 4 years. Based on your line of questioning, you may have shiny object syndrome. The “business” is the shiny object. If you can’t save up that amount in 4 years at $9k/month then take a look at your lifestyle and budget better to save money wherever possible. Live on $50k and invest $50k into the S&P or some index per year. \n\nFor now, don’t try to start a salon business from scratch. Buy one that’s already profitable with the money you save up. But don’t cash out your investments, use it as collateral to buy the business. Go do your own research for buying a business, seller financing is popular these days.\n\nBefore you buy a beauty salon, get a job in one to learn how it works. Buy one that’s been profitable for a good enough time frame, for me that would be 5 years minimum. \n\nThe reason you buy one is because it’s gonna cost you a lot to start up, and a lot of time and risk. If you get into the business and you find out that it’s not for you, you can sell it and get your money back because it was a profitable asset when you bought it.\n\nI was taught this by a former client who buys businesses, holds them, and sells them, for a living. Personally, I wish I took that route. It would’ve saved me a lot of pain and tears. Goodluck.",

      "text": "So I wasted like 3.5 years trying every productivity system. Bought some $150 Notion template from a YouTuber (embarrassing). Did the whole Todoist thing, Obsidian, bullet journals, all of it.\n\nBasically I wasn't actually working. Just organizing my work and feeling productive about organizing. Being busy doesnt equal getting important shit done.\n\nEvery morning id open whatever app and see like 40+ tasks, spend 20 minutes moving shit around and color coding it. Then do one easy task and call it a day. The actual important stuff? Always \"tomorrow\"\n\nI had 40 tasks every day. Would finish maybe 1. The other 39 just sitting there judging me. Way too many to even know where to start so I'd just pick whatever seemed easiest.\n\nThe list was the whole problem.\n\nSo i said fuck it and deleted everything, every app, every so called productivity tool. Bought a small whiteboard from around the corner.\n\nMade one rule: only what fits on here matters today. That's it.\n\nWrote 3 tasks. Not 40. Just the 3 actual important things I need to do to get closer to my goals. Things that can actually be done in a workday.\n\nWith only a few realistic tasks, you can't hide anymore. With 40 tasks theres always an excuse like \"oh ill do that big one after i knock out these 5 quick things\" but with 3? You either do them or you dont and you know it.\n\nWhen I finished something I'd get up, walk over, cross it off with this red marker. It stayed there all day with the line through it. Could actually see what i did. Which gives me some validation that I am moving forward.\n\nThis worked amazing! No anxiety, no busyness. Just getting shit done.\n\nMy buddy came over and just started reading my tasks out loud. \"Yo whats this project about?\" Just reading my whole board.\n\nSame thing on video calls, people asked about the whiteboard behind me, trying to read it.\n\nAnd I work from home so its in my living space. In the evening trying to get a clear head and my tasks are right there staring at me.\n\nBut i couldn't hide it because seeing it was the entire point. That was the whole system.\n\nSo I got this idea, what if it just flips. One side is the whiteboard for tasks. Other side is just clean wood that actually looks good on a wall without office vibes. No art needed, just nice & clean looking surface.\n\nTook me forever to figure out how to make it light enough to actually flip easily and stick with magnetic fixation. Tried a bunch of materials that were either too heavy or looked like crap. Went through like 10 different prototypes. Tested several concepts, some worked great but i just didnt like them aesthetically so i moved on until something clicked.\n\nReal lesson tho is 3 tasks you actually finish beats 40 tasks you organize and never do. Less isnt limiting its just focus. Being busy doesnt always equals getting shit done.\n\nObviously this is the polished version. There were a LOT of ups and downs in between.",

They make you feel busy without making progress on anything that matters. When you only have 3 things, you cant hide behind \"oh ill do the hard one after these quick wins\" because there are no quick wins to hide behind.\n\n  \nThe physical aspect is key too. Something about writing by hand and physically crossing things off hits different than checking a box in an app. I think its because digital tools are too forgiving. You can drag, snooze, reschedule, archive. A whiteboard just stares at you.\n\n  \nThe privacy problem you ran into is interesting too and honestly a good sign. It means the system is visible enough to actually hold you accountable. Thats the whole point. The flip mechanism sounds like a clean solution to that.\n\n  \nCurious how many prototypes you went through before landing on the magnetic fixation. Hardware iteration cycles are brutal compared to software where you can ship a fix in minutes.",

Max 5 applications per day but make them count. Customize each one.\n\n2. Use tools that remove the busywork. I use Sprout which autofills applications and tailors resumes with AI but lets me review everything before submitting. Saves like 30 min per app.\n\n3. Track what gets responses, not what you send. If a role type never replies, stop applying there.\n\n4. Keep it simple. I used a basic spreadsheet with just company, role, status. No fancy automations.\n\nOrganizing = productivity is a trap.

You're categorizing, prioritizing, color-coding, and at the end of the day you've produced nothing but a prettier task list.\n\nI run a dev company and we had the same problem at the team level. Sprint planning sessions that took half a day, Jira boards with 200 tickets, elaborate story point systems. We stripped it back to a simple rule: every morning, each person writes down the one thing that moves the project forward today. Not three things. One. If they finish early, great, pick another. But the first thing on the list is the thing that actually matters.\n\nOutput went up noticeably within the first two weeks. Turns out when you remove the illusion of choice, people stop debating what to work on and just start working.\n\nYour whiteboard approach is the physical version of the same principle.

You set a deletion timer for a thought/task and have to refresh it each day if it stays important to your goals. For me it'd be about 7 days. I'd dump my ideas into the journal, rank them by importance, then recall them using auto fill (app would keep record of 7 days of blurbs). If I didn't think about it again for 7 days, it would be deleted and gone forever. Naturally, important tasks and ideas would rise to the top and enter working memory, and I wouldn't have the latent anxiety that I was forgetting something important. ",

Not because the interviews give you a perfect roadmap, but because they reveal assumptions you didn't even know you were making.\n\nOne thing I'd add to your list: pay attention to what people are currently doing to solve the problem, not just whether they say they'd use your product. If they're cobbling together spreadsheets, emailing themselves reminders, or paying for some clunky workaround, that's real signal. If they just nod and say \"yeah that sounds cool,\" that's politeness, not validation.\n\nThe other expensive lesson I learned: the MVP doesn't need to be software. We've shipped validation tests with landing pages, manual processes behind the scenes, and even just a well-written email describing the solution. If people won't engage with a rough version, they definitely won't engage with a polished one. Glad you came out the other side with something profitable. That second run is always sharper.",

Be genuine, not salesy. Something like \"Hey, I'm researching [problem]. Would you be open to a 15 minute chat? No pitch, just trying to understand the space better.\"\n\nLinkedIn works well too, especially for B2B. Filter by job title and industry, then send connection requests with a short note about your research.\n\nThe other underrated move is posting in relevant communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack groups) asking people to share their experience with the problem. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to talk when you frame it as learning, not selling.\n\nStart with 5. Once you get comfortable with the format, the next 25 come much easier.",

          "text": "I am starting my journey too \n\nI wasn’t always confident.\n I’ve been shy for most of my life. I turned 18 last December, and the person I am today is the result of a series of experiences that shaped how I think, work, and make decisions.\nAs a child, I was mischievous. My parents worried about where that energy would take me, so they sent me to a hostel for my development. That decision changed my life. Living away from home at a young age forced me to learn how to survive on my own, how to socialize, and how systems work when you’re not protected by comfort.\nThe hostel environment exposed me to power dynamics early. Bullying existed. Seniors used power for entertainment. We were forced into situations where we had to fight our own friends or do things just to avoid being targeted. It showed me how fragile people can be under pressure, and how easily power can be misused. Those years taught me how authority works in the real world and what kind of authority I never want to become.\nI stayed in the hostel from Class 3 to Class 5. When I returned home in Class 6, I realized I didn’t think like most people my age. My thinking patterns were different. My maturity didn’t match my age group. That gap stayed with me.\nThen the pandemic hit, and with it came one of the hardest phases of my life. I lost my grandmother without being there to see her for the last time. I had the option to go, but I chose differently. That decision left me with guilt I still carry. The weight of that period pushed me into isolation. I escaped into online games and distractions, trying not to sit with what I was feeling.\nAfter lockdown, I joined another hostel for a new school. This time, I was the senior. The difference was simple. I did not repeat what was done to me. I chose not to use power the way I had experienced it. I focused on helping juniors in studies, decision making, and personal growth. That was the first time I consciously decided the kind of leader I wanted to become.\nThat phase is where my self development started seriously. I began exercising. I started reading. The first book I picked up was Atomic Habits, and it changed how I approached my life. I went from nearly failing to becoming a top three student. By Class 10, I had read extensively on psychology, communication, and business. I was actively working on my mindset, discipline, and character.\nClass 10 was also when I discovered entrepreneurship properly. Before that, I thought entrepreneurship only meant building big companies. Watching Iman Ghazi’s self development content became a turning point. In hostel, we only had phone access twice a week. I used that time to study his content and spent the rest of the week applying what I learned. I could see real changes in how I thought and acted. Later, I learned he was running a business. That is when I realized building something of your own was not just about companies. It was about ownership over your life.\nAfter Class 10, I returned home for Classes 11 and 12. That phase was unstable. Poor choices and lack of discipline led to wasted time. I went from being a top three student to losing consistency. My boards are now just days away. I do not feel fully prepared, but I will get through them.\nWhat has not changed is clarity about my potential. After my boards, I am moving out. Not for college, but to build. I have saved enough to support myself for one year. That one year is fully dedicated to starting my own venture. This is not impulsive. I have been thinking about this path for years. It is a new beginning, and while there is fear, there is also certainty about what needs to be done.\nI am not chasing money for the sake of it. I have been clear about my field for around four years now. I am serious about the work. I do not come from privilege. I come from a lower middle class family. My father’s job is enough to sustain a living. Nothing more, nothing less. I do not have a safety net of cafes, luxury setups, or lifestyle content before success. I have discipline, clarity, and the willingness to build from zero.\nCollege and a job are common paths. They are not the only ones. I am choosing to try building something of my own. This is my bet on myself.",

One thing I wish I'd done better was monitor what people were actually saying about the problem space online before we built. Like not just interviews but seeing where the pain showed up naturally in reddit threads or twitter. We built based on our own experience as engineers which helped, but there were adjacent problems people were screaming about that we missed entirely.\n\nThese days I use hazelbase to track conversations in my company's space. Honestly wish something like that existed back then because just manually lurking in subreddits is time consuming as hell, but you learn a ton about what people actually struggle with vs what they say in a customer interview.",

I was so focused on building the “right” solution that I assumed the problem was obvious and shared by others. Turns out it wasn’t. What hurt the most wasn’t losing money, it was realizing how long I avoided talking to real users because I thought feedback would slow me down.\n\nThe biggest lesson for me was that momentum without validation is just expensive motion. Talking to people early feels uncomfortable, but it saves you from months of false confidence. Your point about prioritizing sales and feedback over perfection is spot on. A rough product with real users teaches you more in weeks than a polished one sitting unused.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this honestly.

We've closed over $1M in contracts in roughly 2 years. The average deal is around $100K, and the lifetime client value sits around $350K as they re-up.\n\nHere's the thing: almost all of that came from me and my network. Every time we've tried to bring on a salaried salesperson, it's been the same story. Pay them for months, they don't close anything, and we're out a chunk of cash we could've reinvested into the business. It's happened multiple times now, and honestly, it's one of the most frustrating parts of scaling.\n\nSo we shifted our thinking. We put together what I think is a solid commission structure:\n\n* 10% on the initial downpayment\n* 5% on all recurring revenue from their clients\n* 30% of anything sold above our base proposal (so if we quote $100K and they close at $130K, they keep 30% of that $30K)\n\nWe'd also cover conference tickets and events since that's a big part of how deals happen in this space.\n\nOn a typical deal, that's around $10K upfront with recurring income over the client's lifetime. Not bad for someone who knows how to sell and doesn't need their hand held.\n\nBut I genuinely cannot figure out where to find people who are actually good at sales AND willing to work commission. Every platform I've tried is either flooded with people who want a base salary no matter what, or with people who talk a big game but don't deliver.\n\nFor those of you who've been in a similar spot, where did you actually find your salespeople? Did commission only work for you, or did you just bite the bullet and keep paying salaries until someone stuck? Also open to hearing if my comp structure is off, always willing to adjust.\n\nAppreciate any insight. This is the one piece of the puzzle I haven't figured out yet.",

The problem is that selling custom software is fundamentally different from selling a product. Your prospects need someone who can talk architecture, understand scope, and build trust around technical competence. A traditional salesperson can't do that.\n\nWhat worked for us was treating sales as a partnership function, not a hire. We found two channel partners (an agency and a consulting firm) who already had relationships with the types of clients we serve. They bring us into conversations when a client needs custom dev work, and we give them a referral cut. No salary risk, no ramp-up time, and the leads come pre-qualified because the partner already has trust.\n\nYour commission structure looks reasonable, but I'd add one thing: make sure whoever you bring on has genuine technical literacy. They don't need to code, but they need to understand enough to have a credible conversation about what you build and why it matters. That's the filter most dev shops miss.",

It sounds like your past hires were set up to fail.\n\nSimilarly, what kind of tools are you using? What does your lead gen look like? I'd guess that it's minimal, and frankly, most of what's out there is more product-oriented anyway. It's hard to build momentum in your space, I did it for a decade.\n\nI'd focus on referrals for now.

Off the back of the workshop the client receives detailed documents of what they want to build. It’s a recommended architecture, feature and design doc. They see what they get in their MVP and their roadmap. You would essentially do a version of this when they sign up anyway but by doing it as a separate product there’s a low cost and low friction step that provides real value. Technically they can shop the doc to get quotes on the build but no one ever did because the relationship is built and they’re already in motion (especially now days when you have a tool like Figma make that can punch out a prototype in a few minutes and include mock UIs in the workshop doc 🤯). For sales people their close rate went up exponentially because they weren’t selling $100k build which will normally need several people to sign off on instead they were selling a $5-$10k workshop which usually only needs one person to sign off on.

          "text": "The reason you keep losing money on salaried salespeople is that government/enterprise software sales has a long cycle and a very specific skillset. Most salespeople who apply to small shops are used to selling something with a shorter close and an established brand behind them. They flounder when they have to open doors from scratch in a niche like SDVOSB contracting.\n\n  \nYour commission structure is actually solid for someone who understands the space. The problem is where you are looking. A few things that have worked for other small shops in similar positions:\n\n  \n1. Look for retired or semi-retired government contracting officers or program managers. These people have the rolodex and understand procurement, but they are done with full-time work. Commission-only or part-time with commission is perfect for them. Try AFCEA chapter events, local GovCon meetups, and LinkedIn groups specifically for SDVOSB/8a contractors.\n\n  \n2. Partner with other small SDVOSB shops that do complementary work (cybersecurity, cloud infra, data analytics). You refer them your overflow, they refer you theirs. No salesperson needed for those deals, just relationship management.\n\n  \n3. If you want a dedicated seller, consider a hybrid: small base (even $2-3K/month) plus your commission structure. The base signals that you are serious and filters out the dreamers. The good ones will earn way more from commission anyway. $2-3K/month is cheap insurance against another wasted hire.\n\n  \n4. Your $100K average deal with $350K LTV is a strong story. Lead with that when recruiting. A salesperson closing even 3 deals a year at your structure would earn $30K+ in commissions plus recurring. Make sure your pitch to salespeople is as polished as your pitch to clients.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that pure commission-only is a red flag for top sales talent because they have options. The people willing to work 100% commission with no base tend to be either very confident or very desperate, and the ratio skews toward the latter.",

That kind of trust transfer takes years to build, not months.\n\nThe commission-only or hybrid model is the right direction, but the pool of people who can sell $100K+ technical services AND are willing to work on commission is extremely small. The good ones already have established books of business and are not browsing job boards.\n\nWhat has worked for similar shops I know: instead of hiring salespeople, they turned their existing team into a sales channel. Engineers writing about their work, speaking at conferences, being active in communities where government procurement people and CTOs hang out. Slower but the close rate is dramatically higher because the buyer is talking to the person who will actually build their system.\n\nThe SDVOSB advantage is also worth leaning into harder. There are procurement officers who actively need to fill set-aside quotas. Building direct relationships with those specific people is often more productive than any cold outreach campaign.",

Let them go after 3 months and $15k in lost salary payments and had a serious think about why it didn’t work. Here’s my thoughts.\n\n1. I was expecting a sales person to build out sales infrastructure when they were expecting just to close deals. We didn’t have a big enough pipeline to have a sales person so the bulk of their work would have been just building that and that wasn’t their skill.\n\n2. I didn’t have a clear enough offer / product. Well this one is a bit challenging because I do, and we are bringing in close to 1M each year in business so it’s obviously working. But we don’t run ads / have a fixed price list / etc etc so it was difficult for the sales person to articulate.\n\n3. They didn’t know very much about the service that we offered and so couldn’t really understand the need for it. That made them fail when it came to explaining basic concepts.\n\nEven at 1M a year we’re not big enough for that. I’m closing business now and doing a good job. We’re working on building out the pipeline infrastructure and are not looking for sales at the moment at all.",

Customers like \"experts\" far better than a vaporwave person.  How to do this easily?  Take one of your staffers along with you on a sales call.  Let them see how it works.  Then have them answer some of the customer's questions, and let the staff member \"snow\" the customer with technical jargon, as that is GOOD thing.  The staff member just PROVED to the customer they are technical, not good at talking with normal people, and literally will have a valuable opinion of the do-ability of the task, and even define the stages and algorithms needed to solve the task. \n\nThus,  the customer now knows your firm has experts who are well qualified to COMPLETE the job, instead of getting just half way, taking half the budget, before telling the customer, the job can not be done.\n\nHope this helps.",

We burned money on sales and marketing employees. We burned money on agencies. We burned money on paid ads. Tried everything to make that type of business scale.\n\nHere's the truth:\nYou are trying to solve an equation that has no solution. Look at all the answers here. Everybody is desperately trying to get a steady stream of customers running. \n\nFrom what I have seen and learned in the past 10 years, I would say it's not possible to come up with any sales or marketing strategy or tactics that generate new customers. \nSure, having a good partner company can work. But it will make you dependant and often, you will be the sub contractor in the back.\n\nHere's what does work. It worked for us and I know plenty of companies where it worked too:\n\nYou need to fix your OFFER. \nYou can't just offer sw development as a service. Nobody cares, really. It provides questionable results, it is risky, it takes forever, it is never the primary solution for any given problem but often the most expensive one and if you fail, it can seriously damage the decision makers career. \n\n\"But I want to offer custom dev\"\nYes. It is absolutely possible to do so.\nBut you need to separate FULFILMENT from your VALUE PROPOSITION.\n\nSee, your customers will buy the following offer:\n\"We help (industry) to achieve (transformation) in (time span), as proven by (case study A, case study B).\"\n\nE.g. \"We help medical device manufacturers cut time to market by 30% by introducing a custom PLM solution based on ... as end-to-end backbone in 3-6 months\"\n\nThat's an actual example of a biz doing very well. \nIt is still 80% custom development in the background. But the value proposition and the target audience is crystal clear.\n\nAnd abacadabra, sales and marketing suddenly do work.\nAnd it gets even easier to find new customers using partners and referrals. \n\nHow to shift from generic dev shop to such a business? I figured this out the hard way and I could write books about it. If people are interested, I can write some more information about it in another post.",

In reality, I am exhausted.\n\nBeing a solo founder means I am the support team, the dev team, and the sales team all at once. I have become the bottleneck for my own growth. I feel like I am just keeping my head above water instead of actually building a company.\n\nI am honestly considering applying to YC just to find a co-founder. I know that sounds weird, but I feel like I need a partner to share the mental load more than I need the capital.\n\nI have a few questions for people who have been here:\n\n* **Finding a partner late:** Has anyone actually found a real co-founder after hitting six figures in revenue? Or is it better to just start hiring senior people?\n* **The YC route:** Is it crazy to use YC as a way to find a partner when the product is already working?\n* **Burnout:** How do you keep the momentum when you are the only one pushing the rock up the hill?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has transitioned from solo to a team, or even those who decided to stay solo and found a way to make it sustainable.",

Few thoughts from the other side.\n\n  \nOn the co-founder question: at $321k ARR you honestly dont need a co-founder, you need a strong first hire. A co-founder at this stage means giving up equity for something you could solve with a good ops person or senior engineer. The mental load sharing you want is real but a trusted #2 employee can provide that without the complications of a late-stage co-founder relationship.\n\n  \nOn YC: great network and signal, but going through a program primarily to find a partner is an expensive way to network. You already have a working product with real revenue. YC is designed more for pre-product or early-traction companies. If networking is the goal, founder communities like OnDeck or even just being active in niche Slack groups for your vertical would get you there faster.\n\n  \nOn the burnout itself: the biggest unlock for me was realizing that not everything needs to be done well. Some things just need to be done. I was spending energy trying to be excellent at support, sales AND engineering simultaneously. The moment I hired someone for support (even part-time contract) and let them handle it at 80% of my quality level, I got 40% of my mental bandwidth back. That 80% was more than good enough for customers.\n\n  \nPractical next step I would suggest: before you look for a co-founder or apply to YC, try hiring a part-time contractor for your biggest time sink (probably support or sales). Run it for 60 days. You will either realize that was all you needed, or you will have a much clearer picture of what kind of partner you actually want.",

Not because sales was the hardest part, but because it was the only one that could be systematized without needing someone as smart as the founder.\n\nHere's what worked:\n\nDocument every single call for two weeks. Every objection, every demo flow, every discovery question. Then hire someone decent, not exceptional, and have them shadow for 30 days. They take over setters first, then closers. Founder still jumps in when deals are over a certain threshold, but suddenly there's 20 hours back per week.\n\nThe mistake is trying to hire someone to \"do sales.\" That person will suck because they don't have your context. Build the system first, then hire someone to run it.\n\nSupport next. A VA using a knowledge base you build over two weekends can handle tier 1 stuff. Anything they can't solve gets escalated.

We worked together as partners just like co-founders for many years, even though there was only one \"founder\" in the usual sense of the word.\n\nDo you think that's a model that could work for you?

A co-founder would want equity but you've already de-risked the business - they'd be joining something that works, not building from zero. That's an employee not a co-founder.\n\nWhat you actually need is to hire your first 2-3 people and delegate the stuff that drains you most. Figure out which of support/dev/sales exhausts you the most and hire for that first. Most solo founders try to hire for everything at once and end up with mediocre generalists. Hire one specialist who can own an entire function.\n\nThe YC thing is backwards. You don't need a co-founder to share the mental load, you need to stop being precious about who touches your product. YC wants companies that can scale and you can't scale if you're the bottleneck. They'd probably tell you to hire anyway.\n\nFor burnout - the only thing that worked for me was accepting that slower growth while building a team is better than fast growth that kills you. Your revenue will flatline for 6 months while you train people and that's fine. You're playing a long game not a sprint.\n\nOne practical thing - before you hire anyone, document every process you do repeatedly. Takes 2 weeks of painful work but then you can hand someone a manual instead of training them from scratch every time.",

Entrepreneurship risk is very manageable because even if the business fails, they can go get a job again.\n\n  \nThe dangerous myth on both sides is treating it as binary.

You don't control the market. You don't control your customers' decisions. You don't control the economy, the timing, or whether someone with more resources builds the same thing faster. You traded one type of uncertainty for another and called it freedom.\n\nThe real question isn't which path is riskier. It's which kind of risk you're equipped to handle, and whether you've thought honestly about why you're choosing it. \"I want control\" sounds empowering until you realize most new businesses don't fail because the founder lacked control. They fail because the founder didn't know what to build, who to build it for, or why it mattered beyond revenue.\n\nAnd the conspiracy angle at the end weakens an otherwise interesting conversation. \"Media wants us to stay employees\" isn't critical thinking. It's just suspicion wearing the costume of insight. The real reason most people stay in corporate jobs isn't brainwashing. It's that entrepreneurship demands a kind of self-knowledge that most people haven't done the work to develop. That's not a media problem. That's a human one.\n\nBoth paths are hard. Both paths are uncertain. The difference isn't control. It's whether you've been honest with yourself about what you actually want and what you're willing to lose to get it.",

So, yes, it's a lot riskier, because if your business fails you're going to have a hell of a time replacing the income.\n\nAlso, in a corporate job you typically have a benefits plan that includes PTO and short and long term disability.  If you suddenly develop lupus or whatever, as a corporate employee, you have a viable financial path (not that living on 60% of your income is _easy_, but it's at least _possible_).  If you're unable to work as a solo or small company entrepreneur, even in you have disability insurance, the company itself is going to run out of money without you and be unable to pay the premiums.  More likely you just never signed up for this kind of insurance because it was way too expensive, particularly STD.\n\nThe reality is that owning your own business is a great deal more risky than being an employee, even taking layoffs into account.

That puts you ahead of 95% of graduates. If you can find a program that combines real-world building with some structure, that is the best of both worlds. Traditional 4-year degree just to have a backup? Probably not worth it if you are already executing.\n\nOne thing I would watch out for: at 19, your network is small. Whatever you do, optimize for meeting people who are 5-10 years ahead of you. That has been more valuable to me than any lecture.",

At the end of the day, I’d weigh whether a program expands your worldview and network more than it distracts you from real growth.

The only real edge college might give you is network and exposure. Not lectures. Not exams. The rooms and the people.\n\nIf you feel your worldview is limited, attack that directly. Put yourself around founders doing bigger numbers. Attend events. Join paid communities. Work with higher level clients. Travel while still running your business. You do not need a campus to expand your thinking. And those travel build programs can be interesting, but only if they genuinely raise your standards and connect you with serious operators. Otherwise it’s just a nice experience that delays scaling what already works.\n\nIf the agency is growing steadily, I’d push it aggressively for the next 2 to 3 years before pausing momentum.

If I could redo, id skip university and get straight into it. Theory is important but there is a vast amount of knowledge spread out. Besides most people these days are using Ai to pass their degree. If you can get a degree through using Ai, why not use it to study business principles that you would get through university.

You're doing neither. You already named your actual gap: no network beyond clients, no exposure beyond your niche, limited worldview. That's a more honest self-assessment than most people twice your age ever make.\n\nHere's what I'd sit with. The question isn't \"college or no college.\" It's \"what kind of growth do I need right now?\" You've proven you can execute. You can build, sell, deliver. That's real and you should be proud of it. But execution without perspective narrows over time. You get better and better at the thing you already know, and your world gets smaller while your revenue gets bigger. That's a trap disguised as progress.\n\nCollege, at its best, isn't about learning business theory. It's about being forced to think across disciplines you would never choose on your own. Philosophy, history, psychology, ethics. The stuff that doesn't feel useful until ten years later when you're making decisions that require more than tactical skill. It broadens the foundation you build everything else on.\n\nThat said, a traditional four-year degree isn't the only way to get that. Those travel programs you mentioned sound closer to what you actually need: real exposure, real building, real worldview expansion. The test for any option isn't \"will this give me a credential.\" It's \"will this make me think differently about what I'm already doing.\"\n\nYou don't need a backup plan. You need a wider lens. How you get it matters less than whether you're honest about needing it. And at 19, the fact that you already see that puts you ahead of where most people start",

I firgured they needed accountability. So, I had them send daily 5 minute report of what they were working, what’s their focus for the day, and what were they stuck or off track. Plus I needed them to start organizing their shifts themselves.\n\nThe second thing was that I end up hiring a remote virtual assistant in Latam through a company that GPT recommended. This staffing agency was called Hire With Near. It was game changing. Yep it cost me a bit at first but it was totally worth it. Instead of spending 60-70k having someone on-site or remote in the US this VA from Mexico was around ~20k a year.  But beyond saving time an each week I had most of the admin stuff handled. I was able to devote time to improving my sales pitch, improving our demand gen tools and just accelerating deals closed. Hope this if helpful in any way.",

Clients would forget what the work was, question line items, delay payment. Average time to payment was 35-40 days.\n\nSwitched to invoicing immediately after delivery. Same day, while the value is fresh in their head. Average time to payment dropped to 12 days. Cash flow went from constant stress to predictable.\n\nThe other boring thing: adding a late payment fee clause to every contract. Not to actually charge it, but because the existence of the clause changes behavior. About 90% of clients who used to pay late started paying on time once the clause was visible on the invoice.\n\nNeither of these is exciting. But reliable cash flow is what keeps you building instead of chasing money.",

Something boring that solves a real problem and people already pay for. Local lead gen, short form content for businesses, email marketing for small ecom brands, that kind of thing. You do not need capital for that, just skill and relentless outreach.\n\nEveryone wants leverage before they’ve earned it. Leverage comes after you can consistently sell. So step one would be learn how to sell. Cold outreach, follow ups, handling objections, closing on Zoom. It’s uncomfortable but that’s where the money is. You can make 3k to 5k per month way faster with a service than trying to build the next big SaaS from zero. I’ve seen people burn 12 months building something nobody asked for. Painful.\n\nThen once cash flow is stable, I’d build distribution. Newsletter, Twitter, maybe YouTube. Not for ego, but to own attention. Attention compounds. You post consistently for a year and suddenly doors open. Weird how that works. It’s boring at first. Feels like shouting into the void. But that’s the tax.\n\nSo yeah. Service for cash. Sales skill for survival. Distribution for leverage. Then product later when you actually understand the market.\n\nIf you’re into building real wealth from zero and not just dreaming about it, I write about that journey weekly in Wealth Rewired. It’s all practical stuff, no guru nonsense.",

For me that is development, for others it might be writing, design, or ops work. Get to 3-5k per month in freelance income first. This is not the business, it is the runway.\n\nThen spend every non-billable hour doing one thing: finding a problem that real businesses will pay to solve. Not brainstorming in a notebook. Actually talking to 50 people who run small businesses or SaaS companies and asking \"what is the most painful repetitive thing you do every week?\"\n\nThe answer in 2026 almost certainly involves AI automation. But not the way most people think. It is not \"build another AI wrapper.\" It is \"find a 500 dollar per month manual process and automate 80 percent of it with existing AI tools.\" Sell that as a service before you build a product.\n\nBiggest advantage of starting from zero in 2026 vs 2020: the cost to build has dropped 10x. A SaaS that took 50k and 6 months can now ship for under 500 dollars in a few weeks. But that also means competition is brutal, so distribution matters more than ever.\n\nFastest path: skill leads to income leads to problem discovery leads to service leads to productize. Skip steps and you are just building something nobody asked for.",

Same angle. Same cursor hovering over revenue. Same refresh button. Same captions about quitting your job.\n\nOne in particular kept popping up on my feed. Young guy, rented Airbnb background, MacBook on the table, showing what looked like steady five-figure days. I wasn’t even mad about it. I’ve been in dropshipping long enough to know big days happen.\n\nI probably wouldn’t have thought twice about it if I hadn’t paused the video at the wrong time.\n\nWhen he refreshed the dashboard, the numbers updated and for a split second there were two dollar signs in front of the revenue. Most likely a typo. One slightly offset. It disappeared almost immediately when the animation finished. You wouldn’t notice it unless you scrubbed through the video frame by frame.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI replayed it a few times and it kept happening. The extra symbol showed up for a fraction of a second and then corrected itself. It didn’t look like lag.\n\nInstead of commenting publicly, I DMed him. Acted interested. Asked about the course, the usual questions. He replied quickly, sent voice notes, told me spots were filling up, as every guru does i guess.\n\nAfter a few messages, I sent him a screenshot from his own reel with the duplicate dollar sign circled and just asked what that was.\n\nHe responded saying they had a collaboration with a platform that lets them simulate dashboards for marketing. Said it helps make content cleaner and even sent a signup link to the same platform he was FAKING it all on. Said the real business is separate from what’s shown in videos.\n\nJust so you understand the size of this problem - there's probs way more affiliates, way more gurus who are selling you courses that don't even know how to do the thing they're selling.\n\nI know how bad it sometimes feels when your sales are slow and then you see a 19 year old kid flexing lambos and multi-million revenue on Instagram. I'm asking you to stop believing it.\n\nNow whenever I see those “flexing” videos, I can't help myself but to analyse every single detail of the video lol.\n\nEDIT: My DM's are being flooded by people asking what the tool name is. I do not condone this and for those who are asking in regards to \"research purposes\" the tool is is dashmock or mockdash, I can't quite recall due to archiving the conversation with the influencer and I am not affiliated with it in any shape or form.",

After **35 years in business and 15 years mentoring of founders**, I’ve seen that 'faking it until you make it' has mutated into 'faking it to sell how to fake it.'\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this the **Circle of Lust for Round Zero**. It’s the obsession with looking successful to trigger other people's FOMO, rather than building a business that actually generates cash. When a guru tells you that 'simulating dashboards helps make content cleaner,' they are admitting that their business isn't sales, it’s illusion.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these guys are trying to convince you that they’ve thrown a perfect stone by photoshop-ing the target. But in the real world, the ice is cold and the friction is real. If you don't have a **Structure** that handles real customer data, real logistics, and real margins, you don't have a startup; you have a video edit.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't flaunt dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that the only 'clean' content is a bank statement that matches the tax returns.\n\n**Quick question:** Beyond the technical glitches, what do you think is the biggest 'red flag' in the way these gurus talk about the actual operations of the business?",

Compliance stuff, niche scheduling, industry-specific reporting. Zero competition because no developer thinks it's cool enough to build. But the customers are sticky as hell because switching costs in niche workflows are brutal.\n\n  \nThe \"search for anger\" framing is perfect too.

Just hit 10k downloads with zero marketing spend.\n\n\n\nNot a unicorn story - making \\~$500/month - but wanted to share what actually worked vs what I thought would work.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PRODUCT\n\n\n\nPDF editor that's:\n\n\\- 20MB (vs Adobe's 300MB)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n\\- No signup/cloud required\n\n\\- Free on desktop, small one-time payment on mobile\n\n\n\nBuilt it because I was tired of bloated PDF tools that force everything through the cloud.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK (Spoiler: Didn't)\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt Launch: Ranked #284\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks preparing\n\n\\- Got 50 upvotes\n\n\\- \\~200 visits\n\n\\- 12 downloads\n\n\\- Felt like a complete failure\n\n\n\nHackerNews (First Attempt): 11 points, 0 comments\n\n\\- Posted at wrong time\n\n\\- Didn't engage in comments fast enough\n\n\\- Buried in /new within an hour\n\n\n\nMy Own X/Twitter: 3-4 likes per post\n\n\\- Tweeted about launches\n\n\\- Crickets\n\n\\- My followers don't care about my product (harsh truth)\n\n\n\nPaid Ads: Didn't even try\n\n\\- No budget as bootstrapped founder\n\n\\- Heard horror stories about burning money\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKED\n\n\n\n1. SOMEONE ELSE'S TWEET (1,900 likes)\n\n\n\nA random user tweeted about my product. I had nothing to do with it.\n\n\n\nMy tweets: 4 likes\n\nRandom user's tweet: 1,900 likes\n\n\n\nSame product. Different messenger.\n\n\n\nLesson: You can't make your product go viral. But you can make a product so good that others want to share it.\n\n\n\n2. GERMAN TECH BLOG (3,500 downloads)\n\n\n\nA respected German tech blog found my product organically and wrote about it.\n\n\n\nI didn't pitch them. They found it.\n\n\n\nTheir angle: \"No cloud requirement\"\n\n\n\nTurns out, Germans are extremely privacy-conscious (GDPR is a mindset, not just compliance).\n\n\n\nResult: Traffic exploded overnight. 40% of my users are now from Germany, Austria, Switzerland.\n\n\n\nLesson: Build with strong principles. The right market will find you - even if it's across the world and you didn't target them.\n\n\n\n3. SOFTWARE DIRECTORIES (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nGot listed on:\n\n\\- AlternativeTo\n\n\\- Softonic\n\n\\- AppBrain\n\n\n\nDidn't pay for featured placement. Users added my product themselves.\n\n\n\nWhen people search \"Adobe alternative\" or \"lightweight PDF editor\" - they find these directories first, not my website.\n\n\n\nResult: Steady stream of 50-100 downloads per day just from directories.\n\n\n\nLesson: SEO isn't just Google. Be discoverable where your users are searching.\n\n\n\n4. REDDIT (Organic Comments) (\\~2,200 downloads)\n\n\n\nNot posting \"Check out my product!\"\n\n\n\nJust being helpful in r/productivity, r/software threads where people ask \"What PDF editor do you use?\"\n\n\n\nI'd share my experience, mention alternatives including mine, and let them decide.\n\n\n\nResult: People checked it out because I was helpful first, promotional never.\n\n\n\nLesson: Distribution = being present where your users have problems. Not announcing where you want attention.\n\n\n\n5. WORD OF MOUTH (\\~1,000 downloads)\n\n\n\nThe unsexy one that compounds:\n\n\\- Students sharing in college WhatsApp groups\n\n\\- People recommending in forums\n\n\\- Reviews mentioning it\n\n\n\nTakes time but becomes self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nTHE PATTERN I'M SEEING\n\n\n\nDistribution channels I can't control (others' tweets, blogs finding me, directories, word of mouth) >>> channels I can control (my tweets, paid ads, official launches).\n\n\n\nYou can't force organic growth. But solve a real problem well, and people will talk about it.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCURRENT METRICS (Full Transparency)\n\n\n\nRevenue: \\~$500/month (\\~50 paid users at $10 one-time purchase)\n\nDownloads: 10,000+ total (across all platforms)\n\nTime to build: \\~10 months (nights/weekends while working day job)\n\nMarketing spend: $0\n\nTeam: Just me\n\nFunding: $0 (bootstrapped)\n\n\n\nGeographic breakdown:\n\n\\- 40% Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region)\n\n\\- 35% India\n\n\\- 15% USA\n\n\\- 10% Rest of world\n\n\n\nPlatform breakdown:\n\n\\- 60% Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - completely free\n\n\\- 40% Mobile (iOS/Android) - freemium\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT I'M LEARNING\n\n\n\n1. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT > MARKETING\n\n\n\nUsers market products that solve real problems. You don't need to.\n\n\n\n2. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE IS REAL\n\n\n\nBiggest market: Germany\n\nMy location: Not Germany\n\nMy German language skills: Zero\n\n\n\nBuilt for global market with strong principles (privacy, offline-first). Germans loved it. Now I'm learning German and translating the app.\n\n\n\nSometimes your product finds its market before you do.\n\n\n\n3. FREEMIUM CAN WORK FOR BOOTSTRAPPED\n\n\n\n10,000 free users = my marketing team\n\n50 paid users = fund development\n\n\n\nFew % conversion isn't impressive, but:\n\n\\- Free users create reviews, mentions, directories\n\n\\- Word of mouth scales\n\n\\- Paid users make it sustainable\n\n\n\nCurrently at $500/month. Goal: $10k/month (need 1,000 paid users).\n\n\n\n4. LAUNCH DAY DOESN'T MATTER\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt flopped. Nobody remembers.\n\nHackerNews flopped. Nobody cares.\n\n\n\n3 months later: 10,000 downloads from sources I didn't plan for.\n\n\n\nGreat products compound. Bad launches don't matter if you keep shipping.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nCHALLENGES I'M FACING\n\n\n\n1. CODE SIGNING ($400/year)\n\n\n\nWindows installer isn't signed. Shows scary warning. Losing downloads because of this.\n\n\n\nCan't afford it yet at $500/month.\n\n\n\n2. CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Just Me)\n\n\n\nHandling 20+ support emails per week alone.\n\n\n\nNeed to automate or hire but can't afford yet.\n\n\n\n3. FEATURE CREEP\n\n\n\nEveryone wants their specific use case: OCR, cloud sync, collaboration.\n\n\n\nStaying focused on \"lightweight offline PDF editor\" is hard when revenue is slow.\n\n\n\n4. IMPOSTOR SYNDROME\n\n\n\n$500/month isn't impressive. Seeing others with $50k+ MRR makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\n\n\nBut have to remember: I started at $0. Progress is progress.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\n\nShort term:\n\n\\- Hit $3k/month (need 300 paid users)\n\n\\- Afford code signing certificate\n\n\\- Translate to German (my biggest market)\n\n\n\nLong term:\n\n\\- $10k/month = quit day job\n\n\\- Hire part-time support\n\n\\- Build team of 2-3\n\n\n\nNot trying to be a unicorn. Just trying to build a sustainable business solving a real problem.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY\n\n\n\n1. How did you find your unexpected market? (Like my Germany discovery)\n\n\n\n2. At what revenue did you quit your day job? (Thinking about this at $3k/month)\n\n\n\n3. Code signing / legal costs - when do you bite the bullet and just pay?\n\n\n\n4. How do you stay motivated when growth is slow but steady?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about:\n\n\\- Bootstrapping without funding\n\n\\- Building solo\n\n\\- Distribution tactics that worked (and failed)\n\n\\- Pricing strategy\n\n\\- Geographic expansion\n\n\\- Dealing with impostor syndrome\n\n\n\nNot here to sell - genuinely want to learn from this community.

Without code signing, business will not touch your product (they will have policies that would block it). \n\nI would do 3 things right now\n\n1) Code signing - bite the bullet and wear the costs, you are leaving money on the table without it.  \n2) Create excellent documentation, make it easy to find (in app) and search - ie work to keep support emails to a minimum.  \n3) Segment the market - $10 for private, at least $50 for business (they can afford it, and you need to cover your extra overheads).  \n\nJust be prepared for a lot of extra work selling to business - whilst some people can use their credit cards, get ready for dealing with requests for quotes and  purchase orders for $50 which can really suck up your free time (and your will to live).  \n\nGood luck.",

One thing I'd add from my experience shipping MVPs for clients: the 'zero marketing spend' framing undersells what you actually did. Community engagement, word of mouth, and showing up in forums IS marketing. It's just not paid marketing. The distinction matters because founders read 'zero budget' and think distribution happens by itself. It doesn't. You clearly put in the work on distribution, just not through ads. That's worth calling out.",

The founders who do well seem to find the 2-3 places where people already have the problem, not blast it out to everyone.\n\nQuestion though - at $10 one-time, how are you thinking about the long term math on this? u/finalbuilder brought up the support load thing and that's something I keep going back and forth on. I'm still trying to decide between one-time and subscription for my own app. At $10 per user you'd need a LOT of volume to make it work no?",

Instead of a revenue number, consider: 6 months of runway + consistent growth trend. $3k/month sounds low, but if you're seeing 20%+ month-over-month growth, the math changes fast.\n\nAlso, the code signing issue - that's costing you more than $400/year in lost conversions. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money. Consider it your first \"employee\" - it works 24/7 removing friction.\n\nThe Germany discovery is fascinating.

Ask upfront: \"Is there an internal team involved in this project?\" Not confrontational, just standard discovery. Their answer (or dodge) tells you a lot.\n\n  \n2. Replace free demos with paid discovery. Even a small paid phase ($500-1500 depending on scope) filters out everyone who is not serious. Real buyers are happy to pay for it because they get value either way. Time-wasters disappear instantly.\n\n  \n3. If they push back on paid discovery, offer a short presentation or walkthrough of similar past work instead. Never custom-build anything before money changes hands.\n\n  \n4. \"Show us what you can do\" without any commitment from their side = free consulting. A legit client will have a budget, a timeline, and a decision-maker on the call. If any of those three are missing, be cautious.\n\n  \n5. Set a personal rule: no more than 2-3 hours of unpaid work before any engagement. That is enough for a proposal and a rough wireframe, not a full week of building.\n\n  \nThe silver lining is that once you start charging for discovery, the quality of your leads goes way up. The people who stay in the conversation after hearing \"paid discovery\" are almost always the ones who actually close.",

That doesn’t mean walk away immediately, but it does mean no free builds. At most, high-level walkthroughs or concept sketches.\n\nPay attention to how concrete the conversation is. Buyers talk about timelines, budgets, and consequences if something doesn’t get done. Idea collectors talk about possibilities, features, and “what ifs”.\n\nOne simple filter that saves a lot of pain is flipping the ask. Instead of “I’ll build a demo”, say “let’s do a paid discovery or pilot”. Even a small paid engagement changes the dynamic completely. The people who disappear were never serious. The ones who stay usually are.\n\nAnd honestly, some of this only comes with getting burned once or twice. It’s not stupidity, it’s tuition.\n\nThe fact you caught it and are asking how to spot it earlier means you’ll handle the next one much better.",

And more importantly, their answer tells you what they actually value because they chose that solution for a reason.\n\n  \n2. \"If we built this, who in your organization would use it daily?\" - If they can't name specific people with specific workflows, it's a tire-kicker. Real buyers know exactly who needs it and can describe the pain with specifics.\n\n  \nThe \"show me what you can do\" request without any commitment on their end is the biggest red flag. Real prospects with real problems don't need a full demo to validate that you can solve it. They need a conversation about their workflow and a rough sense that your approach would fit.\n\n  \nI now have a rule: no custom work until I understand their current process.
