      "text": " Last year my mom finally admitted she needed help clearing out her house and I took a week off work to help her. Not gonna lie, it was rough. But the thing that got me was how many other older people in her neighborhood were in the same boat but had no one to help them.\n\nThese weren't your typical \"hire a junk removal service\" situations. These folks needed someone patient who understood that every item has a story and you cant just toss everything. They also needed help deciding what actually has value vs what doesn't, how to sell stuff on facebook marketplace (most of them have no clue), and someone to physically do the heavy lifting.\n\nStarted offering this super specific service in my area. \"Downsizing assistance for seniors\" basically. I help them sort, list valuable items online, coordinate donations, and handle the actual cleanout. Charged $35/hour which felt fair and I had a little money saved up so I could test it without stressing about immediate income.\n\nFirst client came from my moms friend. Then word of mouth exploded because apparently every boomer in a 10 mile radius is dealing with this. Now I'm booked 3 weeks out and averaging around $4k/month working maybe 20 hours a week. The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nIm wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?",

The vast majority of them have a layer of dust on them so thick that it’s clear she hasn’t worn them in a long time.  Some are in piles. I asked her to start small by throwing away five pairs, thinking this was a manageable goal that could lead to momentum in cleaning up the rest of their home. \n\nWrong.  She has made every excuse under the sun for why she couldn’t spare any time to this task.  I remind her every time we speak. That was two years ago. \n\nNow consider they have a 3500 sq ft home.  Every room has its storage depleted with her stuff that she doesn’t use.  \n\nUnfortunately I believe nothing will be cleared until after she passes.",

          "text": "The end game for a business like this is simply to start an auction house tied to estate clearance. When I sold my Grandma's house in 2016, I went down there for a week and loaded up a trailer with the valuable items or things I thought I'd use at home. The rest of the house was evacuated by a team of some 5 laborers who bagged/boxed up clothes, linens, books, etc and brought them to their warehouse. It took them maybe half a day to tie up loose ends. From there, the business model was simple. Once a month, this business would hold a public auction that went from like 7am till 9pm. Lots of similar items from different estates would be placed in this enormous warehouse/outdoor space and people would come through and make offers on items (or just buy outright for a fixed price). Throughout the day, at different time checkpoints, the price would be reduced by 25% until the last few hours of the day it would be 75% off. At the end of the day, all unsold goods were landfilled or donated. \n\nIn terms of making money, the contract was set up where I owed the company $1,000 no matter what and 25% of net revenue of sold goods. They ended up getting around $3,000 for the miscellanea of her house so I only owed $250 above what they got from the sale. They also set me up with a contractor/realtor to get the house minimally ready for sale.\n\nI'm not saying you need to scale it that large, but that's how that company was able to provide families with some peace of mind that the entire house wasn't just going in the trash.",

          "text": "> The crazy part is how many of their kids are willing to pay me to do this because they either live far away or dont have the patience.\n\nHonestly it might not even be about not having the patience. You operate in a unique space of being able to come from outside and handle the downsizing/listing of items. For example, if you, a stranger/expert come and tell them that this item should be listed and is worth ~$20, they might accept your word for it while if their son or daughter comes and says the same thing, they might argue and tell them they're wrong. \n\nI deal with the same thing with my family all the time. I did my degree in computer science and economics. I work in tech. My parents are academics (researchers at a uni). They will argue with me till they're blue in the face about systems I've literally worked on because I'll always be their son and kid in their head, but if one of my colleagues said the same thing as me, they'd accept it as expert testimony.\n\n> Im wondering if this could actually scale beyond just me doing the work? Like could I train others and turn this into something bigger or is it too personality dependent. Anyone dealt with service businesses like this before?\n\nI mean, it's a specialist version but you have a lot of parallels. You should think about what exactly makes up the core parts of your profession and how it differs from other similar, overlapping industry professions. From there, you can figure out a)where to hire from, b) how to hire, c) what needs to be taught, and d) how you continue to refine that niche. It can totally scale. (and as others have said, $35 an hour is less than what I pay just for regular cleaning ladies to come dust my place every week lol. You also have to keep in mind if you take outside help, your prices need to scale so you make your cut and can also handle other things like equipment, liability, etc.. At least in LA, I pay $50 an hour pp (e.g. $200 for 2 hours with a crew of 2) and that feels fairly standard/not the lowest budget but certainly not high end. So yeah, $35 for specialist help? Not surprised to hear that it's popular).",

Credit card saved for processing and if you bid and won, it was yours.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you had to agree that you could pick up the goods on the specified pickup date during a set of hours. This allowed the company to arrange all pick ups of goods from the house on one single day. They'd only have to worry about what didn't sell.\n\nIf a customer didn't make it to pickup between the set hours on the pickup date, the goods went to second place in the auction for an arranged day, and you were charged anyway.\n\nI think each lot had an easy minimum set, like that Sports Stuff example would start at like $6.\n\nWas pretty awesome.",

If that bothers you (I know the feel), grandfather in the people who your current clients refer to you after the rate change, or grant those referrals a reduced rate special for the first X hours or something.\n\nScaling something like that is tricky. The reason you're so successful, and distinguishing yourself from what's out there, is your emotional intelligence and empathy. That can be recruited, but not really realistically taught on an employee-training timeline. I wouldn't try to make this a big company with many agents or anything like that.\n\nThat said, with careful consideration and selection, you could probably justify expanding to a very small team, and perhaps dividing up labor would be efficient as well, like having someone to list things for sale, someone else to do hauling with a truck, whatever of that nature comes to mind for you based on your operation. Or each person could just take on the full scope of services, and the team just divides up clients. You have lots of cool options for helping people in your area, hooking up one or two or a few other people with a good job, and making your business easier on yourself. But yeah, I think if you try to expand very far beyond a smallish company in your particular city/region, it would probably succeed, but probably also lose a lot of the real core value being provided (that being the compassionate shepherding of people through a difficult life transition).

      "text": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

The money and business and all of its inventory/assets are still mine, regardless if it’s reinvested into more inventory or not. The money is still growing as opposed to sitting in my savings account (what it was doing before). \n\nAlso, im learning Sales, Marketing, Operations, Shipping/handling, inventory management, asset tracking, accounting, etc, etc. so I get all of the benefits of just learning how to run a business. \n\nI’ve sold some day-dates and royal oaks in the 50-60k range. Made some good profit on those (3k+ each) but those deals are hard to come by. \n\nBut keep in mind there’s also times where you hit big on a much cheaper watch.

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent. Many of the old business greats I had one thing in common.And that is, they sat on a mountain of cash.",

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

Here's the breakdown:  \nIncome Stream #1: Dividend Investing ($500/month passive)  \n  \nStarted with $200/month into dividend ETFs back in 2021  \nNow automatically contributes $600/month, reinvests dividends  \nGenuinely zero maintenance once set up  \n  \nIncome Stream #2: Microtask platforms ($200-400/month semi-passive)  \n  \nDo small online tasks during lunch breaks, while watching TV, etc.  \nTakes maybe 5-10 hours/month total  \nPerfect for dead time that would otherwise be wasted  \n  \nIncome Stream #3: Testing digital products (TBD)  \n  \nCreating info products in my niche  \nToo early for real numbers but optimistic  \n  \nThe strategy that changed everything:  \nDon't try to replace your income immediately. Start with things that fit into gaps in your schedule. The dividend income grows automatically while I can dial the active stuff up or down based on work demands.  \nFor anyone starting out:  \n  \nBegin with one truly passive income source (investments)  \nAdd flexible side hustles that don't require set hours  \nAutomate everything possible  \nBe patient - took me 2+ years to see real momentum  \n  \nWhat side hustles are you all running alongside your day jobs? Always looking for new ideas to test.",

That's my bad for making it confusing. Here's the actual breakdown:\n\nDividend income: $80-100 a month (you nailed that estimate)  \nThe rest comes from a mix of capital I can access if needed and some gains I've taken\n\nI should have been clearer that the $500 a month \"passive income\" number included portfolio growth I could tap into, not purely dividend payouts. That's misleading on my part.  \nThe actual pure dividend income is way more modest like you said, around $80-100 a month from roughly $25k invested. Still nice to have but definitely not the $500 I implied.  \nThanks for keeping it real. Don't want to give anyone unrealistic expectations about what's actually possible in 4 years. Edit typos",

Way less pressure and it actually stuck this time.  \nThe automation piece is huge too. My dividend contributions happen automatically every paycheck so I never have to think about it. Takes willpower out of the equation.  \nWhat side hustles burned you out before? Curious what didn't work so I can avoid those mistakes myself.",

I'm calling because I just showed them 50-60% saving on the parts you use, and sally said, I'd need to call you. Can I email this over?So when you get a chance, you can look at it later?\n\nYes....\n\nSold.\n\nI don't really give a shit what their name is or what their business name is or what city they're in or where they're located or any of that stuff. My job is to bring value to the marketplace period. It doesn't reward your wants, or needs it only rewards value.\n\nI care about.Do they use the widget that I sell?\n\nI know my widget is higher quality and it's half the price.

The only industry I didn't take the top sales role and hold it as long as I was there was oil and gas sales.\n\nTo me, the definition of communication, is the response you get. So if i'm selling, I have to be closing the deal or i'm not communicating correctly. The other side is, you gotta out work everybody. I always hit my 100-200 cold calls a day, and thats dialing the phone myself. Every night I build my list for the next day. I was always old school too I hand wrote out each lead into a spiral bound notebook. It used to drive my bosses crazy!\n\nI still do it with my business. I put the leads in the system... eventually sometimes. Okay that's not all true. I've got less leads in my hub spot than I have customers.So I must not be putting them all in. That means i've got a stack of spiral bound notepads.\n\nSee, there's always some area of improvement for everyone.",

Whatever. Just make it real and honest, no marketing coded bullshit). \n\nSo here is my offer- (give actual non vague, highly specific price). Thoughts? \n\nGreat, all I'm looking to do now is send you our standard contract. Once you get that filled out, we can start talking specifics. If it doesn't work out, no worries. I just want something on paper before we get into the nitty gritty so I know you won't (sell my price list, secrets, try to undercut or cut me out, whatever.\"\n\nThen send them some bullshit doc with whatever you two talked about, but no real call to action. Just a \"if I decide to go through this vendor for this item, it will cost this much\". Just something for them to push through legal to get you on the vendor list. Then the real selling starts. Because your already an approved vendor, you cut out a ton of the bullshit. \n\nI sold into Coke, Ford, Ulta, Rivian, CAT, and more in the manufacturing space before moving to Healthcare and using the same script to break into HR departments in Mayo, Brigham, HCA, Kaiser, Providence, and Ascension.",

Sometimes when I forget to ask how a client is, they will interrupt me getting to their issue to ask how I am in a tone insinuating I forgot to be human first. There’s definitely plenty of folks that need this to feel connected. As with most things in sales, it’s how you say it. \n\nEspecially true with return clients ime, it really makes a huge impact to ask how they are doing using their name, and perhaps something you remember from their last visit. \n\nContext is surely important ofc. A car salesman for instance, will have a much harder time coming across as sincere with small talk pleasantries because the general public don’t trust them and don’t really want or need their middle-man services. But a personal care service worker selling products to go with their skilled labor is a whole different story. The client has to spend time with this person and trust them, etc. Here it pays to make genuine connections in order to bring immediate testimonial value to your products and services.",

Per farlo, uso uno strumento chiamato **Customer Impact Map**. L'obiettivo è mappare l'impatto reale che la tua soluzione ha sulla vita (o sul portafoglio) del cliente in meno di 5 secondi. Se il tuo interlocutore non percepisce un **'Positive Reinforcement'** immediato, il suo cervello si spegne. La vendita non è un esercizio di simpatia, è un esercizio di precisione chirurgica sul problema.Smettere di chiedere 'Come stai?' e iniziare a dire 'Ecco come ti faccio risparmiare 2 ore oggi' è la differenza tra un venditore che elemosina attenzione e un professionista che risolve problemi.

Even a warm phone call, a personal visit, shared routines become the memories that actually last.  \nChasing success for them is beautiful, but don't turn love into a deadline. if they raise someone this driven and this caring, you have already given them proof they disn't fail.\n\nI was in similar boat a while ago, but my oldman gave this advice, and my wife validated the same, now we are in happy space.",

One of the purest motivations is the desire to repay those who have sacrificed for you.  \nHowever, don't wait until you \"make it\" to spend time with them or express your concern. Success isn't only about the major event; it's also about the small things that happen along the route. Give them a call, stop by when you can, and show them that you're trying. That still has significance now.  \nYou already stand out since it's obvious that you don't take things for granted. Continue, but while you're constructing, remember to live in the moment with them. Supporting you from a far!",

I spent last year travelling, working from home, and I realized even with a 6-figure job as a machine learning engineer, I am not successful in my own eyes.\n\nOne thing that hit me hard is the fear of being too late. That's a heavy thing to carry, and I think a lot of people grinding quietly for their families feel it, but don't say it loud.\n\nSomething I've learned the hard way is that success doesn't show up all at once. its not a single moment where everything is okay. its usually messy and slow and mixed with doubt the whole way through. wanting to give your parents comfort already says a lot about your priorities.\n\nMy goal is to work hard this whole year, build my own apps and businesses from what I've learned working as a sales director to machine learning engineer, taking on freelancing projects, and to quit my job at the end of the year. I want to give my parents a lump sum of money at the end of the year so they can retire.\n\nGoodluck and I also hope this post will help someone out.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’d really appreciate some perspective from founders or people who’ve been through co-founder conflicts.\n\nI’m a technical co-founder (CTO) of a small Swiss startup (GmbH). I built and maintain essentially the entire product, run infrastructure, fix bugs, and handle most customer support. My two co-founders focus on business and sales.\n\nEquity is split 40% / 40% / 20% (me). Originally it was meant to be equal, but it changed at incorporation due to capital contribution issues. I also don’t have sole signature rights.\n\nOver the last months, they:\n\n\\- Excluded me from business meetings\n\n\\- Started discussing decisions privately\n\n\\- Reduced communication\n\n\\- Admitted later they “distanced themselves”\n\nThen they began blaming me for:\n\n\\- Not being involved enough\n\n\\- Not asking about meetings I was excluded from\n\n\\- “Acting like an employee” because I mainly do technical work\n\n\\- Not doing business/sales/networking (which was never my role)\n\nNow one of them gave me an ultimatum:\n\n1. Become an employee and give up founder equity\n2. Leave completely\n\nThey refused my proposal to align expectations or do a measurable performance plan.\n\nThey also said things like:\n\n\\- “We can’t have someone who does nothing and bunkers equity.”\n\n\\- “This is just derisking for us.”\n\n\\- “It’s too late to fix things because there is now distance.”\n\nWe do have a co-founders’ agreement that says:\n\n\\- Equity reflects long-term contribution\n\n\\- Performance issues should go through a written improvement plan with a cure period\n\n\\- Disputes should go through negotiation -> mediation -> arbitration\n\n\\- Vested equity can’t be forced to transfer (5% vested)\n\n\\- Role or equity changes need unanimous consent\n\nThey skipped all of that and went straight to an ultimatum.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Is this a normal “professionalization” move or a co-founder squeeze-out?\n\n\\- Do I actually have leverage here, or will majority control win anyway?\n\n\\- Should I refuse both options and force mediation / legal process?\n\n\\- Is accepting employee status a bad idea long-term?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

He got caught cheating on his wife of 17 years (with her best friend I might add) and when she filed for divorce and went after half, (understandably so) he sold the company for cheap and fled the country.  \n\nI lost everything and during the legal proceedings, he wound up getting into last stages of congenital heart failure and blew through all the millions on medical and hospital bills.  It's been verified, legitimately verified with my attorneys, and someone even made him a go-fund me.  I'm still recovering.  \n\nLawyer up now.  At least have them on standby if need be.",

If it's just a few months of work I would probably not spend too much time on it and go for a quick resolution and walk away. If it's years with real IP I would fight.\n\nNext get a lawyer, I'm in the US so I don't understand swiss business culture or laws but that would be their job.\n\nIT sounds like either they don't understand/value technical contribution or there's more to this story and they have buyers remose for bringing in a cofounder and not hiring a developer.  Either way you have to put up a wall \"I achieved all technical tasks which is in the role of CTO if you were not satisfied with my performance in a business setting you should have asked sooner\".   Small note people tend to judge others based on their skillset \"well the CTO can't sell or network as well as me!\"  Which is probably true but that's not the CTO's role. I'm sure they can't code or architect software as well as you so it's not a fair comparison.\n\nGood luck. Take from this learning and lessons and move on.

So I would say no, if you want to be an employee, you should go be an employee somewhere else.\n\nAlso, your equity, even your unvested equity, is commercially valuable and you shouldn't give it up for nothing.

The business guys decided one day they could just hire offshore developers and replace us. It ended in an expensive two year lawsuit where we settled in court. \n\nI can’t really offer any advice besides talk to a good lawyer (our first lawyer told us to just roll over and accept their low ball buyout) but I will say I feel empathy for you as I suspect this is quite common. Business people tend to see themselves as the real life of the company and look at us tech people as employees that are interchangeable.  It’s really quite unfair as I feel like the tech part is the hardest and we absorb the most risk in the beginning.",

I am more inclined to offer a discount to a long term client, not someone who this is my first interaction with.\n\nThere are times when taking a small hit are worth it, mostly if the prestige of having this client, or being able to use them as a powerful reference, is something you can leverage to get more business.  Offering a discount if you can showcase the work you do with them to other clients as part of your marketing might make it worthwhile.  Obviously, depends on the business.\n\nThat said, if they come in promising to pay more later, that's a pretty big red flag.  I very likely would also walk away.  Even if they could bring you in steady work in the future, they likely will always push to give you minimal margins, so you'll be working a lot for them, but not really profiting.  Again, depends on the type of business if this is worth it or not.",

          "text": "I know it's hard, or even seems impossible and pointless. I've been there, still there in a way. Put it to the side for now. There is no rush or time table on whatever you are working on... Just do what you can when you need the distraction. Don't do anything that will require your time, unless you need the distraction, or are sure you unable to be spending it with your loved one. I will share some of my story. I don't know if it will help or not, as I'm still not sure how it turns out....\n\nI quit my job (6-figures) last February to move 200 miles back to my hometown to take care of my father. He was  having a hard time and seemed to be going through early stages of dementia. My Dad in the 8 months before that lost his brother, his wife (step-mom) and his sister. He was best friends with his brother, extremely close to his sister, and married to his wife for over 40 years. The year before we lost his father and the year before that his mother. The lost seemed to take a piece of my Dad's mind each time. But I was just far enough a way to not see it... I talked to him 4 or 5 times a week but he was always according to him doing good. \nMy Dad and I have always been really close and if you ask him, his whole life he was always good, or fine. By the time I got here I instantly knew he wasn't good. It took a few months to find out he had stage 4 lung cancer, that had traveled to his brain, and bones. My Dad who was never sick, never had a surgery, or illness, and was the rock in my life. He was a good man, that was always smiling, and really cared for everyone he ever met. I only saw him mad a few times in my life, and never sad except when we lost loved ones.\nI dropped everything in my life the day he called me to ask if I had talked to his sister, my aunt.. who we lost 6 months before. I literally quit my job as a Program Manager at a Fortune 100 company, packed a suitcase, and drove the 200 miles to his house. I gave everything else I owned away to family and my wife of 30 years that I had recwbtly seperated from. \n\nI came here and since that day I took him to every appointment and treatment, watched him waste away all the way down to 85 lbs after the radiation treatments, cooked his meals 3 times a day that he just couldn't eat eventually, carried him to the bathroom, bathed him, and held his hand when he took his last breath on December 13th 2025. By then I was struggling to feed myself and keep the lights on. I scrapped up just enough to pay for the funeral. Now I have to be out of his home by February 1st and not sure what I'm going to do... probanly sleep in my car. Idk... \nWhatever happens I'm thankful for the time I had.. I'm haunted by it as well. He was who I talked to whenever anything happened in my life. I sometimes would put off something or whatever it was for days before talking to him, because I knew he would tell me the right thing to do.. and that was usually the hard thing I was avoiding. But that was the kind of person he was. He was good. In the 10 months we probably had 5 or 6 people stop by... He didn't want others to know or worry about him.. ever. But over 100 people showed up at his funeral. Many I didn't know. He was truly a great man, quiet, good looking, funny, talented, humble... and really so talented... as an artist, a musician, and really everything, he could literally do everything. The man was amazing and just so so humble. A professional musician his whole life. He could play any instrument since he was 6 years old. Didnt read music, you could just turn on the radio, hand him any instrument and he would start playing along with whatever was playing. He was a studio musician and recorded for a ton of names everyone would know. He was flawless thats why they hired him when making the final cut of a song or album. He also was a  business owner, and so much more. He was just good and I know I'm blessed to have had him as a father.  Sorry for going on. \nI'm still lost, I don't know how to deal with it or anything anymore. \n\nBut if you take anything away from my ramblings, just be thankful for whatever time you have left. Spend as much time as possible with your loved one. Ask them questions, make them tell you all their stories, experience anything they are still able to do... bring your laptop. There will be plenty of time between those moments to turn your mind to websites and whatever just to distract yourself from the doctor's office, or hospital room, or the nap they are taking. That's all I have. I will pray for you and your family. If you want to talk or need someone just to listen, im available.",

Cash on paper, revenue, profits looking great, but cash in bank accounts in the red. Collecting is a job onto itself. Especially when dealing with clients with infinitely more resources in lands far away. \n- Constant accounting problems. Bad accounting advice from major firms costing tens of thousands to resolve and unimaginable second orders issues. \n- Getting intimate with employment law as a necessity has ensured I will never have a business with employees in my location. Endless liability and requirements. Truly insane being forced to honour “verbal contracts” aka conversations during reviews where nothing was promised other than a review of circumstances and a decision back turning into arbitration situations that wasted tons of time and money despite being provably in the right. Thank god for diligence in writing meeting memos and circulating those for approval and comment \n- Complete inability to separate my life and create space. It’s all encompassing. And it’s too much. \n- But really to summarize, core business is amazing. Still love it. But the regulatory and second orders management requirements have completely sucked the joy out of operating. \n\nLooking for an exit this year, or next, even if it means a loss.",

He had put up an ad for a marketing intern and I went for it and the rest is history. \n\nI was on the real estate team shadowing the hell out of everyone, learning a lot at every meeting we had, even translated for an agent when I shouldn’t have because technically that’s illegal (non-real estate agent being part of a legally binding contract). \n\nThe hardest part of everything right now is the last part you mention. My friends and family all think I’m not amounting to much or that I need a full time job because it’s important to have health insurance, a steady paycheck, and blah blah blah. I have learned SO MUCH these last 9 years of my life and I’m at the point where I’m finally ready to put it all together and create actions. I’m so thankful that I fully believe in myself and my dreams because I could have easily given up many years ago but momma ain’t raise no damn quitter! I’m excited to see myself put everything together this year but it’s tough. I live paycheck to paycheck but I know I’ll make it out soon like I did before.

I just released a dictation app to the app store I spent the past 4-5 months grinding to build. I've been trying to get the initial downloads but it's been tough. I'm early on in the entrepreneur path but I've already realized that getting people interested in my apps is the hardest part, even harder than the grind to build them. I was definitely hyped about being my own boss and realized it's harder than I thought. I still plan to persevere on this path and do whatever it takes to be successful, I just can't mentally fathom going back to working for a tech company.",

You need to transition from being the 'operator' to the 'owner' by refining your systems. I've been studying these kinds of business frameworks lately for a project I'm building, and it's clear that clarity in your exit strategy is what determines the price.

They often go away in due diligence (or earlier.)   If you decide you want to sell, do your best to get 3 or 4 buyers at the table at the same time. So that they compete for your company.

      "text": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

          "text": "This is one hundred percent spot on the truth.\n\nI always remind myself that those giant Redwood trees in California have to suffer through decades of forest fires for their bark to grow thick enough to be able to grow so tall.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties, I wanted to be a business owner for fuck you money. When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business. You should always be testing new business ideas by first trying to find a customer. And then building upon that. Thats how many greats who started on a shoestring budget, without investors, did it. Hope this is helpful to somebody.",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

This will be **very** expensive (not least because of VAT), so looking for ways to save every penny.   \n  \nThe essence of the question is in the title: should I count on the option of a partial VAT refund and put that money into the budget for the future, or is this option far from guaranteed and more of a pleasant surprise? I am a US resident, if that matters. This is the first time I've ever shipped anything to Europe.  \n  \nAnd in general: how are you handling international tax compliance right now? Are you using any tools or tax filing services that actually make this easier? Or does it make sense to do everything yourself?\n\nAny tips are welcome!",

People dont churn because they didnt learn everything. They churn because they never felt the payoff. If someone hits the core value once they usually forgive rough edges and missing features. So the real metric isnt time spent onboarding. \n\nIts time to first meaningful action. Shorten that and churn drops without touching the roadmap. Most founders over explain instead of over guiding. Some teams use in app prompts or flows for this. Hopscotch comes up a lot. Ive also seen userflow mentioned when people want something lightweight.",

My dad is a CS major, saw lots of people coming from oversees to fill in  roles alongside himself and he ended up working on government contracts where you needed a security clearance. That is a solid option (and may need to relocate to the dc area). Accounting has a pipeline issue and it’s two fold: the job has not been attractive for young people because it’s not glamorous, lots of hours and not as well paid as other finance type and CS roles. I say do an externship to learn more about what the roles look like and what they are trending to be in the future. CS has broader applicability in my mind but accounting is a fundamental set of concepts. If there is an IT type of major offering in your program do that with accounting. My school was starting to add some data analysis and IT adjacent majors when I was in undergrad which was about 10 years ago. Good luck!!",

          "text": "Oh damn I didn't see this but true! AI has definitely changed how each of our teams inside the company work! Engineering probably has changed the most but here are some use cases that has impressed me personally as the CEO:\n\n1. Writing Code: Like Ryan Dahl said, all of our software engineers have kinda become product managers because almost all actual code is written using AI agents like Windsurfs Cascade! I believe Cursor is pretty good as well but we use Windsurf mostly!\n2. A/B Testing at Scale:  Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved! \n3. Call Summary & Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again. \n4. Blogs & Social Media Content: We have used AI tools like frizerly to automate the process of coming up of a content strategy using our Google search data. This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! It's quite impressive how AI can create full blown images for instagram posts featuring actual products etc!\n5. Auto Resolving Repetitive Support Tickets: We have been able to resolve repetitive customer support tickets using Intercom fin quite well! Other questions are still manually handled by our support team! \n\nAnd that's all I can think of rn! Following to see what others are using it for :)",

Ma attenzione, l'IA può farti costruire un prodotto in una settimana, ma non può costringere nessuno a comprarlo.\n\nNel mio libro, **'Startup Inferno'**,(lo trovi su Amazon) spiego che il vero valore dell'IA per un imprenditore nel 2026 non è solo l'efficienza, ma la **velocità di validazione**. Ecco tre casi d'uso 'brutali' che ogni founder dovrebbe implementare:\n\n1. **Il Grill della validazione H24:** Usa l'IA per simulare migliaia di interazioni con il tuo target e trovare i **'Fatal Flaws'** (difetti letali) del tuo modello di business prima ancora di scrivere una riga di codice.\n2. **Eliminazione della 'Lussuria dello spreco':** Esistono tool di IA che analizzano il tuo burn rate e le tue spese operative identificando istantaneamente il 'Lusso dello spreco'. Se l'IA non vede un impatto diretto sul cliente, quel costo va tagliato.\n3. **Customer Impact Mapping istantaneo:** Puoi usare l'IA per analizzare i feedback dei competitor e generare una **Customer Impact Map** che ti dica esattamente dove il mercato sta fallendo, permettendoti di essere rilevante in 7 secondi.\n\nEssere 'AI First' significa usare l'intelligenza artificiale per uscire dal **Labirinto della vaghezza** dieci volte più velocemente degli altri. L'IA costruisce la scala, ma sei tu che devi decidere su quale muro appoggiarla.\n\nOttimo spunto per il 2026!",

Faster content creation + repurposing (marketing/social media) AI can help generate ideas or turn one concept into multiple formats: posts for different platforms, story/script ideas, and it can also improve or help create captions, descriptions, headlines, and versions for different tones and audiences. This saves time and makes posting consistently easier, without burnout.\n2. Call summaries + follow-up support for sales. After speaking with a potential client, you can use AI to quickly create a short call summary, highlight key points (what the client needs, their questions, concerns), and draft a follow-up message: an email or a short text with clear next steps.\n3. Customer support + FAQ automation A simple chatbot/support assistant that answers common questions and hands off complex cases to a human. Saves time and improves response speed.\n4. Internal knowledge base search So your team can ask things like “what’s our refund policy?” or “how do we price X?” and get answers directly from your docs. Saves time and makes work smoother for everyone.\n5. Basic operational automations Workflows like: form submitted → create a deal in the CRM → assign an owner → send an onboarding email → set a follow-up task. It removes a lot of unnecessary steps and simplifies the workflow.\n6. Data cleanup + research. AI can help with lead categorization, summarizing competitor pages and reviews, and spotting recurring patterns in customer feedback.\n\nOne key point: the best ROI usually comes from embedding AI into an existing workflow, not trying to replace everything at once. Start with one bottleneck (support, sales, admin) and measure the impact.",

You can do everything right for months and still see nothing move, while everyone online only posts wins. And lastly, the guilt.

If I notice I’m looping, I pause big choices and do something mechanical instead. Gym. Walk. Clean. Boring stuff. The mind settles on its own if you give it space.\n\nTalking helps too but only with the right people. Most people don’t get it and that makes it worse. Even just writing things down somewhere private helps unload it a bit.\n\nAnd some days you don’t handle it well at all. You overthink. You doubt everything. Then the next day you’re fine again.

      "text": "I've watched dozens of founders announce their fundraise over the past year. Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",
