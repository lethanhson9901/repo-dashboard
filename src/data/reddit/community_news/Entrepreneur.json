      "text": "so we had this customer who was extremely frustrated with us(asking for refunds / angry emails on serivce etc). every week they'd email support with another complaint. my cofounder wanted to just refund them and move on\n\ninstead i got on a call and asked if theyd be willing to show me exactly what they hated. turned into a 2 hour screen share where they basically roasted our entire product lol\n\nat some point i just said screw it and asked \"what if you designed it yourself? what would it look like?\"\n\nthey sent me back a excalidraw file the next hour. it was ugly as hell but honestly it was genius\n\nwe had all these charts and graphs and filters because we thought it looked professional. they replaced it with like 5 big numbers and a single button that said \"export for my boss\"\n\nshowed it to the team and there was silence. our lead designer was honestly kinda offended. but i pushed us to build it exactly as the customer spec'd it. took maybe a week\n\nthat angry customer became our biggest referral source. theyve sent us like 12 clients\n\nnow we do this regularly. every quarter we find our most frustrated user and give them way too much access. they roast us and we build whatever they ask for\n\nturns out the people who complain the most are just the ones who care the most\n\nanyone else ever let customers dictate product decisions like this? curious if its worked for others",

Every morning feels like pushing a boulder uphill. There's no one I can turn to and say \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" or \"I'm exhausted\" without it affecting morale or their sense of job security. I have everyone analyzing my personality to see if I'm cut out for it, and I don't care to have all this pressure (I know pressure is a privilege, but I've stopped feeling the passion).\n\nI catch myself being jealous of the stability of those who have a salary (I've never had one). It feels like each month I have no clue what the next month will entail. I resent the company now and the clients. I dream about sending a resignation email TO MYSELF. But if someone took my place I would rather die. My business is like my child and I've put multiple six figures into it.\n\nI KNOW I'm not built for a corporate job. And there ARE parts of what I do that I enjoy - I just can't seem to hold onto them under along with everything else. I know theoretically I have the power to shape this into something I love. I built it, so I should be able to rebuild it, right? But I have no clue how to get from where I am to where I want to be since I've gone so far.\n\nAnyone else been here? Did you figure out how to fall back in love with what you built, or am I just spinning my wheels?",

          "text": "Yes 100% been there and felt the exact same way. I think my breaking point was getting to 7 or 8 employees but even 4 was rough too. The answer for me was figuring out how to do some of the work myself and also downsizing so I needed less help. I didn’t want to deal with firing my trusty employees that was the biggest issue but luckily a few of them ended up wanting to move on to different jobs anyway. The final step was I moved to a different state and closed my original office so that took care of another employee or two. Kinda just blamed it on the move and downsizing and they totally understood. \n\nAnyway, it was a long difficult transition but now I just have 2 employees - 1 of them is a salesperson who works remote and basically pays for herself and it’s very part time so no pressure, and the other is my spouse and we share our money so the salary thing doesn’t matter as much. I recognize this is a unique situation and might not be realistic for many businesses but it’s worked out beautifully. \n\nRegardless I think the sentiment of downsizing and doing more of the busy work yourself if possible is relatable. My dad was an entrepreneur and had the same issue but on a much larger scale but he said the same thing about there being a sweet spot when the business was smaller and then it all got messed up when he hired more people and expanded and everyone depending on him etc. \n\nidk your situation and if this is possible but hopefully it helps. \n\nAlso don’t sweat the employees depending on you and maybe needed to let some of them go, it’s just business not personal and in my experience the best thing you can do is give them a huge amount of time to figure out a different job if you do decide to downsize. I gave a couple employees like 3 months notice and they had new jobs secured before I actually wanted them to quit lol",

You've also said several yellow/red flags of common mistakes. \n\n\nI would highly recommend therapy and or a CEO coach, but first you need a week long vacation minimum where you don't answer any emails or check any work. No your company won't implode in 5 business days, but you will catch weaknesses in your processes.\n\n\nLet me address your yellow flags:\n\"Can't turn to anyone for help\". You absolutely can and should say \"I don't know\" followed by \"but I can help you find the answer\". Leadership is about learning and helping those around, not always already having the right answer.  Also you can find business owners, that are in similar spaces or promote/identify people on the team. I bounce ideas off other business owners, chances are the same problem you haven has happened millions of times before. \n\n\nYou absolutely can say \"I'm exhausted\". Literally you say \"hey guys I'm not feeling hot today so I may be a little slow in my response today\". We are whole human beings. In our weekly status meeting we would start with green yellow red for personal mood you could elaborate, but you didn't have to. \n\n\nyou're not responsible for the emotional state of everyone around you and your not solving for happiness. You shouldn't inflict panic or confusion but you absolutely can say \"Hey team that big job fell through so we are only going to have 10k in the bank at the end of this month, let's try to slow down non essentials\" if you give people more accurate information they can make more accurate decisions. \n\n\nI resented my company at one point. It usually means you're doing to much. I don't know your cost structure but go hire a chief of staff, coo, president etc. Let them run all the average business day to day and only focus where you add unique value. \n\n\n\"If someone took my place I would rather die\" HUGE red flag. You just said \"I don't want to grow and my ego is tied into this\". First at the end of the day this is about a lifestyle and money. There's nothing wrong about being at any size, but if you \"can't\" give up control you are acknowledging you will never scale past your personal bandwidth to make every important decision. I run two companies at the same time I absolutely give up as much work as possible to others. I'm there to inspire and pick strategy. I've already sold companies and lost them I'm at peace with any business.\n\n\n\"My business is like a child and I put six figures into it\" I'm confused is this a net positive venture? have you put in more than you've got out? Is this a viable business or a really expensive hobby? If you got your money out, hour much you put in makes no difference. If it's not cash for positive evaluate why. \n\n\nYes to answer your question I fell back in love my giving up everything I hated doing and dragging my feet on and only do the stuff I love and can add value. Best feeling was coming in when I wanted and leaving when I wanted because I was confident the team had it covered. I also have up control knowing people would do things differently, but it was my job to course correct not gate keep. \n\n\nPractical advise new company policy that every manager has to take off at least 4 days in a row once per quarter. Starting with your self. You need to step away and look at things objectively, and it prevents burnout.",

These things can sometimes overshadow who we really are and what we really should be doing.  I can feel tension in your words and how you dislike the pressure.  What makes matters worse is that you're continuing to work out of obligation.  What I would do is breathe first, remove the obstacles, what if there weren't people depending on me, what if money wasn't an issue, what if I could wake up and do whatever I wanted, what if I started from zero again?  how do you feel? if you don't want to be the CEO without these constraints, then it isn't those things, it's the actual job.  You can also reframe your job, your position, your company, what parts about my job do I still love?  Can I move these things forward and delegate the things I don't love?  If you just absolutely can't find anything that you love, not like, about your job, company, or parts of it, then I would say it might be time to move on.",

          "text": "Reading this, I hear someone whose nervous system has been under sustained responsibility for a long time. Being the person others depend on financially and emotionally activates something very primal. Over time, the work stops being experienced as creative or meaningful and starts being carried as a weight that never really comes off. The trapped feeling you describe often shows up when identity, responsibility, and safety become too tightly bound together. I see this all the time with the people I work with. When the business holds all of that at once, the system rarely gets to rest.  Resentment towards the company and the clients tends to appear when there has been no safe place to express uncertainty or exhaustion. If you’re always required to be the steady one, the honest parts of you get pushed into the background. Over time, that disconnect makes it harder to feel close to the work, even when parts of it are still meaningful.\nMany founders reach this stage because the business has grown beyond the internal structure that originally built it. What worked in the early years can become unsustainable when the stakes are higher and the responsibility wider. That shift often brings confusion rather than clarity, especially when there’s a sense that you should be able to handle it better by now.\n\nChange  is possible, but it usually unfolds once there is more internal safety and less pressure to hold everything together alone. Insight and motivation tend to return after the system feels supported, not before. You’re noticing something very common and real here , and you’re not the only one who reaches this point. Speaking it out loud is often the beginning of a necessary reorganisation, even if the next steps aren’t obvious yet",

It sounds like becoming the \"emotional shock absorber\", risk carrier and decision dumpster for everyone else. And dude, that role drains the joy out of anything, no matter how much you once loved it. Been there...\n\nA big trap a bunch of founders fall into is confusing being CEO with being a \"martyr\". I tell my friends that your team doesn’t actually need you to be invincible. They just need you to be predictable, clear, and definitely have systems in place. Feeling like you can’t say \"I’m tired\" isn’t a personal flaw... it's just a sign that the business depends too much on you.\n\nAnd you know, resenting clients usually is not about passion disappearing either. Most times i'ts a systems problem. When every issue, fire, or request hits your nervous system directly, something is broken either in boundaries, your pricing, your scope, or even delegation. Just try to fix those things once in a while and you'll see it'll bring you instant relief.\n\nMost founders who fantasize about resigning don’t really want out. Deep down they actually can't! They just want relief. And boy, the solution is never  stepping away from the company and much more often stepping away from being the center of everything. If you just try and yourself from day-to-day operations you'll see it'll change the weight of the role massively.\n\nAnd envying salary stability is more normal than people admit. Heck, how many times I wanted to throw everything out of the window?! But you see, employees envy freedom and us founders envy predictability. Both sides are only seeing the upside of the other. The grass is greener...\n\nI don't think that falling back in love with what you built is about motivation or mindset. For me it's more about redesigning the role. Get real honest about the small part of the job you still like to do and then delegate, systemize, or eliminate the rest. If the business can’t survive that, it wasn’t actually sustainable yet.\n\nAnd man, feeling trapped doesn’t mean you failed, even though failing isn't bad at all, it's just another lesson. It just means that your company outgrew the version of you that built it. The next move isn’t quitting. It’s evolving. I'm going through that right now, actually!\n\nKeep it up, man, you’re at the point where hustle stops working and design has to start. PM me if you need to chat!",

This will kill your drive, confidence, and interest in your business. It will make your problems feel insurmountable and the pressure is so great you’d rather stay in bed than figure it out. \n\nWhen your levels are optimized, you actually enjoy the challenge. Struggle and pressure feel good again like it did when you were young and just starting your business. \n\nI’ll tell you something you could do in your business if you feel lost. Just start cleaning it up. Look for messes, chaos, ambiguity, waste, excess, and just starting tidying up. Don’t worry about growth or what’s next. Look at what you have right now and figure out what needs attention. Small stuff from organizing your desktop/inbox, to organizing and painting a mop closet, going over your finances and making sure you’re paying for what you need and nothing more. Look at roles and the org chart to see if it’s still optimal. \n\nIf you spend your time doing Maintence and upkeep on the business, it will run better and be more enjoyable. It will set you up to grab new opportunities when they arrive. \n\nSo that’s my answer. First Work on your health by getting your bloodwork done (use an online men’s clinic btw, primary care won’t help you). Then the follow up is, clean up shop in every way you can.",

While you should not say \"I don't know what I'm doing\", you can bring issues and problems to them so they can help solve them. \n   * They know more than you give them credit for. They know the issues of the businesses and know you are exhausted or burnt out, so stop treating them like they don't.\n   * Meet in an \"all hands\" meeting at least monthly and ask what they see as the top issues and then include them to help solve them. Trying to do it all yourself is not how effective leaders operate.\n* Find and develop a #2. All businesses need a #2 in case you are hit by the proverbial bus. This person will help you which will reduce the pressure on just you as they can share it. Make sure they have skin in the game by offering profit sharing, or some kind of small equity ownership position. \n   * Make sure this is NOT a \"yes person\". Deliberately select someone who has different views or approaches from you. Someone who will stand up and challenge you in private, then come to an agreement and be solidly together in front of the staff.\n   * Over time work to transition authority and key functions to your #2 so you can focus on the business.\n* A saying I learned was that process and planning can set you free. If you're so stressed out then this means you do not have solid planning or robust processes meaning your business is not in your control. \n   * Why is it some businesses run like clockwork, make good profits, and are virtually stress free, while others are chaos and struggle every day?\n   * Process and planning will smooth out your business to take a lot of stress off of you and everyone. \n   * In addition to running smoother, the business will be more efficient, lower expenses, have much better employee morale and customer satisfaction, which all leads to more loyalty and profits.\n* Culture: This maybe should be the top item, but takes the most time and leadership commitment. There is a saying that \"culture beats strategy\" every time. Strategy is great, but in a low performance culture even the best strategy can fail. In a high performance culture even a poor strategy can often succeed.\n   * Develop a high performance culture in your company. This encompasses a lot of the above as it will entail partnering with your employees, trusting them to help identify and provide, then deploy, solutions to the issues facing the business.\n   * Instead of seeing them as someone you have to provide livelihoods for, see them as partners and you are all in this together to win or lose as a team!\n   * There are some great books out there on highly successful companies who thrived because they had a high performance culture, read them and start making this change today.\n\nI could go on, but hopefully this helps!",

It sounds like the old you is standing on the way of the new more powerful you and doesn't let him out. \n\nThe old you has taken too much responsibility for other people's emotions and pain at your own expense. He agreed to things that aren't in your best interests, justifying it with responsibility, but secretly dreading their judgement or disapproval. \n\nAll of this happened because the old you, the younger version of you was conditioned to tolerate certain things you didn't really want to accept, but had to because the alternative was loneliness and disapproval from your parents, teachers, other kids, society and social norms in general.\n\nAnd while the old you felt passionate about the business because it allowed it to run away from the pain, the new you doesn't want to run. He wants to face all the shit you thought was ok but are not really ok. \n\n\n\nHaving no idea what you're doing? Sounds like accepting stories and narratives that you didn't really want to accept but still justified them somehow. Hence the resentment to clients. \n\nFeeling trapped because you feel responsibility for other people's livelihood? But your resentment screams \"it's not your responsibility to carry them if they don't make your business stronger!\"\n\nAnd having no clue how to get to where you want? A clear signal that you know what you have to do, but your mind protects you from all the pain and discomfort the old version of you has gotten into due to his conditioning.\n\n  \nIt sounds like me a few years back, a lot of people I know. You realize the old habits, beliefs, and values keep you chained to serving others in a way that's not beneficial to you or them. \n\nBut you're too scared that others will judge you if you change. That you will be alone (not realizing you already are). That they will hate you and attack you for not doing what they want you to do.\n\n  \nIf I were to give an advice, I'd say just pick one thing that gives you the most disdain and resentment, do nothing and just sit with the feeling. Your mind will tell you what to do. Don't resist it. \n\nYour business is not the end goal, it's your journey to becoming a more powerful version of you. Cut the crap that you know doesn't serve you, feel the pain, don't run away from it, and listen to your mind. It will tell you exactly what you need.",

Would anyone believe he didn't have connections to make it such a success?\n\nHeck, there was one financial guru, who did seem to have a reasonably level head, till he said he bought a Ford GT for \"$0 dollars\".  Yeahhhh, he kinda forgot to mention that it's only \"$0 dollars\" after the car would be sold.  Totally skipping the $275K he still needed to drop on it to get it in the first place, and let the appreciation take care of the 'cost'.  I stopped following him right after that.\n\nI mean, let's not even mention that when was the last time you saw a millionaire posting an add on Instagram to make you rich as well?  Hell, even Tony Robbin's stuff is more about 'feel good' methods than it is about anything else.  Does anyone thing he already doens't have enough money to deal with all the things he's doing?\n\nWhat we need are real guides and practices that actually work for where any of us are in our journeys.  Those are usually not glamorous or necessarily product any kind of significant income.  Most really help you fine-tune what we are(or in some cases are not) already doing.  That's not very 'sexy' to sell.\n\nEven Tim Ferris, and he's about the only one I feels gets it, wrote a book (The 4hr Work Week) was great for the time, but now is dated and now being 'remote' for work is pretty common.  (Not to mentioned being....errr...'enforced' in recent times.)\n\nThose of us who are struggling can't afford a $1000 course, or $200/month for 'group support'.  \n\nIs there an answer out there or someone who really gets it and shares real world facts and assistance that doesn't take away from beginners who are mostly flailing around?

      "text": "When I was choosing an automation tool for my outreach nobody told me exactly why automation is risky, so I decided to share what I figured out testing different outreach tools\n\n\n\n1. One of the most important things is how this tool connects to Linkedin. If its extensions caught easiest, cloud tools use API calls, and Linkedin spot them, desktop software is safer.\n2. Depending on the technology type price changes drastically. Cloud tools cost way more, but often times you pay not for the safety, but for the fancy UI. (no offence if it’s a key feature for you)\n3. Limits, and the way the tool explains them. It’s like the main thing I pay attention to.

Some cheaper ones keep auto-sending follow-ups even after someone responds, which looks terrible and burns relationships fast.  \n  \nAlso worth checking if the tool randomly varies timing between actions. If it's sending connection requests at exact intervals (like every 60 seconds on the dot), LinkedIn's algorithm picks up on that pattern pretty quickly.  \n  \nOn your point about limits, I've found the tools that force you to warm up your account gradually (like starting at 20-30 invites per day for new accounts) are actually the ones that keep you safer long term, even though it feels frustratingly slow at first.  \n  \nOne thing I'd push back on slightly though: automation works best for getting initial connections, but once someone accepts or replies, I've had way better results switching to manual, personalised messages rather than keeping everything in the sequence. The conversion difference is massive.  \n  \nAre you planning to run this yourself or have a VA handle it?",

No matter what kind of business I think about, it feels out of reach because I lack the necessary knowledge.\n\nA few quick facts about me: I’m 30 and I’ve started studying computer science (but I’m still not very good at it).  \nHowever, I’m good at math. I also speak three languages: German, Russian, and English. I can think analytically as well.  \nUnfortunately, that’s where it ends, those are basically all my skills. I’m not writing this because I want to start something only where my skills already are, but just to give an impression of what I can do.\n\nCan anyone give me some tips on what I could do?",

It’s over-complicating the entry point.\n\nDo not look for a big idea. Look for a boring, high-friction service where the current process is manual, slow, or error-prone. Localized data cleanup. Technical translation. Reporting handoffs between teams that do not share a language or system.\n\nThose are broken systems, not glamorous opportunities. That is why they pay.\n\nPick one narrow workflow, improve one step, charge for reliability. Optimize before you invent.",

My efforts were directed at creating a business idea rather than identifying a problem that I could grapple with for a while. I kept requesting “what can I offer?When the better question was Many problems do I tolerate working on every day?”.\n\nThe transition for me was recognizing that being analytical + multilingual + learning CS already puts one in a rare bucket: one can understand technical stuff and explain it across language and culture gaps. It offers a genuine and functional advantage, except it has not yet taken startup idea form.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learnt was to always try and be useful to a specific group of people instead of trying to start a business. I chose a niche, frequented their forums, and responded to questions I didn't feel qualified to answer. Patterns started to develop gradually. The business very much came from that.\n\nAt this point, you aren't required to have a business idea. You require closeness to individuals with messy dilemmas.\n\nIf you had the choice of one group being especially useful to you for the next 3 months   who is it?",

Even with rocket science though you could still probably find something scientists need and would pay for for example ... Point is. \n\nMy best tip would be do something you love. You don't need certifications or anything for it. Forget your skills too. This isn't a \"job\" youre being hired for or vetted for. Most things you'll need for a business you will learn as well by just doing it, so most of your skills are irrelevant most times... Just go with something you've always loved. \n\nSome people like shoes, others like plants. Others construction. Fashion. Business. Teaching. Cleanliness.  Sports. Logistics. Snacks & beverage. Real estate. Manufacturing. Technology. Ceramics. Gloves. Pillows. Wine. \n\nWhat do you like? (Answer in your head this)\n\nIf you for instance like shoes... \n\nSet up a shoe store. Set up an app that finds you custom made shoes for people looking for it. Make a shoe polishing business. Make a business that makes special shoe laces. Make a business that does custom painted shoes. Make a business that exports exotic shoe laces. Whatever you want that you like. \n\nOnce you got that just don't stop, keep going, get into the space meet people doing what you want to do. If you're consistent you can get great results and move past failures and obstacles more easily as well as build a tangible product overtime. Finding product market fit is also a whole other beast... and whatever skills you have or whatever idea you choose will have little to do with actually trying to ship whatever you make out to the world. \n\nIt's gonna take lots of hard work, lots of failures probably, lots of discipline and consistency. If you wanna be in it for the long run pick something you like ideally ... Not just for money, focus on loving what you do. Because you might not see money for a while. \n\nAsking us what you can do is something you should know better than anyone. Do something you like, it's that simple. After you pick something get into those areas. If it's, say, selling shoes. You're not gonna be here with this question. You're gonna be talking to people who are into shoes. So what you're asking here is extremely vague and you won't get much out of it because no one knows you or is you so its not easy. Ideas are abundant. \n\nSo, maybe speak more about what you like. What do you like? Is there something youve always been into? Then we can help turn that into a more viable business to an extent. No one's gonna hold your hand doing anything. So this is the moment you start what is a largely self discovered journey. \n\n No one can give you specific ideas here because only you should know what feels best to you... Choose something you'll have the best chance of excelling at, choose something you like that will make you feel happy when you get that first paying customer and see their smile. Not for the money. But for what you did. Something that will pull you through the hard times. Because things WILL get hard... And it's that light of passion for what you do that gives you that tap on the back to keep going. Money as an incentive is often always really rough (this is the classic give me ideas that make money....). Most people who start for money burn out quick for that reason. Their morale dies out too fast when they don't see money. Only a rare minority gets driven enough by it and actually succeeds. Best tip. Choose what you like. \n\nThe best things of people I've seen done always had some sort of initial passion for it or \"epiphany\" moment doing somethig that ignited a spark. \n\nModern vacuums for instance .. done by a guy who got fed up of his manual vacuum so he went through about 5,000 prototypes to get to what we use today. He probably didn't just sit to ask \"what should I do I need ideas\". Very different process. Lots of the best things done today happened like that. Lots of businesses same thing. \n\n Can change your life if you understand this.",

Only start 1 business, not multiple.\n2. A service Business is for sure your best option.\n3. There are Service Businesses for low and high Skills, cutting some grass is easy to learn, translating between languages is hard to learn. This means, there is no excuse or reason for you to not start *any* business at all, but you should keep in mind that we Entrepreneurs get paied for solving hairy problems. The more uncomfortable the problem and the harder or more annoying it is to solve, the higher are the prices you can ask for.\n\nI think those are the three main points you need to know to get a clear mind and set a focus, but I encourage you to ask me as many questions as you need, in order to make a decision.\n\nFinally I want to be honest with you about one thing, you are not to old to start a business, but it will absolutely become harder for you if you wait any longer. We trade skills for money, if we have no skills, we trade time to learn skills. The older we get, the less time we have each day to invest.",

          "text": "I feel you. I'm 31, and have been trying to build my own business for several years. There's so much generic advice out there. Sometimes I feel like to \"make it\" as an entrepreneur you need a literal invention, funding / bags of cash, or luck. I've not \"made it\" by any means, but I've definitely learnt some lessons so far:\n\n1. To come up with an idea, you need to observe. Dedicate like min 10% of your constant conscious thoughts to entrepreneurial thinking. Why do they do that? Is there a way to make that better? Does a solution exist for this? Stupid example: see a bunch of people sat on the pavement eating lunch when you know round the corner there's empty benches -> do people not have access to nearby outdoor seating area knowledge? Is there an app does / could do this? Vocalise it and stir up discussion within your circle. Most of my friends get lowkey annoyed at how much I do this, but you need to gear your brain to find problems for you to solve. Get used to coming up with lots of ideas, no matter how dumb, because most of them will not make it past the next thing I'm gonna say.\n\n2. Once you have an idea, try your hardest to tear it down. I've spent a year working on something that I was too proud to admit nobody wanted - at least in the way I was delivering it. Don't let ChatGPT put your idea on an imaginary pedestal. Try your best to find out what \\*doesn't\\* work with your idea. Competitors, cost to run it, access to data, or even if people actually want it.\n\n3. Get feedback from possible users. This is my most recent failure. I built something that I was so sure would be useful to people, but never bothered to ask my target users - I thought I'd build it first then market it, and someone would buy it. In reality, it's pretty hard to get your first customers - they want reviews, but everyone's too busy to help give reviews. Still working this one out. I'm going to try offer lifetime free subs for beta testers? If this works I'll check back in and tell you. \n\n4. You need patience. This isn't for everyone and I can't tell you how many times I've felt so sh\\*t about myself and my ideas after another failure or just the grind of having to push on with the dream after so little reward. It's not cost me huge amounts of money - it's cost me my time. Some people might get lucky with knowing the right things or having the right ideas, but not me! I'm in it for the long haul, and maybe by the time I'm 40 I'll get my break.\n\nI have no doubt that everyone can make it in this business, but you need to love it, love the process, and be willing to go the distance. I guarantee you you're more talented than you think, and that you'll uncover the skills you need to make it happen. Believe in yourself, your abilities, your work ethic. I'm sure you can make it happen.",

What was something I could learn quickly, market easily and make some extra money. I ended up landing on Lawn Maintenance, your standard mow, weed eat, edge and blow type if service. My decision to start with this came down to the below: \n\n(1) I’m in an area that grass grows year round, I see the demand is there and I just needed to carve out my little route to make some money. \n\n(2) When doing research the cost to entry wasn’t that high. I have a paid off truck, a small 5x8 trailer cost me $900 brand new, my mower and basic Stihl equipment was able to be financed for 48 months at 0% interest. All in my cost to be able to offer services was around $1500 to start. If you don’t have a truck it’s not bad still, I picked up an F150 with 250k miles for $2500 and it’s been used strictly for my business over the last year.. \n\n(3) It was something I could learn myself. I started with just my yard, my parents, family and friends while I honed my skills. My business only needed to make me $350 to break even and at the beginning I wasn’t worried about my time paying me as it was just the beginning. \n\n(4) It’s easily scalable. Get more yards? Add some help. Get a ton of yards? Hire a few employees and have them run your route. Then you can offer additional services like tree trimming, flower bed cleanouts and remulching that easily bring a few hundred in revenue. \n\n\nMy first year I was on my own, during the last 12 months I went from 12 accounts to 75 accounts, plus added 5 commercial properties. Now I have 2 full time employees that go out 4 days a week and handle everything. As I add new yards I go out and mow them the first time, take pictures of what it should look like when finished and place it on my guys routes. My goal for this year is to get to 150 accounts, run 2 crews and hopefully go hands off.",

          "text": "At one point in my life, I worked in community and civil society initiatives, which put me in direct contact with real problems in underserved areas. Over time, I realized that temporary help rarely changes anyone’s reality but teaching a skill can make a long-term difference.\nThe idea was always simple instead of giving people something ready-made, help them learn how to rely on themselves. When people learn a craft, they create income and preserve their dignity, and that proved far more powerful than short-term aid. This became my understanding of real economic empowerment.\nThat’s when I started to notice the true value of handmade industries, especially traditional kilim weaving, not just as heritage, but as a practical tool for economic empowerment.\nWhile working in this space, I unexpectedly developed skills myself understanding audiences, communicating clearly, reading market needs, and building trust.\nWhat surprised me most was that these skills didn’t just stay on the social side they translated into real, practical, and profitable value in my own business later on.\nI entered the space driven by service, but what I gained in skills and income opportunities was far greater than I had expected.",

                  "text": "At different stages of my life, I worked inside very different Egyptian communities, not from offices or at a distance, but through direct, on-the-ground engagement with people and their everyday problems.\n\nThese experiences took place in socially and economically sensitive areas, many of which had, for years, developed a culture of escape or resignation rather than building.\n\nIn northern Egypt, in villages such as Borg Moghizel, irregular migration became a nearly normalized option for many families, despite the extreme risks and high death rates.\n\nIt was not unusual for a family to send a 14-year-old child to cross the sea. Not because people sought danger, but because they were raised to believe this was the only way out. Alternatives either did not exist or were not understood.\n\nThe real shift began when the logic of intervention itself changed and realistic alternatives appeared on the ground.\n\nSimple but smart initiatives emerged, such as repurposing palm waste into flooring materials, inputs for simple footwear, handmade bags, or even household furniture.\n\nSheep and goat wool was collected, processed into usable yarn, and then transformed into handmade kilims with real market value.\nWomen were also trained in sewing and then guided into small production clusters, with their work connected to real markets.\n\nSome products were supplied to support tourism in Sharm El Sheikh, while others were designed specifically for coastal regions in Libya, tailored to the preferences of local tribal communities, which differ significantly from urban markets.\n\nIn other parts of Egypt, the challenges looked different on the surface but were similar at their core:\nlack of education,\nweak health awareness,\nfamily instability,\nand long-term dependence on aid instead of capacity building.\n\nThe real difference came when empowerment became conditional and clearly structured:\nlearning a skill in exchange for keeping children in school,\nincome tied to maintaining family stability,\nreal opportunities matched with real responsibility.\n\nAt that point, behavior genuinely began to change.\n\nWhen people saw a viable alternative, escape lost its meaning, complaints decreased, and something more important emerged: a sense of capability and self-worth.\n\nThese experiences taught me that economic empowerment is not just a theoretical concept.\n\nHandmade industries, such as traditional kilim weaving, are not only cultural heritage, but practical tools that, when applied correctly, can create income, preserve dignity, and build real stability.\n\nWhat I found most interesting was that a path I entered with the intention of service ended up changing me personally as well.\n\nIt deepened my understanding of human behavior, sharpened my ability to read market needs, and taught me how to build trust instead of relying on quick fixes.\n\nEventually, this translated into direct, practical, and profitable outcomes in my own work.\n\nThis experience taught me that real change, whether in communities or in business, begins when you engage with reality as it is, build from within, and avoid imposing solutions from the outside.\n\nOver time, I also became convinced that none of this could happen through one side alone.\n\nCivil society, which includes people like you and me and anyone willing to work on the ground, and governing systems that have vision and genuine intent for development, are both ends of the same thread.\n\nThis is what I witnessed in Egypt:\nan active civil society,\na government beginning to approach development as a long-term process rather than short-term fixes,\nand citizens willing to participate in positive change instead of escape or resignation.\n\nWhen these elements worked together, the results on the ground were tangible.\nNot perfect, not complete, but real and sustainable.",

So I had like 2 years of coding experience as an AI bachelors student (I'm not an expert by any means), so it was easier for me to get started with vibe coding but for a complete beginner it might be much harder.\n\n4. Web builders feel easy cause they're drag and drop but making a good site still takes experience and time.\n\nThere are other such reasons as well that make this a good opportunity.",

Wasn't trying to build some empire or anything.\n\nWhat blew my mind was how fast the money came in and how HIGH the margins were. Like, 90-100% profit margins when you're solo. No inventory, no shipping, no bullshit overhead. You're just selling what you know.\n\nAnd here's the part nobody talks about... people will pay you INSANE amounts of money to solve their problems faster. I've got clients now charging $40-50K for college admissions help. Another guy helping people get green cards. These aren't sexy businesses. Nobody's flexing about them on Instagram. But they're absolutely PRINTING money.\n\nThe crazy part? Everyone's chasing dropshipping, Amazon FBA, crypto, all this stuff that requires capital and has razor-thin margins. Meanwhile, coaching costs $0 to start and you can land your first client this week if you actually put in the work.\n\nThat's the secret. The boring stuff is what actually gives you freedom.",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

I replaced myself as CEO about 16 months ago and am completely lost. I have built a large business, many in fact. But because I recently I replaced myself with a more capable leader in my largest company and now feel completely useless. I don't run anything anymore. I dont hire/fire. I check in biweekly at most. I almost lost my key staff today because I have been so overbearing and basically not trusting them as well as second guessing decisions. \n\n  \nThey gave me their 60 day notice today, and I refused to take it, instead we agreed that I would work on my seperation/reactive attachment issue. I need to stop interferring with the people that put in charge. We agreed to make goals with deadlines, and if I interfer 1 more time, they will quit. If they dont meet the goals and deadlines that they set, I will ask them to leave.\n\nNow my identity. \n\n  \nMy entire identity for 20+ years has been building and running businesses. I get mailbox money now that I dont earn daily, which sucks trust me. I am having issues in my marriage and home life because I am misrable knowing that I literally have no business purpose any more. \n\nYes. I should be happy. But I am genuinely miserable. I have a beautiful family, beautiful house. I have had more sports cars than most athletes. This is not to boast, its to send a clear message. None of this is or ever made me happy (Except my family, love them! :)).\n\n  \nIm sitting here as a multi-millionaire, with so much business intellect, and 0 outlet. I dont want to make some cheesy course, or consult. \n\n  \nI just want to talk about business, day in and day out, I have owned and invested in so many markets because its all exciting to me. But the internet has created a somewhat nasty reputation to anyone who wants to help people solve problems.\n\nQuestion: \n\n**How if at all, can I genuinely help people when they are building or built great businesses?**\n\nI thought about angel investing and mixing fun content like dave ramsey when people call in, I thought about interviewing other successful people (easy to call on when I mention who I am). \n\nI am not gatekeeping info, Ill help if I can, but the few people that I have tried to help publicly, like instagram and such, just want me to invest. Which I have in the past, but most times I say no. And most times they need someone to hand hold. Not anwer questions.\n\n  \nPlease help GODS of reddit! :D \n\nGenuinely appreciate you for listening",

We give 50% off what we take in currently and just build more assets with the remainder. Its a vicious circle though because those assets spin off even more. Just keep the cycle of giving growing at the same pace.\n\nWe sit down monthly and have our family meeting. We flip through our idea note books and see what's been brought to market by others over time, push research on some ideas, and every once and awhile pull the trigger on an idea we are ready to take to market.

As someone about to finally do something with my LLC I have a million questions and no one to ask them besides strangers on the internet. If your goal is to help people, and not get boring or money hungry pitches all day, I feel like your best bet for fulfillment would be mentorship. Or helping people who aren't even at the investment stage. Watch something grow from just the idea, helping with budgeting and gov docs, taxes etc. Might not be exciting, but if you believe in the person or in the idea, you could scratch that itch without needing to sink all your time and energy into it. Then again, if things not being under your full control is a problem area, that may need to be addressed prior. Alternatively, create. Seems to me a lot of broke creators are really happy, and a lot of rich people tend to lack that outlet. There's a middle ground somewhere I'm sure, but maybe help a music or art teacher scale in exchange for some lessons and material.",

Take the family on vacay to some island.  Go to one of those Tony Robbins seminars in Fiji.  Or just listen to the audio of his programs.  The personal development programs in your case, not the business programs. Trust me it will really help to find out what you want. It sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are now and what you want.\n\nWhat problems in teh world could you solve? If you have that amazing business ability, can you put it toward creating charitable organizations that would truly help people? Here and in other parts of hte world? A spiritual search maybe might aid this.\n\nBut before doing anything it sounds like you need to look inside and figure out who you are at this stage of your life and what that looks like without this or that business. Is that all you are?  If they all went south tomorrow, and you were left with nothing, no businesses, no cars, no fancy house, no fancy clothes, who would you be?  Would you give back?  To who? Would you pick up a long ago abandoned interest or hobby?  What type of person would you be?  What really matters?  Who in your life really matters? What would you notice that previously got lost in the whirlwind. Are you missing things in  life that are right in front of you? Material things come and go, and in the end you can't take them with you. Some major event could happen tomorrow that affects all of it. What's important is the people around us, relationships and what we give back.\n\nOne of the good clarity exercises Robbins talks about is the Rocking Chair test -where you imagine yourself at the end of your days, sitting in a rocking chair, and imagine what you are glad you did and what you regret, and what you regret NOT doing. My paraphrase.\n\nSome therapy is a very good suggestion if you have the right therapist.  Good luck to you.",

We judge ourselves and others by what they do, how much they have, what status they hold etc. Size them up, evaluate them, respect or disrespect them based on that. But is that a real measure of someone?  In some other cultures outside the US, it's considered offensive to ask what someone does for a living.  It's considered more appropriate to ask what someone likes to do or what their interests are.\n\nOne life event, one major disaster that disrupts the economy, one environmental disaster, then none of that matters. For perspective, imagine someone who might have owned a store in Ukraine, or owned an apartment building, or who's been a big shot in this or that. Now those same people are fighting on the front lines together in a town that is unrecognizable.  No one cares if the person next to them was a big shot or an ordinary guy, a saint or a sinner.

I feel like we are right at the tipping point, but not sure we have the capital to make it through. Insurance reimbursements can take a long time to pay out, so while we just had a good month, we are struggling to pay expenses because we are probably 4-6 weeks from actually getting the payments. At the same time we’re reconciling a lower revenue per patient (the reason our revenue isn’t matching our projections). So it seems like the solution is additional locations so we can have a higher patient count, but I might be stuck putting up the capital myself, which I really don’t want to do since I might have to reach into my own pockets to cover expenses while we wait for payment anyway. What do you think we should do to solve current cash flow problems? Try for an AR based loan or something? And what should I do as far as the future of the business? Wait until it can support additional locations on its own? Or fund it myself?",

Tackle hard questions and help contribute to scientific progress where there is a legacy and purpose beyond just profit.\n\nSame with charitable giving in general. Sustainable charity work is hard to come by - supporting charities building systems that benefit their communities and help their members improve their situation is very similar to your Dave Ramsey idea, because those folks aren’t looking to sell a startup for a specific ROI they’re just looking to create a living that improves their life. And mentorship in those spaces is entirely possible. \n\nSimilarly, helping non-profits build a non-donation based revenue stream is something that can feed your need for building while also having a higher purpose than profit. Meaning helping charities be less reliant on donations - as global giving can fluctuate and it helps ensure their long term survival. (They can’t make a profit of course but they can do activities that generate revenue).",

I don't mean make a course and write a book, but maybe spend some time to  figure out both a method and a medium to do it so optimally and smoothly that it becomes part of the infrastructure of your life (a life's style) with your marriage and other actual responsibilities.",

Knowing the mistakes you made, your approach to leadership and where your mental health is, are you really ready to offer mentorship or to start something that is focussed on impact and not income and growth?\n\nThis is a similar story to an acquaintance of mine. He built a business over a number of years and sold it last year. He pocketed millions and stills gets a residual income off the business.\n\nAfter he transitoned out staff moral and employee satisfaction went up, churn went down, quality went up. Despite being a big and busy business he was never able to let the people he hired do the job...he was an angry, overbearing micromanager.\n\nOn the outside he became unbearable to be around. He has spent years working insane hours and only thinking about and talking about business and money. He forgot how to have a day off and keep himself entertained or mentally nourished.\n\nHis kids are now grown up, starting university and absolutely do not need him trying to help...they got this far without dad being a reliable, supportive presence so why now.\n\nHis wife has her own life, hobbies, friends and a job and will probably move out soon.\n\nThey don't have any real memories of being a family together. Family vacations were actually his wife taking the kids on her own while he stayed buried in the business.\n\nOf course he thinks he is the one that has sacrificed so much to give his family a 'life' but I think they would have been fine without the trappings of...things...if they had a better family life.\n\nSo anyway this is a long way of saying to literally go for a walk in nature every day, turn your phone and emails off, play with the kids, do housework, see your friends, have lazy days on the couch, go on a trip...for a year...you are burnt out and have trained yourself to only think one way. You need time away to get perspective and quieten the mental buzzing.",

          "text": "In my opinion, I wouldn’t encourage you to spend your time elsewhere rather than helping startup founders.\n\nInstead, I would suggest maybe buying a lower middle market or smaller company in an industry you enjoy or are curious about, find a capable operator either inside or outside that company, and take a hands on mentoring approach teaching the operator the things that have helped you become success, and the failures you learned. Build that person up, build your business up, rinse and repeat. \n\nThis might allow you the ability to get back in the trenches with small teams, build people back up and mentor them again, and build a portfolio of assets that will cash flow for you.\n\nAs for the team at your current business, one of the greatest lessons I learned from a CEO from a large company, was don’t try and be involved in everything. You hired these people because they are talented, capable, and you have to get out of their way and let them do what they do best. Doesn’t mean you fully walk away, but at that stage you’re prob going to be set at setting direction and objectives and letting them figure it out and execute.",

(Love my small family and the house mortgage :) ) i have originated over $2B in loans, and funded a good enough amount. Still going.\n\nI have done well, but seems like i have not enough time to enjoy just living. I have 20-50 opportunites a day, all requesting funding for thier operations. I want to help and drives me to do so. Its honeslty overwhelming at times. My 2.5 yr old daughter is why i do it. I hope she can have a better life then i did in my war torn childhood. (When i was 9 i was shot. Burried alive in mass grave. Crawled out at night. Over the river and through the woods. Into hands of evil and a concentration camp.) Now i am here for a reason. Funding businesses and solutions is what i am good at, but only enjoy the people who are kind, honest, and really want help from me. 1000s have just tried to use me. 1000s of investors, brokers, banks, etc have \"backdoored\" me.... its been a wild ride, and i have learned a ton. Hopefully one day i can take less on, have a good team to depend on. I do everything myself. From intake calls, strategies, solutions, UW convos, presentations, and work is on my mind 24/7.\n\nIts the challenges of my industry and the rewards are great. But doing it all by myself is going to run me dry one day. \n\nI don't know why I typed all of this out. Thank you for reading. We can always go fishing together If you want.  We can bring the kids! \n\nThat be nice. \n\nEnjoy a bit of time off. Sounds like you and i need just a small vaca. Enjoy the little one. Diper changes with phone in one hand can be a challenge! \n\nLife is short, challenging, and rewarding.  \nHope my story gives you some clearity and comfort.\n\nPeace internet stranger. Dm if you want to chat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, i need thearpy hahaha ... its very stressful!",

          "text": "I’m going through a similar problem. I have a large portfolio of real estate that brings in enough money for me not to have to work. And if I do get a job, the pay will amount to the rent of one of my assets. So a job won’t make sense. So I am stuck in this situation that if I got a job, I will not be able to take care of my assets (some are overseas so I need to travel). But sitting at home drives me nuts. I’ve managed to find a way to survive though.\n\nI go to the gym in the morning. Or I go for a swim. Exercise helps expel all that energy that’s irritating you; all the energy you were using for business. So vacant days are for exercise. Then you will have days where you need to run some errands, like checking up on your businesses. Or you can decide to travel somewhere. Or you can write a book. I’m writing a book addressed to my daughter, for example; and I’m pouring in all my life experiences and giving her advice on life. Even if it never gets published, I can gift it to her. Plus it’s very therapeutic. \nAnd also there’s other things you can get into. I’m in real estate, and I’m itching to try a business. You’ve tried business; why not get into real\nestate? Build something. Buy a building and rent it out. Real estate is great for the kids. It’s easier for them to run a building than a business. And it’s more difficult for your kids to squander a building or real estate assets; very easy for them to squander cash or sell stocks.\n\nYou just need to fill up the first half of the day with something like exercise, or a side project, or writing. Or maybe take yoga classes. Then after lunch, spend some time with family. Or take them out. My father, a retired lawyer, goes to a poetry club every morning, then goes back home for lunch, then brings his friends over for a card game, or he goes to one of his friends and plays cards. He has a driver, and a cook. So his driver takes him everywhere. He has managed to keep himself busy.\nAnyway, good luck. And be sure that the whole busyness phenomenon is a modern thing. Ancient Romans and Greeks used to spend much time in leisure. That’s how philosophy was invented 😂 No need to keep running around. Enjoy life!!!",

And no private equity isn’t just for billionaires. \nBut most billionaires have done it through private equity, also you build long term aswell, you talk business day in and day out and do that? Basically make your empire bigger, instead of consolidating.\nWould get assets for yourself instead of gambling on “markets” you’re a business owner/founder/ceo/entrepreneur, not anything else. \nYou invest in markets that’s basically modern day gambling or secure 10% at most. Unless you’re in that game and have an edge then it’s more iknow. Investing in markets for founders and ceos, should only be done with an edge or capital gains. Stop going for fking 10% at most. Also it’s not an asset in reality. \n\nPrivate equity or a subsidiary company of the current company and build an empire? \n\nInvesting in markets for people like you it’s stupid, iknow we all get the advice and iknow most want you to go through this. But the actuality unless you’re an employee or professional in the markets or have an edge. You should NOT do it. \n\nAssets also that’s gonna make the family happy and yourself in the process, they all want you to be happy and they want to be secure, right now?

To hear your passion and what it has done for you is awesome. I'm sorry you've found yourself in a challenging spot. And it sounds like you've already conquered the hardest part which is being aware. And then taking the step towards fixing it. That's a place many never make it to. \nIf you do decide to mentor-my hand is raised :) But I also think self care is most important now.  I always wondered why there weren't more therapists that specialized in specifically helping people impacted by their career, in some way or another. Because when it's your passion-it affects your soul, that cannot be helped. \nI don't have any better advice than the more experienced people have given.  I'm a 50 yr old newborn entrepreneur.

      "text": "Hello, entrepreneurs!\n\nSo, it's been over a year since I left my job and started working for myself. My main focus is renovating kitchens and bathrooms (doing it for more than 10 years). Have a small team that I've been working with since the very beginning (we were employed together and decided to leave together), and a few more teams that I hired relatively recently.\n\nAt first, attracting customers was not an issue - word of mouth and contacts from my previous job took care of that, but then we realized that we couldn't grow that way.  \nTo solve that we created a website and started social media accounts, but that didn't help much, so we resorted to the services of SEO and SMM specialists. There were some results, but nothing impressive. Something else caught our attention: many customers said they found us in AI search results when they asked for recommendations on who to contact for repairs in California (we are based here). We didn't understand what was going on, but then it dawned on us - some articles from our website were randomly appearing in neural network search results.\n\nHere's my question: how does AI visibility optimization work? Is it possible to influence it in any way? Is it ethical?\n\nAnd this brings up another topic: how much sense does it make to focus specifically on AI SEO optimization to increase LLM brand visibility, instead of classic SEO? Is classic SEO dead in 2026?\n\nIn general, I was very impressed by how many people say they found us in ChatGPT, and now I want to figure it out, but don't understand how it works or where to start.\n\nSorry if my post is too confusing. Thank you!",

LLMs love that because it’s structured, specific, and easy to quote.\n\n\n\nIf you want to lean into AI results a bit more, add:\n\n\\- Clear entities (city, service type, materials, price ranges)\n\n\\- Short FAQs in natural language\n\n\\- Case studies that read like mini stories of actual jobs\n\n\n\nThat feeds both Google and AI. I use Ahrefs for topics, Notion for drafting, and Pulse for Reddit to spot what questions people are actually asking so I’m not guessing.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, your edge isn’t “AI SEO tricks”, it’s stacking the internet with clear answers to questions your best customers already ask.",

They’re reading your content, understanding context, and making recommendations based on relevance not just keyword matching and backlinks.\n\nThat being said there are a few good tools and resources \n\nProfound: This is the most capable automated platform in terms of AI visibility + content creation but the most expensive \n\nWerkHaus.ai: Has free tools and resources so understand AI visibility and GEO they also offer consulting.

He specialized in driveways and decks in suburban neighborhoods. No website, just referrals. Booked 2 months out every spring and summer.\n\n\n\nWhy it works: Low barriers to entry, but high barriers to consistency. Most people start, do sloppy work, or don't show up. If you're reliable and do quality work, customers will pay premium and refer you endlessly.\n\n\n\nSame goes for specialized cleaning (hoods, solar panels), mobile detailing, handyman services. The secret isn't finding a \"gap\" - it's executing on the basics better than everyone else in your area.",

He had 9 trucks by year 2 or 3, and now has a fleet of around 50 and is worth millions! Dude has the biggest \"shop\" you've ever seen and has at least 30 fully restored late 60's Camaros and Chargers, plus several vintage motorcycles. He's either 59 or 60 now, and although he did go through some pain with his injury and a back surgery, it was by far the best thing that ever happened to him. I asked him how he knew to start that business. He said his dad had an old dump truck when he was a kid and made a good side hustle hauling rocks. He had noticed that the trucks from the nearest quarry were driving a good distance bringing gravel back and forth, so it was a breeze getting contracts, and for the most part, he eventually took over an entire section of his state.",

If I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now. Any day off I take is a day I don't get paid. You get the issue.\n\nLast November I started building my first SaaS. Content tool for text-based platforms. Launched it, got some early users, learned a ton. My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\n\nLooking back at the last 4 months? I'm nowhere close.\n\nI'm heavy in tech, 15+ years. I've launched ecom stores before, so I'm not new to building things. But SaaS growth is a different game. It's slow. And I'm impatient.\n\nRight now I'm stuck in this weird middle ground. Freelancing pays the bills but eats my time. SaaS needs time but doesn't pay yet. I can't go all-in on SaaS without the income. I can't grow the income without going all-in.\n\nFor those who made the switch from services to product, how did you actually do it?\n\nDid you reduce client work gradually? Save up a runway and quit? Keep both running until the product caught up?\n\nI also have a family, mortgage, the whole thing. \n\nWhat's realistic here? Am I being naive thinking I can replace $20k/month in year one? When should I kill my SaaS and move on to something else?\n\nAny advice here is appreciated",

Replacing $20k/mo in year one is possible but statistically rare unless you already have distribution or you’re selling a high-ACV B2B product where a handful of customers gets you there.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen work with family/mortgage is: don’t quit, but aggressively reshape consulting. Raise rates, move to retainers, cut scope, and aim for 2 to 3 “good” clients max so you can buy back 10 to 15 hours a week consistently. Then treat SaaS like a pipeline with weekly output targets (customer calls, outbound, content, partnerships), because the real bottleneck usually isn’t building, it’s distribution.\n\n\n\nAlso, don’t “kill” the SaaS based on time, kill it based on signals: if you can’t find a niche that feels acute pain, can’t get people to pay, or churn stays ugly after you’ve iterated with real users. Four months is basically still the learn-what-to-sell phase, so the more realistic question is whether you can get to meaningful revenue in 12 to 24 months while consulting less, not whether you can fully replace $20k by December.",

Raising your rates is such an underused tactic, because all those want-to-bes repeat the \"passive income\" bs because they don't know better.\n\nThere are two paths in your situation and they are not exclusive.\n\n1) Change the terms with your current clients\n\n2) Find better clients\n\n1) I would try to educate them on the benefits of paying a set monthly investment (don't call it retainer) to future-proof your relationship. Tell them you're raising prices 30% for your other clients, but if they agreed to a 12-month contract with a monthly fee, you'd be happy to forego that price increase for them, and only them, because they are such great clients. Blame the change in pricing on your business partner or board or whatever, even if you don't have one.\n\nIf they don't want to commit, raise your rates.\n\n2) Could your clients refer other clients to you? You'd even bump them up into your 'VIP program' for 2 months for free as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOtherwise, go through your list of LinkedIn connections who may be in the market for your service and write to them. You're launching a new service (even if you don't) and thought they may be interested or potentially know someone, and you'd be happy to give a referral fee.\n\nYou could also start posting on LinkedIn, even though it's a slog with the latest changes and takes a long time to get traction.\n\nCold outreach also works.

          "text": "I'm in a similar boat as a B2B service provider. I make roughly the same income and have come to your same conclusion. It doesn't scale. Making me feel basically capped. And the people in my field that do hire people to try to scale, it doesn't go as planned. Ends up just being more stress and responsibility for basically no more income.\n\nBecause of this, I too tried various other things that potentially could scale. Including building my own software.\n\nBasically, nothing else I have tried has made me any money other than me providing my service. And i've tried a lot of things.\n\nAs a result, I am a big fan of building your next move, on the side. Keep your day gig going. It takes a lot of the pressure off. And in the entrepreneurial business, your new venture is much more likely not to succeed than it is to succeed. What would that mean to your finances? For me, it would really really really suck. So I am working on those other ideas on the side.\n\nOne piece of advice I learned to late is, don't build until you have validated that people actually want to buy. Not just interest, not just a clear demand, but people actively trying to part ways with their money for the thing you would build. That's key. Otherwise you will fall into the trap that so many of us fell into. Building something not enough people want. Or, that they do want, just not from you. Or whatever reason people ultimately don't buy. Know that ahead of time.\n\nYes, I think you are being naive thinking you can replace $20K/month in 5 years, let alone 1 year. OF course it's possible. But it's exceptionally rare. Don't base your livelihood on an the stars aligning.",

No it's not obvious and you have to do a lot of work to do that. But you're missing the part where if you stop looking at the path of others there is a great path to scaling for a services companies that isn't explored much. Actually, that's my focus right now.\n\nBut in your shoes, you should first try to get fixed price contracts. It will help you get exact clarity on the value you're providing and what you want to do. From there you'll also own any value from any improvements to your processes and IP that you implement. From there focus on creating IP to make yourself faster. Even consider hirin someone to help you. Technically you're still needed but in the process you are productizing your consulting work. Your knowledge and skill is getting documented in your IP. It alo means you can get a lot more value from a junior implementor.\n\nIP that helps you work faster is just as much valid IP as IP that you sell directly to customers. Hell, AWS is more valuable than the store Amazon even though it's start was IP that was just an internal tool.

          "text": "I’m on the same journey, similar circumstances. In my 7th year. Started as 100% consulting in something I had direct experience in, and I slowly started building a product, starting end of year 1. I couldn’t build a product to replace what I did exactly, but I could build one to supplement the services I offered.\n\nI would do the normal contracts, then see if I could sell the product to solve a small but recurring pain point. It was a small problem to solve, but necessary, so while the subscription revenue was small it wasn’t too hard a sell.\n\nI found it was more important to get my foot in the door as a SaaS vendor than to worry about the money. Because, over time, the product features grew and I already had the relationship. Upselling is often much easier than new sales. \n\nProduct development started to turbo charge early last year, thanks to LLMs, while development cost flat lined or even shrunk. It was difficult to find time to code when I had high paying billable work, so it happened in spurts throughout the year during otherwise slower periods. \n\nI did have an employee who both consulted and coded, they were an entry level hire so while it took a lot of time to train them, they weren’t too expensive while having low utilization. I too had projects only I could do, for whatever reason, so I had to win new, smaller ones, for him. While he certainly helped move the product along, 4 years and many raises in, he was mostly break even and started to under perform, resulting in him being let go. \n\nI hired a part time engineer and an in house accountant-trained-consultant, both off shore. Engineer was good, though financially questionable decision given SaaS revenue. Accountant/Consultant was the best decision I ever made. \n\nUltimately picked up most of the development myself as my employee gained enough experience to replace me on 60% of work. \n\nThe consulting we do, while still majority of revenue, has fully transitioned to consulting on an area of past experience, to 100% on our own product about 3-4 years in. Great for sticky customers and flexible staffing. By year 4 or 5 it all felt stable. \n\nLong story short, diversify customer base and hire / train. Cut back on expenses and re-invest as much as you can into training and product dev. It’s risky, especially if someone you train for a year leaves, or turns out to be a bad fit, but it works. Plan in terms of 3,5,7,10 year milestones, and don’t expect big results in weeks or months. \n\nAt least, this was my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️",

          "text": "While I don't have one concrete answer for your questions, what I believe would help you is breaking down you situation/problem and try solving it part by part. You ask a few different (and some contradictory) questions. So I'll try to do that and challenge some of your statements (feel free to react/challenge/reject anything that doesn't make sense to you).\n\nFirst, you say \"it doesn't scale\". My question to you: why do you want to scale? It may sound like a \"duh\" question but I genuinely wonder where that comes from (you want a different lifestyle, you want more money, you think it that's the logical next step -- what's your personal reason/need behind it? What is truly pressing you?). I seems it's because \"freelancing pays the bills but eats my time\". and you'd like your income not to depend on the hours you work (fair enough). But how would you like to spend the hours you save? Or are you happy to work same or more hours, but you want to scale your income overall?\n\nSecond, besides \"replacing your income by the end of the year\", were there any other reasons you launched the SaaS? Is it a passion of your, or maybe you saw a unique opportunity? Did you perhaps see yourself enjoying the new challenge or did it validate your expertise in a certain way? (Just a few examples). When building is slow, it helps to reconnect with the internal motivation (not just external e.g., I want this to solve my income scalability)\n\nNow the core part: you say \"My goal was to replace freelance income by end of this year.\" and \"I'm impatient\", and \"I'm nowhere close.\" after a few months. This signals to me that there's a certain degree of inflexibility in how you're approaching your situation likely because (bear with me) you have beliefs that clash with reality. I'm seeing that a lot in my own business journey too. What has helped me is adjust my expectations and beliefs of \"this must be done in x way, by x time\". I wonder if this resonates with you.\n\nNet, I sense you're stuck in a binary thinking of \"I must either go all in on the SaaS (but I cannot because I need the money from freelancing) or kill the SaaS, so which one is it?\". In reality, there are always more than 2 options but sometimes it is hard to see them. What makes these the only two options in your mind now? What other (interim) solutions could be possible? If your friend was in this situation, what opportunities would you see for them?\n\nFor example, you say \"I want to scale, I need to hire, and where I'm based, that's not an option right now\"- I wonder if this is fully true. If employing someone is truly a solution, then there could be location-independent ways to get some external help. Perhaps you'd need to compromise your profits for a certain time but you'd gain time to invest in the SaaS or elsewhere. It depends on what is the minimum income you'd need to be stable and what part you can give up temporarily.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you are actually in a fractional employment role. You're building a product so you'd diversify your income (which is smart). I'm a strong advocate for \"portfolio careers\" where income comes from a combination of freelancing, consulting, a digital product, a course/book, and a fractional role.\n\nPerhaps what you need to solve right now is not how to move from fractional role to SaaS business but how to keep both running without burning yourself out?",

Too risky.\n\nAlso consider: your SaaS doesn't need to replace 21k. It needs to replace your minimum viable lifestyle. What's the actual number where you're fine, not comfortable but fine? That's your real target.\n\n4 months is nothing for SaaS. Most take 18 to 24 months to get real traction. The ones that blow up fast are survivorship bias.\n\nDon't kill it yet.

Here's what actually worked:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The uncomfortable truth first:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYou probably won't replace $20k/month SaaS income in year one. The realistic path is more like: maintain consulting income as long as possible while building product leverage, then gradually shift the ratio as the product proves itself.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What the successful transitions I've seen look like:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Don't quit consulting - productize parts of it first\\*\\*\n\n   \\- What repetitive deliverables do you give clients? Can any become templates, tools, or automated solutions?\n\n   \\- Your existing clients are your first potential SaaS customers or at minimum your beta testers\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*The \"runway\" question is the wrong frame\\*\\*\n\n   \\- Instead of \"save X months then go all-in,\" think \"reduce consulting hours by 20% when SaaS hits $2k MRR, then by another 20% at $5k MRR\"\n\n   \\- This gives you feedback loops instead of a cliff\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Kill criteria for the SaaS:\\*\\*\n\n   \\- If after 6 months of consistent effort you have < $1k MRR and flat/declining growth, that's a pivot signal\n\n   \\- But \"4 months and nowhere close\" might just mean you haven't found distribution yet. SaaS growth usually doesn't start until month 6-12\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Specific tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Raise your consulting rates by 20-30%\\*\\*: Either clients pay more (giving you more runway per hour worked) or some leave (freeing up time). Win either way.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*Shift to retainer-only consulting\\*\\*: Project work is unpredictable. Retainers give you predictable income AND time blocks.\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*One day per week non-negotiable\\*\\*: Protect SaaS time like a client meeting. If you don't, consulting will always eat it.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The family factor:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nWith mortgage and family, the \"quit and figure it out\" stories aren't your playbook. The boring answer is: you do both, longer than feels comfortable, until the SaaS can actually support you. Usually 18-24 months, not 12.\n\n\n\nWhat does your SaaS do, and what's your current MRR/user count after 4 months?",

It was the word \"automation.\"\n\nBusiness owners hear \"automation\" and mentally check out. It sounds like a buzzword from someone trying to sell them something they don't need.\n\nSo I changed the pitch entirely.\n\n**Before:** \"I'll automate your lead generation and follow-up workflows\"\n\n**After:** \"Your team is spending 15+ hours/week on lead research and follow-ups. I can cut that to 2.\"\n\nSame service. Completely different reaction.\n\nWhat I learned selling to SMBs ($3M-10M revenue):\n\n1. **They don't buy technology. They buy time.** Never lead with your tools. Lead with the hours they're wasting.\n\n2. **Show the math.** \"Your admin spends 20 hrs/week on X at $25/hr = $2,000/month. My service costs $500/month.\" That's a conversation they'll have.\n\n3. **Stop pitching solopreneurs.** They'll say \"I can do that myself\" every time. Target businesses with 10-50 employees where the pain is real and the budget exists.\n\n4. **Warm leads crush cold lists.** I started pulling leads from competitors' social media engagement instead of bought lists. People who comment on your competitor's content already care about your space.\n\nResults after the switch:\n- Cold email conversion: 0.5% → 2.3%\n- Average project value went up because I was talking to bigger companies\n- Closing time dropped because the value prop was immediately clear\n\nThe irony: I'm selling the exact same thing. I just stopped talking like an engineer and started talking like a business owner.\n\nAnyone else here sell services and struggle with how to frame the pitch?",

Meanwhile the 100k/6k margin business is a full-time job with 10 employees and a Slack that never stops pinging.\n\nI think people confuse \"big revenue number\" with \"successful business\" because that's what gets attention. VCs care about revenue. LinkedIn influencers post screenshots of revenue. But unless you're trying to raise money or sell the company, revenue is just vanity metrics.\n\nThe real flex should be \"I work 10 hours a week and net 8k/month\" not \"I work 80 hours a week to keep a 100k/month revenue machine from collapsing.\"\n\nYour test at the end is perfect - if you turned off paid acquisition tomorrow, would you still have a business? If not, you don't own a business, you rent customers from Facebook.",

The when varies hugely, but at some range of time in every biz life cycle, profits don't matter.  A theoretical great profit margin on sales you aren't making doesn't get you anywhere good.  You have to find traction before you find profits.  So I'm happy to give an attaboy to anyone hitting early sales goals.  \n\nI had 4 interconnected bizes, $250M ARR at the peak, and 3 of them were never far above break even.   Profits weren't the goal.  Every penny of cash we had was cycled back into bizdev ( govt contracting speak for sales and marketing).  The bizes were grown to be sold and one of the metrics for biz valuation was 1x sales.  We wanted sales more than profits.  My partner and I were not even the highest paid employees because our short term personal income was not the priority.   \n\nYour advice fits a lot of businesses, but there's very good reasons that it won't fit all businesses.",

Back then, listening to such words, I always thought I would not be that guy. Today, I am pushed into a corner where I am afraid to do anything or try out something new, and I can feel the walls closing in.\n\nI am doing deliveries and other blue-collar gigs because it makes me happy, and it’s the only time I don't think about my failure. Looking back, I think I had a big ego when I had success. I loved being generous and taking care of people, but being in a position where I'm not able to do so, I don’t want to face anyone.\n\nMy brain is not able to think big right now or come up with ideas; it is in a stagnant state, I feel. And I think I went out of business at the worst time possible, because even the job market in IT is fed up.\n\nWhat I’ve learned during this time upon reflecting:\n\n* I truly understand the essence of networking.\n* Grit doesn’t always mean things will go well; you need a pragmatic thinker on your team who talks to you openly.\n\nAnyways, I have decided, in this Arab?Arabi?c restaurant, that I am going to start again. I have nothing to lose. I am starting at 0 today; 0 capital and 0 funding.\n\nJust my laptop, a roof over my head, and my bike. My trusty bike, the only thing putting food on my table right now. I love my bike; a stupid machine on two wheels, haha.\n\nI don’t have the \"big idea\" yet. I am going to take a different approach to building this time, something that gets me from 0 to 1. I will actively work on getting there rather than waiting for a light bulb moment.",

Like, properly wrong. I said as much, but my boss wouldn’t listen. So we hired her.\n\nThree months in, she had completely fucked up what used to be a genuinely healthy work environment. People started turning on each other because of the rumours she was quietly feeding them. Whispering poison into ears, one by one. It later turned out she’s a massive narcissist with a long history of burning workplaces to the ground, not literally, obviously, but functionally.\n\nI left four months after she was hired. Not because of her, actually, I got a better offer. She’s still there three years later. By now she’s like some sickly little spider, tucked into the centre of her web, and people are genuinely scared of her.\n\nThe boss, though? He likes her.

Lives in a small town in northern WI. \n\nShe did this first as a way to get a free trip but makes decent (not great money) - would be perfect for a 2nd income for people with flexibility. These tours routes already exist. She lives in Northern Wisconsin. Trip #1 was Branson, MO. took her a while but found companies who put this all together.  She didn't put anything down but blocked a bus 9 months in advance. Went to every old person event in her town, neighboring towns, talked to senior groups, etc. They asked her what she got out of it - she got a free trip if she got 20 signups (true) but if the bus got over 40 (IIRC) everyone beyond that number was 50% profit to her.  Trip 1 she got like 30 people - and she didn't do a thing but enjoy the trip and helped wrangle people with the tour guide (college girl).  \nTrip 2 was easier as something like 75% of them who went before signed up with her again (following fall) and filled the bus. Trip #3 filled again.  Over time she built a network.  She gets about $10k/trip and does 2 trips in spring and fall. She also gets commission/referral to a travel agent that people use for Disney/Europe etc. Don't know exact numbers but was told she makes $60k annually, loves it and is grooming her daughter.  \n\nShe could probably do more if she spent some money on facebook ads to supplement her in-person visits.\n\nTyping this out has me wondering why I don't do it.",

I once spent 3 hours at dinner listening to him giving me a line by line breakdown about how much he hated Quickbooks. \n\nThe reason why you hear about crypto, dropshipping, and AI so much online is because most people who think they're interested in making money, are looking for ways to make money without much work. Everything you listed is easy to create a course to sell to those dreamers. \n\nMeanwhile there are thousands of possible businesses. \n\nIf you are interested in a local service business - ask ChatGPT for a list of local professions. Then start Googling them. Pay attention to every business in every strip mall area you drive by. Look at every vehicle that has a business name on it. \n\nResearch \"boring businesses\" - this was the hip entrepreneur term for 2025. It means businesses like lawn care that can earn alot of money but doesn't get the press the way an AI startup will. \n\nAnother option -listen to My First Million episode 779 - about franchises. There's 4000 different franchise concepts available. Many are not restaurants. \n\nGreg Isenberg launched ideabrowser. Everyday they post a business idea. They're always unique but once you read them you think \"yeah, he's right.\" Example from last week - building a database of where people are buried. It's a real problem. Not sexy.

Then the willingness to pay is actually insanely high. \n\nThe market is saturated at the low end, but there’s still a real shortage of high-quality execution. 2D/3D rigging is a great example: top-tier riggers are expensive and booked out for months.  \n\nI am personally in the ai companion space for example. There are a quite a lot of them just simple ai wrappers just there for a quick buck with insanely high churn rates. But now if you really understand anime fans and actually designs around anime fandom culture (collecting, community, roleplay, stories), there’s room to build something people stick with. In my case i am getting pretty good roi in what i spend in ads and so on. \n\nAnyways, the market is great if you can create something high quality or offer high quality services .",

          "text": "Hmm there are a few to be honest that either we have currently running. Here are the ones I can think of:\n\n* Email & linkedin automation to generate leads: We have used tools like Clay to automate outbound emails and linkedin DMs to let them book a call with our sales team! This was something our team used to manually do- but automation has basically allowed them to take more sales call without worrying about this repeative task that used to take atleast 2 hours daily! Massive savings imo\n* SEO automation: Again, we noticed our SEO agency was basically just looking at our Google search data and industry keywords to come up with content answering specific questions customers were already asking on Google so that we became the top result! We were easily able to automate this using AI tools like Frizerly to get the same results for 1/10th the cost! This also translates to getting mentioned on both ChatGPT and AI overview as the go to tool for various questions! So again, this is saving us both agency fee and getting us actual customers over time!\n* Support automation: Once of the core problems we have had is customers often dont real our FAQs or website and ask the same question over and over again! Using tools like Sierra, we have been able to instantly auto resolve these questions! Others are still routed to a real support person! Saves our support team so much time now!\n* Quarterly Customer Reports: Lastly but not least, we used to send quarterly report presentations to all our customers based on our analytics for our tool helps them with to show ROI basically! We have been able to automate this almost completely using Gamma! We still review them and make ended before sending it their way- but saves 80% time for our team!\n\nFollowing to see what else others have been automation :)",

It's felt like death by admin 😂\n\nSo we didn’t automate work, like the actual PR or press stuff. We automated *t*he admin stuff around it One inbox for media. Auto-labels so you could tell at a glance what was urgent. A simple alert if mentions jumped suddenly. Approvals forced into one path instead of “can someone sanity check this?”\n\nThe payoff wasn’t a bunch of time saved on spreadsheet stuff.

I made a tool for myself where I just enter my client's website, and it just spits out a fully revamped website that I just paste into Lovable. So I'm just mostly copy-pasting now, and prompting maybe a bit here and there, but often times I don't even prompt. \n\nThis allows me to give clients free homepage redesigns because its now quite fast for me. It's getting a lot of orders, nearly daily, but I wouldn't say its like super high ROI. \n\nI'm still new to sales, and web design, so I have to communicate better in my emails, and say the right things, but at least I'm seeing traction now. \n\nSo I can't say for sure if this path is super solid. But from what I'm intuiting, now that I'm getting clients (for free homepage redesigns daily) is that I can now move on to the phase where I'm focused on improving my selling skills, etc. \n\nI think also web design is hot now because of Gemini 3 Pro. Like the websites Lovable makes is pretty okay. They trained a small custom model to keep it cheap from my understanding. But Gemini 3 Pro is so amazing at website design. Try it out. That's what made me want to offer that to clients, and the excitement is pretty high for the free homepage redesigns. \n\nFor context I used to offer phone agents, and cold email engines. I would get like 2 replies per month from my cold emails. And many would just have negative sentiment to my cold emails. But with free homepage redesigns, people are actually excited, and appreciative, mostly because you're doing something for free (another key thing) and its something they need. \n\nSo when you talk about high ROI, I think we need to think in terms of a funnel. My focus is solving one part of the funnel at a time. If you just want high ROI, you're going to feel lost because the whole funnel is like a system you need to design and tweak. High ROI = improving every part of the system, not just the automation you offer. I'm still yet to see how this plays out, but I feel like I solved one part of the system now.",

Many people try to think or plan their way into action (increase success chance and lower effort), so you go through a loop of alternative action (productive procrastination) as a way to avoid the real task.\n\nThe answer: listening and learning to see what part of your mind is talking.   \nIm glad that you got out of the loop this time, but this anxious avoidant part of the mind will try to strike again.   \nThink of your mind as different parts of you. The brain loves being efficient, and doing as little action as possible. So it will first use distractions (craving to watch content or daydream). Secondly, it will use emotions (Tiredness when you sit to work, brain fog). Third it will use logic (\"I can take a cheat day\" or \"Maybe it would be better if I planned X out\"). Lastly it will try to use any addictive or paralyzing thing on you (becoming horny, anxiety, mental breakdown, heavy brain fog)  \n  \nYour goal: Find where the mind is leading you with every thought and emotion, it's not always on your side.  \nDiscipline (scientifically) is actually just the act of observing these conflicts of interest, the longer you see that your brain works this way, the better chance you have at not falling for its tricks, and doing what's correct. Learn to find the pattern of logic and anxiousness that leads away from your one very clear goal (make $100k, get 10,000 users) just have a clear goal and don't let any logic get in that way\n\ndm if you want any more advice or details",

Your brain rewards you for it. Meanwhile, actually launching means exposing yourself to rejection, criticism, and the possibility that your idea doesn't work.\n\n  \nThe single page constraint is a good forcing function. Another one that works: define what \"done\" looks like before you start planning. If \"done\" is \"I have a customer paying me money,\" then every planning activity has to directly lead there or it's wasted motion.\n\n  \nWhat i've noticed: people who struggle with over-planning often have a hidden belief that if they just plan well enough, they can avoid failure. But failure isn't optional - it's the feedback mechanism that tells you what to fix. The 50-page plan is trying to skip that step, which just delays the learning.\n\n  \nThe uncomfortable truth is that your first customers don't care about your plan. They care about whether you solve their problem. You only figure that out by talking to them.",

On the site itself just make sure your city and service keywords are in the page titles and headings naturally. Like \"Nutrition Coaching in [Your City]\" type stuff.

      "text": "This might piss some people off, but I need to say it. I ran a personal branding agency for three years. I had clients, I had a team, and I made decent money. I called myself an entrepreneur everywhere, on LinkedIn, on Twitter, and even in my Tinder bio. One day, a friend asked me a simple question: “What happens to your income if you stop working for two weeks?” I said, “It stops.” He laughed and said, “Bro, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re self-employed with a fancy title.” That hit me hard. When I really thought about it, I realised my agency was mostly just me trading time for money, only with a few extra steps. I was not building an asset and I was not creating something that could run without me. I was basically a freelancer who hired other freelancers. The uncomfortable truth is that, in India, almost everyone with a laptop and two clients calls themselves an entrepreneur, agency owners, freelancers, even people who made one dropshipping sale. The word has been watered down so much that it has started to lose its meaning. To me, real entrepreneurs build systems that create value without their constant involvement, build assets that can be sold, and take real risk with capital, not only with their time. Running an agency taught me many useful skills, but it also taught me one important lesson: being busy is not the same as building something. I am not saying agencies are bad, I am only saying that having clients does not automatically make someone an entrepreneur. It is a different game. I am still trying to figure out what real entrepreneurship looks like for me, but at least now I have stopped lying to myself. Anyone else had this realisation, or am I being too harsh on myself and others?                                                                   ",

You're building your skill-set, you're building your _name_, you're building yourself.\n\nMaybe you are the product currently, and without you there's no business, but that is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nThe easiest way for you to become an entrepreneur would be to hire an employee, and to teach them your way of working, now you've got two products generating income for your company. When you start scaling up to 5+ people it starts to make sense to take stock of what work there is in your company, and who should do this work, but for now it's all stuff you've done, which means you should be able to teach someone how to do it.",

              "text": ">easiest\n\n>hire an employee, and teach them\n\nIMO you've just actually described one of the most *difficult* things to pull off in a service business. You essentially need to productise the service, experience good and bad recruitment, adjust KPIs to align with margin requirements, monitor and implement quality controls, codify all knowledge into processes. These things take YEARS to get right.\n\nI'm all for encouraging OP, I think it's great they're aware of what they want and what their gap is. But I think it's a hard journey to go on that I see many founders struggle with. In fact, it's more common for me to meet founders that are still delivering the sales/service, than those that have largely freed themselves.\n\nI believe setting expectations is important so that OP can prepare themselves for what's next and ask themselves if it's worth the struggle (like you said - nothing to be ashamed of being a freelancer).",

The real shift happens when you start building something where the value isn't you - a product, a system, a brand that works while you sleep. Agency work is great for learning what people will pay for, but at some point you gotta take those learnings and build the machine instead of being the machine.",

          "text": "I don’t think you’re being harsh. I think you’re being precise, and precision can feel uncomfortable when it removes comforting labels.\n\nWhat your friend pointed out is real. Many people, especially online, use “entrepreneur” to mean “I don’t have a boss.” But independence and entrepreneurship aren’t the same thing. Self-employed people sell their time. Entrepreneurs build something that can keep creating value when they step away. Different games, different rules.\n\nThat said, I’d be careful not to swing too far into self-flagellation.\n\nRunning an agency is not fake work. You learned sales, delivery, hiring, client psychology, cash flow, and responsibility. Those are not trivial skills. The mistake isn’t that you ran an agency. The mistake would be thinking those years were wasted because the business wasn’t an asset.\n\nMost people who eventually build real leverage start exactly where you did. They first trade time for money. Then they notice the ceiling. Then they get uncomfortable. That discomfort is usually the signal that it’s time to evolve, not to invalidate the past.\n\nAlso, the definition of entrepreneur is a bit more nuanced than social media makes it. Plenty of real businesses start as time-bound services and only later turn into systems, products, or sellable assets. The transition is the hard part, not the label.\n\nThe important shift you’ve already made is this one: you’re no longer confusing being busy with building something. That’s huge. Most people never catch that.\n\nInstead of asking “Was I ever really an entrepreneur?”, a more useful question might be “What would need to change for this work to become an asset?” Systems, productization, delegation, or eventually moving beyond services entirely.\n\nYou weren’t lying to yourself before. You were early. Now you’re clearer. That’s progress, even if it doesn’t feel flattering yet.",

Acquirers and investors call this \"key person risk\" - if the entire business depends on one person's time and relationships, it has near-zero sellable value. The uncomfortable math: an agency doing $300k/year with you working 60 hours a week isn't worth 3x revenue to a buyer. It's worth close to nothing, because the revenue walks out the door when you do.\n\nThe good news is you identified the right problem. The next step is asking: what systems, processes, or assets could generate revenue without my direct involvement? Even in services businesses, there are ways to build value - documented processes, recurring contracts, trained teams that can operate independently. That's when you shift from building a job to building equity.",

Of course there’s a spectrum, but it will only change how fast it happens, not IF it happens\n\nalso we call entrepreneurs to a big bunch of people that take vc money and drives it into a wall never creating a real business. So, that merits the word more than your real business that depends very intimately on your work? I don’t think so\n\nbut in the end is as a lot of people said: dont worry about labels, be thoughtful and introspective about what you want in life and do what you believe will take you in that direction, all the rest is noise and perspectives",
