      "text": "I run a small online plant shop, mostly succulents and stuff for apartments. Been doing it for about 2 years, decent side income that turned into my main thing last year. Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

We had some old windows the glass had been take out of and never really did much with them, so she cleaned them up and spray painted one side black and let it dry. Then she would find the perfect web and spray it gently with white, and before it could dry she would \"walk\" through the web with the black sheet of glass so the wet paint would firmly apply the web to the glass. She let it dry and then put the top piece of glass on and it was done except for the frame. She did one huge web on a large piece that came out almost perfect and sold it for $3,000.",

September to now is four months and you're claiming you went from one random request to 20-30 monthly clients purely from Instagram engagement with zero advertising. That's not organic growth that's either paid promotion you're not mentioning or fiction\n\nAlso the margins being \"insane\" on something that takes 3 hours per piece at $95 means you're making like $30/hour before materials and overhead. That's fine but not exactly revolutionary income compared to selling plants\n\nThe whole story reads like you're setting up to sell a course on \"how I built a 6 figure dead plant business\"",

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent. Many of the old business greats I had one thing in common.And that is, they sat on a mountain of cash.",

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Nothing viral. Just showing up.\n\n2) He kept his online presence extremely simple One page that made it clear who it was for and what problem it solved. No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out. No automation.\n\n4) He didn’t judge results quickly He mentioned that most of the benefits only showed up after sticking with it longer than felt comfortable.\n\nI’m curious if others here have seen similar patterns, or if this breaks down at some point.",

Scale and automation only helps once you have a manual workflow that is nailed down really well.\n\nIf you are getting started, assuming you have a product that actually solved a problem, first identify your ideal customer persona! Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage. Ideally you will find one that outperforms rest! Once you have this channel you can essentially scale up till it breaks. Once it breaks, you kinda have to repeat the process all over again. But that doesn't usually happen until you cross $1M in revenue etc!\n\nHope this helps :)",

The manual phase sucks but it's where you figure out what actually resonates.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add is the type of content matters a lot in that first phase. I spent way too long posting general advice that got decent engagement but zero clients. What shifted things was posting actual examples from deals we were working on. Redacted screenshots, specific objections we handled, what changed our close rate that week.  \n  \nIt was less polished but people could tell it was real. The replies became actual conversations instead of \"great post\" comments.  \n  \nThe other thing about keeping outreach manual early on is you learn so much faster. I could see which hooks got responses, which industries ghosted us, what follow-up timing worked. When you automate too early you just scale what doesn't work yet.  \n  \nWhen you say he replied to people who engaged, was he jumping into comment threads or sending DMs after they interacted with his posts?",

      "text": "Started flipping luxury watches about a year and half ago. I started with 25k of my own capital from my day job. Eventually I put in up to about \\~70k of my own funds (owners capital) to grow the business. I started with no funding, no mentor, no one in the business and no courses. Lost 2k on my first 2 watches in 2024. Lost another 8k later that year. I mostly sell Rolexes and luxury brands. Nothing under 1k. Average watch price is around 10k.\n\n2024 - First 6 months:\n\n\\- 561k in sales\n\n\\- 22k gross profit\n\n\\- 13k net profit\n\n2025 - One year:\n\n\\- 1.2m in sales\n\n\\- 87k gross profit\n\n\\- 63k net profit\n\n\\- \\~8k payroll (salary to myself)\n\nIve been wholesaling pretty much everything. Fast flips. I aim for 6-12% margins, depending on how long I’m holding a watch. I’ve lost a few times, can count on one hand probably. I’m trying to get to a point where I’m making a consistent 10k / month net, after all expenses including my salary of 1k / month.\n\nI do some social media / marketing but very little. Trying to really focus on that this year so I can sell to more retail clients for a healthier margin. As well as buy more watches from retail clients.\n\nIt’s been really fun and I love watches and enjoy getting to wear them while I try to sell them. I still have my day job and don’t think I’m going to quit anytime soon.\n\nJust wanted to share this. If I missed anything or any questions just ask below. I’m going to try to post regular updates to track my progress and engage with others as I have never done it before. \n\nThanks!",

I’ve sold some on Instagram, eBay, fb marketplace, reddit. \n\nI don’t service all my watches especially since they are mostly going to other dealers. I also try to only buy modern watches (less than 5 years old) which helps me avoid a service. Ive definitely (edit, typo) had to service a few older watches I’ve bought. \n\nYes, got scammed for a fake when I first started. That’s how I lost 8k my first couple months. Definitely a costly lesson. I avoid it now by authenticating every watch myself. The one I got scammed for was authenticated by a watch store that didn’t even open up the caseback to look at the movement. I authenticate everything myself now and if there’s anything remotely fishy about the watch or buyer I pass on it. \n\nExpenses include platform fees (dealer groups), shipping, payroll (1k/mo salary to myself), watch servicing, office supplies (tape, boxes, material, etc.) some marketing/advertisement, some banking fees (wire fees).",

One the one hand you could just use paperwork/documentation. On the other hand, you mentioned opening up the caseback and observing the movement as a way to authenticate. I wouldn’t be confortable doing that to a $10k watch lol. ",

I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

I'm just glad I didn't lean into that.  Writing things down, putting it to my calendar for reminder, documenting steps, recording everything in Notes and recording expenses close to when they happened felt slow and unnecessary when everything was still small.   \n\nWhat I learned pretty quickly is that catching up never really works.  Once a few days pass, context disappears and you start guessing - both with decisions and with numbers.  Having things written and financials recorded in real time made the real friction visible instead of hidden. \n\nIt wasn't about being organized for the sake of it.  It slowed me down early, but it saved me from undoing a lot of assumptions once things got more complex.  Also, retracing back the steps is more time consuming than you'd expect.",

Rent looked manageable, but commute and other fixed costs hurt way more when revenue was still shaky. I overestimated my network. People were supportive but lacked authority or budget. Later learned to qualify leads properly (BANT), which saved a ton of wasted time. Started with service-based pitch templates. Eventually realized clients don’t care about services, they care about their problems. Switched to question-based discovery instead.  \nGood things also happened that i got freelancers on board instead of full time employees. It helped me a lot to save on cost as well as avoid liabilities. For scaling up i outsourced to third party companies, it doesn't always helps to cut costs (sometimes margins are too narrow to make any profits) but it does helps to acquire big or multiple projects at a time or to open new channels.",

Your team will feel empowered by the enhanced responsibility and will take accountability in a way that is hard if the founder is hovering, exhausted and exhausting. The team feels strong and safe here. They are empowered by the space and trust you have given, and they feel safe knowing that you are doing your job which includes ‘firefighting’. Calm, collected and available for whatever is needed, while recognizing that delegating all possible responsibilities is necessary to remain ‘calm, collected and available’.",

Later also changed for less social media and quit everything what I felt bad about.  \nI almost cry now when I writing this - because was hard for years, and I'm taking my time everywhere to write what kind of miracle I have experienced.  \n  The 2nd option is to take at least 1-2 weeks of pure laziness somewhere (totally free from work relations, digital world and anything that makes you thinking about) - first 3-5 days you will nervous and shaking your legs under table - but longer you there - just laying on the sun till you stop thinking - it must be like a back to the womb and human nature.  \n  3rd I would recommend some drugs (but not from pharma) -  but it also depends a lot from a person - sometimes one time in year a Ayahuasca retreat is a savior. Generally you need find something that you completely jump out from work related stuff - but I mean like hard reset - not just go to the gym.  \nGood luck, and IT IS POSSIBLE to heal",

(onboarding issue)\n\nI learned this the hard way: our \"overall 80% retention\" looked healthy, but cohort analysis showed April signups retained at 65% while June was at 88%. Turned out we'd fixed a critical onboarding bug in May, but the blended average completely masked the improvement.\n\nYour bounce rate example is the same principle ... aggregates lie, segmentation reveals truth.

Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

          "text": "This is one hundred percent spot on the truth.\n\nI always remind myself that those giant Redwood trees in California have to suffer through decades of forest fires for their bark to grow thick enough to be able to grow so tall.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties, I wanted to be a business owner for fuck you money. When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

If you want a slightly “faster” path to success, don’t go straight to building a business, build sales. Find your customer FIRST, with a sign up sheet and product mock ups. With cold calls or emails. With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business. You should always be testing new business ideas by first trying to find a customer. And then building upon that. Thats how many greats who started on a shoestring budget, without investors, did it.

Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

This is a pretty common positive side for almost everyone. But no has really talked about the negative and dark side of the journey. Let me start with mine. I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Living in that middle ground is uncomfortable.

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack. Many hours worked does not necessarily equate to many dollars earned. Life is so short, and work is far from the most important thing we can do with the little time that we have.",

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

For example: salt is cheap. Salt collected by hand from the salt pans of a small European island by Mr. XYZ whose family has been living across the street from the sea for generations. Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year. Just two ideas I came up with now.\n\n3. Social good. If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply. But I don't know what I'll need to assemble a bed or fix the doorframe. Create a package. Assembly kit for product X. I'm happy to pay a small premium if you make my life easier.",

I therefore know precisely which companies or organisations are interested in what solutions. \n\nThe other aspect is that once a solution is chosen you can deduce the kind of preferences from it.  Solution thinking is very much about personal preferences because the one who chooses or designs the problem has the most say. I therefore think that there is a huge gap in research regarding decision making.\n\nToo many focus on tools; but process and experience matter.\n\nMy problems aren't solved; so we build our idea. My area of focus is complex social interactions within societal issues.\n\nIt is about what happens where, why,,  when and with whom. Most importantly what outcome is important. But always based on integrity. I put that back in on top as it influences the outcome.\n\nNowhere in the tech world I see this kind of thinking. Because tech is about tools. I prefer to think about relationships and interactions. The doing.  Depending on the fit I am open to collaboration. I am focused on the Dutch market for now. But a good team can tackle more markets.",

So while you're out there experiencing the real world, simultaneously spend time to learn about business, marketing, sales, market economics etc etc so that you're prepared when the moment arises. \n\nGood luck.

Those conversations were eye-opening, they told me what they disliked about the tools they use every day.\n\nIn this case, it was Clay. Even though it’s one of the biggest GTM tools out there, there was still a major pain point: pricing for HTTP API enrichment which is a feature many teams rely on. That feedback made me pivot completely and build a cheaper alternative for teams that don’t have large budgets or don’t need the full product just to use one or two features.\n\nNow I have a few paying clients and I’m focused on marketing it.\n\nThe takeaway for me is that ideas don’t come fully formed.

Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

      "text": "I run a hardware studio here in India handling end-to-end OEM work. I want to be optimistic because I’ve bet my career on this, but we need to be honest about what’s actually happening on the ground.\nIf you believe the headlines, we are a superpower now. Electronics production hit $135B (₹11.3 lakh crore) last year, and we are the 2nd largest mobile manufacturer in the world. On paper, it looks like a revolution.\nBut in my studio, the reality feels different.\nThe issue is that while the \"Production\" numbers are up 6x, the local value add is stuck at like 15-20%. That means for every \"Made in India\" phone, ~85% of the value is still just imported parts that we screw together here.\nI dug into the trade data to see if I was just imagining it, and it’s actually getting worse in some areas:\nOur imports from China almost doubled between 2017 and 2024 (hit ~$129B).\nWe still rely on them for 94% of our Li-ion batteries and 88% of ICs.\nThe bottleneck isn't talent.\nThe issue I face daily is speed vs. compliance. If I’m in Shenzhen, I can get a complex PCB prototyped and assembled in 3 days. Here, I spend that same time just waiting for a specific sensor to clear customs or dealing with BIS certification paperwork.\nI’m trying to solve this for my clients by handling the end-to-end mess for them, but it’s an uphill battle.\nI’m curious to hear from other hardware founders here: What is the actual blocker for you?\nIs it that you literally can't source the components locally, or is it that the BIS/Customs headache just makes it not worth the effort compared to importing white-label stuff?",

When you treat it like a place to learn in public and help people, the right ones eventually ask what you are building. That 1 in 10 comment conversion you mentioned feels very real.\n\nThe DM thing is underrated too. Asking people what they are actually trying to do instead of pitching immediately builds trust fast and saves you from building stuff nobody wants. Early stage feels awkward but avoiding awkward conversations just delays feedback.\n\nCurious how long it took before the first real customer showed up.
